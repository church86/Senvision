Join For Free Discover¬†how to focus on operators¬†for Reactive Programming¬†and how they are essential to react to data in your application. ¬†Brought to you in partnership with¬†Wakanda.¬† Apple knows how to keep its users engaged. After 7 beta releases, they have finally launched the iOS 10.3 for the masses. This doesn‚Äôt end the good news. The real news is that after installing the new OS on their iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, users have noticed their device working faster and more responsive. iOS engineer Renaud Lienhart, in one of his tweet, said, ‚ÄúiOS 10.3 feels ‚Äòsnappier‚Äô because many animations were slightly tweaked & shortened, for the better.‚Äù Well, this isn‚Äôt all. With the launch of this new version, Apple has also bid farewell to its 19-year-old HFS+, which was the based on 32-year-old HFS and replaced it with Apple File System (APFS). Now, this is a big step. The new inclusion not only saves the space but also optimize it for solid state drives (SSDs). There‚Äôs Lots More in the Bucket Every time Apple releases a new update, the users without any delay download the new version. Though there are many misconceptions about iOS, this trust and loyalty are no doubts result of the uncompromised security they give. The users never try to look for the new features that are being released. Keeping this in mind, we have here listed some of the new features that make iOS 10.3 futuristic: 1. Find My AirPods They are easy to lose. Keeping this in mind, Apple introduces new Find my AirPods feature. The feature comes activated in the new OS. So, if you forget where you kept your AirPods last, dropped one/both of them somewhere, or lost. Simply go the Find my iPhone app and you‚Äôll notice the new icon for AirPods. If your AirPods are connected to the device via Bluetooth, the feature will play a high pitched sound that will help you find them. However, if it isn‚Äôt, the map will show you the last location where it was connected to the device. 2. Updated Siri This one is especially for the cricket lovers. Our assistant Siri now understands that Cricket is a famous sport, played in different countries across the globe. The Siri can now tell you the scores for cricket matches and can also pull in scores for the world cup and champions trophy. Apart from this, the AI assistant will also help you in booking Uber trips hours in advance and in paying bills. 3. App Store Gets Better The updated App Store now allows you to rate the apps you are using. The developers can now ask users to write a review without switching to the App Store. This will help them understand the positive and negative aspects of user experience and subsequently can work to better it. The developers will also be allowed to respond to these reviews, making the entire arena more like a forum. 4. Customize App Icons This one is again for the developers. The new feature allows them to change the app icons without updating the app. However, to ensure that the feature isn‚Äôt misused, there are certain limitations to the feature. 5. User Interface This feature is too small to be noticed by many individuals. With this, now when you close your app, you‚Äôll get the rounded corner at the edges. The reason for calling this change good is that the animation goes quite well with the rounded corners of the app icons. Keeping the same trend, Apple has also replaced the dashes with circles which can be noticed while entering the passcode. Apart from these, changes can also be noticed in the form of up/down arrows for switching emails in the mail app. 6. Updated Podcast Widget The control center can now be adorned with a podcast widget, which will allow you to listen to your podcasts quickly and to launch next one in your list with ease. Though this new widget looks very much like the one for music, it doesn‚Äôt show recently played albums. Instead, it features just the cover art of the podcasts you are subscribed to. 7. Changes in Apple ID Profile Changes start with the settings page. As soon as you reach the page, you‚Äôll notice a new section featuring your photo and name. This section is housed with all the important information linked with your device. This includes your Apple ID, iTunes and iCloud information, and the App store settings. The new section allows you to update your payment information, set up family sharing, check iCloud storage, and check the devices that are linked with your Apple ID. 8. Hourly Weather Forecast The Maps app now enables you to have details about the upcoming weather conditions. The only thing you need to do is to use the Touch ID on weather icon to the right of the screen, and there you are with the details of the coming six hours. This new feature will help the users to plan their travel accordingly and avoid unexpected and unfavorable weather conditions. 9. Updates for CarPlay The new feature will allow you to switch apps without going back to the home screen first. Also, the music app gets a new "Up Next" screen featuring the list of songs that are in the queue, and will also let you access the album view from the song screen. 10. Safari and iCloud Improved The Verizon customers here get a treat, as they can now use any iCloud-connected device to answer Wi-Fi calls. Previously this feature was available only for Sprint, T-Mobile, and AT&T customers. However, to enable this, users will have to go to phone tab to the settings page and enable Wi-Fi calling. Apart from this, you can also check your iCloud storage easily through a breakdown by going to iCloud settings. iOS 10.3 no doubt is loaded with some really great features. This is why we said in the beginning that Apple is well acquainted with the ways to attract and engage users at the right time. With this entire list of new features for developers and users, we look ahead to have future updates from the house of Apple.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Chinese officials are cracking down and blocking‚Ä¶ Chinese officials are cracking down and blocking access to Apple's App Store By Kyle Wiggers ‚Äî April 20, 2017 11:13 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital¬†Trends Get today's popular Digital¬†Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you The outcome of China's investigation could determine which apps get through the App Store's approval process. Apple‚Äôs dealings with the Chinese government have been fraught with turmoil, to put it lightly. China has targeted the iPhone maker in state-run media¬†smear campaigns and it has repeatedly blocked access to Apple‚Äôs¬†services and storefronts. Now, it is turning a skeptical eye on the Cupertino, California-based company‚Äôs App Store. On Wednesday, China‚Äôs official Xinhua News Agency reported that authorities will¬†‚Äútighten up checks on software applications available in the Apple Store.‚Äù¬†According to Xinhua, Apple has been approached by the Beijing offices of three Chinese agencies, including the Cyberspace Administration of China, public security officials, and a cultural law enforcement group. The article did not elaborate, but the investigation appears to focus on third-party apps available in China‚Äôs app store ‚Äî specifically those that offer live content forbidden by Chinese law, like pornography. Earlier in April, authorities told three Chinese websites to tighten their oversight of online information, live-streaming services, and online performance. Chalermphon Kumchai / 123RF It is part of a broader crackdown on¬†digital goods and services in the country.¬†In January, China‚Äôs Cyberspace Administration required that all app stores register with the government, and¬†it recently¬†enacted a bill ‚Äî the Cyber Security Law ‚Äî that prevents apps from ‚Äúendanger[ing] national security‚Äù or ‚Äúdisrupt[ing] the social order‚Äù¬†(Apple pulled the law‚Äôs first victim, the¬†New York Times‚Äò¬†app, from the Chinese App Store in 2016). Apple‚Äôs business dealings in the region have frequently run afoul of the country‚Äôs regulatory agencies. In¬†2014, following revelations that the U.S. National Security Agency surveilled Chinese leaders, China Central TV described the iPhone as a ‚Äúnational security concern.‚Äù Earlier in 2017, Chinese government regulators blocked access to Apple‚Äôs iBooks and iMovies within the country ‚Äî reportedly out of concern for ‚Äúsecurity threats.‚Äù That is bad news for Apple, which depends on China for about one-fifth of its revenue. But the company‚Äôs relationship with the government may be on the mend. CEO Tim Cook apologized following Chinese state media‚Äôs allegations of warranty fraud, publishing an open letter in which he promised to implement an ‚Äúimproved level of repair service‚Äù and a ‚Äúclearer and more concise‚Äù policy. A series of meetings in May between Cook and ‚Äúsenior government and Communist Party leaders‚Äù was described as ‚Äúproductive‚Äù by a Reuters source. It is a balancing act for both parties. Apple‚Äôs Chinese manufacturing operations are ‚Äúdirectly or indirectly responsible for tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs,‚Äù according to eWeek. Apple, meanwhile, is eager to turn sales around in a market ripe for growth.
Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Weibo Someone rendered that leaked iPhone 8 design, and it looks even worse than we thought Chris Mills @chrisfmills April 21st, 2017 at 2:02 PM Share Tweet We‚Äôve seen leaks and heard rumors that suggest Apple could put the Touch ID sensor on the back of the iPhone 8. Someone‚Äôs now taken the time to render what that would look like, and somehow, it actually looks worse than I‚Äôd imagined. Don't Miss: These leaked iPhone 8 schematics are a travesty if they‚Äôre real The casing render¬†comes from Weibo, and seems to be based on the schematics that Sonny Dickson leaked earlier this week. We have the same cut-out for the Touch ID sensor on the back, the same dual camera module, and other details from the same set of leaked schematics like screw holes. Putting the fingerprint sensor on the back would be a logical engineering move for Apple. This year‚Äôs design trend has been to have edge-to-edge displays with no bezel, and that includes no bottom bezel. With nowhere to put a physical home button, Apple would either have to shift the Touch ID sensor to the back, or use some technology that lets the screen itself read a fingerprint. Apple has filed numerous patents for an under-screen fingerprint reader, but it‚Äôs unclear if the tech is mature enough to put in a consumer phone this year. With so much hype and stock price riding on the iPhone 8, Apple might be forced to ship the device this year, even if it involves making a huge compromise in design ‚Äî like putting a fingerprint sensor on the back. In case you‚Äôre wondering why a fingerprint sensor on the back is a bad idea, just look at reviews of the new Galaxy S8. Although it‚Äôs a fantastic device in nearly every way, reviewers have universally found that the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor is way too close to the camera lens. You‚Äôre far too likely to hit the lens when you go to unlock, meaning smudged photos and unhappy customers. It‚Äôs still very possible that Apple has another plan up its sleeve. This render is still based on one dubious set of schematics, which could well be a fake, made by messing with the schematics for the current iPhone 7 Plus. It‚Äôs also early enough in the year that Apple is likely still experimenting with a number of different devices, before deciding which design to ultimately go with for manufacturing. Even if it means a few months of pain, it‚Äôs easy to see Apple delaying the iPhone 8 launch until after Christmas to get it right. With so much on the line, I‚Äôd like to think that Apple won‚Äôt be dumb (or courageous!) enough to ship a phone with such an obvious design flaw.

This year's phones show less innovation than in years past. ¬† Samsung's Galaxy S8 goes on sale this week. The early 2017 phone picture is now complete. We now know what the mainstream phone market will look like until Apple reveals its iPhone plans. Here are ten things we've learnt about the state of the phone market: 1. Samsung fans are forgiving, maybe too forgiving You couldn't step on a plane at the end of last year with cabin crew reminding you of problems with the Samsung Note 7. Every safety announcement told passengers it was dangerous. The Note 7's exploding battery was news for weeks. The tech business has rarely seen such damaging publicity. It seems Samsung raced the product out before completing testing. According to Ben Bajarin at techpinions that bad publicity is not enough to stop today's Samsung owners from considering the Galaxy S8. 2. S8 ain't done until Bixby runs Bixby is Samsung's voice-controlled virtual assistant. If it works it will rival Apple‚Äôs Siri, Google‚Äôs Assistant and Amazon‚Äôs Alexa. Samsung says Bixby is different because it strings tasks together. It then manages complex tasks the others can't. Among other things, Bixby can wrap-up and send your most recently taken photo to, say, your partner. It promises to hunt down, then stream a specific video to a Samsung TV set. Soon after announcing the S8 Samsung said Bixby features will not all be available on day one. Unfinished software is not on a par with unfinished and unsafe battery designs. Yet it seems Samsung hasn't learned all the important lessons from the Note 7. If the signature feature of a new phone isn't ready by launch, you might wonder if Samsung still cuts corners. Will anything else emerge, Note 7-like, after the launch? 3. The case of the disappearing bezel Bezel is the name given to the rim around a phone's screen. All phone makers have reduced the size of their bezels in recent models. Huawei and Oppo's 2017 phones have tiny bezels. Samsung has taken this almost to the logical extreme. There is almost no bezel on the Galaxy S8. The front is almost all glass. In practice this means two things. First, you get more screen in a smaller package. The display on the Galaxy S8 is larger than the display on the Apple iPhone 7 Plus. Yet the S8 is roughly the same size as the non-Plus iPhone 7. 4. Much ado about fingerprint scanner placement Put Note 7 fires and Bixby to one side for a moment. What is the main aspect of the Galaxy S8 that every phone reviewer wants to discuss? Is it the camera technology, the processor speed or large 5.8-inch screen? It's none of these. Almost every review mention Samsung's decision to move the fingerprint scanner. A smaller bezel on the phone's front means there's no room for a fingerprint scanner. Samsung moved it to the rear of the phone. Using the S8 fingerprint scanner is now a little more uncomfortable and a touch more awkward. Both points are true. It says a lot about phone innovation that reviewers focus on fingerprint scanner placement. 5. Cameras, cameras, cameras Every phone maker at every launch says their latest model has the best camera on the market. I've been to five launches in the six months or so and have heard five different phone makers make that claim. They can't all be right. For what it's worth, all premium phones have great cameras. They can all take excellent pictures in the right circumstances. Exactly what makes up the right circumstances varies a little from brand to brand. To a degree the camera innovation battle has moved on from hardware to software. At least four of the five big phone brands now offer some form of software-generated bokeh effect. 1 6. Enough with the fashion parades So far this year Samsung, Huawei and Oppo have all had big splashy phone launches with a fashion theme. Each launch included beautiful people from the fashion world. Oppo took this furthest with a Sydney Harbour boat cruise. It featured lurid coloured cocktails, a DJ and fashion models cat posing with phones. A fashion-industry big wig made a speech. She told boat passengers to throw their iPhones overboard and replace it with an Oppo. It's worth pointing out that fashion-themed phone launches are not new. LG held a similar event in Auckland 10 years ago. The message, in case you didn't get it, is that premium smart phones are fashion items. 7. Hardware innovation slows in 2017 phones Related to the fashion metaphor is the fetish with phone colours. There are different shades of black, metallic blues, greens and reds and so on. Again, we've been here before with premium phones. In a sense modern phones have reached the point American cars got to in the 1960s. Then Detroit covered cars in chrome and added tail fins. They did this to create the impression of innovation where, in fact, there was little new. Innovation isn't quite dead in the phone business, but it has slowed to a crawl. The fact that people fuss over the fingerprint scanner tells you that. Almost every hardware improvement in the last year has been incremental, cosmetic or unimportant. Screen resolution passed the point where the human eye could notice a different a few years ago. It's been even longer since a phone processor wasn't fast enough for all everyday tasks. 8. The price isn't right Premium phone price have climbed faster than inflation. This isn't because of currency effects, phone prices are going up everywhere. In part this is because phone makers did not make much profit in the past. Although Apple has always enjoyed a good margin. Even Samsung struggled at times to earn a decent amount from selling hardware. In 2013 the Samsung Galaxy S4 cost NZ$1150 and the 16GB iPhone 5S was $1050. Today the cheapest iPhone 7 is $1430 and the bottom of the range Galaxy S8 is $1300. You can go all the way to $1830 with Apple or $1500 with Samsung. You can argue that you get more phone, or at least more memory and more screen. But that's not the point, it now costs Apple fans over 30 percent more to buy the least expensive iPhone. Samsung customers pay around 20 percent more. Huawei has pushed its prices up even faster. Four years ago it made bargain basement phones, today the P10 is NZ$1000 and the Mate 9 is $1100. Bucking the trend Oppo's $700 R9s has most of the features found in a Samsung phone for almost half the price. There's a huge opportunity for a brand selling good phone hardware at that price. 9. Everyone has a phone Almost every person in the rich world who wants a modern mobile phone now has one. This means phone sales have slowed to a crawl compared with the past decade. It also means phone makers rely on shortening the upgrade cycle to turn over more product. That keeps the money rolling in. There is one big problem with that... 10. There are few compelling reasons to upgrade Today's premium phones are good. When it comes to practical functionality they are not much better than the handsets on offer two years ago. Most of the changes in that time have made little difference to an owner's everyday life. There are always going to be performance obsessed geeks who argue for some esoteric reason they need an even faster processor. But in reality, it's been a long time since phones were slow in everyday use. Likewise, any new hardware feature, is often only of interest to a minority. Few people will hold onto phones for, say, 10 years, as they do with PCs. Apart from anything else, they take a physical beating day-in, day-out and get dropped or otherwise worn out after a few years. Most users who are not on plans have already moved away from annual or bi-annual phone upgrades. In the future more of us are likely to hang-on to devices for even longer. I can't remember if Sony or Oppo mentioned anything about blurred image backgrounds. Apple, Samsung and Huawei all did.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States Analysts See These 5 Top Tech Companies Beating Earnings¬†Estimates By Lee Jackson April 22, 2017 9:20 am EDT Print Email Tweet With earnings starting to really pick up last week, and a market that seems to be teetering somewhat due to high valuations and some messy geopolitical issues, it makes sense now¬†to look for companies that are candidates to beat the current expectations. The only thing better than beating expectations is beating them and adding some positive forward guidance for the second quarter and/or the full year. We screened some recent reports from our Wall Street research database and some recent 24/7 Wall St. posts for companies that top analysts on Wall Street think are candidates to beat expectations. These stocks make good sense for growth portfolios that have some risk tolerance. Here are five¬†top tech companies that may beat earnings expectations. Apple This technology giant has been on a huge run, continues printing all-time highs and is the top large cap pick at RBC.¬†Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, and it is among the leaders in the world in innovation with the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple‚Äôs four software platforms ‚Äî iOS, OS X, watchOS and tvOS ‚Äî provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services, including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. RBC thinks the iPhone 8 opportunities are solid, as the¬†firm, like others, feels the product will have significant upgrades. Toss in the easier comparisons and the strong average selling prices, and the new phone is a distinct positive. While the¬†firm does note higher commodity prices are a potential headwind from NAND and DRAM pricing, it sees service growth and acceleration as another distinct positive. Apple investors receive¬†a 1.6% dividend. The RBC price target for the stock is¬†$157, and the Wall Street consensus target is $147.61. The stock closed trading on Friday at $142.27, and Apple is¬†scheduled to report earnings on May 2. Arris International This stock has been an RBC favorite for some time and is the¬†top small cap pick.¬†Arris International PLC¬†(NASDAQ: ARRS) provides media entertainment and data communications solutions in the United States and internationally. It operates through two segments. The Customer Premises Equipment segment offers various product solutions, including set-top boxes, gateways, digital subscriber lines and cable modems, and embedded multimedia terminal adapters and voice/data modems that enable service providers to offer voice, video and high-speed data services to residential and business subscribers. The Network & Cloud segment provides cable modem termination system, converged cable access platform, multichannel video programming distributors, programmer equipment, ad insertion technologies and equipment in the ground or on transmission poles, as well as equipment used to initiate the distribution of content-carrying signals. The $33 RBC price target is in line with¬†the consensus target of¬†$33.13. Shares closed most recently at $25.51. The earnings report is due on May 3. Lumentum This top company looks to benefit big-time from the Facebook Voyager project. Lumentum Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: LITE) manufactures and sells optical and photonic products in the Americas, the Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It operates in two segments, Optical Communications and Commercial Lasers. The analysts at JPMorgan are very bullish on the company as it is¬†working on several handset original equipment manufacturers for 3D sensing, and the CEO recently said he could see $100 million¬†or more a quarter growing up to a $1 billion opportunity annually (last 12 month revenues were about $1 billion), which many believe could drive upside to current estimates. JPMorgan has set its price target at $54, and the consensus target is¬†$49.35. The stock closed most recently at $45.20. The company is expected to share its results on May 3. Viavi Solutions This smaller capitalization company has solid upside potential. Viavi Solutions Inc. (NASDAQ: VIAV) is a global provider of network test, monitoring and assurance solutions to communications service providers, enterprises and their ecosystems, supported by a worldwide channel community, including Viavi Velocity Solution Partners. The company delivers end-to-end visibility across physical, virtual and hybrid networks, enabling customers to optimize connectivity, quality of experience and profitability. Viavi is also a leader in high-performance thin film optical coatings, providing light management solutions to anti-counterfeiting, consumer electronics, automotive, defense and instrumentation markets. The JPMorgan analysts noted this in a recent report: We continue to see material upside to Viavi‚Äôs earnings from 3D sensing in the new iPhone as well as ongoing restructuring. We also believe accretive consolidation¬†deals are a possibility. The $13 JPMorgan price target compares with the posted¬†consensus target of¬†$10.56. The stock closed Friday at $9.90 per share. The company is scheduled to report its fiscal third-quarter results on May 3. Western Digital This long-time innovator in the storage industry is a leader in the total addressable hard disk drive (HDD) market,¬†and it posted a very positive earnings pre-announcement earlier this week.¬†Western Digital Corp. (NASDAQ: WDC) is an industry-leading developer and manufacturer of storage solutions that help to create, manage, experience and preserve digital content. Western Digital is responding to changing market needs by providing a full portfolio of compelling, high-quality storage products with effective technology deployment, high efficiency, flexibility and speed. Its products are marketed under the HGST and WD brands to original equipment manufacturers, distributors, resellers, cloud infrastructure providers and consumers. The most compelling news for 2017 and beyond is that the company made a stunning $19 billion purchase of SanDisk last year. This could be a strong addition to Western Digital‚Äôs current offerings, and the company could significantly benefit from SanDisk‚Äôs technology and portfolio leadership in the NAND flash semiconductor and enterprise flash systems market. Shareholders are paid a solid 2.4% dividend. RBC has a $96 price target, and the consensus price objective is $93.37. Shares closed Friday at $83.11. The company is scheduled to report on Thursday.

Shop: Surface Studio | New Surface Book | Xbox One S Bundles | NEW Dell XPS 13" Back to school Microsoft's new push into education is the right move ‚Äî at the right time By Daniel Rubino Friday, Apr 21, 2017 at 9:02 am EDT 182 Comments Daniel Rubino is executive editor of Windows Central. He has been covering Microsoft since 2009 back when this site was called WMExperts (and later Windows Phone Central). His interests include Windows, Surface, HoloLens, Xbox, and future computing visions. Follow him on Twitter: @daniel_rubino. A new low-cost Surface device and Windows 10 Cloud OS combo could do some serious damage to Google's Chromebook ambitions in U.S. schools. On May 2, all eyes will be on Microsoft at its New York City event. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is expected to take the stage and unveil a new push into the education market, likely focused on the U.S. initially. Google has been making big inroads into the K-12 education sector with its low-cost and easy-to-manage Chromebooks. According to IDC's latest numbers,, Chromebooks represented 49 percent of that market last year, up from 40 percent in 2015 and just 9 percent in 2013. Another research firm, Futuresource, puts the number even higher at 58 percent, up from 50 percent in 2015. Apple, which has taken the brunt of the damage from the Chromebook wave in education in the U.S, meanwhile lost significant momentum in recent years. Apple's iOS, featured on the waning iPad series, went from a peak of 26 percent of the market in 2014 to just 14 percent last year, according to Futuresource. Microsoft's Windows, by comparison, did better, dropping from 25 percent to 22 percent in that same time period. For non-U.S. markets, the tale is very different. There, 65 percent of the education market is Windows, with Chrome OS at just six percent and Android at 17 percent. Apple held steady at just nine percent of the global education K-12 markets. The timing is right for Windows 10 Cloud Google is on to something with its Chromebook line, at least in the U.S. Combined with hardware support from major manufacturers, a mature app ecosystem, and ease of IT management, Chromebooks are the preferred choice for school IT departments. In speaking with some local school IT administrators ‚Äì both public and private ‚Äì here in Marlborough, Mass., it is the ability to lock down and secure Chromebooks, followed by cost, that is driving Chromebook adoption. 7 things you need to know about Windows 10 Cloud Microsoft is poised, however, to get back into education. Windows RT was a disaster for the company on many levels, including its confusing name, poor marketing, software limitations, and pricing. The Windows 10 Cloud OS, which may go by the name "Windows 10 S" when unveiled on May 2, is a different scenario. This time, Microsoft has a story to tell and a strategy to market this version of Windows to the right audience. Key differences between Windows RT and Windows 10 Cloud OSes include: A more mature Store for Windows Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps. The ability for the OS to be upgraded to a Home or Pro license. Capacity to run Win32 apps via "Project Centennial" bridge apps via the Store. A hardware team that's more in tune with commercial and consumer needs and desires. Combined with advancements in hardware and improvements to the OS, Microsoft has clear goals it wants to achieve with Windows 10 Cloud. In an internal document obtained by Windows Central (above), we can see exactly how Microsoft views Windows 10 Cloud as competing against Chromebooks in performance benchmarks. Additionally, recommended minimum specifications for a Windows 10 "CloudBook" are listed for hardware manufacturers: Quad-core (Celeron or better) processor. 4GB of RAM. 32GB of storage (64GB for 64-bit). A battery larger than 40 WHr. Fast eMMC or solid state drive (SSD) for storage technology. Pen and touch (optional). Microsoft is focusing heavily on all-day battery life, as evidenced by its new "Power Throttling" initiative that's being tested in recent Windows Insider Program previews for the "Redstone 3" release expected this fall. Windows 10 on ARM will go further Windows 10 on ARM is another big step for Microsoft that is expected to come to fruition this fall, as well. With the ability to run what was an x86/64 OS on mobile ARM processors, the company can further drive down hardware costs, improve battery efficiency, and make thinner and lighter devices. Intel is making significant strides in reducing battery consumption, and Microsoft's Power Throttling goes further. According to the company, its Power Throttling support will be extended to other processor types (currently it is limited to 6th and 7th Generation Intel processors), which likely includes ARM. The Achilles heel of Windows laptops has always been two-fold: poor battery life, and risk management due to viruses and installing .exe software. Both of those problems are now being ameliorated through Windows 10 Cloud. Windows 10 on ARM devices are expected at the end of 2017 in the fourth quarter. Today's Surface Book is too expensive The current problem for Microsoft and its Surface line is the price. At Microsoft's Surface Studio event in October 2016, Microsoft's Corporate Vice President of Devices Panos Panay used a photo of his son to demonstrate how children naturally adopt digital inking on a PC. In the picture, presented as a backdrop, the child is using a Surface Book. That device starts at $1,600 and increases to more than $3,000 for the high-end version. Kids love inking and the Surface Book, but how do you get it into schools? While in a perfect world all kids would be able to afford a Microsoft Surface Book, the chances of that happening are minuscule. Clearly, Microsoft needs a lower-cost, entry-level device that provides a similar experience with an emphasis on a touchscreen and digital pen. A new "Surface Laptop" running Windows 10 Cloud is the ideal solution, if it meets the minimum hardware specifications mentioned earlier. It also could also replace the now deprecated non-pro Surface 3. Microsoft is expected to announce such a device on May 2, though some of our sources say the new hardware may not come until Microsoft's Build conference the following week. A traditional laptop without a detachable keyboard would keep production costs down (fewer product SKUs), and it would work for schools, where losing a keyboard (or breaking it) could cause headaches for IT staff. As a solution to making the laptop more Surface-like, the keyboard could rotate around like Lenovo's Yoga series or HP's x360 line. I also suspect a Surface Pen will be a part of any Surface Laptop, because the recent Creators Update focuses on inking. The new EPUB support in Windows 10 makes sense when you think of a push into education for Microsoft. Likewise, the seemingly odd addition of EPUB support for the Edge web browser and corresponding digital book section in the Windows Store makes more sense once you bring education into the equation. However, one issue Microsoft could face in schools is app selection. While UWP is evolving and improving the selection of quality apps specifically related to education, it cannot possibly match the Google Play Store. That could change over time, and perhaps Microsoft has some strategies in place to help lure companies to create apps specifically for this genre. Windows 10 Cloud and Surface for schools makes sense Recently, a nephew of mine who is nine years old saw my Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon. He said, "That looks like my Chromebook." I jokingly corrected him by stating "No, your Chromebook looks like my PC laptop." The point should be obvious: The education market is critical to Microsoft's future based purely on familiarity. The debate between macOS and Windows preference, for instance, almost always comes down to what you were exposed to first. Rarely in today's world do adults try both OSes, evaluate them equally and come to rational decisions. Chromebook or PC? The answer may be age dependent. If Google is already at 50 percent adoption in the U.S. education market, that is a generation that's now in the Google and Android ecosystem. Microsoft needs a plan to take that on and, for once, I feel like it may have some significant advantages with Windows 10 Cloud and a new Surface. The recent announcement that it will align the servicing models for Windows 10, Office 365 ProPlus, and System Center Configuration Manager also likely plays a part in this plan. Windows 10 Redstone 3: Everything we know so far Microsoft's hardware partners are likely to pick up the slack and deliver even lower cost hardware to run Windows 10 Cloud in the coming months in preparation for fall 2017. All of that combined with Apple's declining popularity in schools is a perfect opportunity for Redmond. As such, Microsoft's May 2 event could be the start of a significant push for the company ‚Äî one that will have a lasting effect on a new generation.

It is terrible. When they try to do something productive, such as write a r√©sum√©, I always tell them to get on word. They are forced to use google docs and it is so limited compared to word. They even have older versions of word on older computers, and those are more powerful than google docs. Another thing I don't understand is why do the teachers use Windows 10 and the students use chrome books ü§î. They clearly know Windows is more productive and they decide to give students google services. 4 1 day ago Reply Hirox K it's frreeeeeee... (whisper) 0 1 day ago Reply VOMoreira No. I know for a fact they pay for the services. Students get emails and drive storage just like Microsoft does with exchange and OneDrive. It's the exact same service, but worse. If anything, it's probably cheaper because it is worse. 3 1 day ago Reply 19Michael87 There is probably a huge Linux fanboy running the IT department at your school that finally has the ultimate tool (Chrome OS) for him to use in his holy crusade against Microsofts evil dominance ;-) 0 1 day ago Reply VOMoreira Lol. I tried. They say its better for the students and I just don't see how its better. 0 1 day ago Reply bleached It is good for the students and definitely easier for the staff. Chromebooks require almost no support. They basically just need WiFi and an account created for each student. Windows historically isn't anywhere near as easy to manage and requires dedicated IT support. When students log into a Chromebook it automatically has all their settings and files available, no matter what machine they are on. It is really simple and each user has their own separate experience. Windows is getting better here, but it still takes some time when you first log in and Microsoft's services (especially Edge) just aren't really designed for this style of cloud computing. I think this is where Microsoft really needs to improve. Logging in with your Microsoft ID should quickly give you the same experience on any device without having any setup required to use their services. Chromebooks accel here. There are certainly tasks that are tougher to complete on a Chromebook. Computer programming, video editing, CAD, etc. just aren't great experiences.

It is so much easier to handwrite notes and the ability to add diagrams and drawings is phenominal! A Windows 2-1 device and OneNote will draw circles around a Chromebook any day. Chromebook is last century in comparison. Teachers can share their lecture notes with students. Students can share notes with oneanother - all without ever needing to use a keyboard! Every subject benefits from easy pen input. Science, Math, History, Art. Everywhere you have more than just words a pen is a great idea. Try drawing a diagram for physics with a keyboard. Or doing math problems. Or Art. You will quickly understand what I mean. Modern versions of Windows on 2-in-1 devices are exactly what students need in the classroom. They provide almost every conceivable manner of input that a student might need and they do it well. The only thing Chromebooks had going for it was cost, setup and a strong ABM (anything but Microsoft) attitude. Modern Windows 2-in-1 devices can do both and so much more. Schools were burned by iPads, and when they see how much more they can do with Windows 2-in-1 devices than Chromebooks it will be like the iPad all over again. 3 22 hours ago Reply ozaz I didn't ask what the idea behind¬†it is.

But the numbers, to me, show that Microsoft's strategy of "US only" or "US first" is as wrong as it gets. Yes, the growth of ChromeOS in the USA may be worrisome to Redmond BUT the USA is just ONE country in 196. In 195 countries, Chromebooks are absolutely irrelevant. Now you may say "well, that's why they should focus on the US". But that's, to me, the wrong strategy. They hold a large margin worldwide but if they continue to treat the US as special and focusing all their offerings and services only on the US, all that Google or any other competitor needs to do is to open those same types of services to people in the other 195 countries. We can take a couple of examples from history: - Microsoft has always treated Europe as a second-rate (or third, or fourth) market for the Xbox (and most other things, really). As a result, Sony's PlayStation rules in Europe with over 70% marketshare (in some countries over 90%). They've sold over 22 million consoles in Europe. Xbox? Less than 8 million. - Nokia's Eflop years saw the company leave their European/Asian focus and move it to the US. Because "Europe was guaranteed". As a result, sales in Europe continuously declined without the US market growth making up for it. - Sony's Xperia phones, at the same time, saw great growth in the European market because Sony made an effort instead of bothering with focusing in just one country (the US). When Sony decided to change that - around the time of the Xperia Z4 - and start trying to focus in the US market alone, sales of Xperia devices started to come down. ¬† So whilst it's important that Microsoft shows aggressiveness in the US market to combat the Chromebook infestation that has installed itself on Uncle Sam's lands, it will be a major flaw if they limit the efforts to the USA. In Europe and other Western or Westernised markets, if Microsoft doesn't make an effort to show some parity of treatment with the US, they risk Google or someone else to come along and show that parity. And then they'll not only risk not gaining back anything in the US, they'll be losing market in those other countries. It's also worth noting that the educational system in Europe and Western markets is far better than the American and more likely to adopt new technologies to tackle on new educational challenges. Microsoft simply can't let that pass and not take the chance. 13 1 day ago Reply Azizelh Simple... The focus on the US is not because of the US. It's because schools here offer items to their students and are ready to pay some money for that. None of the schools I personally know in France for example offer them to students. They have some in dedicated rooms and the libraries, but none in class. Pretty sure it's the same or close in other countries. Reason is schools and tuitions are too cheap in most European countries to allow for these expenses. Most of the time of course. Im sure some school can offer them, just MUCH less than US. 3 1 day ago Reply Hoekie Over here we do. So that can't be the reason. Also deals for pure personal use. It's the US being cheap.

From the graphs above, there's not enough information to know.

Most of the large software distributors want their own store, their own control, and 100% of the revenue.¬† (for obivous reasons) 0 1 day ago Reply Daniel Rubino "And why would they want a competitor store, as of right now they keep 100% of revenue? " Simple, it's a tradeoff. You promise/deliver more access and exposure via Store and new devices, which offsets the cost incurred from Microsoft. That's literally how ALL app stores work in the world. Sell 5,000 licenses for $1 or sell 10,000 licenses for $0.70. It's simple math based on size of reachable audience. 1 1 day ago Reply MakoDaniels That really doesn't answer the question. ¬† I help build a massive weapon which then my enemy can use against me... MS is their competitor not their friend. ¬† You give up control, you give your competitor more weapons to do harm and you give up revenue.... adobe is probably losing close to zero money not being on the MS's store. ¬† I don't think you'll will see Valve products either... its really a no brainer. ¬† The big developers have zero reason for the MS store to be successful especially if they have their own store.¬† Smaller developers, sure, they don't have their own store, don't have the means so another distribution path could be a benefit... big developers have a negative incentive. ¬† There is actually a less incentive then it was to distribute via GFWL as at least with that... we were dealing with open and Win32. ¬† MS is a competitor to Adobe, Autodesk, Valve, Epic, etc. not a friend, although their might be partnerships from time to time. ¬† Which is why many of them have spoken harshly about UWP and the Store. -1 1 day ago Reply MakoDaniels Daniel, another comment. ¬† The reason why this site keeps getting excited then disappointed by MS product sales and adoption, and ultimate leads to the dropping of the tech/product is.... most of this is the opposite of what these articles saying. ¬† What I mean is you are geared towards your own consumer incentives... but when it comes to Windows, consumers have either dropped it or ignore it. Let me give you an example, you think this Cloud OS is a good idea, but basically its RT2.0.... fair enough, that is what you think. ¬† But in the real world, in my experience at the enterprise level.... businesses have or want to strip not the Win32 stuff out but the UWP/Store from Windows 10. ¬† So, I work with a medium size company that wants to deploy Win10 from Win7 which is virtualized and users use citrix. ¬† Now do you want to know what those builds look like now in testing.... everything you write about in these articles are being stripped out... whether its the Store app, OneDrive, UWP, tablet mode, etc. ¬† Windows without Win32 and open is kind of like Kate Upton without the rack, what's the point? ¬† Windows with UWP might as well be a Chromebook, either way I doubt the consumer is going to come back in mass. What MS is doing is throwing a bunch a mud at the wall hoping the consumer is coming back, the problem is.... reality is much different. ¬†¬† 0 1 day ago Reply MrElectrifyer There's 1 MAJOR advantage Chromebooks have in the Educational market that Windows 10 currently has nothing to match; NEVER need to reboot to update the OS. Chromebooks merely being the Chrome web browser on Windows means that to install security patches/updates, all that has to happen is the user closes the browser and the security updates are installed automatically without requiring ANY reboot. That is automatically and seamlessly done whenever a user logs out the system, and if a security patch didn't get the time to install prior to the chromebook going to sleep, that's easily and quickly done on next resume from sleep. So, literally 0 need for reboot to stay secure, literally 0 need for IT department keeping tabs on them for security reasons. Compare that to Windows 10 where when you wake it up from sleep, you'll be getting that stupid "Updating Windows, don't turn off your computer" message for several minutes, especailly when they've not been updated in a while due to them not being used in a classroom. Imagine getting that when you're about to write an online Exam (which is the only place where Chromebooks were used on my Campus, everything else is Windows). Unless an IT department is being paid to keep those Windows 10 Cloud Laptops up to date, or those Laptops never turn off (in which case they can do the restart when the user logs off and thinks they've put the Laptop to sleep), Windows 10 Cloud won't be able to remain secure, making them a security threat to the Campus. 0 1 day ago Reply Daniel Rubino Microsoft's policy is to not require a reboot for an update more than once every 4 weeks. I really don't see that as a big deal these days. Additionally, the Unified Update Platform (UUP) goes a long way to helping with this as well. 1 1 day ago Reply MrElectrifyer It's not much of a concern as a consumer, 'cause I'm only dealing with 1 PC (a Surface Pro 2 in my case), and I can easily take a moment to configure Windows Updates to match my workflow for the rest of my use of the Windows PC. No problem with that. In the case of a school campus, where there's 1000s of them - all of which don't get used for months until an Exam is coming up - it becomes a big concern in terms of both time and security. You'll need to pay an IT department to mange each and every one of those Windows Laptops/Convertibles, 'cause unlike Windows Desktops, they're not connected to a LAN 24/7, and thus can't be updated remotely. If you don't pay an IT department to do that, you risk having significant delays or interuptions when the Laptops are needed; during an online Exam. That's the major advantage Chromebooks have; savings in both IT department costs and time. With Chromebooks, any Teacher (regadless of background) could just grab a Laptop cart (contains about 50 Chomebooks I think) from some IT room (where the cart was plugged in charging the Laptops) at anytime of the year, bring it to the classroom, students simply unplug 1 of them and take to their desk, log-in, and can begin the exam (no waiting for any updates). Once they're done, they sign out, take the Laptop back to the cart and just plug in its power cable. To get the same with most of todays Windows Laptops, you'll need to be fussing with both power and ethernet cables for each and every one of those Laptops in some specialized cart, so that when in the IT room, they can be connected to the LAN and kept up to date remotely when not in use for months. That adds more room for human error, unless the campus pays some premium to get a custom Windows Laptop and Laptop cart that can get both power and ethernet over 1 connection. On top of that, would still need to pay an IT department to be keeping tabs on them remotely. None of which is a concern with Chromebooks.

Because again the US is not representative. Hopefully tech journalist will realise this sooner than later. -2 1 day ago Reply Daniel Rubino I specifically mention and discuss non-US market share for Chromebooks, Windows, and Apple. "For non-U.S. markets, the tale is very different. There, 65 percent of the education market is Windows, with Chrome OS at just six percent and Android at 17 percent. Apple held steady at just nine percent of the global education K-12 markets." And I live in the US, with access to public and private school IT heads who I spoke to about this topic. Why should I not write on the US where I live, our site is based, and where this product will likely have the most push? 3 1 day ago Reply Hoekie Only the start should be different.

Who knows how close MS is to achieving¬†those targets?¬†Incidentally, my 2-years-old Chromebook Flip cold boots in 7 seconds. So Chromebook numbers are a little skewed to lower the bar for MS.

Why would it cost more? It's using the same chipsets, the same type of hardware, and likely a free license.¬† Personally I wouldn't say that's better app quality, when the app pool (android apps) isn't even designed for the FF, and they are more geared to social networking and bus stop games than education. Chrome apps themselves number a paltry 10,000. Admitedly for the education sector, windows might have a small catch up, but its not exactly huge, nor are education apps demanding functionality. For the most part people use web browsers, and word processors.¬† The whole point of difference for Windows could is - its touch enabled, its ink and stylus enabled and its fully upgradable to full windows. Which makes chromebook seem kind of sad by comparison IMO, as an educational tool.¬† 0 22 hours ago Reply Aden Rossinni Yes, but they don't do much so ... 0 1 day ago Reply vEEP pEEP Get'em while they are young...

They are just gimmicks, and have already been swapped for Surface Pros in some places, so what MS is doing is perfect in this situation. 3 1 day ago Reply yac man please quote your sources ( otherwise untrue / did not happen / fake news ). ¬† 0 1 day ago Reply Drael646464 sd 0 22 hours ago Reply Drael646464 As importantly, the tablet market where windows on arm is targeted, is a sector where only windows and budget are growing amonst consumers. By making a budget hybrid, perhaps something like the transformer book, windows can be positioned in BOTH of the growth sectors of tablets, when both samsung and apple have been slipping for four years. a serious foothold in tablets will drive UWP development, as will any substantial sales of a cloudbook. Re-positioning Windows to re-enter the fray for pocket cellular devices.¬† So this year, I expect not simple a surface pro, but a budget model. I'm hoping with a transformer book design, so it can be also more laptop like. And without the ridiculous screen sizes - perhaps a happy 10.1 inches, or even apple like 9.7. I expect this is why the rumours on surface suggest both arm, and intel - it'll be both.¬† Basically its the whole budget thing that is MS's entire pathway back to market dominance, in particular larger touchscreen devices. And that's also the point of difference for a cloud book - its touch enabled, its stylus enabled (as you say, a rotatable design would suit education best). If windows can make gains on bigger screen touch devices, that breathes life into UWP. And you can see the push for UWP in all of MS's recent moves - the option to lock windows down to store only, the cloud device, and the cheaper arm devices. THIS is how they are tackling the app gap - by fighting in an area where they have strenth - bigger screens. ¬† 0 22 hours ago Reply r4incs So MS is playing catch-up once again? It turned out really well last time (looks at Windows Phone/Mobile). 0 21 hours ago Reply bleached This article doesn't mention exactly where schools are saving money with Chromebooks. I don't think it is cost of the hardware. It is likely cost of supporting and managing Windows machines. There are plenty of low cost Windows machine as available today, but they are not easy for a school with limited resources to deploy. Microsoft needs to further simplify Windows and match the services available on Chromebooks.

The most recent entrant however isn't particularly original, though it does suggest Apple is considering its options in the augmented reality space. The patent, which can be found in scanned form on the US Patent and Trademark Office, outlines a "method and device for illustrating a virtual object in a real environment". Yes, that's a somewhat vague description, though it's made up for by an overly elaborate summary: The invention relates to a method for representing a virtual object in a real environment, having the following steps: generating a two-dimensional image of a real environment by means of a recording device, ascertaining a position of the recording device relative to at least one component of the real environment, segmenting at least one area of the real environment unmarked in reality in the two-dimensional image for identifying at least one segment of the real environment in distinction to a remaining part of the real environment while supplying corresponding segmentation data, and merging the virtual object with the two-dimensional image of the real environment with consideration of segmentation data such that at least one part of the segment of the real environment is removed from the image of the real environment. To put it simply, the patent describes using augmented reality to replace or add objects to a real scene. The lead image of this story, taken from the patent documents, makes it pretty clear how this would work in practise. There's also this adorable sketch: Image: Apple / USPTO The patent is light on specific implementation plans and is broad enough to cover a large swathe of uses for augmented reality, so it's impossible to know how Apple might utilise the patent. That said, you could read a lot into the patent's focus on furniture ‚Äî some sort of interactive interior decoration app, perhaps?

Apple was granted a permit to test self-driving cars on April 14 by the California Department of Motor Vehicles but the company has never said anything about its plan. The state released 41 pages of Apple application documents to Reuters that give some clues about the company's highly secret self-driving effort, which it has never openly acknowledged. The iPhone maker joins a long list of carmakers, start-ups and technology rivals, including Alphabet's Waymo, that are testing cars on state roads. Apple is looking for new hit products and autonomous car technology is expected to revolutionize the traditional auto industry. As part of the application, Apple included a 10-page training plan that appeared to be related to operators taking back manual control of the car during automated driving exercises of the system, which it calls a development platform. Apple declined comment beyond the filing. The plan includes a document called "Automated System: Development Platform Specific Training Overview" whose objective is "to train safety drivers in various automated driving conditions." "Development platform will be controlled electronically (e.g. joystick) and safety drivers must be ready to intervene and take control," the document reads. The document highlights different scenarios to be tested, from high speed driving and tight U-turns to lane changes. One letter sent from Apple to the state Department of Motor Vehicles noted that Apple's development platform "will have the ability to capture and store relevant data before a collision occurs." The document does not include detail on how Apple's self-driving platform actually works or other technical details. It also does not say what kind of sensors are found on Apple's three permitted vehicles, all 2015 Lexus model RX450h. The permit does not necessarily mean that Apple itself is building a full car. Apple could instead be designing a self-driving platform that can be integrated into other manufacturer's cars.

The highly anticipated completely wireless earbuds were announced alongside the iPhone 7 to make up for the lack of a headphone jack. Now that AirPods have been on the market for four months, are you using them? Take Our Poll Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case One thing worth noting right off the bat is that it‚Äôs still incredibly difficult to get ahold of Apple‚Äôs AirPods. They‚Äôre backordered six weeks from Apple‚Äôs online store and retail availability is scattered at best. AirPods were originally slated to be made available in October but ended up being delayed until September over what is believed to have been manufacturing issues and it‚Äôs possible that Apple still faces those same manufacturing difficulties. Nevertheless, seeing that they‚Äôve been available for four months, anyone who really wanted them has likely been able to track a pair down. Scattered availability, however, has been one of the top complaints of users and rightfully so. It seems weird and out of character for Apple that, despite announcing them over 6 months ago, the company still struggles¬†to keep up with demand. A six-week backorder window likely has not had a positive impact on sales, either. While Apple hasn‚Äôt released official sales numbers for AirPods, Tim Cook stated back in December that they are a ‚Äúrunaway success.‚Äù Cook also addressed the scarce availability and said that Apple is making units as fast as it can, but again, things haven‚Äôt approved in that area as of yet. Personally, I‚Äôm a huge fan of Apple‚Äôs AirPods. I‚Äôve tried all of Apple‚Äôs W1 headphone options and walked away most impressed with the AirPods because of the truly wireless design, the carrying case, and their ear fit. AirPods offer the best combination of design, value, and performance in my opinion. What are your thoughts on AirPods now that we‚Äôre four months in? How often do you use them, or have you not been able to get your hands on a pair? Let us know in the poll above and in the comments below.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Apple Watch Series 3 May Potentially Incorporate A micro-LED Display By Ali Salman Apr 22, 2017 9Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple has a secret research and development facility in Taiwan which has been researching micro-LED display technology for as long as since 2015. Now, a new report from Business Korean cites that an advanced micro-LED could possibly be incorporated in the Apple Watch Series 3. If it does debut on the next Apple Watch, it will be replacing the flexible OLED panel. There are certain advantages associated with adopting micro-LED displays compared to OLED and LCD screens. So let‚Äôs dive in to see some more details on the implementation of micro-LED displays on the Apple Watch. Apple Watch Series 3 To Rock A micro-LED Display Instead Of OLED? According to the report, the iPhone-maker along with its suppliers will start producing micro-LED panels for the next Apple Watch in Taiwan by the end of the year. micro-LED panels are thinner, lighter and consume less power compared to OLED and LED. This will benefit the wearable in terms of both the quality of display as well as making it lighter. Related Apple and Nike Announce the New Apple Watch NikeLab ‚Äì Space Gray Color Enthusiasts Will Love This We also came across Apple‚Äôs acquisition of LuxVue back in 2014, which was working on micro-LED display technology. Moreover, it is said that LuxVue has found out a way by which the micro-LED displays will consume less power in consumer electronics. Currently, all Apple Watch models feature an OLED panel manufactured by LG Display. Advertisement The upcoming iPhone is expected to feature an OLED or AMOLED panel, which initially will be exclusively supplied by Samsung Display. Moreover, by 2018 the panels will be supplied by Sharp, Japan Display and LG Display. In addition to this, the aforesaid suppliers have already invested and are geared up to support Apple‚Äôs demand needs for OLED panels. However, there is a possible scenario in which the iPhone‚Äôs adoption of OLED panels is implemented for a short span of time. After 2018, there are a whole lot of possible directions that Apple can move towards. Apple could also potentially make a shift to micro-LED screens in 2019 or 2020. Nonetheless, final statements at this point wouldn‚Äôt be the right way to go. Related Spotify Is Partnering With A Third-Party Developer To Bring The Official Apple Watch App If Apple decides to go with micro-LEDs instead of OLED, both LG and Samsung‚Äôs business would take an impact. Generally, both suppliers would have to forgo around $1 billion annually. Nonetheless, as we have mentioned earlier, it‚Äôs too early to jump to any conclusions. There will be more to the story, so be sure to stay tuned in for that. This is it for now, folks.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Influx of crime leaves private school in danger of losing business license Saturday Apr¬†22,¬†2017¬†at¬†7:34¬†PM Apr¬†22,¬†2017¬†at¬†7:43¬†PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY ‚Äî A riot, gang activity and sex crimes represent a sample of incidents at a private school now in danger of losing its business license, which would displace 78 students and some 30 employees. Between Dec. 28, 2015, and March 11, 2017, San Bernardino County Sheriff‚Äôs Department deputies in Apple Valley responded to 132 calls for service at Bright Futures Academy, according to Capt. Frank Bell. Bell said he presented a report on the calls to town officials during closed session of a recent Town Council meeting, and requested the academy‚Äôs license be revoked when it comes up for renewal. The town instead announced its intent to revoke the license posthaste, Bell said. Bright Futures, which serves many students with intellectual and emotional disabilities, has appealed the decision. The service calls ‚Äúranged from audible alarms, (Absent Without Leave/Runaway Juvenile), gang activity, medical aids, riots, simple assaults, assaults with significant injuries, sexual batteries, thefts and unlawful sex with minors,‚Äù according to a memo attached to the report. Deputies also responded to reports of burglary, vandalism and students threatening to jump from rooftops, Bell told the Daily Press. ‚ÄúThe problem isn't so much the kids,‚Äù Bell said. ‚ÄúWe understand these are kids that need a unique learning setting. We‚Äôre all for that. But there are other schools that serve these type of kids without any issues. The problem seems to be the staff can‚Äôt control the kids. ‚ÄúSo they call us ‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here, but we don‚Äôt see that type of volume anywhere else. It‚Äôs a drain on our resources.‚Äù Twenty-two criminal reports were filed and eight arrests were made during the nearly 15-month span, according to Bell. On April 14, during a meeting with Bell and Deputy Chief Lana Tomlin, Bright Futures officials received the report and a letter from Town Manager Frank Robinson detailing reasons for the revocation, including failure to provide a safe school environment. Bright Futures Chief Operating Officer Pamela Lamberth called the report misleading, however. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying there aren‚Äôt issues,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbut the copy (of the report) we got doesn‚Äôt tell much of anything. Follow-up calls are added as individual calls and it also counts 39 false alarms. It looks like there‚Äôs more calls. The report is a bit inflated.‚Äù Bell disagreed: ‚ÄúIf the problem was false alarms, we wouldn‚Äôt have had that meeting (with Bright Futures officials). That‚Äôs not the purpose for the license being revoked. It‚Äôs the criminal activity and the lack of control.‚Äù Citing the academy‚Äôs use of local vendors for school supplies, repairs and short-term housing for teachers, Lamberth and President Betti Colucci urged the town to keep the business license active and proposed a plan to ‚Äúreduce calls to the Town‚Äôs police department‚Äù in an appeal letter. Hiring a full-time deputy for the campus (which would cost about $204,000 annually, according to Bell), as well as an after-hours security guard, and attending meetings with the Council and Sheriff‚Äôs Department were included in the plan. In addition to forcing the academy out of Apple Valley, the revocation would short St. Timothy‚Äôs Episcopal Church ‚Äî which leases the facility to Bright Futures ‚Äî $1.8 million, according to Lamberth. ‚ÄúThis is going to close that church down,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really bothersome to me.‚Äù St. Timothy‚Äôs Clerk of the Vestry Jeanne Bryson told the Daily Press a contract with the academy provides 60 percent of the church‚Äôs operating budget, but she stopped short of agreeing the church would close as a result of Bright Futures losing its business license. ‚ÄúThe church would have to find another tenant for sure,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúExactly how long that would take is hard to say, but it would cause some hardship because that source of income would be gone until we found another tenant.‚Äù Bright Futures contracts with Apple Valley Unified School District, among others, to provide year-round care, special education and behavioral services to students ‚Äúwith exceptional needs that can‚Äôt be met in a public school setting,‚Äù according to the appeal letter. The academy has operated in the High Desert for 25 years, first in Victorville before relocating to Apple Valley in December 2015. Two other campuses exist in Riverside and Twentynine Palms. ‚ÄúOf the 78 students enrolled at Apple Valley, about 65 attend daily,‚Äù the appeal letter shows. ‚ÄúApproximately half of these students have autism and intellectual disabilities, and the remainder have emotional disturbance or learning disabilities ‚Ä¶ We have never had a citation or license issue.‚Äù Those enrollment numbers made the situation ‚Äúmore severe‚Äù for Bell. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre open from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., Monday through Friday,‚Äù he said. ‚Äú(That‚Äôs) 30 hours a week, and we‚Äôre getting these types of calls for service. I thought they‚Äôd have a couple hundred kids.‚Äù But Bryson defended the academy, which moved into its current location following the abrupt shutdown of St. Timothy‚Äôs Preparatory School in 2015 after 48 years. ‚Äú(T)here seems to be a movement to force (Bright Futures) to leave Apple Valley because of the kids they serve,‚Äù Bryson wrote in an email. ‚ÄúThe school has the complete support of the Desert/Mountain Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA), as well as the Special Education Departments at the local schools. The students they serve are all local students, including residents of Apple Valley.‚Äù Lamberth said a request was made to have deputies speak with students in an attempt to mitigate service calls, but was told the visits wouldn‚Äôt be possible due to low staffing at the Apple Valley station. Bell challenged that claim. ‚ÄúWe told them absolutely, but we‚Äôd have to work out the timing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn Public Affairs we have deputies whose job is to go to schools and talk about anti-bullying and staying out of gangs. That‚Äôs a resource available to them, but this request came only after they got word from the town that they would revoke the business license.‚Äù Town spokesperson Kathie Martin said the Council is aware of the matter, but has taken no action or position on Bright Futures‚Äô business license. ‚ÄúThe next step is the appeal to the Town Council,‚Äù Martin said. An appeal hearing has not yet been scheduled. Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254. Follow him on Twitter @DP_MatthewCabe.

However, does the new lower cost of the 128GB iPad mini 4 make it a compelling purchase? This review will look at the iPad mini 4 and give buyers advice on whether it‚Äôs worth the price even at the lower cost. The iPad mini 4 first showed up¬†back in September 2015 and then got a lot of attention. Since it‚Äôs original launch, Apple hasn‚Äôt updated it or added new features. However, they did recently drop the 32GB model and offer the 128GB iPad mini 4 for $399, $100 less than it used to cost. We decided to take a second look at the tablet. Should potential iPad buyers opt for the cheaper mini or go with the new 2017 iPad just introduced at an even lower price of $329? iPad mini 4 v. 2017 iPad The iPad mini 4 has a nice 7.9-inch display with a¬†2048¬†x¬†1536 resolution. That‚Äôs 326 pixels per inch (ppi). It‚Äôs a beautiful bright display with a colorful look delivering faithful color rendering. The new 2017 iPad has the same resolution as the iPad mini 4, which means it has a lower pixel-per-inch resolution. It only delivers 264ppi making it less crisp, in theory. I couldn‚Äôt tell a big difference between the two despite the pixel per inch difference. The smaller iPad uses older A8 and M8 processors while the new iPad enjoys faster speed with Apple‚Äôs A9 and M9 processors. They‚Äôre both 64-bit, so they‚Äôll work fine with the new 64-bit only iOS coming out later this year. They both include 2GB of memory to run programs. The new 2017 iPad sells for $329 with only 32GB of storage built-in. The larger iPad offers a smaller 32GB storage option at the base price of $329. The 128GB model costs $429 making it just $30 more than the 128GB iPad mini 4. The older iPad mini 4 drops the 32GB model and starts at $399 for 128GB of storage. The speed difference between the two iPads doesn‚Äôt show up in daily use and in the basic apps that I used. The newer larger iPad does boot a couple of seconds faster than the iPad mini 4. Most people won‚Äôt notice enough of a¬†speed increase to matter. The iPad mini 4 weighs 299 grams while the larger 2017 iPad weighs 469 grams making it just over 50% heavier. The new 2017 iPad measures 7.5mm compared to 6.1mm for the iPad mini 4. Those numbers mean that the bigger iPad does weigh more and feel thicker, but not enough to make that a serious consideration. The screen size will matter. The larger 9.7-inch screen makes it easier to see the same thing on the screen compared to 7.9-inches in the iPad mini 4. However, it will feel bigger and might offer less convenience for reading in bed at night or carrying around. Smaller means more portability, while bigger means easier viewing of video, images and text. iPad mini 4: Hardware Design I love using an 8-inch tablet for reading, quick Internet browsing and checking email. I especially love using it for taking notes in meetings or classroom settings at professional development training workshops. It‚Äôs small and convenient. A good fine-tip stylus like the Adonit Dash 2¬†($49.99 direct) works almost as well as the Apple Pencil on the iPad Pro. Apple sells the iPad mini 4 in¬†Silver, Space Grey¬†and Gold. I prefer the more conservative Space Gray look. Apple put the fast and reliable Touch ID Home button on the iPad mini 4. It‚Äôs quick and easy to open the iPad with it. The boring iPad design won‚Äôt get anyone excited anymore. We‚Äôre used to the rectangular slabs of glass, metal and plastic. The brushed aluminum edges with rounded corners feel good in your hands. Like all Apple tablet and phone designs, it screams quality and efficiency. The buttons for power along the top right corner and volume along the upper right edge feel sturdy. They should last and in my experience don‚Äôt wear out after normal usage even after more than a year of usage. I‚Äôve only had this iPad for a short time, but it feels no different from other iPads I‚Äôve owned for more than a year. Fortunately, we still get a headphone/mic combo port on the left end of the top edge. Sound is great through the headphones and adequate using the speakers along the bottom edge. Apple still maddeningly uses their proprietary Lightning port for charging and syncing. It‚Äôs a USB-C world and they need to change to the new standard especially since, they‚Äôve added the faster and more reliable USB port to their MacBooks. iPad mini 4: Camera Not many¬†people will use their iPad camera as much as their iPhone or smartphone camera. Apple gave the iPad mini a decent 8MP camera. It‚Äôs not the same as the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus camera, but it‚Äôs still pretty good for a tablet. Taking photos with a large 7.9-inch electronic view finder feels more satisfying than one might think. It‚Äôs easy to hold the iPad mini for stable shots since you can grip it with two hands. The camera app offers the following useful features: HDR Square shots Panorama Video When you finish shooting photos, you can use the built-in editing features to improve them. Apple offers a great system where third-party apps can add editing features to the built-in camera app to¬†enhance photo editing. I use my tablet camera to scan handouts in meetings. Grab a snap of the page and import it into your note taking app. Grab a shot of the whiteboard to save class notes or meeting brainstorming sessions. The iPad mini 4 camera excels at this. Apple iPad offers the best tablet camera available. That makes it useful if you have to use it to get snapshots or scan documents. iPad mini 4: Bottom Line The iPad mini 4 easily wins the award as the best overall 8-inch tablet. It‚Äôs not the least expensive and other tablets might prove themselves a better option for some people. For example, if you mostly want to read books and watch video on Amazon or Netflix, get the Amazon Kindle, which costs about one-eighth the price of the $400 128GB iPad mini 4. However, almost everyone else should opt for the iPad mini 4. People heavily invested in Android might want to consider something like the smaller Samsung Galaxy Tab S2. The new Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 tablet doesn‚Äôt come in the smaller 8-inch size. Budget conscious buyers who want more than a digital reading device (Kindle) should look at either the iPad mini 4 or the new 2017 iPad. If you want a smaller and more portable tablet, then go with the mini. However, if you want something bigger, obviously go with the new iPad. The mini costs only $30 less than the new 2017 iPad with128GB, so price isn‚Äôt much of a concern. If you won‚Äôt install many apps, then the cheaper 32GB 2017 iPad will save you $70 over the 128GB iPad mini. We don‚Äôt recommend that you buy that one since it fills up quickly. I own both, but I‚Äôm returning my iPad mini 4 to the store. I like the larger screen and faster processor. In all other ways, they‚Äôre nearly identical so get the size¬†you want and you‚Äôll enjoy it. They‚Äôre both great tablets. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

And making all those iPhones, MacBooks and tablets takes an enormous amount of energy. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a big deal when Apple says it wants to be the greenest company on Earth. The company launched a massive clean energy program in October 2015. The goal was to convert all of its energy use in China to clean power sources. Apple clobbered past that goal and is now working toward 100% renewable energy worldwide. ‚ÄúIn 2016, 96 percent of the electricity used at our global facilities came from renewable energy, reducing our carbon emissions by nearly 585,000 metric tons. We‚Äôre 100 percent renewable in 24 countries ‚Äî and all of Apple‚Äôs data centers,‚Äù Lisa Jackson, Apple Vice president of environment policy, said in an annual letter released earlier this year. Jackson served as the administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency from 2009 to 2013. To go fully green, Apple has said it plans to ‚Äúgenerate and source from more than 4 gigawatts of new clean energy worldwide by 2020,‚Äù according to a document released this month. So far, Apple is less than a quarter of the way toward its 4 gig goal, the equivalent of the energy needed to power about 4 million homes. It currently has 485 megawatts of wind and solar projects installed across China. The company also said last September that it‚Äôs committed to making sure all of the companies that supply parts to Apple follow its lead. Seven of Apple‚Äôs suppliers have already committed to going 100% renewable by 2018. Related: Why it‚Äôs really hard to pitch a green energy startup Not to mention Apple‚Äôs new corporate headquarters, Apple Park, will be powered solely by renewables. And to save trees, the company says 99% of the paper used in product packaging is from recycled materials. Tom Murrary ‚Äî the vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund‚Äôs EDF+Business initiative ‚Äî praised Apple‚Äôs efforts. He says Apple has been a leading player in sustainable initiatives, and now more than 70 companies have followed suit by committing to use only renewable energy sources. ‚ÄúFor companies like Apple, usually 80 percent or more of the carbon footprint is in the supply chain. That‚Äôs why its critical that Apple is looking beyond its own operations and working with suppliers to become 100 percent renewable as well,‚Äù he said. 40.712784 -74.005941 Trademark and Copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Ten things we¬íve learnt about this year¬ís phones Posted on 23-Apr-2017 13:10 by Bill Bennett | Filed under: Articles :¬†Bill Bennett Phone designers are running out of options. This year‚Äôs phones show less innovation than in years past. ¬† Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy S8 goes on sale this week. The early 2017 phone picture is now complete. We now know what the mainstream phone market will look like until Apple reveals its iPhone plans. Here are ten things we‚Äôve learnt about the state of the phone market: 1. Samsung fans are forgiving, maybe too forgivingYou couldn‚Äôt step on a plane at the end of last year with cabin crew reminding you of problems with the Samsung Note 7. Every safety announcement told passengers it was dangerous. The Note 7‚Äôs exploding battery was news for weeks. The tech business has rarely seen such damaging publicity. It seems Samsung raced the product out before completing testing. According to Ben Bajarin at techpinions that bad publicity is not enough to stop today‚Äôs Samsung owners from considering the Galaxy S8. 2. S8 ain‚Äôt done until Bixby runsBixby is Samsung‚Äôs voice-controlled virtual assistant. If it works it will rival Apple¬ís Siri, Google¬ís Assistant and Amazon¬ís Alexa. Samsung says Bixby is different because it strings tasks together. It then manages complex tasks the others can‚Äôt. Among other things, Bixby can wrap-up and send your most recently taken photo to, say, your partner. It promises to hunt down, then stream a specific video to a Samsung TV set. Soon after announcing the S8 Samsung said Bixby features will not all be available on day one. Unfinished software is not on a par with unfinished and unsafe battery designs. Yet it seems Samsung hasn‚Äôt learned all the important lessons from the Note 7. If the signature feature of a new phone isn‚Äôt ready by launch, you might wonder if Samsung still cuts corners. Will anything else emerge, Note 7-like, after the launch? 3. The case of the disappearing bezelBezel is the name given to the rim around a phone‚Äôs screen. All phone makers have reduced the size of their bezels in recent models. Huawei and Oppo‚Äôs 2017 phones have tiny bezels. Samsung has taken this almost to the logical extreme. There is almost no bezel on the Galaxy S8. The front is almost all glass. In practice this means two things. First, you get more screen in a smaller package. The display on the Galaxy S8 is larger than the display on the Apple iPhone 7 Plus. Yet the S8 is roughly the same size as the non-Plus iPhone 7. 4. Much ado about fingerprint scanner placementPut Note 7 fires and Bixby to one side for a moment. What is the main aspect of the Galaxy S8 that every phone reviewer wants to discuss? Is it the camera technology, the processor speed or large 5.8-inch screen? It‚Äôs none of these. Almost every review mention Samsung‚Äôs decision to move the fingerprint scanner. A smaller bezel on the phone‚Äôs front means there‚Äôs no room for a fingerprint scanner. Samsung moved it to the rear of the phone. Using the S8 fingerprint scanner is now a little more uncomfortable and a touch more awkward. Both points are true. It says a lot about phone innovation that reviewers focus on fingerprint scanner placement. 5. Cameras, cameras, camerasEvery phone maker at every launch says their latest model has the best camera on the market. I‚Äôve been to five launches in the six months or so and have heard five different phone makers make that claim. They can‚Äôt all be right. For what it‚Äôs worth, all premium phones have great cameras. They can all take excellent pictures in the right circumstances. Exactly what makes up the right circumstances varies a little from brand to brand. To a degree the camera innovation battle has moved on from hardware to software. At least four of the five big phone brands now offer some form of software-generated bokeh effect. 1 6. Enough with the fashion paradesSo far this year Samsung, Huawei and Oppo have all had big splashy phone launches with a fashion theme. Each launch included beautiful people from the fashion world. Oppo took this furthest with a Sydney Harbour boat cruise. It featured lurid coloured cocktails, a DJ and fashion models cat posing with phones. A fashion-industry big wig made a speech. She told boat passengers to throw their iPhones overboard and replace it with an Oppo. It‚Äôs worth pointing out that fashion-themed phone launches are not new. LG held a similar event in Auckland 10 years ago. The message, in case you didn‚Äôt get it, is that premium smart phones are fashion items. 7. Hardware innovation slows in 2017 phonesRelated to the fashion metaphor is the fetish with phone colours. There are different shades of black, metallic blues, greens and reds and so on. Again, we‚Äôve been here before with premium phones. In a sense modern phones have reached the point American cars got to in the 1960s. Then Detroit covered cars in chrome and added tail fins. They did this to create the impression of innovation where, in fact, there was little new. Innovation isn‚Äôt quite dead in the phone business, but it has slowed to a crawl. The fact that people fuss over the fingerprint scanner tells you that. Almost every hardware improvement in the last year has been incremental, cosmetic or unimportant. Screen resolution passed the point where the human eye could notice a different a few years ago. It‚Äôs been even longer since a phone processor wasn‚Äôt fast enough for all everyday tasks. 8. The price isn‚Äôt rightPremium phone price have climbed faster than inflation. This isn‚Äôt because of currency effects, phone prices are going up everywhere. In part this is because phone makers did not make much profit in the past. Although Apple has always enjoyed a good margin. Even Samsung struggled at times to earn a decent amount from selling hardware. In 2013 the Samsung Galaxy S4 cost NZ$1150 and the 16GB iPhone 5S was $1050. Today the cheapest iPhone 7 is $1430 and the bottom of the range Galaxy S8 is $1300. You can go all the way to $1830 with Apple or $1500 with Samsung. You can argue that you get more phone, or at least more memory and more screen. But that‚Äôs not the point, it now costs Apple fans over 30 percent more to buy the least expensive iPhone. Samsung customers pay around 20 percent more. Huawei has pushed its prices up even faster. Four years ago it made bargain basement phones, today the P10 is NZ$1000 and the Mate 9 is $1100. Bucking the trend Oppo‚Äôs $700 R9s has most of the features found in a Samsung phone for almost half the price. There‚Äôs a huge opportunity for a brand selling good phone hardware at that price. 9. Everyone has a phoneAlmost every person in the rich world who wants a modern mobile phone now has one. This means phone sales have slowed to a crawl compared with the past decade. It also means phone makers rely on shortening the upgrade cycle to turn over more product. That keeps the money rolling in. There is one big problem with that‚Ä¶ 10. There are few compelling reasons to upgradeToday‚Äôs premium phones are good. When it comes to practical functionality they are not much better than the handsets on offer two years ago. Most of the changes in that time have made little difference to an owner‚Äôs everyday life. There are always going to be performance obsessed geeks who argue for some esoteric reason they need an even faster processor. But in reality, it‚Äôs been a long time since phones were slow in everyday use. Likewise, any new hardware feature, is often only of interest to a minority. Few people will hold onto phones for, say, 10 years, as they do with PCs. Apart from anything else, they take a physical beating day-in, day-out and get dropped or otherwise worn out after a few years. Most users who are not on plans have already moved away from annual or bi-annual phone upgrades. In the future more of us are likely to hang-on to devices for even longer. I can‚Äôt remember if Sony or Oppo mentioned anything about blurred image backgrounds. Apple, Samsung and Huawei all did. ??Ten things we‚Äôve learnt about this year‚Äôs phones was first posted at billbennett.co.nz Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Trending now ¬ª Hot discussions in our forums right now: The case for mandatory internet filtering Created by shanehobson, last reply by Rikkitic on 23-Apr-2017 16:39 (63 replies) ... 3 4 5 The President Of The USA: Donald Trump Created by TimA, last reply by tdgeek on 23-Apr-2017 14:21 (4032 replies) ... 267 268 269 New Immigration Changes Created by Oriphix, last reply by joker97 on 21-Apr-2017 21:01 (40 replies) ... 2 3 Victim Impact Statements Created by robcreid, last reply by dejadeadnz on 20-Apr-2017 20:08 (33 replies) ... 2 3 Spark move to IP-based voice Created by freitasm, last reply by old3eyes on 22-Apr-2017 07:38 (61 replies) ... 3 4 5 Please post your ATM pin code here along with your internet banking password...

About Techzim Contact Us Send a Tip Menu About Techzim Contact Us Send a Tip Search advertisement Homepage ¬ª Connectivity ¬ª Cider promises Android users a taste of the Apple Cider promises Android users a taste of the Apple Posted 21 May 2014 by Garikai Dzoma (@gdzoma) Read 3 Comments Thanks to Cider, Android users will be able to install iOS Apps on the devices. Apple Fanboys have always claimed that a lot of Android device owners did not buy their devices by choice- they are just poor and could not afford the iPad and iPhone heaven. Under all that clamouring and FOSS ideology lies a secret desire to own an Apple device-they say. Thanks to a new piece of software called Cider, Android users might just¬†be able to install some iOS apps on their Android devices thus at least sating part of that secret desire. Before you get all excited, you should know that the software is just a prototype and the creators have said that they have no intention to commercialize it. The six PhD graduate students from Colombia who created the software said they did so as part of a research to bypass current restrictions on tablets and smartphones. They cite two¬†drawbacks of such restrictions: ‚ÄúUsers who want to run iOS gaming apps on their smartphones are stuck with the smaller screen sizes of those devices. Users who¬†prefer the larger selection of hardware form factors available for Android are stuck with the poorer quality and selection of Android games available compared to the well populated Apple App Store.‚Äù ‚ÄúAndroid users cannot access the rich multimedia content available in Apple iTunes, and iOS users cannot easily access Flash-based Web content.‚Äù They feel this is stifling innovation and depriving users of choice as some App publishers simply choose to target one platform because of resource restrictions. For example much as I would like to test Office for iPad I am stuck with a poor half-hearted imitation from the Play Store because I am unwilling to spend money buying a mobile device that will cost me three full grown cows! advertisement Cider Vodoo From the mumbo jumbo in the research paper Cider sounds a lot like WINE which allows MAC and Linux users to run PC software by providing the requisite API calls. ‚ÄúCider enhances the domestic operating system,Android, of a device with kernel-managed, per-thread personas to mimic the application binary interface of a foreign¬†operating system, iOS, enabling it to run unmodified foreign binaries.‚Äù Whatever this means it allows you to run iOS apps on your Android device. It‚Äôs not going to be in the Play Store in our lifetime. Cider was presented last month at APPLOS 2014¬†in a presentation titled Cider: Native Excution of iOS Apps on Android by Jeremy Andrus and his colleagues. They made a functional version of the software and tested a couple of Apps including Papers for iOS, Passmark benchmark and the Calculator for iPad but for now it remains just that-research. There are a lot of hurdles to be cleared if the software is going to become publicly available. Besides swatting the bugs and releasing the alphas and betas there are our friends from Cupertino California to deal with. If there were willing to sue people for rounded corners and bouncy features one wonders how they would react if Cider were to be released. We know how Apple loves to bilk, cheat and overcharge its customers via the Apple store and God forbid if someone was to introduce a way for users to circumvent that and allow Apple users to access the wider ebook world of Android for example. For now the researchers have said that they have no intention of commercialising the software despite the positive tone from their paper. Maybe someone got to them or maybe it means they are just going to release the software as an Open Source project. I hope it is the latter and I am anxiously waiting to get my hands on the software and take it for a spin. Picture Credit: Mashable Enjoyed this article?

And the company has set some lofty goals for itself. The company has a few long-term ambitions, such as stopping mining altogether and getting its entire supply chain to switch to 100% renewable energy, for one. But Apple‚Äòs efforts are already underway, with some impressive steps to be had. For starters, it said that seven major suppliers have pledged to power their Apple production line with 100% renewable energy by the end of 2018. It also revealed progress in the packaging department. ‚ÄúTo preserve precious resources, over 99 percent of the paper in our product packaging is from recycled or responsibly managed sources. And, in only two years, through partnerships with the Conservation Fund and World Wildlife Fund, we have achieved our goal of protecting or creating enough sustainably managed working forests to cover all of our product packaging needs.‚Äù Apple is embracing the use of its Liam robot to disassemble iPhone 6 handsets Apple also shed light on its initiatives to reduce reliance on mining, with the previously revealed Liam robot being one of these solutions. The robot was designed specifically to quickly disassemble iPhone 6 devices for recycling purposes. ‚ÄúFor example, we‚Äôve melted down iPhone 6 aluminum enclosures recovered from Liam to make Mac mini computers for use in our factories, and we‚Äôre transitioning to 100 percent recycled tin solder on the main logic board of iPhone 6s.‚Äù The company also revealed that with two Liam lines running, they can disassemble 2.4 million iPhones a year. Apple also said that for every 100 000 iPhone 6 devices, Liam has the potential to recover 1900 kilograms of aluminium, 800 kilograms of copper, 300 grams of gold, 400 grams of ‚Äúplatinum group metals‚Äù, seven kilograms of silver, 55 kilograms of tin, 24 kilograms of rare earth elements, 550 kilograms of cobalt, 3.5 kilograms of tungsten and 2.5 kilograms of tantalum. Otherwise, Apple says it will also be encouraging people to recycle devices via its Apple Renew programme.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: What to Expect From Skyworks Solutions' Q2 Earnings Skyworks Solutions shares have been soaring this year, but will the rally continue after upcoming results? Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) Apr 22, 2017 at 6:14PM Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) will look to extend its momentum when it releases its second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on April 27. Shares of the semiconductor specialist have risen over 30% this year, thanks to a terrific first-quarter performance back in January and a bright outlook driven by potential gains at its largest customer, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Here's what investors should expect from Skyworks' upcoming earnings. Image source: Getty Images. The headline numbers Wall Street expects Skyworks' second-quarter revenue to increase 8.4% from the prior-year period to $840 million, in line with the company's guidance. As it turns out, analysts were originally expecting lower revenue of $818 million, but contract wins at Chinese smartphone companies and Apple-related tailwinds led to a stronger outlook. Skyworks should be able to meet its guidance, as Apple -- which accounts for 40% of the chipmaker's revenue -- hasn't slashed its iPhone builds as severely as it did last year. Nikkei reports that Cupertino's iPhone production dropped 30% in the first quarter of 2016, which led to a marginal 2% increase in Skyworks' revenue. But the decline was relatively softer at 10% in the recently concluded quarter, explaining the stronger growth expected this time around. Meanwhile, Skyworks' stronger revenue growth is expected to boost its earnings to $1.40 per share, mitigating the negative impact of a 1-percentage-point decline in the gross margin from first-quarter levels. Wall Street was originally forecasting $1.24 per share in earnings, but Apple's relatively stronger iPhone production will play a key role in boosting its bottom line. Image source: Skyworks Solutions.¬† ¬† The way ahead Skyworks' guidance will largely depend on Apple's production timeline for the next iPhone. Late last month, Economic Daily News reported that the iPhone supply chain is already in motion, as key supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing will start mass-producing the A11 chip in April. The report also stated that TSMC could manufacture 50 million A11 chips by July, with another 50 million expected in the remainder of the year. Such a scenario means that Skyworks' guidance could top expectations once again, though analysts should take the report with a grain of salt, as rumors have begun of iPhone production bottlenecks. Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri believes Apple is struggling with low yields for the fingerprint sensor that's supposed to be integrated into the display itself. This problem could force Apple to push its production timeline back, negatively affecting Skyworks' guidance. It can't be denied that Apple will play a big part in deciding Skyworks' outlook, but there's another catalyst that investors shouldn't ignore. The chipmaker has been gaining content at Chinese smartphone companies such as Vivo, OPPO, and Huawei by launching specific products targeted at this market. For instance, the SkyOne Ultra 2.5 front-end LTE solution that was launched earlier this year will help the chipmaker target the growing demand for LTE chipsets in the Chinese market. China is the biggest market for LTE smartphones globally, and Chinese vendors such as OPPO, Vivo, and Huawei are now dominating the global marketplace. This is good news for Skyworks investors, as sales of the top 10 Chinese original equipment manufacturers for smartphones could rise 39% this year, with Vivo, OPPO, and Huawei expected to cross the 500 million-unit mark. Skyworks' focus on diversifying its business elsewhere should help it do well during lean iPhone manufacturing periods. For instance, OPPO recently launched its new flagship phone, the F3 Plus, which should help Skyworks boost its sales during the June quarter as it supplies radio frequency chips to the smartphone maker. Skyworks Solutions investors, therefore, can expect an optimistic outlook from the company once again, thanks to its gains outside Apple, while an early production ramp-up of the next iPhone could be another tailwind.¬† Harsh Chauhan has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About General Apple is getting serious about self-driving cars Yoni Heisler @edibleapple April 22nd, 2017 at 6:02 PM Share Tweet Though Apple‚Äôs plans to develop and manufacture a branded car may currently be on hold, the company‚Äôs plans to research and develop self-driving car technologies appears to be moving forward.¬†Just about a week after Apple obtained a permit to test autonomous vehicles in the state of California, Business Insider filed a public-records request and managed to gain access to materials accompanying Apple‚Äôs permit application. The filed documents provide us with some interesting new information regarding Apple‚Äôs training program for its nascent self-driving car initiative. Don't Miss: Someone rendered that leaked iPhone 8 design, and it looks even worse than we thought According to training materials which¬†correspond to software Apple calls the ‚ÄúApple Automated System‚Äù, it appears that Apple engineers have been busy developing a suite of software and hardware sensors designed to assist a car drive with the¬†flow of traffic while avoiding other vehicles and pedestrians. According to the training packet, the car that Apple‚Äôs staffers are using to test the self-driving technology is outfitted with consumer video game gear such as a Logitech steering wheel and pedals to actuate drive by wire. Whereas Apple‚Äôs earlier car efforts seemed to entail hiring hundreds of employees with vast automotive experience across all aspects of the car development and manufacturing process, it stands to reason that Apple, for the time being, has decided to primarily focus its attention on self-driving technologies. With cars boasting Apple‚Äôs mysterious autonomous software having been approved for use on the road, California law holds that the drivers/passengers overseeing the testing must be sufficiently trained and ready to assume control of the wheel at any moment. Apple applied for a permit for six drivers to drive three Lexus RX450h SUVs. Apple‚Äôs drivers, named in the application, are mostly Ph.D.s specializing in machine learning, some of whom previously worked for companies like Bosch and Tesla, according to their LinkedIn profiles. Apple said its vehicles would be able to capture and store ‚Äúrelevant data before a collision occurs‚Äù in its application. That Apple is exploring self-driving technologies may not be all that surprising, but the more interesting question is if it really matters. As it stands now, we can only presume that Apple‚Äôs progress with its own technology isn‚Äôt anywhere close to matching what established automakers and a myriad of start-up companies have already developed. Going forward, it will be interesting to see if Apple‚Äôs foray into the self-driving world will ever yield a marketable product or if it will simply become an Apple research initiative that never sees the light of day. Apple‚Äôs full permit application can be viewed over here via AppleInsider.

Now, training documents acquired by Business Insider reveal more details about the company's self-driving car plans. The documents themselves reportedly contain details of a "Development Platform Specific Training" for employees testing out the autonomous system Also included in the documents are details about the autonomous-vehicle system itself, which is apparently referred to as the "Apple Automated System." Related: Project Titan ‚Äì What you need to know Accoridng to the report, an Apple official wrote on one of the government forms: "The development platform uses hardware and software to monitor surrounding objects and events." The official added that the technology is "capable of sending electronic commands for steering, accelerating, and decelerating and may carry out portions of the dynamic driving task." The training documents also appear to reveal that Apple is using consumer video game gear, including such items as a Logitech steering wheel and pedals to "actuate drive by wire". They also reveal that Apple staffers must be fully trained in how to override the automated system and take manual control of the vehicle. The staff must pass seven tests, according to the documents, with each driver having two practice runs and three trials to pass each test. Apple will apparently be using six drivers, most of whom are reportedly Ph.D.s specializing in machine learning, to test out three Lexus RX450h SUVs Whether Apple plans to build its own self-driving car remains unclear, with some expecting the company to simply work on developing autonomous technology for use in cars from third-party companies. However, in November last year, Apple‚Äôs director of product integrity told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in a letter: "The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.‚Äù Just what Apple has planned with regards to its own autonomous car remains unclear, but it's good get some insight into the company's latest self-driving developments.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Silver iPhone 8 Rear Shell Images Show Vertical Camera, Fingerprint Sensor In Center & More By Ramish Zafar 19 hours ago 27Shares Share Tweet Submit Given that there‚Äôs still a lot of time left until Apple launches the iPhone 8, the company‚Äôs testing a lot of prototypes. One of these, with a rear fingerprint sensor is the feature of a lot of leaks lately. According to these, Apple will follow in Samsung‚Äôs footsteps this year and introduce the iPhone 8 with a rear fingerprint sensor as well. Samsung‚Äôs reason for the move is that Syaptics simply did not have the technology ready at the time of the S8‚Äôs launch. Now, Apple‚Äôs also testing the possibility of a similar move. Looks like Synaptics‚Äô still having problems with the technology. Today, we‚Äôve got some more details on the concept. Take a look below to find out more. Alleged Shell Images For The iPhone 8 Show Vertical Dual Camera And A Rear Fingerprint Sensor The iPhone 8, despite a good five months left until its launch, is a regular feature of the rumor mill. The smartphone, like the iPod before it, constitutes a majority of Cupertino‚Äôs revenues and it‚Äôs a dire need for Apple to stay ahead of the pack when manufacturing its smartphone. However, it‚Äôs dropped the ball with the smartphone over the past couple of years. Not only has design taken a backseat, but the only new features that we get are forced as a reply to Apple‚Äôs competitors. Related The Xiaomi Mi6 Plus Passes 3C Certification; Larger Screen, Snapdragon 835 In Tow? Advertisement This year, the rumored iPhone 8 is expected to bring Apple back into the game. Firstly, the device is rumored with the very important OLED upgrade. Apple‚Äôs lack of adequate supply chain resources have left the company embarrassingly behind in this critical display upgrade. The smartphone is also rumored to feature a virtual fingerprint sensor, just like the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ had been rumored to prior to their launch. Today‚Äôs alleged shell images for the iPhone 8 surface straight out of China. They‚Äôre based on the schematics for the device that have leaked earlier. The shell in itself looks very unorthodox. The iPhone‚Äôs back is generally very smooth, with Apple‚Äôs love of minimalism being at its strongest. Now that there‚Äôs¬† a fingerprint sensor right at the center, this breaks the previous approach on the lineup‚Äôs design. At least Apple‚Äôs more thoughtful and has placed the sensor at the center of the iPhone, rather than at the top like the Galaxy S8. This will make using the device much easier, especially for one-handed use. Related Apple and Nike Announce the New Apple Watch NikeLab ‚Äì Space Gray Color Enthusiasts Will Love This Other changes in addition to the rear fingerprint sensor is the dual camera sensor arrangement. Apple debuted the feature on the iPhone lineup with the iPhone 7 Plus last year. Now, with the iPhone 8, we‚Äôll see the sensors arranged vertically, rather than horizontally. If these images are accurate, then Apple must have a really good reason to make the change. However, such a sensor arrangement makes us doubt the authenticity of today‚Äôs images. Vertical sensors simply don‚Äôt make sense. Take it with a grain of salt and let us know what you think in the comments section below. We‚Äôll keep you updated on the latest.

By Madeline St. AmourMorning Sentinel Follow on Twitter Email Writer 207-861-9239 Share Comment Read Article UNITY ‚Äî Apple trees ready for planting at the Maine Heritage Orchard lay near the entrance with tags that read names such as Black Oxford, Finley Lane and Bourassa, and while these heirloom varieties might not appear next to the McIntosh and red delicious varieties at the grocery store, some would argue they‚Äôre superior. ‚ÄúThese days it‚Äôs really hard to find a really, really good pie apple in the grocery store,‚Äù said John Bunker, a co-founder of the orchard that lies on Crosby Brook Road near the grounds of the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association, or MOFGA. Jenny Koontz, left, and Jordan McHugh plant a tree Saturday. "I'm really interested in Maine and how progressive they are in organic farming," Koontz said. John Correa, right, and Laura Sieger water a newly planted apple tree in Unity on Saturday. "I'm interested in the history of Maine apples," Correa said. Staff photos by Michael G. Seamans Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store ‚Üí On Earth Day this Saturday, a few dozen people gathered at the 10 acres of terraced grounds that was formerly a muddy gravel pit. They each took a tree, each with a name that can‚Äôt be found in most stores, and planted it along the rows. This is the fourth spring planting for the orchard. For John Correa of Trenton, the day of planting was also sentimental. He placed a memorial tree for his brother-in-law, who died three years ago, along a part of the terrace overlooking a stream. The tree is a Northern Greening variety, which originated in Orland near Correa‚Äôs residence. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm interested in the history of Maine apples and how important they were to the settlement,‚Äù he said, adding that the variety he chose is unique because it was reportedly something Americans sent back to England. The trees were planted in marked spots that had a small compost pile on top. First, Bunker said during a demonstration, you weed the dirt pile, then you dig a hole for the tree. The hole should be ‚Äúmore like a salad bowl than a post hole,‚Äù he said. When Bunker had dug the hole deep enough, he made a small hill in the center and lay the roots of the tree over it, then put the soil on top. He also made a berm, a narrow ridge along the outside of the hole that would keep the rainwater from going toward the tree. There were 25 apple trees to plant and 100 other fruit trees, such as elderberry. The orchard has 300 apple trees planted so far. Fred Kraeuter of Boothbay attended the first year of planting in 2014 and came back again this year. ‚ÄúI just like to be a part of something as important and historic as helping to preserve the heirloom apples of Maine,‚Äù he said. Jenny Koontz and Jordan McHugh, both apprentices at the farm Bunker runs with his wife, Cammy Watts, in Palermo, said they came to the area because they were interested in learning about farming in Maine. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really interested in Maine and how progressive they are in organic farming,‚Äù Koontz said. Before coming to Maine, she worked at an orchard for four years after college before moving to Alaska. McHugh heard about MOFGA and then found the apprenticeship, which she thought would be a good opportunity to learn about apples before possibly working in the cider business one day. ‚Äú(Bunker‚Äôs) kind of just like the ultimate apple guy,‚Äù she said. As more people look to cook or make cider with apples, they‚Äôre going to look for varieties that create a better product, Bunker said in an interview Thursday. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt exist in the grocery store anymore, but they do still exist,‚Äù he said. Heritage or heirloom varieties of apples and other fruits exist in the ‚Äúold, broken-down farm orchards of Maine‚Äù that Bunker searches out to get scions to graft onto seedlings. For example, he found an old apple tree in Belgrade that is a variety called Judy, so he took a few scions and grafted it onto a small seedling at the Maine Heritage Orchard. In Maine alone, about 500 to 1,000 apple varieties were grown, but most disappeared by 1900. ‚ÄúWe left the world of diversity for the sake of convenience,‚Äù Bunker said. In the past, he said, the apple orchard ‚Äúplayed a small but important role on every farm.‚Äù Each farm had small orchards of 10 trees, or maybe a few more, and mainly used the apples themselves or in the surrounding community. Because they were localized and adapted to the specific soil conditions of a region, the varieties grown in Waldo County would be different from those grown as nearby as Waterville. ‚ÄúAs we left that world of the small, diversified farm and entered the world of the large commercial farm,‚Äù we lost many of the varieties for practicality‚Äôs sake, Bunker said. ‚ÄúHannaford‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt know what to do if they had 500 varieties in their produce section.‚Äù The many varieties represent a piece of Maine‚Äôs history. A list of all the apple varieties kept in the Heritage Orchard shows that many originated in Maine, some from long ago. For example, Aroostook Sunset came from Mapleton before 1870 and Black Oxford came from Paris in 1790. ‚ÄúThese varieties represent a huge diversity. They come in all sizes and shapes and colors and seasons,‚Äù Bunker said, adding, ‚ÄúWhen I was young, I realized there was a huge resource that we shouldn‚Äôt let go.‚Äù He started to collect scions and graft them onto seedlings at his farm, the Super Chilly Farm, in Palermo, but he eventually ran out of room. Then he worked with the late Russell Libby, who led MOFGA up until 2012, to establish the Maine Heritage Orchard. The work is important, Bunker said, because it will preserve the apples for future generations as well as part of our heritage. Some of the varieties are adaptive and disease resistant, he said, making them a practical choice for home gardens. ‚ÄúPlus it‚Äôs this incredible body of genetic material that was developed by Mainers,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI felt like it would be a terrible shame to lose this.‚Äù The orchard serves as an educational facility where innovative techniques are tried to shape what was a gravel pit overlooking a muddy stream into a semi-circle of terraced land blooming with fruits, and it hosts a spring planting every year that provides people with a way to make a difference locally. ‚ÄúThe beauty of something like Earth Day is not thinking good thoughts about the earth, but it‚Äôs actually going out and doing something,‚Äù Bunker said. ‚ÄúWhat can be more in line with ‚Ä¶ Earth Day than planting a tree?‚Äù Madeline St. Amour can be contacted at 861-9239 or at: [email¬†protected] Twitter: madelinestamour Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

(Submitted by Ryan Holowaty) Noodlecake's Ryan Holowaty says the best thing about being a featured developer in an Apple celebration of Canadian video game makers is that it helps put Saskatoon on the map in the gaming world.¬† "Games are being made here in Saskatoon and people don't necessarily realize that," said Holowaty, the vice-president of marketing and business development for Noodlecake¬†Studios. University of Saskatchewan students show off final project video games Game on: Video games celebrated at Saskatoon Western Development Museum "A lot of them think everything is done either in Vancouver or Toronto ... there's actually some really amazing tech work going on in Saskatchewan and this kind of helps put Saskatchewan on the map a little bit more nationwide." Recognition is part of Canada 150 feature The tech giant is¬†currently featuring Canadian game developers at the Apple App Store in recognition of Canada's 150th anniversary of Confederation. Noodlecake is the first of "Canada's best game makers" to be featured, putting them on the front page of Apple's Canadian app store.¬† Apple's App Store is featuring Saskatoon-based game developer Noodlecake as part of a Canada 150 celebration of Canadian game makers. (Submitted by Ryan Holowarty) The feature includes a profile of the company and¬†recognition that it is based in Saskatoon. Holowaty said it was important to spread the word that it's not essential to leave Saskatchewan for a career in the tech industries. Not just oil and gas in Sask. "Everybody just assumes around here that you have to be in agriculture or oil and gas and those industries," said Holowaty. "The computer science programs and things at the university are doing great work and there's different industries¬†in the tech side that people can get into, especially from a career standpoint." Noodlecake's work is a combination of creating its own games and helping to publish games made by other developers around the world. The company was founded by Jordan Schidlowsky and Ty Haugen and most of the people who are involved with Noodlecake are University of Saskatchewan graduates.¬†Its latest game, Invert, was created by a team in Denmark. Holowaty hopes that the industry in Saskatchewan will begin to grow. "This gives a lot of interest to young students who are coming up and can realize that this is a career that they can have here in Saskatoon, and not necessarily something they maybe thought that they could even do without moving," he said. ¬† Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Weather Severe weather warnings or watches in effect for: Sunday Chance of rain showers or flurries 4¬∞C Monday Chance of flurries 1¬∞C Tuesday A mix of sun and cloud 2¬∞C Wednesday Snow or rain 4¬∞C Thursday A mix of sun and cloud 9¬∞C More Weather Latest Saskatoon News Headlines Catholic school funding decision could extend beyond Sask.: professor March for Science draws 200 in Saskatoon Feds announce $2M in funding to Sask.

The Galaxy and Note series have both been wildly successful -- so much so that they basically cemented Samsung's status as Apple's equal in the smartphone war, at least here in the US. But the cheap plastic design and overwrought software found in early Galaxy devices turned me off, to the point that I thought I'd never take their phones seriously. When a few colleagues started talking up the Galaxy S8 after an early preview, I remained skeptical. Yes, the company had been taking big steps forward in industrial design over the past two years, but I just couldn't imagine how something with screens this large could be comfortable. (We all remember the tragedy that was the massive Nexus 6.) Popular Searches Halliburton Co HAL ‚ñº 47.06 -0.63 -1.32% National Beverage Corp FIZZ ‚ñº 85.49 -4.78 -5.30% Williams Companies Inc WMB ‚ñº 30.01 -0.25 -0.83% Renault SA RNSDF ‚ñº 85.05 -1.05 -1.22% How wrong I was. Ever since Samsung first unveiled the Galaxy S8 late in March, I've had to eat my words. At first, a phone with a tall, 18.5:9 aspect ratio seemed to be a strange design decision, but it was the right one. Despite its massive screen size, the S8 is basically the same width as phones with much smaller displays. Keeping the S8 relatively narrow was probably the most important design decision Samsung made. The S8 measures 68.1mm wide, a scant 1mm wider than the iPhone 7. This size makes using the S8 with one hand is absolutely a reasonable prospect, something I didn't imagine when hearing about a device with a 5.8-inch screen. It's something you really need to hold to appreciate. I can't overstate how that completely changed my view on the S8. Don't get me wrong, it's still a Large Phone and not everyone will be able to use it comfortably in one hand. The tall aspect ratio also makes reaching UI elements at the top of the display challenging, for sure -- getting to the notification pane is trickier than I'd like. But all told, it's far more useable than I ever expected. (The S8 Plus manages a similar trick, packing a larger screen into a frame that's basically the same size as the iPhone 7 Plus. It's not a one-hand device, but it's still much smaller than it has any right to be.) ¬© Chris Velazco / Engadget Indeed, it's not just useable -- it's downright enjoyable, more so than any other phone I've tried with such a massive screen. There will be some growing pains as app developers adjust to this odd new screen size, but the S8 is both immersive and beautiful. Holding and using the first iPhone was a magical and futuristic experience compared to every other phone that was on the market in 2007. Using the S8 feels the same -- it's the closest we've gotten to that sci-fi dream of having a glowing glass slate device to guide us through the universe. Designing and then manufacturing such a device at scale was likely quite difficult, but it paid off. I'm far from the only one out there who now looks at Samsung as the undisputed hardware design master in the field. Quite a trick, considering most of the media coverage around the company in the last six months has focused on exploding phones. Assuming nothing goes wrong with the S8, I think we can safely say that the company has put its huge misstep behind it. ¬© Chris Velazco / Engadget Even better for Samsung, it now has a good five or six months to bask in the glory. Apple will almost certainly unveil a new iPhone with an overhauled design, and it's hard to imagine that Google's next Pixel will keep its surprisingly large bezels, but neither of those phones are expected until the fall. That's a long time for Samsung to crow about its revolutionary new phone design, and it wouldn't be surprising if sales ended up reflecting that. Yes, LG's G6 has a similar bezel-less design, but the fit and finish isn't quite as excellent, and Samsung has been handily beating LG in terms of smartphone marketshare for a long time now. The S8 will only grow that lead. Still, the Galaxy S8 isn't a perfect phone. I'd still vastly prefer the stock Android experience that Google offers on the Pixel, even though the skin formerly known as TouchWiz is now polished and totally usable. Bloatware remains a problem, and Bixby is not at all ready for prime time. Also, what's up with that fingerprint sensor? But then again, no smartphone is perfect. And the good news with software issues is that they're often fixable -- particularly when you consider how relatively open and flexible Android has proven to be over the years. Software evolves and changes -- but when you buy a phone, you're usually committing to that hardware for a good two years. For the first time, I'd be willing to make that commitment with a Samsung phone. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

And making all those iPhones, MacBooks and tablets takes an enormous amount of energy. That's why it's a big deal when Apple says it wants to be the greenest company on Earth. The company launched a massive clean energy program in October 2015. The goal was to convert all of its energy use in China to clean power sources. Apple clobbered past that goal and is now working toward 100% renewable energy worldwide. "In 2016, 96 percent of the electricity used at our global facilities came from renewable energy, reducing our carbon emissions by nearly 585,000 metric tons. We're 100 percent renewable in 24 countries -- and all of Apple's data centers," Lisa Jackson, Apple Vice president of environment policy, said in an annual letter released earlier this year. Jackson served as the administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency from 2009 to 2013. To go fully green, Apple has said it plans to "generate and source from more than 4 gigawatts of new clean energy worldwide by 2020," according to a document released this month. So far, Apple is less than a quarter of the way toward its 4 gig goal, the equivalent of the energy needed to power about 4 million homes. It currently has 485 megawatts of wind and solar projects installed across China. The company also said last September that it's committed to making sure all of the companies that supply parts to Apple follow its lead. Seven of Apple's suppliers have already committed to going 100% renewable by 2018. Related: Why it's really hard to pitch a green energy startup Not to mention Apple's new corporate headquarters, Apple Park, will be powered solely by renewables. And to save trees, the company says 99% of the paper used in product packaging is from recycled materials. Tom Murrary -- the vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund's EDF+Business initiative -- praised Apple's efforts. He says Apple has been a leading player in sustainable initiatives, and now more than 70 companies have followed suit by committing to use only renewable energy sources. "For companies like Apple, usually 80 percent or more of the carbon footprint is in the supply chain. That's why its critical that Apple is looking beyond its own operations and working with suppliers to become 100 percent renewable as well," he said.

It didn't make for the sleekest-looking design we've seen, with the leaked schematics seemingly revealing the fingerprint cutout to be located centrally, beneath the standard Apple logo on the back of the handset. Numerous reports and rumours have suggested Apple is planning to do away with the physical home button on the upcoming iPhone. Related: What will the new iPhone be called? This has led some to predict the company will relocate the Touch ID sensor to the rear of the device, while other rumours have it that the phone will feature the scanner below the display itself. While the latter would make for a sleeker handset, these latest schematics didn't offer much hope in that department, and now, someone has turned those schematics into a full render. Yes, Chinese social media site Weibo (via) has provided us a with a 3D rendering of the schematics in question, complete with the same cut-out for the rear-mounted Touch ID sensor. Of course, there's absolutely no guarantee the original schematics are indicative of Apple's final design, so this latest render shouldn't worry fans of streamlined smartphone designs too much. Apple is said to have been testing numerous prototypes, so even if the schematics are accurate, they could refer to just one of many designs Apple is considering. But with Samsung moving its fingerprint sensor to the rear of the Galaxy S8, it could well be the case that Apple follows suit. The company has filed numerous patents for in-display fingerprint sensors, but has, accoridng to some analysts, been facing issues with actually implementing that technology. Apple should unveil the final design later this year, and at this point nothing has been confirmed so stay tuned for the latest.

The emails went out to predominantly 50GB iCloud subscribers on Wednesday, causing some MacRumors readers to speculate that Apple was discontinuing the storage tier completely. Options to purchase some of the plans through macOS and iOS were also reportedly affected. However, as predicted, the emails were sent in error. Apple has now followed up the errant message to clarify that it was a mistake and that there has been no change to users' subscription plans. "You recently received an email incorrectly stating that your iCloud storage plan has been discontinued," the email read. "Your 50 GB iCloud storage plan is not affected and will continue to renew automatically. "We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. If you have any questions, please contact us."

The documents, obtained by IEEE Spectrum under a public records request, contain Apple‚Äôs full application for an autonomous vehicle testing permit that the¬†DMV granted last week. This includes details of the three Lexus RX450h hybrid SUVs that Apple will be using for on-road tests, the company‚Äôs training plans, and the identities of some of the people working on the project. Apple might not be intending to build a full self-driving car, only an accessory or software for other manufacturers The training plan for the safety drivers, which California requires behind the wheel of all autonomous vehicles, is perhaps the most revealing. It shows that drivers are being trained on a jury-rigged drive-by-wire system using Logitech steering and pedals intended for video-gaming. The plan involves low-speed (48 kph or 30 mph) and high (104¬†kph or 65 mph) driving, indicating that Apple is working on systems for highway as well as urban use. The documents do not specify the system Apple is working on, although it does not sound as ambitious as the fully driverless systems that rivals like Waymo and¬†Zoox¬†are building. One entry reads: ‚ÄúThe development platform uses hardware and software to monitor surrounding objects and events. The development platform is capable of sending electronic commands for steering, accelerating, and decelerating and may carry out portions of the dynamic driving task.‚Äù Two of the cars that Apple will be using for public tests were only registered to the company at the end of March, and the third only dates back to November. Since buying the Lexus last year, Apple has put only around 700 miles on its odometer, according to a smog check report included in the application pack. All three vehicles are registered to Apple at an address in Illinois that is also the headquarters of Donlen, a fleet-leasing subsidiary of the car-rental company Hertz. The six safety drivers that Apple mentioned in its application all appear to be engineering staff working on the car. The first mentioned is¬†a highly experienced engineer who previously worked on automated vehicles for NASA and Bosch. Her LinkedIn profile says of her current role at an unnamed Silicon Valley company: ‚ÄúI developed the vision and built an organization of [around] 30 world class researchers and engineers in the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence. ‚Ä¶ I lead this incredible team to develop innovative algorithms, and implement and test these algorithms on hardware.‚Äù Other safety drivers have also previously worked on autonomous vehicles, including cars in the DARPA Urban Challenge that kick-started the technology a decade ago. The person who completed the application is Apple‚Äôs director of product integrity, Steve Kenner, who was previously in charge of automotive safety at Ford. But the documents raise as many questions as they answer. In a letter to the DMV dated 12 April, Kenner asks for Apple to be excluded from the DMV‚Äôs provisions requiring it to meet Federal vehicle safety standards and install a data recording system. His reason is because the recording systems are ‚Äúnot applicable to development platforms used for testing purposes only.‚Äù It is unclear why Apple should have been granted a permit without agreeing to these conditions. After all, all the vehicles in California‚Äôs autonomous vehicle testing program are, by definition, only to be used for testing purposes. However, the wording of ‚Äúdevelopment platform‚Äù rather than ‚Äúcar‚Äù or ‚Äúvehicle‚Äù, which Kenner uses throughout the application, might imply that Apple is not intending to build a full self-driving car but only an accessory or software for other manufacturers. We will certainly learn more about Apple‚Äôs efforts once its cars are spotted on public roads, and when the company is (eventually) obliged to file a report on its testing activities, early in 2019.

Over the past week, Apple's reported plans to build a major iPhone update have been the subject of several rumors. One of those rumors discussed what the handset might actually offer, including a big screen and new design. But it was flanked by reports of Apple needing to delay its release due to some supply problems. There's also talk that Apple might be considering a different design than it had hoped, due to fingerprint technology not advancing to where it might have liked. This is Fortune‚Äôs weekly roundup of the biggest Apple news this week. To see last week‚Äôs roundup, click here. But that's not all the Apple news this week. The company was also a target for Chinese regulators hoping to enforce controls on live-streaming apps, and the company made clear that it's committed to creating products entirely from green materials‚Äîsomehow. Get Data Sheet, Fortune‚Äôs technology newsletter Read on for more about Apple's past week and what you need to know about the company's upcoming iPhone in this week's Fortune Apple news roundup. Apple is preparing three iPhones this year, including one that would come with an overhauled design, Bloomberg reported this week, citing sources. That third handset could come with an all-glass design and use organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology for its screen, rather than the liquid-crystal display Apple has long relied upon. Apple might also be considering a slightly curved display and eliminating bezels to boost the screen size to around 6 inches. The biggest iPhone Apple sells now, the iPhone 7 Plus, has a 5.5-inch screen. An image of what is purported to be an iPhone schematic surfaced on the Web this week. The schematic shows the back panel of a possible iPhone. While it doesn't reveal much, it shows a vertically aligned hole for a dual-lens camera and another hole for Apple's fingerprint sensor. Apple currently has a fingerprint sensor on the front of its iPhone, and on the iPhone 7 Plus the company's dual-lens camera is horizontally aligned. Whether the schematic is the real thing, however, is unknown. That hole on the back of the schematic for a fingerprint sensor could have been developed in response to some reported troubles Apple is facing with its third iPhone design. According to a Pacific Crest Securities note this week, Apple is having some trouble getting a fingerprint sensor that would be baked inside its iPhone display working. That might ultimately force the company to delay the big iPhone update a couple of months to get it right or move the sensor to the back. Apple has been rumored to be planning to bake the fingerprint sensor into the iPhone's screen, a feature the company has never offered before. A report out of China this week said that regulators in the country are planning to talk to Apple about strengthening its controls on live-streaming applications as part of a broader effort by the government to analyze, and in some cases, clamp down, on certain kinds of Internet content. Apple this week said that it plans to stop mining materials for its products and make its devices only from green materials. However, the company cautioned that it's not yet sure how it can be achieved and didn't say when it might happen.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS Guest How Apple can fix news Adam Ghahramani@adamagb April 22, 2017 10:25 AM Image Credit: Lawrey/Shutterstock Two months ago, Tim Cook railed against the rise of ‚Äúmind-killing‚Äù fake news and pledged Apple News‚Äôs support in the battle against it. And so far, Apple News has done an admirable job of curtailing false news. But it‚Äôs done a lousy job of elevating good journalism. Here‚Äôs why that‚Äôs an issue: Starting with iOS 10, Apple News comes as a preinstalled widget on the iPhone. Because few people customize their widgets, Apple News enjoys undue influence in shaping daily news perception. With that power, Apple has had the opportunity to usher-in a new standard for digital journalism. Instead, it has eschewed bold strokes for mediocrity and sensationalism. Here are the two key mistakes Apple is making: 1. Too much randomness The Apple News widget displays two headlines in each of two categories: ‚ÄúTop Stories‚Äù and ‚ÄúTrending Stories.‚Äù The logic behind this separation appears sound: Every media outlet has a top and trending list, right? But at a single media outlet, editors choose top stories and readers choose trending stories. The lines are clear. Apple News isn‚Äôt a single media outlet; it‚Äôs an aggregator that algorithmically scours the field. Meaning, for a top story to make the cut, it‚Äôs probably trending among its peers, and for a trending story to make the cut, it has to be on top. The lines are mish-mashed. Sometimes, the same story appears both under the ‚ÄúTop‚Äù heading and the ‚ÄúTrending‚Äù heading. Other times, a fluff story appears under ‚ÄúTop‚Äù and a story of material importance appears under ‚ÄúTrending.‚Äù I bring up the poor category distinction not because it‚Äôs particularly harmful but to underscore the chaos that Apple introduced into its widget design. It gave its product privileged placement but left to chance the quality and social responsibility that that placement demands. Let‚Äôs assume Apple will improve on its categories. Perhaps it will only feature lighter stories under ‚ÄúTrending.‚Äù Well, that raises a question: Why should the important stories share equal real estate with the popular stories? Especially in this age when so many stories trend for the wrong reasons ‚Äî because they appeal to our baser instincts, because their parent is a master of social media, or because they went through 100 headline iterations. Apple should remove ‚ÄúTrending‚Äù altogether, or at least rethink the split. ‚ÄúI would probably emphasize top news with at least a 2 to 1 ratio,‚Äù said digital culture guru Douglas Rushkoff, when I asked him about this recently. ‚ÄúIt would be nice to lose trending stories altogether, but people feel disconnected without them; they need to see headlines about Taylor Swift or scandals in order to feel relevant.‚Äù With such a change, Apple would lose empty clicks in the process, but who cares? As Rushkoff pointed out, ‚ÄúApple‚Äôs competitive advantage is their business model: they are not delivering eyeballs to advertisers or data miners, they are delivering news to customers.‚Äù In a CNN interview, Apple SVP Eddie Cue said as much. ‚ÄúWe benefit by creating a great application on our devices. And we think this is a really, really important application for the world,‚Äù said Cue. In an age when clickbait dominates social media, wouldn‚Äôt it be more important for iPhone owners ‚Äî and society ‚Äî for Apple to highlight substance over buzz? 2. Extreme perspectives We all love editorials, obviously, but if you could pick four headlines from every media outlet in the world to represent the most important news of the day, how often would an editorial make the cut? How about a comically spun editorial from a hard-skew outlet? Probably not very often. Yet the Apple News widget promotes sensationalist editorials every day. Apple showcases extreme stories from both sides of the spectrum. Like boxers in a ring, one day Fox News uppercuts and the next day HuffPost counter punches. Meanwhile, Apple holds the mic as the prime time promoter. ‚ÄúStories with extreme perspectives are bifurcating our society,‚Äù said Rushkoff, ‚Äúand Apple can use human beings to curate the news people actually need rather than the clickbait that simply gets our attention for no good reason. They already use humans to curate playlists for music and apps.‚Äù As a discerning moderator, Apple could feature editorials with balanced, nuanced analysis and penalize the rest. Apple could also curtail or rewrite clickbait headlines, cutting phrases like ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never believe what‚Ä¶‚Äù or replacing ‚ÄúTrump absolutely crushed liberal reporter‚Ä¶‚Äù with ‚ÄúTrump criticized Times reporter‚Ä¶‚Äù Rewriting headlines sounds dramatic, but Techmeme, a gold standard in news aggregation, has been doing it since 2013. Rewriting headlines would solve another problem: that many headlines as-written are too long for the widget. It‚Äôs common for long widget headlines to end abruptly in an ellipse, obfuscating their meaning. This helps no one: readers get confused and publishers receive less engaged clicks. Right now, media outlets are incentivized to run clickbait headlines. The upside is unlimited and the penalties are non-existent. Apple can change the paradigm. A silver lining: no personalization One thing Apple is getting right, though, according to Rushkoff, is the lack of personalization options for its News widget. The first time a distrusted media outlet appeared in my widget, I dove into the depths of Apple News and emerged with a dozen sources added and blacklisted. Wiping the water from my eyes, I looked up at the scoreboard only to see that it hadn‚Äôt changed. It turns out that while you can customize Apple News to jelly, those changes don‚Äôt carry over into its widget. And the widget doesn‚Äôt appear to take your reading activity into account (I tested this with three iPhone devices). While I found this lack of customization personally frustrating, especially in lieu of the problems discussed earlier, Rushkoff sees it as necessary. He praised Apple‚Äôs decision to show everyone the same headlines and contrasted that decision with Facebook and Google‚Äôs take on the news, which hides too much. ‚ÄúAt least with a newspaper, you knew the stories you were ignoring,‚Äù said Rushkoff, ‚Äúthey stayed in your awareness.‚Äù With Apple‚Äôs News widget, that‚Äôs true again. How could Apple improve its news widget? The short answer is ‚Äúobsessive human curation.‚Äù The long answer is: Obsessive human curation Rethink the ‚ÄúTop Stories‚Äù and ‚ÄúTrending Stories‚Äù distinction and ratio Prioritize thoughtful editorials over spin Penalize clickbait headlines or rewrite them Hide or rewrite headlines that are too long for the widget Add more media outlets, especially smaller outlets Living up to the name So far, I‚Äôve referred to Apple News as ‚ÄúApple News.‚Äù That‚Äôs the official designation on the App Store, but not what the app calls itself. Underneath its pink icon and headlining its widget is one word: ‚ÄúNews.‚Äù Apple names a lot of its apps in the shorthand, like ‚ÄúCalculator,‚Äù ‚ÄúWeather,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWatch,‚Äù but ‚ÄúNews‚Äù is a loaded word. It represents an ideal in a sea of coverage tarnished with a human point-of-view. I bring this up not to criticize Apple for falling short of ‚ÄúNews‚Äù ‚Äî everyone does ‚Äî but to give it a loftier target. With a thoughtful, socially responsible approach, this little widget can set the standard for the news. And that‚Äôll benefit everyone, most of all Apple itself.

According to The Wall Street Journal‚Äôs publication, AllThingsDigital, it informed that though the term of the deal has not been disclosed officially, but HopStop has been compared to Israel‚Äôs Waze, which was recently acquired by Google for $1 billion. Founded in 2005, HopStop.com makes mobile applications for both iOS and Android that covers over 300 cities and that helps people get directions or find nearby subway stations and bus stops. Echeruo, formerly an analyst at investment banks and hedge funds, who founded HopStop, is now chairman of the Board for the app firm. The move, according to market intelligence, is seen as Apple‚Äôs plan to bolster its map offering especially given Google‚Äôs recent acquisition of Waze. A serial entrepreneur, Echeruo, grew up in Eastern Nigeria and attended Kings College, Lagos. He attended Syracuse University and the Harvard Business School in the United States and founded HopStop.com after working for several years in the Mergers and Acquisitions and Leveraged Finance groups of J.P Morgan Chase where he was involved in a broad range of M&A, financing and private equity transactions. He also worked at AM Investment Partners, a $500 million volatility-driven convertible bond arbitrage hedge fund. He founded and raised nearly $8 million for his two U.S. based Internet companies: Hopstop.com and Tripology.com. Tripology.com was acquired in 2010 by American travel and navigation information company, Rand McNally. True to form, Echeruo is working on yet another venture but this time, focused on small businesses in Africa. According to him, ‚Äúthere is no reason why every entrepreneur should have to reinvent the wheel every single time in all the countries in Africa. My idea is to essentially have one place where a budding entrepreneur can access a template for starting a business, and then customise it to suit their own situation; essentially, a business-in-a-box. Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, online services, and personal computers.

Nigerian ‚Äú‚Ä¶..an igboman Dr Philip Emeagwali‚Ä¶He founded d internet‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù I had to stop reading your post right there. Emeagwali is an achiever no doubt but your statement is patently false. Ralf Yes, its no false, Dr Philip Emeagwali is, an igboman n he founded d applications tht made modern day internet possible. ..Google tht name‚Ä¶Who cares if u read my views or not‚Ä¶They are not for d uninformed anyways..

Prince T you are welcomed lisacambell46 Sharapppppppppp Na propaganda,you done hear about Innoson Motors? Prince T i am not going to sharrrrrrrrrappppp. does emeagwali has PhD??? Please answer the question by yourself. ‚ÄúEmeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan from 1987 through 1991. His thesis was not accepted by a committee of internal and external examiners and thus he was not awarded the degree‚Äù a thourough search of his patented work showed that the the only patented work is his website. Morever where is your inventor today. I am not going to bother myself looking for innson morons lisacambell46 Jealousy go kill you,wetin Yoruba achieve if no be to dey steal Nigeria money Prince T How would I be jealous of a fraudulent person. He is in the dustbin of history today. The guy was smart no doubt about it must it patent lie. He is one of the people giving us bad name.

At least i got under your skin. I know your type lisacambell46 GET AWAY NOTHING YOU TELL,UNTIL YOU CHANGE FROM YOUR SENTIMENT,YOU TOO LOW COMPARE TO MY CLASS,WE ROLL IN DOLLARS AND POUNDS STERLING Justina. Yet it does not call for crude tribalism to annoyance of others solo la Philip Emeagwali is a fraud, go check his profile online. lisacambell46 But he his where he his,you tribal bigott Justina. What a shameful crude tribal bigotry is yours. At the end of day you end up raising more hatred and hurt to genuine and enlightened members of your tribe New Nigerian ..and have you attended all the graduation ceremonies all over the USA, Canada, UK and other western countries for you to come to this conclusion? Are is that it is just facts to justify a pre-conceived notion? Tunde Hausas have nothing to show outside of Nigeria. On a fair playing field, the hausa man is finished. OLUREMI i don‚Äôt believe iheonunekwu ever attended any school in his life his reasoning doesn‚Äôt show he ever passed through the four walls of classroom,wearing suit doesn‚Äôt make you an educated man but if he ever did then that means some people need urgent assistance before it‚Äôs too late solo la Your retarded from your mother‚Äôs womb. Ayo Ademola This is a biased and narrow minded comment to divide Nigeria, you don‚Äôt what else is going on in other cities in America not to talk of other part of the world. if you want to compliment somebody who has done a good job, that‚Äôs fine, just do it and stop the negative comments about others. Nwade Chudi You can join your slave masters to deny President Jonathan second term but the factor that the Ndigbo are Jews of Africa is not in doubt .The extending the frontiers of Nigeria in all areas where there is level playing fields is not doubt. The three sons and daughters of Ndigbo have just won seats in the concluded United Kingdom election ,so we must show that we are push the Nigeria frontiers outside the shores of this country.To built a Television is no achievement but to discover is the main thing.The achievements during the civil war is no mean feat , that was killed by the present civil war alliance is APC. New Nigerian Congratulations. The world is expansive and Nigerians in the diaspora of every tongue & tribe are truly world class citizens. What you have written here about Ndigbo can be said about Nigerians of other lineage, Yoruba, Hausa, Ijaw, Tiv, Jukun, etc contributing their quota in world commerce, peace and uplifting of the human race in Nigeria and everyweher in the world. Please elevate yourself above bigotry and try to jojn those folks who definitely are not looking at issues perpetually through a tribal lens, and No Ndigbo are not jews. Jews are jews and Ndigbo is Ndigbo ‚Äì If the sentiment is in being creative, open your eyes and you‚Äôd see that there is no monopoly of creativity by a race, any race ‚Äì Creativity is post-racial. Much Love! solo la Thank you and God‚Äôs blessing. ASH ASSET he grew up in lagos and attended kings college Lagos,so get it into your head ,if he grew up in the east,at best he would have turn out to be importer of fake drug or at worst,an armed robber or a kidnapper leonardsonyekwere ‚Äúhe grew up in Lagos and attended kings college Lagos‚Äù Therefore, he is from Lagos State(A Lagosian of Igbo heritage). I accept this but do you accept that Lt. Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu was from Kaduna State? Yes, born in Kaduna, raised in Kaduna, saw himself as first a Nigerian from Kaduna, then an Igbo man. Do you accept that Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe was from Niger State? Yes, born and raised in Niger State and saw himself first as a Nigerian but of Igbo heritage. Do you accept that Dim Ojukwu was first a Ngerian before he became a Biafran? Yes, Ojukwu was born in Niger State(thus a Northerner by place of birth) relocated to Lagos where he attended Kings College(so he was groomed in Western Nigeria). Went to Britain from there and returned to Lagos before experiencing life in the Southeast. I mean, Nigeria will become a federation the day a citizen of Nigeria becomes a citizen anywhere he or she reside within the geographical boundary of Nigeria. New Nigerian We accept where the major characters you mention accept for themselves as where they were from. You raised a very important point that have puzzled me for a while ‚Äì which is that when you look at history and hindsight is always 20-20 as they say, the major actors you mentioned could arguably be said not to be Igbo by place of birth, yet they are the ones who cause more problems for the place of their lineage based on their approach and the results‚Ä¶as their approach seemed to always been reactionary and hijacking their ‚Äúhomeland‚Äù for turf-battle with their true birth places. You would have expected that they should have been the one at the forefront of being able to bridge the divide and bring advantages to their ‚Äúhomeland‚Äù, so what is it in the psyche of these igbo-by-lineage personalities that made them hijack their lineage for personal adventurism at the extreme risk of the survival of Ndigbo. What is it that makes them fail to truly be egalitarian and bridge builders, choosing for the most part everything but, even though they have been born, bred and ‚Äúbuttered‚Äù outside of igbo land? Now about Nzeogwu Kaduna, yes he was as you said, accepted as such and had all the rights and accesses of being from Northern Nigeria, seriously, and then what did he do? He did not see himself as a Northerner, he saw himself more akin to being from the south east, even as we knew it was only by lineage, worked with folks with similar lineage to kill his premier‚Ä¶.and others who thought like him and who happened to believe in their super-race also killed other premiers, their leaders in the army and leader of the country..mostly from the North‚Ä¶did Azikiwe saw himself as a Northerner then? No, so what did he do ‚Äì he vacillated, was on perpetual vacation in the Carribeans and UK and I watched him (it‚Äôs on You tube) explain away why it was not a coup BUT that the first republic people abdicated‚Ä¶this after his fellow Onitsha man (he saw himself as an Onitsha man, even though like you rightly said he was born & bred in the north), Aguiyi Ironsi, had forbidden the swearing in of a new leader and sacked the parliament and effectively killed the first republic making himself the paramount ruler of Nigeria‚Ä¶this sent the country into a tailspin, which included civil war and other extreme political & social engineering‚Ä¶ and things are just beginning to normalize through our democracy of the past 16 years‚Ä¶which should continue, we should jaw-jaw, rather than war-war.. Do you know that Murtala Muhammad was a Kano man, yet his lineage we hear is Ogbomosho, western Nigeria. Do you know that Lateef Jakande‚Äôs lineage is Kwara, even as he remain every bit a Lagosian and was an executive governor of the State‚Ä¶profile any leader from Northern Nigeria and you may be surprised where the lineage would lead you‚Ä¶so long as he accepts to be with the people and is dedicated to serve them, what does it matter, really? Do you know that Abacha‚Äôs lineage is NOT Kano? Ambode‚Äôs lineage (New Lagos Governor) NOT Lagos, even as he is every bit a Lagosian as you may find‚Ä¶talking of which ‚Ä¶.Northern region has every tongue spoken in Nigeria for example, yet it was built on a foundation of hard work, faith & unity..western Nigeria and northern Nigeria, by and large, are further along I have found in my extensive interactions country wide in accepting public service from people according to the content of their character, not perfect but further along. The remaining part of Nigeria have some catching up to do even as all part recognizes the differences, and celebrate unity in diversity for a progressive Nigeria. The world need Nigeria to be strong and progressive and we all should leave no one behind. lisacambell46 My friend sharappppppppp,do you know this topic of this Article? Useless tribal bigot Ifeanyi This is a very stupid comment. I hope you are aware of that, because if you aren‚Äôt, your future is really bleak. Alhaji yusuf Chimamanda was born and brought up in Nsukka, eastern part of Nigeria. Issysmooth So why are Yorubas the owners of Kings College not able to achieve this? Bad belle, just give it to the Igbos because not until an Igbo man becomes the President of Nigeria, it will continue to be one step forward two steps backward for Nigeria. dkoma Congrats broda Sal Yarima it is not anywhere in US news. They usually associate Nigeria with filth, criminal activities and poverty. They will never show this guy to the US public. They are afraid of the African New Nigerian Not true, my brother. Nigerians are known to be on average one of the least criminal community, the most educated and one of the upwardly mobile groups in the USA. No kidding. solo la Your right we are well respected in the usa. pete Is a shame that some persons will come out here and be saying rubbish. You can only site out just few names among the millions of people who are from the so called Igbos. Beside philipe Emeagwali and this very guy whose news as not be validated yet. And you are also talking about igbos getting the highest numbers of graduate in that institute. I don‚Äôt know when the igbos started going to school. what we all know of are the yoruba‚Äôs who has the highest numbers of professor in Nigeria. They are not igbos, they are yorubas. and also the first Nobel Laurent award to be won by and Africa was also won by a yoruba man who is a prof. Now, the richest tribe in Nigeria are also the yorubas, eg, the lives of Adenuga, femi, and even the richest black woman on earth is also a yoruba. my broda shut your month up! Now talking about the hausa‚Äôs. one of the brigtest mind today we have in nigeria, still remain, sanusi lamido sanusi. i don‚Äôt know if that sounds like an igbo. and the richest man in africa, is also an hausa, i don‚Äôt know if that sounds like igbo too. the only thing an igbo man as brought to the nation Nigeria, is shame and reproach. like that of the death sentence out there in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand china, name it. both male and female. And there also other tribe out there. And with all of this, they are still not as rich compel to other tribe. Is a pity! There are still a number of them still on the death role. I urge you to pray for your tribe because is a big mess. That is why every other tribe don‚Äôt like them in Nigeria. Because they are mess. now there is a news now hitting the sky, of how an igbo man is selling human parts as a meat in his hotel. Anabra in quote! What will you say about that? Try to check the news daily. you will see how curse is the igbo race and what they have done to the image of nigeria. Nonsense! And come to think of it, the igbos call themselves the jews of Africa. So dumb! you guys should do a research on the life of the Jews. now most of the technology weuse in the world are from the Jews. Zionist in quote. Eg, mike zurkerberd, who as about 2. something billion customers in facebook. And who as also revolutionize the world via his invention. helping families and friends across the world.and a number of them that way too like the Sergey Brin of google n, Larry Ellison, oracle, name it! the isreal are the world movers and also affect lifes positively. But the igbos hasn‚Äôt done anything notable. The only notable thing they ever brought to mankind, is pain, shame and reproach. with great war between themselves.An average igbo does not have love for his fellow tribe. I do have few ones they stay with me, i know what i am talking about. So shut your mouth. Now in addition to this. No race or tribe is inferior to the other. Success is not a tribe of a race. if not, the richest and the largest pastors and great men will not come from Africa. Any man can be a success, provided he will be able to give his or herself to the demand of success. Truthwillprevail Shame on the Guardian for posting this as fresh news. This was widely published in the US two years ago. He made the front page of Black Enterprise magazine last year MindYourself As soon as I finished reading the story I had already imagined how the commentaries would turn out. Ndigbo vs Yoruba. My ‚Äòbrother is very very brilliant ‚Ä¶.you don‚Äôt know anything‚Äô. If I may ask, what did you do to contribute to the society? Nothing, but creating hatred amongst yourselves. Can‚Äôt you people imbibe the spirit of humility for once? Must you fight over the achievements of your brothers? If this man we are celebrating today behaves in this shallow manner he may find it hard to achieve this greatness. You all should be ashamed of yourselves. Issysmooth Yorubas will never see any good in anybody else. The Igbos are giving then run for their money, so they hate them. They will prefer Nigeria without the Igbos so that they will become local champion amongst the other tribes. Mikfaya ???..! You right man.! Prince Omiedo Very welcome devt but this is no longer news. Read about it some two years ago on The Engineering Network. http://bit.ly/1cP0TWs ADENCHI As the saying goes, ‚ÄòSuccess has many brothers‚Äô. I‚Äôm NOT in the least surprised that tribalists and ethnic jingoists will turn this into a tribal slagging match instead of celebrating Nigeria(ns)for a change. Does anybody even know which state or part of America Bill Gates is from? But we all know he‚Äôs an accomplished American. Please brothers/sisters, let‚Äôs get our values right, because it‚Äôs the same ethnic mentality that drove us into civil war that cost many innocent Nigerian lives. lisacambell46 Yoruba,Igbo,Hausa ad other tribe,all have intelligent brain that are making Nigeria proud,Nigeria are blessed.

In its press release, the company said: Apple's new Earth Day Challenge encourages customers to get outside and enjoy the planet and complete a workout of at least 30 minutes. If they do so on Earth Day, they'll receive a special achievement and unique stickers in the Messages app. The new stickers and badges are just one way Apple has elected to promote Earth Day. Additionally, the firm has worked with artist James Blagden to create animated videos which show Apple's approaches to being more sustainable. One such animated video discusses Apple's new HQ, Apple Park, which will replace ‚Äú5 million square feet of asphalt and concrete with grassy fields and over 9,000 native, drought-resistant trees, and is powered by 100 percent renewable energy‚Äù. Lastly, Apple highlighted some of the key points from its environmental responsibility report. The company said it is 100 percent renewable in 24 countries, including all of its data centres, and that seven manufacturing suppliers have committed to using 100 percent renewables for any Apple products they produce. Another interesting note is that Apple has transitioned around 320,000 acres of forest in China towards Forest Stewardship Council certification, meaning it has protected and created enough sustainably managed forests to cover all its packaging needs.

Now documents that were filed as part of the application have been published, and they detail the safety and training procedures for employees who will work with the software platform and act as backup drivers to take over the controls when needed. The documents are titled ‚ÄúDevelopment Platform Specific Training‚Äù and refer to the self-driving car platform as the ‚ÄúApple Automated System.‚Äù Obtained by Business Insider, these pages indicate that Apple will be using three 2015 Lexus RX450h SUVs as their test vehicles, with six certified drivers. These drivers must pass seven different tests, which include basic maneuvering and taking control of the vehicle during specific situations like a tight U-turn or sudden acceleration. Each test requires two practice runs and three trials in order to pass. Other tidbits include the use of hardware like a Logitech steering wheel and pedals paired with the self-driving software, allowing drivers to actuate drive by wire. When a driver needs to manually take control, they can override the autonomous driving system simply by grabbing the steering or pressing the brake pedal, while presses of the accelerator will leave the system in control.

Could Alphabet and Apple now be considered two of the best healthcare stocks around? Maybe so. Image source: Getty Images. Teaming up Alphabet has a couple of companies focusing on healthcare ‚Äî Calico and Verily. And these companies have forged partnerships with some big established healthcare companies along the way. Calico was formed in 2013 to develop technologies that increase the human lifespan. The following year, AbbVie teamed up with Calico, investing $750 million to try to bring new therapies to market for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. In late 2015, Google Life Sciences changed its name to Verily Life Sciences. Verily is working with Dexcom (NASDAQ: DXCM) to develop¬†miniaturized continuous glucose monitors for type 2 diabetic patients. It formed a joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline to create bioelectronic medicines that use tiny implanted devices to¬†treat disease.¬†The Alphabet business unit also formed other joint ventures with Johnson & Johnson to develop robotic surgical systems and with Sanofi to create technology that helps diabetic patients better manage their health. Perhaps the most intriguing project that Verily is working on is its effort with Novartis to develop a smart contact lens that senses glucose level in tears. The goal is to have contact lenses that change color if diabetic patients‚Äô glucose levels aren‚Äôt where they need to be. No pain, big gain CNBC recently reported that Apple has a secret initiative underway that‚Äôs trying a different approach in monitoring glucose levels. Currently, patients must use finger sticks that pierce their skin four times per day to monitor their glucose levels. Apple‚Äôs team is trying to develop a solution that uses optical sensors instead. The ultimate goal is to fulfill Apple founder Steve Jobs‚Äô vision of wearable devices that could continually monitor important vital signs. Apple Watch already enables monitoring of heart rates. Apple has applied for a patent to send alerts to family or emergency staff if an Apple Watch wearer has heart problems, such as arrhythmia. However, monitoring glucose in a completely non-invasive way has been impossible so far. Dexcom does have a continuous glucose monitoring system that interfaces with Apple Watch. However, the system uses a sensor that is placed underneath the skin. It also requires a minimum of two finger sticks each day for calibration. Apple‚Äôs hope appears to be to eliminate the need for finger sticks entirely. Apple is looking at other healthcare opportunities as well. Bloombergreported last year that the company intends to transform its HealthKit app that runs on iPhones and Apple Watches from a primarily fitness application to a tool that helps improve diagnoses. Apple also bought a small company in early 2016, Gliimpse, which is developing software that stores electronic health records from multiple sources in one place. Top healthcare picks? There‚Äôs no question that both Alphabet and Apple are trying to solve some of the most challenging problems in healthcare. But are the stocks good choices for investors wanting to profit from the growth in the healthcare industry? Yes and no. The negative response isn‚Äôt because Alphabet and Apple aren‚Äôt solid stock picks. They are. However, in the near term, neither company will generate enough revenue from healthcare to rank the stocks among the best ways to ride the healthcare wave. On the other hand, investors should look at the long run. If Alphabet and Apple are successful in achieving their goals, the financial opportunities in healthcare for both companies are enormous. The diabetes testing market could reach $17 billion by 2021. If Alphabet‚Äôs smart contact lens pans out and Apple‚Äôs optical sensor technology works, the two technology giants could also become healthcare giants. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(Reuters) India would welcome Apple to make its iconic iPhones in the country where a lot of big firms were already making mobile phones, said Union IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Saturday. ‚ÄúA lot of big mobile phone manufacturing companies have come, and if Apple comes fine, they are welcome,‚Äù he told reporters at the margins of an IT event here. Noting that he would soon be meeting top officials of the US-based firm to discuss its plans to make its mobile phones in India, Prasad said as India was a huge market, making in India for the domestic and export markets was important. ‚ÄúThey (Apple) are very keen. Its executives are going to meet me in a couple of days though I need not share with you what they are going to discuss with me,‚Äù quipped Prasad after an interactive meet with captains of the IT industry, organised by the state-run Software Technology Parks of India here. Also watch: Noting that 72 global telecom firms have started production in the country over the last two years, the Minister said 42 of them were making handsets while others (30) were manufacturing components like batteries and other parts. ‚ÄúThough we (India) missed the industrial revolution and the entrepreneur revolution, we don‚Äôt want to miss the digital revolution. We want to become leader in that, which is our fundamental philosophy,‚Äù he said. Asserting that India was at the cusp of a digital revolution, he said the country‚Äôs digital economy would be a trillion dollar market, for its stakeholders, including IT/ITeS, e-commerce, digital payments and communications.

Carscoops Your daily scoop in automotive news About Contact RSS Mobile Social Media HOME NEW CARS SPIED CONCEPTS FUTURE CARS VIDEO GAMES OFFBEAT BRANDS TUNING REVIEWS NYIAS Shanghai Auto Show Carscoops.com Apple's Autonomous Prototype Outed As A Lexus RX With A Rear Seat Steering Wheel | By Michael Gauthier | ShareRedditPinTweetPlus Apple was recently granted a permit to begin testing autonomous vehicles in California and now we're learning more about the company's plans thanks to a public records request by Business Insider. According to documents released by the California Department of Motor Vehicles, the company's autonomous driving technology is called the "Apple Automated System." Unlike some of Google's prototypes, the Apple autonomous driving prototype has a Logitech steering wheel and pedal kit with drive-by-wire technology. The Cupertino-based tech giant said "the development platform is capable of sending electronic commands for steering, accelerating, and decelerating and may carry out portions of the dynamic driving task." Apple test drivers must undergo seven different tests to ensure they can quickly override the autonomous driving system in case of an emergency. The first two tests involve driving on a closed course at a set speed. More advanced tests require the trainee to demonstrate they can override the vehicle by grabbing the steering wheel, pressing the brake pedal, or manually making a lane change. Apple has applied for six driver permits to be used in three modified Lexus RX 450h vehicles. The grainy pictures posted by BI fail to reveal much but it appears the driver sits behind the front passenger seat and operates a steering wheel and pedal assembly installed in the rear. This is an odd decision but it could be two-fold: It isn't very noticeable to outside observers and it eliminates the need to reprogram the traditional steering wheel and pedals to accept inputs from both drivers and computers.

IANS Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 India will welcome Apple if it comes, says Prasad India would welcome Apple to make its iconic iPhones in the country where a lot of big firms were already making mobile phones, said Union IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Saturday. "A lot of big mobile phone manufacturing companies have come, and if Apple comes fine, they are welcome," he told reporters at the margins of an IT event here. Noting that he would soon be meeting top officials of the US-based firm to discuss its plans to make its mobile phones in India, Prasad said as India was a huge market, making in India for the domestic and export markets was important. "They (Apple) are very keen. Its executives are going to meet me in a couple of days though I need not share with you what they are going to discuss with me," quipped Prasad after an interactive meet with captains of the IT industry, organised by the state-run Software Technology Parks of India hereb. Noting that 72 global telecom firms have started production in the country over the last two years, the Minister said 42 of them were making handsets while others (30) were manufacturing components like batteries and other parts. "Though we (India) missed the industrial revolution and the entrepreneur revolution, we don't want to miss the digital revolution. We want to become leader in that, which is our fundamental philosophy," he said.

According to a Nielsen study in¬†2014, 55 percent of adults aged between 18 and 34 years used mobile payments. Try Newsweek Subscription Offers Venmo‚Äîwhich has now become ingrained itself as a verb among its young consumers‚Äîreported it facilitated $2.1 billion in payments in the third quarter of 2015, three times more than the same quarter last year.

We ranked all 50 Jelly Belly flavors 2017-04-22T14:54:44.000Z Emi Boscamp TODAY share tweet pin email It's National Jelly Bean Day ‚Äî which may seem like a jolly, innocuous holiday ‚Äî but don't be fooled. It's a highly controversial day, as people are super opinionated about their favorite and least favorite flavors. Some absolutely bonkers people actually enjoy Buttered Popcorn, while others gag at the mere thought of it. Emi Boscamp¬†/¬†TODAY Anyone wanna play Mancala? So, to stir up a little controversy, TODAY.com editorial director Meena Duerson, aka my boss, and I decided to spend an hour (at least) ranking all 50 Jelly Belly flavors ‚Äî which meant tasting, spitting out (hey! sommeliers do it, too!) and generally making ourselves sick. So, even though you won't agree with us (we didn't even agree on all of these), you should probably thank us for sacrificing our taste buds and overall happiness. What did we learn? The best jelly beans are citrus-flavored and look exactly like what they're going to taste like. Also, jelly beans should never, ever be allowed to imitate anything with dairy. *Chills* Here's our (read: Meena's) definitive ranking with tasting notes: Tyler Essary/TODAY Okay, jellies, now let's get in formation. 50. Buttered Popcorn No! You can't throw up in here! Go to the bathroom! 49. Caramel Corn So terrible, the worst, good God these are bad. 48. A&W Root Beer Tastes like what it is, but I hate root beer. 47. Mango This is so sad because I love mango. Is that barf? This is a crime against mangoes. Offensive. 46. Cappuccino Never opt into this color of jelly bean. Yuck. 45. Top Banana Tasted this after Buttered Popcorn, so in comparison, it's amazing. It's still not good, though. 44. Strawberry Daiquiri Gets worse the more you chew it. Too sweet. Is now a good time to tell you I don't like jelly beans? 43. Kiwi Starts out OK then takes a turn. Awful. Offensive to kiwis. Same genre as Cantaloupe. 42. Cantaloupe Very powerful. Wow. Awful.

Licorice Surprisingly not nauseating or as terrible as all the other terrible flavors. 40. Pi√±a Colada Yellow is always a risk. Awful. 39. Bubble Gum Tastes like a headache. 38. Tutti Fruitti Tastes like Bubble Gum but a little better. Not great. 37. Raspberry Tastes like cough syrup. Nauseating. 36. Mixed Berry Smoothie Tastes like it has a gross yogurt coating, like something I'd feed to my baby. Gets worse as you chew. 35. Juicy Pear Classically bad one. Reminds me of how bad Peach was. Actively bad. 34. Berry Blue Looks like toothpaste and tastes like Crest Kids toothpaste. RELATED: For National Jelly Bean Day, make these cool candy-studded desserts 33. French Vanilla Tastes like a scented candle. Waste of time. 32. Orange Sherbet It's like a creamsicle, but worse. It's very flat. 31. Strawberry Jam Fruity, not great, too sweet, like the gum in a Blow Pop. 30. Chocolate Pudding Tastes like a very bad version of fudge. 29. Green Apple Doesn't taste like apple or artificial apple. Unclear what that is. 28. Red Apple Better than Green Apple but not by a lot. 27. Peach Way too sweet. Yuck. 26. Wild Blackberry A worse version of blueberry. Bland. 25. Island Punch Not getting any tropical vibes from this. Is this grape? Pass. 24. A&W Cream Soda Tastes like what it is, but even sweeter, so I wouldn't eat another one. 23. Lemon Drop Very accurate. Tastes like the shot. It's a nice citrusy palate cleanser. 22. Very Cherry Reminds me of a cough lozenge, which I don't mind. Not terrible. 21. Plum Tastes like artificial purple, definitely doesn't taste like plum.

Play Video - 3:41 Quiz: What is the top jelly bean flavor in America? Play Video - 3:41 20. Blueberry Dense. Tastes like a crayon. 19. Dr. Pepper I don't like Dr. Pepper, so I don't think this is very good. 18. Coconut Typically don't like tropical flavors in jelly beans but this isn't bad. 17. Strawberry Cheesecake Tastes like strawberry yogurt, which is fine, but not great. 16. Crushed Pineapple A better version of Pi√±a Colada. More refreshing. 15. Sour Cherry Standard jelly bean fare. Way better than Very Cherry. 14. Watermelon Not as bad as I remember it. Tastes like a scented marker smells ‚Äî which isn't necessarily a bad thing. 13. Cotton Candy Not bad, though it doesn't taste like cotton candy; it's subtle and not too sweet. 12. Toasted Marshmallow Don't hate it, surprisingly, tastes like what it is, with a little hint of cotton candy. 11. Sunkist Tangerine I would like this if I encountered it in the wild, but I've had far too many jelly beans at this point. 10. Sunkist Lemon More subtle than Lemon Lime but still has a good amount of citrus. 9. Lemon Lime It's fine, tastes exactly like it's colored, which is ideal for a jelly bean. You don't ever want to be surprised by what you're eating. 8. Margarita It's fine. RELATED: Jelly Belly debuts first beer-flavored jelly bean 7. Sunkist Lime Exactly what I'd expect it to be. 6. Sunkist Orange Tastes like the soda, very straightforward, which is the best thing a jelly bean can be. 5. Sunkist Pink Grapefruit Subtly sweet. Best of the citrus family. 4. Pomegranate A good baseline for what's good. It's fruity but not too sweet. Refreshing. 3. Chili Mango So much better than original Mango, way more subtle and complex, with some nice spice. 2. Cinnamon This is a dream jelly bean. It's like a Hot Tamale. 1. Sizzling Cinnamon Even more intense version of a Hot Tamale. I like the tingle.

Digital Trends Home > Wearables > Apple is issuing its Watch owners an Earth Day‚Ä¶ Apple is issuing its Watch owners an Earth Day fitness challenge By Christian de Looper ‚Äî April 22, 2017 4:28 AM Subscribe Share Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital¬†Trends Get today's popular Digital¬†Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Beyond the fact that stickers are cool, our planet is even cooler. Apple wants to raise awareness about the environment, and you can be part of the fun. Earth Day is this Saturday, and in celebration Apple is launching the latest Apple Watch Challenge. As a part of the event, Apple Watch owners are challenged to get their butts outside and completely 30 minutes of exercise ‚Äî after which they‚Äôll unlock a slew of new iMessage stickers and special achievements. ‚ÄúGet outside and celebrate Earth Day on April 22 and earn this award. Go for a walk, run, cycle, wheelchair, or swim workout of 30 minutes or more in the Workout app or any third-party app that writes these workouts to Health. You will also earn special stickers for Messages,‚Äù said Apple in a statement announcing the challenge. The Apple Watch challenge isn‚Äôt the only thing Apple is doing in celebration of Earth Day. The company has also launched a video series featuring interviews¬†with key Apple employees leading Apple‚Äôs effort to address climate change and use safer materials. The company also touted its new campus, which is highly climate-friendly. In fact, the campus will feature a hefty 9,000 native and drought-resistant trees,¬†and is powered completely by renewable energy. Apple has long made an effort to be among the more climate-conscious tech companies. At this point, 96 percent of its operations are powered by renewable energy ‚Äî including retail stores, offices, distribution centers, and so on. As part of that, 100 percent of Apple‚Äôs operations are renewable in 24 countries. Apple has also partnered with forestry companies to create more sustainably managed forests ‚Äî and in partnering with WWF in China, Apple has helped transition a hefty 320,000 acres of forest toward¬†Forest Stewardship Council certification. And, of course, the company has created Liam, a robot aimed at tearing down old Apple devices so that components can be reused for new Apple devices. Liam has so far been put to work on using the aluminum enclosures from the iPhone 6 to create Mac Mini computers. And in terms of helping its own customers to pursue a healthy lifestyle, hopefully Apple‚Äôs latest Apple Watch challenge will be enough to get you outside for at least 30 minutes.
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > 6 awesome web browsers for iPhone 6 awesome web browsers for iPhone By Brandon Widder ‚Äî April 22, 2017 6:00 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital¬†Trends Get today's popular Digital¬†Trends articles in your inbox: If you‚Äôre like most of us at Digital Trends, the prospect of surfing the web on a cell phone never seemed tangible until iPhone entered the market in 2007. Sure, we all knew the LG Prada, Windows Mobile phones, and old Blackberries were¬†capable¬†of browsing the web, but none one of them popularized mobile browsers to the degree the iPhone would several years later. Older mobile browsers loaded pages and images at a glacial pace by today‚Äôs standards, drastically lagging behind Safari and other popular offerings from key developers like Google, Mobotap, and Opera. What could have been a convenient way to peruse the web on the go was, more often than not, simply more trouble than it was worth. Then came the iPhone. Safari, Apple‚Äôs proprietary web browser, sported a streamlined interface, remarkable speed, and a toolset worthy of competing with even the most industrious desktop browsers on the market, but it‚Äôs no longer the only available option. Everyone from the aforementioned Google to Ghostery¬†now touts an exclusive mobile app, bringing tabbed and private browsing, cross-platform syncing, and the utmost simplicity to the forefront of mobile web browsing. Now, it‚Äôs only a question of personal taste. Here are our top picks for the best web browsers for the iPhone, so you can make the most of the web wherever you have a network connection. Chrome Chrome is Google‚Äôs answer to Safari, a heavy-handed counterpart offering a slew of valuable tools and reveling in a deep-seeded integration with the Google ecosystem. Once properly synced, Chrome grants you access to nearly all data associated with your account, including passwords, search history, bookmarks, open tabs and the like. It‚Äôs exceptionally quick, offering an address bar that conveniently doubles as a search box while touting the ability to swap between an infinite number of tabs or privately browse the web using the software‚Äôs built-in Incognito tab. Chrome even takes a well-executed shot at Apple‚Äôs personal assistant with Chrome voice search, allowing you to enter search inquiries with your voice, even when using an older iPhone that doesn‚Äôt support Siri. The app‚Äôs interface is minimalist and simple, taking a direct cue from its desktop brethren and encasing a slew of functionality inside Chrome‚Äôs default, gray exterior. Like any mobile browser, an excess number of tabs can make navigation difficult on a small screen, but browsing is still done in such a way that it never feels burdensome ‚Äì especially considering the app showcases your top sites whenever you choose to open a new tab. Best for: Those¬†already heavily immersed in the Google ecosystem. Download now for: iOS Ghostery Ghostery is the perfect mobile browser for anyone¬†that doesn‚Äôt want advertising companies to know, or see, what they‚Äôre doing online. You¬†can even allow the browser to catalog which trackers you encounter and the sites they appear on because the main goal of this browser is to maintain your privacy and anonymity. Cookies can also be completely disabled from the iPhone‚Äôs Settings. The browser gives users a list of trackers to enable or disable for whatever site they‚Äôre visiting ‚Äî complete with a red-numbered notification in the bottom-right corner ‚Äî and there are none of the usual search engine options (i.e.¬†Google, Yahoo, Bing). Instead, there‚Äôs ‚ÄòGhostery,‚Äô which is powered by DuckDuckGo. Ghostery isn‚Äôt as fast as other mobile browsers on this list, so if you really want to keep your browsing history safe, be prepared to sacrifice a bit of speed for it. The design isn‚Äôt particularly¬†pleasing either, though¬†the privacy and anonymity features do set it aside from other browsers. Ghostery also¬†has a feature that lets people protect their Wi-Fi connection from advertisers, which can then be used to block trackers in other apps, provided you‚Äôre still using the same internet connection. The feature is in the experimental stage, meaning you might run into some problems while using it, and using it in combination with the Safari browser will likely lead to some performance issues. If you‚Äôre really serious about protecting yourself online, though, that may not be a huge issue. Best for: Those who prefer privacy over speed and design. Download now for: iOS Opera Mini Web Browser Opera Mini began as a simple pilot project in 2004,¬†derived from the king of open-source desktop browsers and built from the ground up to fetch all web content through a proxy server. Being the case, the mobile browser is one of the fastest ‚Äî if not¬†the¬†fastest ‚Äî pieces of software on our roundup, quickly compressing data by up to 90 percent before downloading and displaying webpages and similar content on even the most crowded of networks. It‚Äôs lightweight and designed to run on limited bandwidth, so it doesn‚Äôt offer the myriad of standard features that rivals bake in. Although options are limited, bookmarks and top sites can still be synced between the mobile and desktop versions of the software, and various multimedia content can be saved by simply tapping and holding said image, link, text or another content type on the screen. The equipped interface, dark and adorned with larger icons than are typically present in mobile browsers, is also a nice touch, allowing you to easily navigate between tabbed webpages and the dashboard tray at a moment‚Äôs notice. If desired, you can view webpages in a welcoming full-screen mode or take a glance at various data usage statistics highlighting the amount of data used in the current session or during the entirety of the app‚Äôs lifespan on your phone. And then there‚Äôs the informative Help menu outlining each component of the app. Best for:¬†Those who seek speed and an easy-to-navigate interface. Download now for: iOS Dolphin Browser Mobotap‚Äôs mobile browser could be¬†the most remarkable browser on our list based on the name alone, but it doesn‚Äôt stop there. Though it sports a somewhat high learning curve, it‚Äôs an incredibly stable browser, one coupled with a girth of valuable features and intrinsically rooted in social networking like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Once synced with the appropriate accounts, you can share content across social networks with a single click, or save the content directly to their Evernote or Box account. Additional options for altering the homepage‚Äôs background image, adjusting the font size, and initiating full-screen mode are also present, as is the opportunity to privately browse the web and block unwanted ads and various pop-up content. Despite the mobile browser‚Äôs stark contrasts with Safari, it‚Äôs just as fast in terms of speed and boasts syncing capabilities for saving your history, passwords, bookmarks, and other data across mobile and desktop accounts. Although more of a novelty than a crucial function, Dolphin incorporates a Pictionary-esque gesture navigation, encouraging you to draw a swath of recognizable symbols that will, in turn, initiate various actions. For instance, scribbling the letter ‚ÄúN‚Äô on the dedicated input screen will automatically open a new tab, while drawing the letter ‚ÄúT‚Äù will direct the current tab to the main Twitter homepage. It‚Äôs not the most useful action, but it is inventive and surprisingly accurate. Dolphin also supports voice search thanks to¬†its¬†Dolphin Sonar feature, but users will have to pay $0.99 first before they can use it. Best for: Those¬†who desire greater customization and novelty navigation. Download now for: iOS Firefox Before Chrome took over our desktops, Mozilla Firefox was the go-to web browser if you wanted something more powerful than Internet Explorer. Firefox for iOS has all the features that other similar web browsers have, such as sign-in to sync settings, history, bookmarks, and passwords. Firefox‚Äôs private browsing mode prevents the browser from remembering your browsing history, and it will also allow you to delete any and all saved information with one tap. If you dig a little deeper into the settings, you will see why you may prefer Firefox to other mobile browsers. For example, Firefox will let you choose whether or not you want to allow it to work with a third-party keyboard. Some third-party keyboards can transmit things that you type back to the developer, so it is good to have¬†an option for this setting. Another very important privacy-related setting is the integration of Touch ID & Passcodes. An example of when this might be useful is if someone else has access to your smartphone. In Chrome, for instance, someone can borrow your smartphone and access the saved passwords section by going to the settings. In Firefox, you can turn on Touch ID & Passcodes, and when you want access to saved log-ins, Firefox will ask you for a passcode or fingerprint. We believe all mobile browsers should have this feature. Best for: Those who share their smartphone with others. Download now for: iOS Safari It‚Äôs also the fastest web browser on our list thanks to its exclusive JavaScript engine while remaining feature-laden enough to compete with the best. Moreover, Safari offers voice search capabilities similar to Chrome, but being the software is an Apple product, it relies on voice assistance through Siri. The coupled iCloud Keychain is also a standout, saving and automatically inputting account names, passwords, and credit card numbers whenever you need to sign into a site or shop online, as is the ability to save images to the photo album by pressing said content for several seconds. Other features abound, but it‚Äôs the built-in convenience and Safari‚Äôs innate ease of use making it one of our top five picks. Best for: Those¬†seeking merely the bare minimum. This article was originally published on 1-17-2014 by Brandon Widder, and last updated by Carlos Vega on 4-18-2017 to include Firefox. Kyree Leary also contributed to this article.

It‚Äôs something that I‚Äôve been talking about on the Apple Core podcast for some time. When they originally came out I expressed that I didn‚Äôt care for them whatsoever. Several months later, and several delays later the hype got to me. Something clicked. I‚Äôm not sure what it was but here I am, right? I am now writing a review for the AirPods, something I wrote off as soon as they came out. So let‚Äôs start with why I bought them in the first place. Well, to be fair, I got them because it was an Apple product and it‚Äôs my job to review these things. Admittedly, I had some interest in them. In terms of sound quality, I set the bar super low. While I didn‚Äôt write a review specifically for them, I absolutely hated the EarPods (both the 3.5mm and Lightning kind). Everything from the sound signature down to the fact that the cable kept forcing them out of my ear. For the last several years, I‚Äôve given up on the EarPods as a whole. I‚Äôve been using over-ear headphones ranging from the worst of the worst (the Audio-Technica ATH-M50), to some of my favorites (the Oppo PM-3). Again, here I am, writing an AirPods review. I also wrote an initial impressions of the AirPods a few weeks ago. Sound Quality If you‚Äôre looking to purchase AirPods to be blown away by sound quality, these are not for you. They‚Äôre bass heavy and that bass extension bleeds into the mids quite a bit. Treble is better than the EarPods, but they‚Äôre a bit recessed. For music, I‚Äôd highly recommend looking elsewhere. Though, Bluetooth and sound quality never mix. Personally, I would never use the AirPods intentionally for music, but they‚Äôll get you by in a pinch. Point blank, don‚Äôt expect these to replace your high-end audio equipment anytime soon. For low-bitrate audio such as phone calls, audiobooks, podcasts, and things of that nature, AirPods are amazing. Don‚Äôt even bother trying to EQ these because it‚Äôs not worth it, seriously. AirPods are decent at any genre that has tons of bass and is dominated by bass. But try anything else, the bass will feel overpowering and overwhelming to most who care about sound quality. The other issue is that with tracks with little to no low end, the AirPods will sound abnormally tinny to the trained ear and the treble will then overtake the mid-range. It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve actually tried EarPods, but AirPods aren‚Äôt terrible. Obviously, sound will vary greatly depending on how well they fit in your ear. Soundstage is similar to the ATH-M50s in the sense that everything sounds very boxed in and lacks any sort of instrument separation whatsoever, though that‚Äôs expected from a set of earbuds with no real seal. Function The AirPods are amazing functionality wise. Everything from taking out one ear and having your audio automatically pause, to them automatically pairing when you put them in your ears. They‚Äôre awesome. The problem here is that they‚Äôre not 100% reliable. I‚Äôd say that these functions work 95% of the time, which may be good enough for most. When you take one out of your ear, there‚Äôs a noticeable half-second delay, and it sometimes doesn‚Äôt pair automatically when you take them out of the case and put them in your ear. It‚Äôs obvious that AirPods were built around the iPhone. When you open the lid, a card shows up on your iPhone telling you the battery life of the case and your AirPods. If you have one earbud in, it‚Äôll show you the battery life of each individual AirPod. This automatic card is only available on the iPhone, and not on the iPad, (maybe the iPod touch, but who owns one of those?). On the Apple Watch, you can pull up Control Center, tap the battery icon, and it‚Äôll show you the same information, but that‚Äôs not automatic. On the Mac is where it‚Äôs clear that AirPods weren‚Äôt designed for the platform. To view battery life on the Mac, you have to tap into the Sound menu bar icon and you see a battery indicator without the percentage. And lastly, on the Apple TV. While being a counterpart to iOS, tvOS doesn‚Äôt automatically pair like the rest of your devices. You have to go into Settings > Remotes and Devices > Bluetooth to pair these. Not the greatest. It‚Äôs also the only Apple platform that doesn‚Äôt have easy access to AirPods. On iOS and the Apple Watch, you can swipe up on Control Center, get to the media controls/AirPlay button and pair from there. On the Mac, you can go to the Sound menu bar icon and pair there, on tvOS you have to dig into Settings to do so. Unfortunately, I‚Äôve found battery life indication to be extremely unreliable. It‚Äôs not that the percentages it gives out is inaccurate, that‚Äôs not the issue. The issue is trying to get the interface to show up at all. On the iPhone and iPad you can view the battery indicator in the Battery widget in iOS 10. However, I‚Äôve found that it isn‚Äôt always there. Ideally, it‚Äôs supposed to show up if it‚Äôs paired to the device, but that‚Äôs not always the case. Most of the time, I have to put them back in its case and take them out a second time in order for it to show up. Same goes for the Apple Watch. The case that the AirPods come in are pretty great as well. It‚Äôs always charging the AirPods while in the case, and the case gives up to 24 hours of additional battery life for the AirPods. Remember, ‚Äúup to.‚Äù In my personal experience, I‚Äôve gotten around 15-20 hours of additional battery life which is fine. I have to charge the case every 2-3 days. Albeit, feels like the case takes forever to charge in comparison to the AirPods. The AirPods can charge from dead to 60% in about 15 minutes, that‚Äôs pretty awesome. But the case? It takes around 2-3 hours to fully charge and unless you‚Äôre charging the case overnight, this could feel like forever. Speaking of charging, it‚Äôs flat out annoying that the AirPods shipped with a Lightning to USB-A cable. Apple claims that USB-C is the future yet no Apple mobile device has shipped with a proper Lightning to USB-C cable in the box. Apple‚Äôs claim of 5 hours of battery life is pretty accurate as well. I‚Äôve gotten anywhere between 4-4.5 hours which is right on the ball with Apple‚Äôs estimate. The microphones that are built into the AirPods are on a whole other level in terms of microphones on mobile devices. I was walking down a busy Seattle street the other day with tons of people walking by and engine-based cars stuck in traffic, yet, the person on the other end of the phone call could hear me just fine. That‚Äôs impressive. Using the microphones for Siri also works surprisingly well when Siri wants to work. And that brings me to my final point, the double tap gesture for Siri is awful. Maybe I‚Äôm not doing it right, but I‚Äôve found that the gesture works about 40% of the time. I‚Äôll keep it on versus changing it to Play/Pause (own an Apple Watch) or having it do flat out nothing. I originally thought, ‚ÄúWhy not map out the gestures from the EarPods to the AirPods?‚Äù I now understand Apple‚Äôs decision. The gesture simply doesn‚Äôt work reliably enough to add any additional gesture. However, requiring an internet connection to do simple things such as adjusting the volume, is flat out insane. How well do they stay in the ear? For whatever reason this is the most asked question when people see me with AirPods. This isn‚Äôt an easy question to answer as everyone has different ear shapes. But for me, EarPods fit just fine and AirPods are the same. If anything the AirPods stay better in my ears due to the lack of wire. Initially, I was paranoid about them falling out of my ear and I kept pushing them back in every time I felt like they‚Äôd fall out of my ear. Though, that‚Äôs starting to slowly fade as I get more comfortable with them. I have yet to have them fall out of my ear at all. Conclusion While it may seem like I absolutely hate the AirPods, they‚Äôre by far my favorite Apple product of the year. They work reliably enough that it‚Äôs not super annoying. Sound quality will be adequate for any non-audiophile person. I‚Äôll primarily use the AirPods for podcasts, audiobooks, phone calls, movies, and other non-music audio. While pairing with Apple TV is supper annoying, I primarily use it there because the Siri remote is able to adjust the volume of my AirPods. While it won‚Äôt be replacing my audiophile grade headphones, it‚Äôll now have a place in my pocket on me at all times for when I need them. If you‚Äôre looking for a set of wireless Bluetooth earbuds, AirPods are the only ones I can recommend. While no promises can be made about Apple improving its software quality anytime soon, AirPods and the experience you get from them (that‚Äôs mostly due to the Apple designed W1 chip) cannot be matched. In the end, it‚Äôs silly to disregard sound quality in a set of headphones, especially from an audiophile. However, functionality wise, AirPods set a high bar for wireless headphones and is a truly innovative headphone, even though sound quality isn‚Äôt there yet.

So here‚Äôs my review: they sound the exact same (if not worse) than the $25 earpods. Is it worth $150 extra for a cool battery widget? jleetj What‚Äôs the point of having an audiophile‚Äôs perspective if sound quality is going to be ignored? All that was discussed in the review has already been mentioned in other reviews by non-audiophiles. s fr Ghey. Just say they suck and get it over with. blueghost211 ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been using over-ear headphones ranging from the worst of the worst (the Audio-Technica ATH-M50)‚Äù Here is where I stopped reading. Lol Dr. Soham Patel The AirPods are amazing. Connect automatically with iphone when you open the case. Bass is more than wired earpods. But less than other in-ear earphones like bose, beats. Microphone is good, accurate and in both AirPods. Battery life is good as mentioned by apple. The biggest myth is that about falling of AirPods. It actually DOES NOT FALL ON WALKING, RUNNING, JUMPING. Do not trust the other website reviews about falling of AirPods. Fit is really good, you will not feel that wearing any device in ear. They are lightweight. Built is good. Double tap mechanism work nicely. You can use double tap to activate siri or play/pause. I feel that this is the only wireless earphones in market which PROVIDES GOOD MUSIC WITH BASS WITHOUT DAMAGING YOUR EAR. The other in-ear earphones available in market which can gives good bass but damages your inner ear in longer times. Only one disadvantage-You have to use siri for volume control and change the song. (You can use apple watch crown or iphone for volume.)

This includes the LG UltraFine 4K & 5K displays. The discounts were done to help ease customers into the transition to USB-C. Apple‚Äôs discounts end at the end of March, which means today, March 31, is the last day customers are able to take advantage of the offers before prices go back up. Today is the last day to purchase the UltraFine displays which are up to 25 percent off, giving customers a deep discount, especially on the 5K display. The 5K display costs $1,299.95 normally but has been discounted down to $974. Non-Apple endorsed USB-C accessories are also discounted, which includes hard drives, cables, adapters, and more. The deal was originally set to expire on December 31, 2016 but was extended until March 31, 2017 after extensive delays on the LG UltraFine 5K Display. Apple could potentially extend the sale again but it‚Äôs best to make your USB-C purchases today as it‚Äôs unclear if Apple will ever make the sale again.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile ¬´ Apple may be Backing Boeing's Low-Earth Satellite Constellation Project that would Compete with Google, SpaceX & Others | Main April 22, 2017 Apple Patents and Groundwork on an Autonomous Vehicle Platform Continues with Road Testing in California ¬† In September 2016 Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Refocuses Project Titan towards Advanced System Software and away from a Dreamy iCar." A secondary report was posted in October titled "Apple's Canadian Office is Focused on Developing carOS." We noted in the report at the time that Apple had established a presence in Ottawa, Canada which has a major presence in the automotive software sector. Kanata Research Park is already home to BlackBerry's automotive division, QNX Software Systems, which recently unveiled a slate of new software for the rapidly evolving driverless car market. Many of Apple's engineers working in Canada were hired over the past year and about two dozen came from BlackBerry's QNX, a leading automotive software provider. Then in March of this year one of our granted patent reports noted that Apple had won a Project Titan patent for driver situationaly awareness alerts and controlling components of a vehicle. ¬† Another granted patent Apple has on record relates to vehicle collisions. In Apple's patent figure 8 below we're able to see vehicle #810 that has collided with vehicle #820. Based on the physical bump condition, the wireless sensors are configured to transfer information associated with the collision. ¬† ¬† More specifically the information may indicate one or more of: the time of the collusion, identification information for vehicles that experienced the bump condition, identification information for vehicles that were nearby when the bump condition occurred, the location of the vehicles at the time the bump condition occurred (e.g., as ascertained using GPS units associated with the vehicles) and so on. ¬† Flashing forward to April 14 Patently Apple posted a repor titled "California DMV Lists Apple as one of 30 Permitted to Conduct Autonomous Car Road Tests." ¬† That same day Bloomberg posted a more detailed report titled "Apple Said to Near Road Tests of Self-Driving Car Software," which pointed out extra facts on the matter. ¬† Yesterday Business Insider posted a report that showed some documentation related to autonomous driver testing. Below is one of the graphics presented in their report. ¬† It's difficult to verify if this is a generic test, because the placement of "Apple" in the title appears to have been added as it's not spaced correctly. Either way it gives us a glimpe into some of the testing that the California Department of Motor Vehicles may require each company involved in the program to pass. ¬† For those who want to delve into more about the testing, workshops and more on autonomous vehicle in California, check out some of the links provided below: ¬† One) Video: DMV Workshop on Autonomous Vehicles ¬† Two) California Department of Motor Vehicles Summary of Draft Autonomous Vehicles Deployment Regulations December 16, 2015 Three) Express Terms ‚Äì Autonomous Vehicles Four) Proposed Driverless Testing and Deployment Regulations ‚Äì Released March 10, 2017 Five ) Autonomous Vehicle Disengagement Reports 2016 ¬† Yesterday's revelations by Business Insider's series of DMV's testing graphics illustrated some of the basics that likely all car automated cars like Tesla's have to pass before they get the green light to use an automated vehicle platform in California. Apple's patents have shown us that they're miles ahead in situational alerts and collision reports and so forth. We've likely only seen the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the intellectual property that Apple is now amassing to protect their future CarOS platform (or whatever they officially brand it) and it will be exciting to see more pieces of the 'Project Titan' puzzle as they become public. ¬† About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

(Alamy Image) Keating made headlines in 2015 after revealing the depths of his science experiment to better understand his own tumour. Apple has hired Steven Keating, the doctoral student from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who made a 3D printout of his own brain after he was diagnosed with a tumour, a media report said. According to a report in CNBC on Friday, it is still not known whether Keating is working on one of Apple's teams dedicated to health care or he has joined another team that can take advantage of his expertise in mechanical engineering. Keating made headlines in 2015 after revealing the depths of his science experiment to better understand his own tumour. Keating told Vox that he collected 75 GB of his health information. Keating on Friday addressed audience Sage at Bionetworks' annual conference "Assembly" held in Seattle as an Apple employee. He spoke about the challenges for patients to aggregate their own medical data. Keating said he ended up going to medical school at least in part so he could study his own tissue, the report added. Apple recently acquired a personal health data startup called Gliimpse which is designed to help people aggregate their medical information. Sage Bionetworks, a non-profit research organisation, has been a major proponent of Apple's ResearchKit software, which is designed to make it easier for medical researchers to launch mobile-based studies. A secret team of biomedical engineers at Apple is also working on an initiative to develop sensors that can non-invasively and continuously monitor blood sugar levels to better treat diabetes. If such sensors are successfully developed, that would be a breakthrough as it is highly challenging to track glucose levels accurately without piercing the skin. It can help millions of people turn devices like Apple Watch into a must-have. Share More > Vote MORE FROM International Americas In this city, prisoners are given jobs after...

Airing as part of Gruber‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Talk Show‚Äù podcast, the interview discussed a variety of environmental topics, especially relating to Apple‚Äôs own efforts‚Ä¶ Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case In the interview, Jackson and Gruber talked about the overall effects of climate change, as well as Apple‚Äôs efforts to combat it. Jackson spoke on Apple‚Äôs new goal of creating a closed loop supply chain and to stop mining from the earth all together, producing all of its products from recycled materials. Jackson also offered some interesting data relating to Apple‚Äôs carbon footprint. She explained that Apple‚Äôs carbon footprint during 2016 was 29.5 million metric tons. This includes a wide array of things, such as¬†mining, product transportation, and packaging. Apple also factors in the electricity that its customers use when calculating its carbon footprint. The Apple executive explained that manufacturing has the largest impact on carbon footprint at the moment, but that Apple is working to change that by working one-on-one with manufacturers. In the past year, 3 new suppliers have committed to transforming to 100 percent renewable energy. This makes for a total of seven Apple suppliers on the path towards 100 percent renewable energy, something Jackson thinks Apple has greatly impacted with its efforts. Even though¬†we don‚Äôt own mines or have a relationship with mining companies, we estimate the extraction and processing of the alumina, all the way through a product use. We actually include in our carbon footprint the electricity that you use as an Apple customer, because you wouldn‚Äôt use that electricity if it wasn‚Äôt for Apple. All the way through recycling. Apple has been celebrating Earth Day all week. The company released its 2017 Environment Responsibility Report, announcing its lofty promise to stop mining the earth and build all of its products from recycled materials. Apple also released a series of comical Earth Day videos, which Jackson talked some about during her interview with Gruber. The full sit-down interview between Jackson and Gruber is available to listen to here. It‚Äôs a pretty fascinating¬†discussion and one to definitely check out.

Blue Sky Innovation Technology The life of an Apple supplier is getting even tougher iPhone 7 Plus Chris Ratcliffe / Bloomberg A customer inspects a new iPhone 7 plus smartphone inside the Apple Covent Garden store in London on Sept. 16, 2016. A customer inspects a new iPhone 7 plus smartphone inside the Apple Covent Garden store in London on Sept. 16, 2016. (Chris Ratcliffe / Bloomberg) Alex Webb and Ian KingBloomberg Imagination Technologies Group discovered how fickle life can be as an Apple supplier when it was ditched this month by the iPhone maker. More suppliers may suffer the same fate as the world's largest technology company faces a shrinking number of semiconductor makers and expands into areas that need special chips designed in-house. Dialog Semiconductor, Synaptics and Cirrus Logic are particularly vulnerable to Apple's supply chain whims and demands, according to analysts. One component supplier, Avnet Inc., stopped working with Apple because the relationship was squeezing its profit margins too much. Apple has developed its own processors for years, but has stepped up in-house design of components, including graphics, Bluetooth and other smartphone-related chips, in recent years. That's expensive, and creates new risks, but it helps the company maintain leverage over suppliers as a recent wave of acquisitions cut the number of chipmakers it works with. To secure cheaper prices, Apple likes to have at least two suppliers for any given component. But last year alone, one in five U.S. chipmakers were acquired, according to Susquehanna Financial Group. Key Apple suppliers SanDisk Corp., Broadcom, TriQuint Semiconductor, Intersil Corp., Sharp Corp., Elpida Memory Inc., RF Micro Devices Inc. and Fairchild Semiconductor International have all been snapped up since 2013. Loop Capital Markets analyst Betsy Van Hees, has seen 35 chip companies swallowed since 2014. "You have less competition, less pricing pressure," she said. "Which may be why Apple is going more internally than externally." In the past, it was easier for Apple to squeeze outside suppliers to improve profit margins, she added. This year is particularly important for Apple because it's preparing to launch three iPhones, including a flagship device with a major new design. The installation of new manufacturing lines and processes is costly, so Apple needs to find savings elsewhere. "To avoid taking a hit you put some pressure" on the suppliers, BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis said. Cost isn't the only incentive for Apple to develop its own components. It also helps the company couple its hardware more seamlessly with its software, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri explained at a Feb. 14 conference in San Francisco. "We have better control over timing, over cost, over quality," he said. Apple readies iPhone overhaul for smartphone's 10th anniversary Mark Gurman and Min Jeong Lee Ten years after Steve Jobs held up the original iPhone to a gushing San Francisco crowd, Apple Inc. is planning its most extensive iPhone lineup to date. Apple is preparing three iPhones for launch as soon as this fall, including upgraded versions of the current two iPhone models and a new top-of-the-line... Ten years after Steve Jobs held up the original iPhone to a gushing San Francisco crowd, Apple Inc. is planning its most extensive iPhone lineup to date. Apple is preparing three iPhones for launch as soon as this fall, including upgraded versions of the current two iPhone models and a new top-of-the-line... (Mark Gurman and Min Jeong Lee) Expansion into new markets and products may also require hardware unique to Apple's needs that isn't immediately available from outside suppliers. The AirPods Bluetooth headphones, released last year, use low-energy communications chips that Apple got through its purchase of Passif Semiconductor Corp. in 2013. In 2012, Apple spent $356 million acquiring AuthenTec Inc., which had fingerprint sensors and related chipsets that helped build the fingerprint scanner on the iPhone. Apple was in acquisition talks last year with Imagination Technologies. The Kings Langley, England-based company designs a type of chip called a graphics processing unit that's used in iPhones and iPads, and analysts theorized Apple wanted to take the technology in house and push it forward on its own terms. Apple decided against making an offer. Then, on April 3, Imagination said Apple would stop using its graphics technology after developing its own solutions. Apple also hired several employees from Imagination, including former Chief Operating Officer John Metcalfe. The British company lost about two-thirds of its market value that day. On Wednesday, UBS estimated Apple will pay Imagination one-third of its current royalty rate as their relationship winds down over the next two years. That prompted analysts and investors to cast a keener eye over what other suppliers may be next. One immediate example was Dialog, which slumped 20 percent April 11 after Bankhaus Lampe analyst Karsten Iltgen suggested Apple may cease using Dialog's power-management chips. Apple is setting up power-management design centers in Munich and California, Iltgen noted, and there's been a steady flow of engineers from Dialog to Apple over the past year. Synaptics Inc., whose products help control the iPhone's touch screen, could also be vulnerable, Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh wrote in an April 12 note. Apple has hired "a significant number" of engineers from the company, suggesting that it's working on products that would render Synaptics redundant, Vinh said. Vinh also highlighted Cirrus Logic, which makes audio chips used in iPhones, even as he deemed the risk of Apple developing its own competing components "medium to low." Hiring in-house experts doesn't come cheap (Cirrus spends $200 million a year on research, Vinh noted). In the past five years, Apple doubled research and development spending as a percentage of revenue, an increase CFO Maestri attributed to new product categories and developing more of its own underlying technology, among other factors. Semiconductor research is among the most expensive in the technology industry, often exceeding 18 percent of revenue. Apple spends 4.7 percent of its income on R&D, up from 2.2 percent in 2012. The pay-off from the investment could be substantial. Semiconductors account for about a third of iPhone manufacturing costs, according to Timothy Arcuri, a Cowen & Co. analyst. Tapering growth of smartphone sales has meanwhile heightened the need to squeeze every last dollar of profit out of the handsets that Apple does sell. The main risk is that Apple misses new technology trends that bubble up through a large supply chain. Relying more on internally created components, it'll have fewer suppliers lining up to show it the latest innovations. When Nokia was the world's largest mobile phone maker, it focused more on cost cutting and controlling component supply and missed out on important changes in the market, according to Mike Walkley, an Apple analyst at Canaccord Genuity. "You've seen what they've done to Imagination and Dialog Semi and all of these people who supply to Apple," he said. "It's kind of what Nokia did back in the day when they were king of the world." An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Then there's the risk that some partners decide they don't want to deal with Apple anymore. Bill Amelio, former chief executive officer of Lenovo Group Ltd. who now runs Avnet, said he walked away from supplying Apple and it's helped improve earnings. The Phoenix, Arizona-based distributor of chips and other computer components had a gross profit margin of 13.7 percent in its most recent quarter.

The grand marshal for this year's Apple Festival will be long-time festival supporter and local businessman Terry Osborne, Sr. who is the owner of the Osborne Equipment Company in Jackson. During the festival, he will have the honor of crowning the royalty and having a place of honor in the parades. Also, the official theme for the 2017 Jackson Apple Festival will be "Apple Blooms and Harvest Moons." The theme was submitted by Jackson area resident Laura Rose Armstrong, who won $100 as part of an annual contest. The announcements of the grand marshal and theme were made at both the Little Queens and Queens contests held last Friday and Saturday evenings, April 14 and 15, respectively at the Jackson Middle School auditorium. In announcing Osborne's selection, Festival President Joe Wyant credited Osborne with being a loyal and major supporter of the Apple Festival throughout the years. Meanwhile, Theme Contest Chairman Butch Aldrich explained that Armstrong's winning theme was selected by a committee composed of representatives from local PTO organizations. The theme will guide decorations for festival floats, booths and windows.

Here are some workarounds. Phones by Rick Broida April 18, 2017 10:30 AM PDT @cheapskateblog For all the changes and improvements (some might say "improvements") iOS has delivered over the years, there's one curious limitation still imposed by Apple. If you want to email someone more than five photos, you can't. That's a pretty big hassle when you're looking to share a big batch of snapshots from a vacation, wedding, day at the beach or other photo-worthy occasion. Even more curious, Apple eliminated this restriction in iOS 9, then brought it back in iOS 10! You might think your only option is to send multiple five-photo emails -- a hassle at best -- but there are other, easier ways to work around this limitation. Copy and paste Normally, the email-photos process goes like this: fire up the Photos app, select from one to five pictures, tap the Share icon and then tap Mail. However, if you select more than five photos, you'll no longer see Mail in the menu that appears. (Weirdly, Message is still there -- iOS doesn't impose this five-photo limitation for text messages.) Enlarge Image iOS 10 won't let you email more than five photos at a time, but you can tap Copy, then paste as many photos as you like into the body of an email. Screenshot by Rick Broida/CNET Solution? Tap Copy instead. Now head to the Mail app, compose a new message, then paste the contents of the clipboard (i.e., your photos) into the body. (For those unfamiliar with pasting, you first put your cursor into the body of the email, then do a long tap on that cursor until a pop-up menu appears. Tap Paste and you're done!) The downside to this method is that the recipient may get an email with all your photos embedded in the message rather than attached as files, which can make them more challenging to extract/save. (It depends on the recipient's mail client.) Use AirDrop Enlarge Image AirDrop is a great option for "emailing" photos to other iOS users, as long as they're in close proximity. Apple Apple's often-overlooked file-sharing tool works well for sharing photos, but there are a couple caveats. First, you have to be in physical proximity to the recipient(s) -- this isn't a long-distance solution. But that's fine when you're with a group and everyone says, "Hey, send me those photos!" Second, AirDrop works only with other iOS users; you'll have to find another method of sharing with your Android friends. Assuming you've met those requirements, you also need to make sure both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are enabled on all devices involved in the transaction. For complete instructions, here's how to share your iPhone photos with AirDrop. It's worth noting that Apple's iCloud Photo Sharing option can also be used to share photos with other iDevice users, but it's not quite the same thing as sending photos. Rather, it's a shared album, which may be fine for your purposes. I find the whole setup a little clunky. Use an app Apple may not want you to email more than five photos at once, but plenty of third-party apps have no problem with it. Granted, in most cases you'll be sending a link rather than the actual photos, but that can actually work out better for the recipient(s): no mammoth email to download. If you're already using a cloud-storage app like Dropbox or OneDrive, that's your best bet for sharing large batches of photos. (Curiously, the Google Drive app for iOS offers no way to share a batch of photos.) Assuming the photos in question have already been uploaded (or backed up, if you use the service for that purpose), just select the ones you want to send, then use the app's "share" option. This will generate a link that you can email to one or more recipients. Once received, clicking or tapping that link produces a web page where the photos can be viewed and downloaded. Enlarge Image Free app Send Anywhere makes it easy to share large batches of photos. Select them, then tap the three dots and choose Share Link. Screenshot by Rick Broida/CNET You don't need a cloud-storage app to share this way, though. Send Anywhere for iOS is an example of a file-sharing app that uploads selected photos to temporary storage, then generates a link you can send to others. One key difference: accessing that link immediately downloads the photos; there's no preview option. To use it, just tap your finger and drag it to select all the photos you want to share. Then, in the "selected" bar near the bottom, tap the three dots to access the action menu, then tap Share Link. That'll lead you to the iOS Share menu, where you can tap Mail. The newly created message will include the Send Anywhere link; now you just need to specify the recipient(s) and send it. Again, this is just one example. If you've found another app that makes batch photo-sharing easy, by all means name it in the comments.

Apple has hired Steven Keating, the doctoral student from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who made a 3D printout of his own brain after he was diagnosed with a tumour, a media report said. According to a report in CNBC on Friday, it is still not known whether Mr. Keating is working on one of Apple‚Äôs teams dedicated to health care or he has joined another team that can take advantage of his expertise in mechanical engineering. He made headlines in 2015 after revealing the depths of his science experiment to better understand his own tumour. ‚ÄòPatiently‚Äô bearing them Mr. Keating told Vox that he collected 75 GB of his health information. On Friday, he addressed the audience at Sage Bionetworks‚Äô annual conference ‚ÄúAssembly‚Äù held in Seattle as an Apple employee. He spoke about the challenges for patients to aggregate their own medical data. Mr. Keating said he ended up going to medical school at least in part so he could study his own tissue, the report added. Apple recently acquired a personal health data startup called Gliimpse, which is designed to help people aggregate their medical information. Sage Bionetworks, a non-profit research organisation, has been a major proponent of Apple‚Äôs ResearchKit software, which is designed to make it easier for medical researchers to launch mobile-based studies. Non-invasive sugar monitoring! A secret team of biomedical engineers at Apple is also working on an initiative to develop sensors that can non-invasively and continuously monitor blood sugar levels to better treat diabetes. If such sensors are successfully developed, that would be a breakthrough as it is highly challenging to track glucose levels accurately without piercing the skin. It can help millions of people turn devices like Apple Watch into a must-have.

Nexus 5X boasts with one of the biggest fan-bases in the smartphone community. The reason why Nexus 5X has managed to gather such a large following is because Google is the company that‚Äôs directly in charge of it while LG has made sure that its equipped with the best hardware parts. The smartphone is popular that many people believe it as being capable of replacing tablets as a result of its rather large 5.2 inch display. With that being said, we can‚Äôt stop ourselves from comparing Nexus 5X with one of the most powerful tablets ever made, iPad Pro. Last year Apple has introduced the iPad Pro lineup and customers have been left in awe. Apple‚Äôs device obviously runs on iOS and it‚Äôs known for being so powerful that it can easily replace laptops. Display Nexus 5X ships with a 5.2 inch IPS LCD panel that‚Äôs considerably large in comparison with normal smartphones. This is why Nexus 5X is able of completing tasks similar to what tablets do. Nexus 5X‚Äôs display features a full HD (1080 x 1920) pixel resolution and a pixel density of 423. On the other hand, we have Apple‚Äôs iPad Pro that‚Äôs been fitted with a 9.7 inch display on the entry-level size model. The display uses LED-Backlit IPS LCD and TrueTone technology that‚Äôs capable of offering a high pixel resolution of 1536 x 2048 and a pixel density of 264. Hardware Power Google‚Äôs smartphone impresses us with its Qualcomm hexa-core Snapdragon 808 CPU. The processor has been clocked at 1.8GHz Cortex-A57 and it is also fitted with an Adreno 418 graphics processing unit alongside 2GB of RAM. As previously advertised, iPad Pro is rather powerful. The tablet is fueled by the Apple made A9X dual-core processor which runs at a boosted speed of 2.16GHz Twister. To make things even better, iPad Pro also uses a PowerVR Series 7 (12-core) graphics processing unit and 2GB of RAM. Final Words As it was expected, iPad Pro completely overshadows Nexus 5X‚Äôs hardware performances. However, Nexus 5X surprisingly comes with the same amount of RAM as iPad Pro but this doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs on the same level. All in all, Nexus 5X is a high end smartphone but it‚Äôs not quite up on par with Apple‚Äôs tablet.

Last year Apple launched the highly powerful iPad Pro in hopes of dominating the tablet industry. However, things didn‚Äôt go according to Apple‚Äôs plan since Microsoft has also launched its Surface Pro 4. The latter is a hybrid tablet which makes it fit right in the same category as iPad Pro. This quite an unexpected rivalry since the two devices run on different operating systems However, they do offer similar hardware performances. Many tech fans have been asking themselves which product deserves their money the most, and we‚Äôre going to answer that question right now. The way in which we will be able to tell who‚Äôs tablet is the most powerful is by pinning them against each other in a brief comparison. Without any further ado, let‚Äôs get into it. Operating System Obviously, the operating system is the biggest difference between these two hybrid tablets. Surface Pro 4 ships with Windows 10 out of the box while iPad Pro runs on iOS 9.3 which can be upgraded up to Apple‚Äôs latest operating system available. Both operating systems have their exclusive features and impressive user experiences. However, truth be told not everyone uses iOS devices and iPad Pro fits only in an iOS-ecosystem. Therefore we have to give it to Surface Pro 4 and its Windows 10 integration in this department. Hardware Power Hardware power is what really matters, this department is what makes the difference between great and average devices. Surface Pro 4 is powered by the Core M3, Core i5, i7 processors depending on the acquired variant. In addition, the processors can be coupled with 4GB, 8GB and 16GB of RAM. On the other hand, we have iPad Pro which runs on Apple‚Äôs own dual-core A9X processor on all size variants. iPad Pro can be acquired in only the 2GB and 4GB RAM memory variants. As everyone can see, Surface Pro 4 definitely has the upper hand in this brief comparison. Surface Pro 4 not only features the better operating system but it also comes with more impressive hardware parts. Last but not least, Surface Pro 4 supports a wider range of Smart Cover keyboards and third party accessories Related Tagged as: Apple, ipad pro, Microsoft, Surface Pro 4 Recommended stories you may like: Surface Pro 5 Expected Release Date and Hardware Specs Nexus 5X vs iPad Pro 9.7 inch ‚Äì An Unexpected Rivalry Nexus 7 (2017) Are you Ready for it?

According to a report in CNBC on Friday, it is still not known whether Keating is working on one of Apple's teams dedicated to health care or he has joined another team that can take advantage of his expertise in mechanical engineering. Keating made headlines in 2015 after revealing the depths of his science experiment to better understand his own tumour. Keating told Vox that he collected 75 GB of his health information. Keating on Friday addressed audience Sage at Bionetworks' annual conference "Assembly" held in Seattle as an Apple employee. He spoke about the challenges for patients to aggregate their own medical data. Keating said he ended up going to medical school at least in part so he could study his own tissue, the report added. Apple recently acquired a personal health data startup called Gliimpse which is designed to help people aggregate their medical information. Sage Bionetworks, a non-profit research organisation, has been a major proponent of Apple's ResearchKit software, which is designed to make it easier for medical researchers to launch mobile-based studies. A secret team of biomedical engineers at Apple is also working on an initiative to develop sensors that can non-invasively and continuously monitor blood sugar levels to better treat diabetes. If such sensors are successfully developed, that would be a breakthrough as it is highly challenging to track glucose levels accurately without piercing the skin. It can help millions of people turn devices like Apple Watch into a must-have. --IANS sku/na/bg SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features India sizzles as heat wave grips states Assam soaks in joy, celebrates Bihu No bars on highways Rare April snow, heavy rains cut off Kashmir Dalai Lama's Arunachal visit rattles China, jubilates exiled Buddhists About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital ¬© Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2017.

More like this Finger-pointing: The rumored iPhone 8 delay iPhone 8 rumors: Apple might move Touch ID to the back of the device Amazing about-face: From fanboy to hater in 3 months Video Hands-on with Apple's new video-editing app, Clips Bad news once again for Apple as the phone that they would normally announce next year is coming this year but late this year. It‚Äôs really bad news. Writing for Mic, Susmita Baral says ‚ÄúThis could be the reason the iPhone 8 is delayed ‚Äî and it spells trouble for Apple.‚Äù (Tip o‚Äô the antlers to Daniel Foss.) Apple's much-hyped¬†iPhone 8 is reportedly¬†delayed. ‚ÄúMuch-hyped‚Äù?! By who? Not by Apple, that‚Äôs for sure. Only by pundits who have only a loose understanding of causality and the linear nature of time. Because the iPhone 8 is not ‚Äúdelayed‚Äù. For starters, products without ship dates cannot be ‚Äúdelayed‚Äù. If the Macalope is licking a salt lick and one of the birds that hangs out on his back eating bugs all day says to another, ‚ÄúHey, Gary. When do you think he‚Äôll be done licking that salt lick?‚Äù And Gary says ‚ÄúI dunno, Ken. It‚Äôs pretty big. Maybe June?‚Äù and then it lasts until July, the finishing of the salt lick was not ‚Äúdelayed‚Äù. Gary was just wrong. Again. Not to go too much into the Macalope‚Äôs personal life, but Gary is always doing this, hairback quarterbacking the Macalope. If he weren‚Äôt so good at eating bugs the Macalope would shrug Gary off into the nearest watering hole. Ken‚Äôs OK. But kind of an instigator, you know? According to¬†Forbes‚Ä¶ Oh, well, if someone from the Forbes contributor network and fund-raising carwash so the glee club can go to regionals said it, then monkey trim the Christmas merkin! ‚Ä¶the public sale of the high-end device could be pushed back to the end of November 2017. Apple will, of course, release an iPhone 7s around September as usual. Now, if those were to be announced in November, you might be excused for saying they were ‚Äúdelayed‚Äù since that would be off Apple‚Äôs normal schedule. But the iPhone 8, which would normally come out in the fall of 2018, being called ‚Äúdelayed‚Äù when it would still be announced 10 months ahead of schedule requires some sort of fan-jerking-tastic Jedi pundit trick the Macalope can‚Äôt even comprehend. The reason for the delay appears to be Apple's fingerprint sensor, the¬†Verge¬†noted. There is a delay and there is a reason for this delay. The reason is this thing. And, shockingly, Apple may remove the thing in order to ship next year‚Äôs phone this year. Apple rumors as such beautifully constructed sandcastles of assumption. It‚Äôs a shame they get washed away with each product announcement and we can never go back and reevaluate the logic of constructing such elaborate edifices with such weak material. NO, WE CAN NEVER GO BACK. God forbid it comes in dongle form. Jokes are always funnier the third time.

Apple was granted a permit to test self-driving cars on April 14 by the¬†California Department of Motor Vehicles¬†but the company has never said anything about its plan. The state released 41 pages of Apple application documents to Reuters that give some clues about the company‚Äôs highly secret self-driving effort, which it has never openly acknowledged. The iPhone maker joins a long list of carmakers, start-ups and technology rivals, including Alphabet‚Äôs Waymo, that are testing cars on state roads. Apple is looking for new hit products and autonomous car technology is expected to revolutionise the traditional auto industry. As part of the application, Apple included a 10-page training plan that appeared to be related to operators taking back manual control of the car during automated driving exercises of the system, which it calls a development platform. Apple declined comment beyond the filing. The plan includes a document called ‚ÄúAutomated System: Development Platform Specific Training Overview‚Äù whose objective is ‚Äúto train safety drivers in various automated driving conditions.‚Äù ‚ÄúDevelopment platform will be controlled electronically (e.g. joystick) and safety drivers must be ready to intervene and take control,‚Äù the document reads. The document highlights different scenarios to be tested, from high speed driving and tight U-turns to lane changes. One letter sent from Apple to the state Department of Motor Vehicles noted that Apple‚Äôs development platform ‚Äúwill have the ability to capture and store relevant data before a collision occurs.‚Äù The document does not include detail on how Apple‚Äôs self-driving platform actually works or other technical details. It also does not say what kind of sensors are found on Apple‚Äôs three permitted vehicles, all 2015 Lexus model RX450h. The permit does not necessarily mean that Apple itself is building a full car. Apple could instead be designing a self-driving platform that can be integrated into other manufacturer‚Äôs cars. ‚Äï Reuters ¬†¬† ¬†¬† ¬†¬† ¬†¬† ¬†¬† MORE ON MMOTV Drive Channel Most Viewed Now Week Lotus launches another lightweight road rocket Autonomous driving moves closer to reality with the new Mercedes S Class Apple self-driving car testing plan gives clues to tech programme Mercedes E-Class debuts in Malaysia Flying cars take off on French Riviera Mercedes E-Class debuts in Malaysia Locally-assembled Renault Captur with EEV now more affordable than ever The all-new Mini Countryman is here and it‚Äôs a thing of beauty BMW launches 7 Series plug-in hybrid What will be the biggest cars of this year‚Äôs Auto Shanghai?

Even Myanmar, which does not have an official Apple outlet and has patchy wireless internet coverage, is not immune to Apple fever. The iPad 2 has quickly established itself as a ‚Äúmust-have‚Äù item for electronics stores in Yangon, dethroning the original, said Ma Tha Pyae Aung, sales manager for Technoland in Kyauktada township. ‚ÄúWe are not selling the iPad anymore. Customers love the new iPad 2 because it is light, it has two webcams where the original had none and it‚Äôs twice as fast,‚Äù she said. Ma Tha Pyae Aung said Technoland tries to keep about 15 iPad 2s in stock because it‚Äôs a fast-selling product. A combination of exciting design and performance is enticing cashed-up individuals to buy iPad 2s, said a spokesperson for AiKON, an Apple sales and service shop in Pazundaung township. ‚ÄúOur main buyers are businesspeople. Many say they find the design attractive and it‚Äôs useful for their work because they can show videos and photographs to co-workers or clients. ‚ÄúUnfortunately a jailbreak for it is not yet available,‚Äù he said, explaining that the jailbreak would allow users to upload more applications and programs onto the device. When that becomes available I expect we‚Äôll see even more sales,‚Äù he added. AiKON also tries to keep about 15 units in stock, he said, adding that the shop sells about five iPad 2s a week. He said the shop orders stock from the United States. ‚ÄúWe order directly from the US but plenty of other shops have bought them from Bangkok, Singapore or elsewhere. We try to order between 50 and 100 at a time and have sold about 30 since March,‚Äù said Dr Saw Yan Naing from SSS computer sales and service shop in Botahtaung. A 25-year-old man buying an iPad 2 at Technoland last week said he was most interested in the device‚Äôs gaming abilities. ‚ÄúWhen you play games it‚Äôs clear that the graphics are much better than the original iPad‚Äôs,‚Äù he said. But for Myanmar Computer Professionals Association member, U Aung Kyaw Moe, the new iPad was not worth the money. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a bit expensive and I don‚Äôt find that it fits my needs because I already have a laptop. If I was looking to buy something now I‚Äôd spend my money on a new laptop, which would be faster and can connect to external hard disks,‚Äù he said. He added that the lack of city-wide broadband internet that can be found in Bangkok and Singapore is also an Achilles heel for the iPad. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt use iPad on the go or send emails from wherever you are from, which you can do in Singapore. There, people carry them everywhere and you see people using them all over the city.‚Äù iPod and Macbook owner Ko Myoe said the restricted wireless internet network in Yangon severely limits the iPad 2‚Äôs usefulness. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no 3G network here, so people have to rely on Wi-Fi hotspots and there aren‚Äôt many of those here. And the ones that do exist, you have to pay to use,‚Äù he said. The shops stocking iPad 2s are selling them from about K960,000 each (about US$1150), shop spokespersons said.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Opinions Image Source: Martin Hajek A $1,000 iPhone will still sell like crazy Chris Smith @chris_writes April 21st, 2017 at 1:12 PM Share Tweet There‚Äôs no denying that one of the best features of Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy S8 is its price. The cheapest version costs $720, which is in line with Apple‚Äôs iPhone 7 pricing. That was certainly a great surprise from Samsung for a phone that was expected to be significantly more expensive than the cheapest iPhone 7. The iPhone 8, on the other hand, is expected to be more expensive than last year‚Äôs entry-price for the iPhone. Some rumors claimed the iPhone might cost over $1,000, and some analysts are already worried about that. But even if we assume¬†that Apple‚Äôs cheapest iPhone 8 will cost around $1,000, the device will still sell like crazy, and all those analysts are probably wrong. Don't Miss: It‚Äôs official: Everyone hates the iPhone 8 design that just leaked A Business Insider report says that analysts are split on whether Apple might stick with the $1,000 price tag for the high-end iPhone. A new note from Longbow that Apple might indeed be right to charge more for the iPhone 8, given the new technologies going into the phone. The research note says that iPhone design changes have driven ‚Äúa mid- to high-single digit increase‚Äù in recent years. The OLED display of the iPhone 8 and an increase in memory prices are some of the factors that could determine Apple to charge more money for the upcoming flagship. The OLED iPhone would cost $30 more to make, the analysts said, offering an average selling price of $849 for the handset, slightly above what the Galaxy S8 Plus costs. IHS said in a press release that it costs an estimated $307.50 to manufacture the Galaxy S8, which is $43.34 more than the Galaxy S7, and $80 more than the iPhone 7. But Samsung decided not to raise the price of the phone. On the other hand, unlike Apple, Samsung had to take to factor a certain unexpected phone recall when deciding the price of the Galaxy S8. ‚ÄúWith a likely shift in form factor for the [anniversary iPhone] with accounting for memory prices that are up 30%+, the high-end model should carry a higher price point relative to the $769 for the iPhone 7 Plus,‚Äù the report says. ‚ÄúWhether a rumored $1,000 price point becomes reality is unknown, but for a point of comparison, Samsung‚Äôs new S8 Plus is retailing for $840 USD and initial demand for the S8 is higher vs. last year.‚Äù Apple has largely kept in place the same iPhone price for years. Last year, it only charged $20 more for the new Plus model compared to the 2015 edition, but it doubled storage at every tier for both 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch versions. That said, Apple managed to increase the average selling price of the iPhone, which means people are still ready to pay a premium price for Apple smartphones. Even if the iPhone 8‚Äôs price does pass the psychological barrier of $1,000, it still won‚Äôt be a problem for many Apple customers. After all, Apple has an iPhone Upgrade Program in place that makes it easier to upgrade, and carriers will stop at nothing to convince you to buy the latest iPhone. Yes, the more expensive the iPhone is, the harder it is for customers in emerging markets to get one, not to mention that it might make the Galaxy S8 seem even more appealing. But regardless of what Apple asks for the iPhone 8 at launch, it‚Äôll likely sell better than any smartphone that launches this year. Get your wallets ready!

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Companies Apple wants drivers to learn how to control self-driving cars, develops special training programme The drivers need to pass seven different tests before they are fully trained with the autonomous cars, according to a leaked document. Kukil Bora ¬† April 22, 2017 15:34 IST Apple's Stephen Chick displays the CarPlay program at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, California June 2, 2014.REUTERS/Robert Galbraith Apple has developed an Automated System for its self-driving car project, and has also put in place a special training programme to teach employees how to regain manual control of autonomous cars. According to Apple's "Development Platform Specific Training" document, obtained by Business Insider, the company is working on an autonomous driving technology, dubbed the "Apple Autonomous System." The latest report came a week after the Cupertino tech giant obtained permission to test self driving cars in California. The leaked documents also revealed that drivers need to clear seven tests including low speed driving, high speed driving, tight U-turn, sudden steering input, sudden acceleration, sudden breaking and conflicting turn signal and action. To pass each test, every driver must complete two practice runs and three trials. The documents also suggest that Apple's "Autonomous System" is controlled electronically during safety testing, which requires drivers to know how to manually control the vehicle when needed. According to the training packet, Apple's self-driving car uses a Logitech wheel and pedals to actuate drive by wire, and it supports one person at a time. Pressing the brake pedal or grabbing the steering wheel in Apple's test vehicles will disengage the electronic driving mode, but drivers can accelerate without overriding the "drive by wire" mode. Last week, Apple was granted a permit to test autonomous vehicles on public roads in the state of California. According to the California DMV website, the iPhone-maker was added to a list of permit holders that includes giants like Google, Tesla, BMW, Honda, Ford and Nissan. Earlier reports said that Apple had applied for a permit to use three 2015 Lexus RX450h SUVs, which will be driven by six drivers who are experts in areas like machine learning. The newly leaked document also has names of six Apple employees who have passed the company's autonomous vehicle test. Therefore, it's likely that these six drivers will get the opportunity to operate the self-driving platform.

The Cupertino giant's latest high-profile recruits include two Google executives specialising in satellite imagery and communications, while Boeing's recent regulatory filing further emphasises the latest developments between the two tech giants regarding Apple's funding into the lucrative $30 billion project. Although Boeing has been in constant talks with Apple about their highly-probable partnership on the project, there has been no official confirmation from either of the two companies about finalising the deal. Nevertheless, Tim Farrar (an industry consultant) has recently quoted an insider suggesting that Apple would indeed be funding the Boeing project. Meanwhile, a Boeing spokesman has declined to comment on the latest developments between the two companies. The proposed project basically employs an NGSO (non-geostationary satellite orbit constellations) low-earth orbit satellite system with the goal of achieving superior broadband coverage service globally, including the entire US. According to Boeing's recent FCC filing, it plans to allot and authorise new uplink spectrum in the bands 50.4-51.4GHz and 51.4-52.4GHz to unlock a total of five gigahertz of paired spectrum for V-band operations. The catch here is to offer low latency and faster connection speeds than existing data-network systems, albeit at the same cost to all users regardless of their geographical location. Here are the currently allocated broadband spectrum frequencies for satellite up-linking in the US: 47.2-50.2 GHz:¬†Not yet designated for fixed satellite service use. 50.4-51.4 GHz:¬†Shared between NASA/military and commercial entities, with co-primary allocations for fixed, fixed satellite, mobile and MSS services. 51.4-52.4 GHz:¬†Currently allocated for terrestrial fixed and mobile wireless services. As the aforementioned frequency bands are not used by terrestrial wireless networks, they will be extremely reliable for satellite-based networks that rely on millimetre wave technology and phased array formation for transmission of data through individual frequencies without jamming the signals. Here are the excerpts of Boeing's FCC filing that sums up the whole project: "By bringing comparable Internet speeds, performance and prices to Americans regardless of where they live, satellite broadband systems also have the potential to create new national broadband competitors and re-invigorate the United States telecommunications marketplace."

Donklephant Primary Navigation Please select a menu in this location Home Mobile The iPhone 8 Design Is Out and Nobody Likes It By Costea Lestoc. Published on April 22, 2017. 1 The next generation iPhone device should have its debut in September, if it were to follow the tradition Apple started when they moved their releases from the beginning of the summer to the end of the summer. However, according to some recent reports, Apple might be encountering some issues with an essential technological component that should appear on the 10th anniversary device. What Is the Problem? From what we gathered from the reports, Apple had two options: to delay the release or to quit the tech component altogether. This lead to a surprising turn of events, where the fans actually want the phone to be delayed, which might even be a first in history! But in order to understand better why fans would want the release delayed, we should go back to a leak that happened last Wednesday. If you remember, a source leaked a basic drawing of what is supposed to be the design of the upcoming device. The image reveals a design that resembles a flatter iPhone 5 look. Besides this, we can also see a new hole appearing underneath the Apple logo. Rumor has it that the hole translates to the Touch ID fingerprint scanner being moved to the back, just under the logo. We know that Apple has been working on placing it below the display for years in a row, and iPhone 8 should be the first phone not to have this technology. But the catch here is the fact that it seems the company has some trouble trying to make the scanner mass-produced. Consequently, the developers are considering relocating the scanner on the back. Take Everything with a Grain of Salt However, this might still be fake news. And even if the image is true, it may just be one of Apple‚Äôs experiments, as we have seen in the past.

It‚Äôs a day to stop and look at all the things that are potentially destroying the planet and a day to perhaps do what we can to save it. We‚Äôve always looked to technology to help save the Earth and major tech giants have tried to lead the way in that effort. On Earth Day, we take a look at what some of the biggest names in technology are doing to promote a cleaner, safer Earth. Apple Being perhaps the biggest name in the industry today, Apple is trying to be a symbol for clean, green technology. Ahead of Earth Day, the company released its Environment Responsibility Report, which argued for safer, greener technology. Notably, Apple plans to recycle metals bought from suppliers with those taken from old, used products for its iPhones in the future. Apple also highlights that 96 percent of the electricity used at the company‚Äôs global facilities came from energy sources like solar, hydro and wind power. The company also said that it uses 99 percent recycled paper for packaging its products. To celebrate Earth Day 2017,¬†Apple launched a video campaign in collaboration with James Blagden that focuses on Apple's work on three key aspects: addressing climate change, conserving precious resources and ensuring safer materials. ¬† Google Google has long tried to celebrate various important dates through Google Doodle and Earth Day 2017 is no different. The Google Doodle for Earth Day this time around is showcasing a story of ‚Äúa fox who dreams about an Earth that‚Äôs been polluted and adversely affected by climate change.‚Äù The Earth Day 2017 doodle¬†follows that the Fox wakes up from his dream and starts making small lifestyle changes and this is meant to move everyone to make small changes to their lifestyles. Clicking on the Google¬†doodle open up a page with Earth Day tips to consider do do your part in saving the environment. This includes ‚Äúsupporting critical conservation efforts such as wildlife conservation with World Wildlife Fund, coral reef conservation with The Ocean Agency, and rainforest with The Jane Goodall Institute.‚Äú Google earlier this week also revamped Google Earth, adding new features like 3D toggle, a new Voyager option, the I'm Feeling Lucky dice, and more. After all, Google Earth is one of the more interactive ways to know about the planet, and the update comes just in time for Earth Day 2017. Microsoft Microsoft dedicated the entire week to reflect on where the planet is, where it‚Äôs heading, and how the Redmond giant is doing its part towards that greener goal. The company earlier this week noted four Microsoft employees - Prashant Gupta, Karen Chalk, Conor Kelly and Krista Connor - who are tackling environmental changes, in a bid to highlight its efforts in time for Earth Day 2017. The Redmond giant has also partnered with Ecolab to apply cutting-edge technology to tackle the issue of water scarcity. Built on the Azure Cloud, the Water Risk Monetizer (WRM) ‚Äúis industry‚Äôs first publicly available water risk analysis and financial modelling tool that translates water scarcity risks into financial terms, and enables businesses to factor current and future water risks into decision making.‚Äù Microsoft is also helping develop smarter energy grids, help achieve optimal harvests, among other things across energy and agriculture. Facebook The massive social media behemoth, Facebook, has also been actively pushing for renewable energy, and joins the likes of Apple and Google in working to achieve the 100 percent renewable energy goal. It is also part of the Open Compute Project, an industry-wide coalition that looks to create energy and cost-efficient infrastructure solutions and share them as open source. Facebook's most recently unveiled data centre, in Clonee, Ireland, is set to be powered by 100 percent renewable energy. The company attributes this in part to the availability of wind energy in the country. It puts it on track for achieving its goal of power 50 percent of its infrastructure with clean and renewable energy by the end of 2018. Mobile accessory maker Belkin is also actively taking a part towards a sustainable environment. The company says it has improved the usage of environment friendly materials in building their USB Type-C cables. Their packaging is also made of fully recyclable materials and the company's HQ in Playa Vista is LEED Gold certified for energy efficiency.

You may recall a few months ago when Elago introduced the Mac Plus Apple Watch stand. We here at iMore just fell head-over-heals and some of us have one sitting on our nightstands right now. Macrumors got wind that Elago has one-upped its own product by turning that same retro Macintosh look into an iPhone stand, available for the iPhone 7, 6s, or 6 (too bad it's not sized for the Plus models). The stand, called the M4, is made from flexible silicon. You can slide your iPhone into the designated slot, and the screen is framed by that adorable boxy Mac Plus look. The charging cable hides away by interlacing into the bottom and out the backside of the stand. You plug it into your iPhone, but the majority of the cable is tucked away behind the faux computer. Imagine how cute this would look when paired with your Magic keyboard. Elago notes that the tight-fitting slot makes it difficult to fit an iPhone with anything but an ultra-thin case on it, but they do have their own line of slim fit cases if you want to go all in. You can get the M4 for iPhone in black or "classic white" which is more of a whitish beige than anything else. You can get one today for about $30. If you have any sort of nostalgia for classic Apple memorabilia, you're going to want to get your hands on one of these before they become collectors items like the real thing.

Apple publishes Earth Day videos on solar farms, wasteful packaging, and fake sweat By Joseph Keller Thursday, Apr 20, 2017 at 12:54 pm EDT 0 Comments With Earth Day coming up, Apple has published a set of short videos explaining the basics of some of the company's environmental initiatives. Each video lasts about a minute and covers a different topic, and, according to Mashable, they were all illustrated by hand by James Blagden. First, we have a video about Apple's solar farms. The video explains how the 40-megawatt solar farms that power various Apple facilities across China do so without disrupting the other uses of the land they occupy. The company also delves into its efforts reduce waste produced by its assembly partners, and how the effort all began because of stacks of plastic packaging. In this video, Apple's Rob Guzzo reveals what goes into testing products to ensure that the materials used are safe for you to use. As it turns out, 30 gallons of artificial sweat. Apple's final Earth Day video details how the company's new Apple Park campus keeps cool using natural air movement and water pipes. So what do you think of these Earth Day videos from Apple? Let us know down in the comments.

By Luke Filipowicz Thursday, Apr 20, 2017 at 1:48 pm EDT 1 Comment Today, Apple Music's official Twitter account introduced the world to its newest feature Up Next, which is meant to promote a different new-and-upcoming artist each month. Note: This feature is not to be confused with the unrelated Up Next feature which allows you to see what track will play next in your queue. This month Apple is teaming up with 6LACK ‚Äî pronounced "black" ‚Äî through a series of little projects to promote his newest album FREE 6BLACK. The newer feature content can be accessed in the New Music section found in the Browse tab and features a variety of content including, a live performance from 6LACK, updated playlists with his music, a video interview with Zane Lowe from Beats one, and even a short documentary about 6LACK himself. You can watch the trailer for that documentary, which was released on the Apple Music Twitter account, below. Introducing #UpNext. Music's Next Generation. A new artist every month.

We've seen Apple promote major artists in the past with special events and partnerships, but this is specifically designed to shed light on artists who aren't as established. My favorite part of Up Next is that Apple isn't just featuring one the artist's albums or singles, but it goes much deeper than that. By having such a variety of feature content, listeners are going to be able to develop a deeper connection with the artists that Up Next chooses to feature, which will not only by creating a buzz in the short term but also turning new listeners into dedicated fans that will be awaiting the artist's next release. Not only does this help the artists make a splash in the giant ocean that is the music industry, but it also helps Apple Music subscribers broaden their horizons and listen to new artists. That's a classic win-win in my book! What do you think of Up Next? Do you like the new feature or do you hate it? Let us know what you think in the comments below!

Apple enters self-driving car race Technology¬†|¬†22 April 2017 Micheal Liedtke San Francisco ‚Äî Apple is joining the fiercely competitive race to design self-driving cars, raising the possibility that a company that has already re-shaped culture with its iPhone may try to transform transportation, too. Ending years of speculation, Apple's late entry into a crowded field was made official Friday with the disclosure that the California Department of Motor Vehicles had awarded a permit for the company to start testing its self-driving car technology on public roads in the state. Share this story The Apple logo above a store location entrance, in Dallas. Apple will begin testing self-driving car technology in California, its first public move into a highly competitive field that could radically change transportation. The California Department of Motor Vehicles awarded Apple a permit to test autonomous vehicles and disclosed that information on its website. AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez, File The permit covers three vehicles ‚Äî all 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs ‚Äî and six individual drivers. California law requires people to be in a self-driving car who can take control if something goes wrong. Apple confirmed its arrival in the self-driving car market, but wouldn't discuss its intentions. Its interest in autonomous vehicle technology, however, has long been clear. The Cupertino, California, company pointed to a statement that it issued in December. " Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems," the company said then. "There are many potential applications". Apple released that statement after Steve Kenner, a former Ford Motor executive who is now Apple's director of product integrity, notifications for these technologies, including the future of transportation."ed federal regulators of the company's interest in self-driving cars in a letter. Read also: Apple to make iPhones in India Like others, Apple believes self-driving cars could ease congestion, prevent millions of crashes and save thousands of lives annually in traffic accidents often caused by drunk or distracted motorists. Self-driving cars could also be a lucrative new market. And Apple has been searching for its next act for a while, one that will take it beyond its mainstay phones, tablets and personal computers. Next big thing Although iPhone's ongoing popularity has helped Apple remain the world's most valuable company, the company hasn't had a breakthrough product since the 2010 debut of the iPad, currently in the throes of a three-year sales slump. The dry spell has raised doubts as to whether Apple lost some of its trend-setting magic with the death of co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Apple will be vying against 29 other companies that already have California permits to test self-driving cars. The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has been spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. Since Google began its work on self-driving vehicles eight years ago, Waymo's fleet of self-driving cars has logged more than 2 million miles on the road. That means Apple has a long way to catch up in self-driving technology. But it has often been a follower in markets that it eventually revolutionized. It wasn't the first to introduce a digital music player, smartphone, or tablet before its iPod, iPhone and iPad came out. Deep pockets With $246 billion in cash, Apple also could easily afford to buy technology that accelerates its development of self-driving cars. There has been recurring speculation that Apple might eventually acquire Tesla, which has a market value of about $50 billion. Neither Apple nor Tesla has given any inkling that they're interested in joining forces, though. Speculation about Apple's interest in expanding into automobiles began swirling in 2015 amid media reports that the company had begun secretly working on building its own electric car under the name project "Titan." Apple never confirmed the existence of Titan, which is now believed to be dead.

By Mary-Ann Russon Updated April 22, 2017 17:48 BST Apple wants to stop third parties from repairing old iPhones and iPads, but this could be one reason why e-waste continues to be such a big problem for the worldMichael Kan, Techworld In order to save the environment, on 19 April, Apple its hopes to, one day, build all iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and MacBooks out of 100% recyclable materials ‚Äì even though it doesn't yet know how to achieve this. This is a great pledge to make, however it doesn't consider the electronic giant's other more controversial efforts, such as the attempts to strike down the Right to Repair legislation being considered in several US states. The point of Right to Repair is that third parties will be allowed to utilise spare parts from older, unwanted iPhones and iPads to repair devices so that they last longer. This means consumers can hold onto their beloved devices for longer, and parts of unwanted products can be recycled, which is good for the environment. So what's not to like? Apple is strongly opposed to third parties repairing its devices as, it argues, this will enable other firms to learn its trade secrets, as well as make it harder to keep its products secure for consumers. "If Apple win this battle, the cost of repairing devices will remain unjustly high as only certified shops will be able to assist. Apple is one of many tech manufacturers that hike up their repair prices leading users to 'buy new', rather than 'repair old', and have an estimated 90% profit margin for each repair," UK-based phone repair firm Lovefone's chief executive Robert Kerr told IBTimes UK. "They don't supply official parts, demonise the third party repair industry and void warranties at any sign of third party intervention. Imagine owning a VW Golf and being told you can only get it serviced at one of their garages at inflated prices. No one would stand for that." The world is still producing way too much e-waste, and a lot of it is due to devices that can only be used for a certain amount of time before being disposed ofLovefone Apple says it is doing more than enough for the environment as it is. Its own recycling programme Apple Renew promotes refurbished devices, and it has an army of disassembly robots ‚Äì dubbed Liam ‚Äì that salvaged aluminium from unwanted iPhone 6 enclosures and used them to build the Mac Mini computers. But Kerr disagrees ‚Äî he claims that Apple's refusal to work with third parties means that overall more e-waste is being generated than saved. At the moment, the UK's annual e-waste output is equivalent to the weight of 120 double-decker buses, and overall, the world's global e-waste outbut is equivalent to 187 Empire State buildings. The components of electronic devices often contain harmful metals, acids and plastics such as lead, cadmium, chromium, brominated flame retardants or polychlorinated biphenyls which are extremely dangerous to wildlife and the environment. It is extremely expensive for countries to dispose of e-waste, and reports have shown that many developed nations including the UK have been illegally exporting thousands of kilotons of e-waste to developing nations. "In fighting Right to Repair legislation, the industry lobbyists' most compelling argument to lawmakers was that broken glass could cut the fingers of consumers who try to repair their screens. "Seriously? The ugly truth is that manufacturers and their lobbyists are hitched to a linear consumption model. Until we move to a circular economy where consumers buy products 'as a service' rather than own it outright they will see the third party repair industry as a thorn in the side of their sales targets. In the meantime the e-waste will keep piling up."

The heat dissipated from the plant will be redirected to warm homes in and around its suburbs. Apple seems to have struck the right formula for embracing its new 'Go Green' motto, especially given its recent partnership with Aarhus University to convert some of the residual waste into nutrient-rich fertiliser for farmers to use on their fields. As the data centre will harness its power completely through renewable energy source from one of Denmark's largest electrical substations, the company plans to eliminate the use of back-up generators altogether. The waste recycling process involves passing agricultural waste through a digester to generate methane gas, which can then be used to produce renewable electricity to power the data centre. As the agricultural waste used to power the plant will be returned to the fields as fertiliser generated from residual waste, it paves the way for "mutually beneficial relationship" between farmers and the tech eco-system. The data centre spanning across 166,000 square metres of land is reportedly the world's largest as well as the biggest foreign capital investment in Danish history, given its estimated worth of nearly one billion dollars.

ITSHOW 2017 Search for: Home > Apple > Purported iPhone 8 Schematic Hints at a Rear-Facing Touch ID AppleNewsSmartphones Purported iPhone 8 Schematic Hints at a Rear-Facing Touch ID Babu Mohan April 20, 20170258 iPhone leakster Sonny Dickson has shared an alleged schematic for the upcoming iPhone 8 model, suggesting that Apple will be moving the Touch ID sensor to the back of the smartphone. It was previously reported that Apple would be using an under-glass fingerprint scanner positioned below the screen. While the leakster hasn‚Äôt provided any additional info, it could be possible that in-screen fingerprint sensors will not be available in required quantities for the iPhone 8. Samsung too was rumored to use an ultrasound fingerprint scanner embedded into the display glass in the Galaxy S8, but it was recently revealed that the company decided not to as such sensors were not available in time for the handset‚Äôs launch. In fact, a research note from analyst Timothy Arcuri suggests Apple is struggling to improve the yield rate of its in-house AuthenTec under-glass fingerprint sensor solution. That leaves Apple with only two options ‚Äì either ditch the Touch ID sensor completely or move it to the back. A similar schematic had been leaked on Weibo as well recently, showing a near bezel-less front and a Touch ID sensor positioned below the Apple logo at the back. It also showed a vertical dual-camera layout with the True Tone flash positioned below it. The iPhone 8, along with the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, is expected to be unveiled in September this year.

If you want your Apple CarPlay to finally direct you to an electric vehicle charger, good news. Apple is expanding its built-in navigation app with EVSE information for Europe, starting with the UK. This sort of info came to the U.S. part of Apple Maps late last year. The UK EV charger data is drawn from Moovility, which is run by Cirrantic and is based in Munich, Germany. Given that Moovility already lists EVSEs for other countries on its website, we assume more such spots will be available in Apple Maps soon. After all, if the CarStations app and Google Maps already have this sort of data (which they do), then Apple needs to at least keep pace, if not take the lead somehow. The CEO of Cirrantic, Arne Meusel, told Bloomberg that, ‚ÄúWe think that consistent, live information of the growing charger infrastructure increases the confidence of EV drivers and, especially with Apple Maps, attracts new user groups to sustainable mobility offerings like EV cars. In the U.K. we started with supporting the major charger operators, including Podpoint, CYC, Ecotricity, NPower and NewMotion. Any interested operator is welcome to set up a connection with us.‚Äù Read also: Even Big Mercedes, Scania Trucks Getting Apple CarPlay Now Watch Apple CarPlay read every single iPhone emoji Harman innovation takes wires out of Apple CarPlay Since we‚Äôre not driving an EV through London at the moment, we‚Äôre not sure if the Apple Maps information is better than a dedicated EVSE app like the one from ChargePoint or the built-in databases found in the nav systems of some EVs. Yes, we know that the ChargePoint app doesn‚Äôt work in Europe, but there are other EVSE-specific alternatives available. Those of you who use these sorts of digital services in Europe, which do you find most useful, and do you think Apple‚Äôs entry will make finding a place to charge up easier than whatever system you‚Äôre using now? Alongside the EV updates, Apple has also added bike rental locations to its London, Paris, and New York maps.

The Museum of Failure contains quite a few pieces of technology Time to look back on those halcyon days of bad ideas, mindlessly hyped 22 Apr 2017 at 07:17, Kieren McCarthy If you work in Silicon Valley, you might want to look away now. Because one day your work may well feature in the Museum of Failure. Created by organizational psychologist Samuel West and due to open in Sweden in June, the museum celebrates the screw-ups, the well-intentioned but poorly considered, and the outright idiotic. And it's fair to say that the tech industry has a disproportionate number of exhibits. Created from his very Scandinavian dislike of everyone celebrating success and ignoring failure, West has scoured industry and history to find failure. But at the same time, he takes a very Silicon Valley-like view of failure: it is not something to be ashamed of but something to embrace, as it invariably leads to learning lessons. And accepting failure, and learning from it, is a critical skill that corporations all too often fail the see and cater to. We are reminded of one anecdote we were told years ago in which IBM CEO Lou Gerstner called a manager who had screwed up and cost the company $10m up to his office for a meeting. After he'd walked through what went wrong, the manager said: "So, are you firing me?" To which Gerstner responded: "What, are you kidding me? It just cost me ten million to teach you a lesson." (Incidentally, while it is very fashionable for Silicon Valleyites to talk about failure as a positive, we will note that they never spend too long dwelling on it and they always talk about it in terms of their current, amazing success. Just sayin'.) But let's get to what you really want to know: what unadulterated electronic ass scrapings have made it into the Museum of Failure? Gravity Let's start with a classic: the Apple Newton. We have repeatedly referred to this famous failure, Apple's PDA (that's personal digital assistant all you people under 40 ‚Äì look it up), usually in our every-ten-years summary of Apple's errors. It was the brainchild of John Sculley ‚Äì the man who ousted god-king Steve Jobs in 1984 ‚Äì and it was a good idea. In theory. But its hyped-up handwriting-recognition was appallingly bad and it bombed, leading Jobs on his return to order the death of "that scribble thing." But we should also note ‚Äì and we hope that the Museum of Failure appreciates this ‚Äì that ultimately that failure helped lead to an enormous success. Apple decided to use a new processor for the device designed by ARM, an offshoot of the UK computer company Acorn. ARM went on to become hugely successful and netted Apple $800m thanks to its 43 per cent share in the fledgling biz. Now ARM designs processor and GPU cores used in billions of phones, tablets, gadgets and other hardware. Next up: the Nokia N-Gage Remember this piece of crap? This was named in our list of 10 technology fails back in 2012. And in fact such was its miserable nature that we dedicated an entire story to its demise back in 2009. Even now, we're not sure what the N‚ÄëGage was supposed to be. It was a phone ‚Äì but also a games console. It ran Symbian (ah, remember Symbian). But rather than the combination hitting a magic sweet spot, the end result was both a bad phone and a bad games machine. Of course, the idea has been proven too right: the addition of games was undoubtedly a huge factor behind the take-up of smartphones by the broader public. We'd be tempted to say Nokia was ahead of time but then we take another look at the monstrosity that is the N‚ÄëGage and think better of it. Speckled twat Another gem: Google Glass. When the Simpsons are featuring your tech, it's time to go hide and cry This is recent enough for everyone to remember. It was going to change the world... but then everyone realized it was actually a bit creepy and not that useful. From the billionaire founder of the company riding the New York subway, to that guy getting punched in a San Francisco bar, Google Glass was going to bring a new magical future to us all. But in the end, it was expensive nonsense. And, as ever, the idea is being reborn in a different format. Augmented Reality is the new hot topic. Just this week Mark Zuckerberg was up onstage waxing lyrical about how a Google Glass-style approach is the future. And all the Apple excito-blogs are in a frottage frenzy over the idea of the new iPhone having some kind of new AR. Here's one that you may have a hard time remembering: the Twitter Peek Remember that? It was a dedicated Twitter machine ‚Äì the idea being that you could use it for Twitter without being hit with expensive cellphone data bills. The downside? It had a tiny memory and so could only store a few tweets at a time. But perhaps most damaging ‚Äì its screen couldn't even handle the 140 characters of a tweet at the same time. Even if there was ever going to be a market for a service-specific device (Facebook phone, anyone? India?), failing to even account for that service was a pretty big strike against this terrible idea. And the rest Of course it's not all tech, so go ahead and enjoy these other examples of terrible failure. Let's give it up for: Bic for Her ‚Äì ballpoint pens for the ladies. How do you know? Because they are in lady colors like purple and pink. Of course there's nothing wrong with the actual pens themselves but there was something so mindlessly ridiculous about trying to gender-market a pen that it became a thing. And by "thing," we mean PR disaster. Harley-Davidson Perfume ‚Äì Just what a man wants: to smell like a motorcycle. The "Hot Road" eau de toilette was good ‚Äì in theory ‚Äì it's a big brand, why not move into the perfume market? But honestly, no one associates motorcycles with nice smells. Not even men. Kodak Digital Camera ‚Äì Yeah, poor old Kodak. At one point a monster corporation. And then we found that digital technology did it for us without all the hassle and the mark-ups. (Admit it, you miss having to hand over your reel to a snotty clerk and come back several days later to find out if any of the small, horribly printed photos were any good.) Poor old Kodak just couldn't admit to its own collapsing market. And so it died. This camera would probably make a good tombstone. Sony Betamax ‚Äì We're not going to start on this one. There are still forums in which people rave about this format battle. It lost, people! Why? Because VHS recorded longer and Betamax quality wasn't actually that much better. Now shut up!

Authorities responded to reports of a major-injury crash involving two vehicles on Highway 18 and Rimrock Road at 1:40 p.m. Friday. A man also suffered injuries due to the crash, Apple Valley Fire Protection District Chief Sid Hultquist said. The exact circumstances of the crash are still unclear, but Hultquist said the woman was headed west on Highway 18 in a Nissan Sentra¬†while the man was headed east on Highway 18 driving a white Ford Flex. ‚ÄúIt appeared as though the Flex was making a left turn to go south and collided with the Nissan Sentra,‚Äù Hultquist said. ‚ÄúThe collision forced the Sentra into a light pole across the road.‚Äù The woman suffered major leg injuries and was airlifted to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center. The man also suffered leg injuries, though not as severe, Hulquist said, and was taken to St. Joseph Health, St. Mary for treatment. San Bernardino County Sheriff‚Äôs Department officials shut down the eastbound lanes of Highway 18 from Tao Road to Rancherias Road following the incident, and traffic was diverted onto Outer Highway 18, Apple Valley Sheriff‚Äôs Station Sgt. Jeff Allison said. The closure was lifted just after 2:30 p.m. The cause of the crash remains under investigation by the Apple Valley Sheriff‚Äôs Station.

When he's not bothering his chihuahuas, Mikah spends entirely too much time and money on HomeKit products. You can follow him on Twitter at @mikahsargent if you're so inclined. Just how easy is it to switch between devices using AirPods? AirPods are just about as magical as Apple claims. The glossy-white earphones not only connect to your various Apple devices in an instant, they stay connected. They know when you're listening and pause when you pull them from your ears; they filter out noise when you use the built-in microphone, and they can trigger Siri or play and pause music. Put simply, they're a delight to use and they're far more feature packed than their subtle design would have you believe. All that said, there's one thing that could take AirPod listening to the next level of delight: better hand-off between devices. I know I'm not the only one who pictured a seamless listening experience like this: I'm listening to music with my AirPods on iPhone. I get a Skype call on my Mac. I head into the office and click to answer the call. My Mac automagically switches to my AirPods for audio I finish the call and pick up my iPhone I click play and my iPhone automagically switches to my AirPods for audio Maybe that sounds like a lot to ask, but I wasn't kidding when I said I wasn't the only one who pictured this experience. This is arguably more important when it comes to phone calls; if I'm using my AirPods and get a phone call on my iPhone, but decide to answer the call using my Mac (via Handoff), it'd be great if my Mac automatically switched to my AirPods for audio. How AirPods work with Handoff on iPhone, iPad, and Mac So how do AirPods work with Handoff? Just short of automatically. By that I mean it requires interaction on your part to switch between devices. Swapping between iOS devices requires fiddling with Control Center, and swapping to and between macOS devices requires fiddling with System Preferences, keyboard shortcuts, and adjusting settings in the Mac menubar. It's not the seamless future I envisioned, but I won't lie: It'll take you no time at all to get the necessary interactions figured out. As long as your AirPods are out of their case or comfortably resting in your ears, you'll see them listed among the audio devices on your iOS, watchOS, and macOS devices ‚Äî they're just a swipe, tap, and click away! By the way, if you'd like to learn how to get into the swing of the audio swap, check out my how-to on switching between audio sources with your AirPods! How to switch between audio sources with your AirPods Thoughts or questions? I'm curious to hear what you think about my proposed AirPods listening experience! Do you wish AirPods automatically switched devices when you started using them or do you prefer to control the whens and hows of your audio swapping?

My Jabra Revo do this well, but they are over the ear and Ido not want to walk with them all over the place. I also wish I could adjust the volume by sliding up or down on the airpod. 0 3 days ago Reply websyndicate So the repairing to my iPad and Macbook is not needed. Granted I do have to select device I'm using in the Bluetooth setting but is much easier than having to repair all the time. I wish there was a better way of making things more fluid but for now it works for me. I change between by Beats X and Airpods. The one thing I wish the Airpods had is volume up and down by touch. 0 3 days ago Reply jonflaire One step closer: found an app called Tooth Fairy that lives in the Mac menubar and makes connecting to AirPods a one-click deal instead of an Option key + two click affair.

It's not enough that I'm skating in a roller derby tournament this Earth Day weekend: Apple wants me to go and explore my outdoor surroundings to earn its third special Apple Watch fitness badge. Following the success of its Thanksgiving and New Years fitness events, Apple is offering users the chance to earn a special Earth Day badge for logging any 30 minutes (or longer) walk, run, cycle, or wheelchair workout in the Apple Watch's Workout app or other compatible third-party app. Complete the workout, and you'll get a special icon in the Activity app as well as a custom iMessage sticker. Ooo, shiny. The slot for the badge will appear in the Activities app starting April 20 and a notification will go out on April 21. It's international, so everyone can participate. But, yes, that means Australia and New Zealand get to finish first. To help you jumpstart your planning for this badge, here are some of the things you could do to get yourself up and moving this Earth Day. Go for a spring photo walk (with or without puppers) In many areas of the world, it's Spring at last. That means it's the perfect time to explore the blooming bushes, trees, and flowers of your neighborhood: Grab a friend (or a doggie pal) and take a 30 minute photo walk and snap your favorite spring flowers. (And don't forget to enter our Earth Day photo contest, while you're at it!) Earth Day Spring photo contest! Trail skating is in Okay, so Apple doesn't officially have a skating option in the Workout app, but you can fake it by logging a cycling workout while you go roller skating, blading, or skateboarding on your town's paved bike path or trail. With clear weather in most parts of the world, it's a great excuse to feel the wind and speed through the outdoors. Make an Earth Day-themed Strava map Enterprising Strava bikers have made all sorts of fun map designs for riding through their neighborhood; why not use this Earth Day to attempt your own Strava creation? Strava - Download now Take a frigid ocean swim Unless you live in the Southern Hemisphere, swimming in the ocean isn't exactly a thrilling option in April, but add in a wetsuit and a waterproof iPhone case, and you might just have some fun. Or, you know, you could just find your local indoor heated pool. That's cool, too, but far less outdoorsy. Run, run, run away The Boston Marathon may have been this past Monday, but that won't stop many runners from adventuring over their city for 5Ks and fun runs. If you're in the mood for a run, check and see if your local city is offering an Earth Day 5K. You may not look as cool as the runners in Apple's recent Watch ad, but what's stopping you from feeling that way on the inside? Clean up your town and get your steps in Many cities offer cleanup days on Earth Day weekend to help beautify the landscape; add your Apple Watch and a walking workout to the mix, and you can earn your Earth Day badge while helping your city look great. Play Pok√©mon Go The Pok√©mon Go Watch app does in fact log a walking workout on your Apple Watch, so you can theoretically go for a fun little Earth Day walk and help hatch your eggs, too. I know what Rene is doing! Pok√©mon Go for Apple Watch Guide: Tips and Tricks! Your ideas? How are you going to grab Apple's new Earth Day badge? Let us know in the comments!

I did the 30 minutes, and it told me I did the 30 minutes, but no badge. After reading it again, it clearly says "in the Workout app or in any third party app that writes workouts to Health." So, I believe you actually have to make the effort to log this, not just do it. I'm disappointed.

Download Our Free Report Small Law Firms, Solo Practitioners, Technology Thank You, Mr. President, For My $379 Speedier, More Secure Office On The Go The increased assault on privacy at the border is a wake-up call for lawyers on cybersecurity. By Carolyn Elefant Apr 19, 2017 at 4:41 PM Shares50 Between October 2016 and March 2017, border searches of phones and laptops have almost doubled, going from¬†8,383 to 14,993 searches ‚Äî an increase of about 80 percent, reports¬†ZDNet. This trend, coupled with Homeland Security‚Äôs¬†recent investment in advanced phone and laptop hacking technology, suggest that threats to overseas travelers‚Äô privacy aren‚Äôt going away anytime soon under the current¬†administration. Computer security has always been critical for lawyers ‚Äî after all, we must protect client confidences and prevent inadvertent waiver of attorney-client privilege at all costs. Nevertheless, the increased assault on privacy at the border was a real wake-up call for lawyers like me who, in the past, skimped on security for the sake of convenience. But as I discovered after this administration‚Äôs invasive policies forced me to rethink my tech systems for travel, security and convenience are no longer mutually exclusive. To my surprise, my new on-the-go system for travel is not only less vulnerable to hacking, but lighter and zippier than what I was using before. So with that, here‚Äôs how I upgraded and fortified my mobile tech for around $379 ‚Äî and how you could do it for even less. Forgo Your Fealty to Apple My Mac was my first computer, so naturally, it will always hold a special place in my heart. ¬†For the past decade, my Mac was my number one tool of choice for mobile lawyering. Lightweight and portable with plenty of memory, my Mac gave me easy access to all of my work files as well as other software like Adobe Pro and Microsoft for Mac, allowing me to prepare documents on the go. My iPad ‚Äî also an Apple product ‚Äî took second place. I loved it for trial, and the bluetooth keyboard worked well enough for blogging or taking notes at conferences (although it was too small and slow to have much functionality for real work). Yet, even though my Mac and iPad functioned well enough, concerns about security in connection with my impending two-week trip overseas ¬†made me reconsider. Although the files on my Mac are adequately protected through activation of¬†FileVault, I didn‚Äôt feel sufficiently confident that default encryption would stand up to border hacking technology. As for my iPad, I‚Äôm not even entirely sure of what type of security I even have on, and which files are saved in local memory versus the cloud. So that‚Äôs why I decided to have a look at a Chromebook. Had I been unwilling to look beyond Apple, I wouldn‚Äôt have found an even better travel system (Mac still wins back at the office). Carry a Chromebook Chromebook is a computer that runs on Google Chrome‚Äôs Operating System and is designed to be used to access the internet along with applications and documents that reside in the cloud. Chromebooks don‚Äôt have much storage or all of the functionality of a laptop .¬† On the flip side,¬†they don‚Äôt cost much either. Out of the box, Chromebooks are already ultra-secure and therefore¬†impervious to the latest viruses and security threats. And because Chromebooks are difficult to hack, many security experts view them as ideal traveling companions. Even the EFF, in its most recent 2017 Security Guide, agrees. Chromebooks range in price from $179 for a small or refurbished version to upwards of $400 for large screen. I went with this Acer model¬†(which I see has already come down in price). The machine has a touch screen so I can use it as an iPad, plus it‚Äôs lighter than a laptop and crazy fast. Who ever thought security could be so sexy?! As for working off the Chromebook, I relied largely on Google Docs, though it also supports Microsoft Word. The full-sized keyboard is much easier to use than the tiny version for my iPad, and I love the ability to be able to flip the screen and use the device as a touchscreen. Securing the iPhone I‚Äôve known some lawyers who rely on dedicated travel phones wiped clean of documents, photos, and contacts. But because I rely on my phone for work calls and would be traveling in many countries (which could require numerous SIM cards), that wasn‚Äôt a viable solution. Instead, I followed these tips for securing my iphone ‚Äì turning off touch access and beefing up my password. I also uploaded all my photos to Google Drive and wiped them from my phone, and backed everything up in case my phone was taken at the border and cleared.¬† Although I was still nervous with these precautions, my concerns were outweighed by the benefits of taking the phone with me, as discussed below. Personalized Mobile Hotspots My carrier, AT&T (like many others), offers a Day Pass plan that provides unlimited talk, text and data anywhere overseas for just $10/day. Although the plan can become spendy on a long-term basis, for my 11-day trip, it was just right. The plan is also convenient ‚Äì just register at your carrier‚Äôs site or call them and ask for it to be turned on. But the unlimited data and talk offered another benefit: I could use my iPhone‚Äôs mobile hotspot for increased security. These days, Virtual Private Networks (or VPNs), which protect your network connection from interception that commonly occurs on public wifi, are regarded as a safer alternative ‚Äî and there are many VPN options available. But the iPhone mobile hotspot is built into my phone and easier to use on the fly. And when paired with my Chromebook, it‚Äôs speedier than when my laptop is connected to a public wifi. With my new system in place, I can work on the road as effectively, efficiently, and securely as from my work or home office ‚Äî and more so than on my prior mobile devices. And to think, all of this innovation came about as the result of Donald Trump‚Äôs policies. Thank you, Mr. President.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple iPhone 8 render based on leaked design surfaces Apple iPhone 8 render based on leaked design surfaces By Bindu Nair - Apr 22, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet The world of iPhone 8 rumors got rocked a few days ago thanks to an alleged design schematic of the handset which featured a cutout for Touch ID on the back. No one can say for sure whether the photo is authentic, with many hoping it‚Äôs not given the awkward placement of the fingerprint reader below the Apple logo. An Instagram user named bro.king has now taken up the task of creating renders based on the leaked iPhone 8 schematic, giving us a clearer look at what Apple may be planning. All-in-all, the device in the images closely resembles the iPhone 5 and iPhone SE. It‚Äôs got a silver aluminum shell with chamfered edges. There notably aren‚Äôt any antenna lines running along the back of the device, getting relegated to a tiny portion of the side instead. Apple is said to be considering such a ‚Äòsimpler‚Äô iPhone 8 design as one of many prototypes. More high-concept ones include models that feature glass on the front and back and sport Touch ID underneath the OLED display. Also See: The iPhone 8 may come out later than expected Apple is reportedly facing yield issues related to the latter. If it doesn‚Äôt manage to overcome the problem in time, it could delay the availability of the iPhone 8 till it does, get rid of Touch ID altogether in favor of iris/facial recognition, or shift the fingerprint scanner to the rear. Based on the reaction to the design schematic, a majority of Apple fans are vehemently against the last option. It would be an unusual move for the company, especially since it would probably be seen as an unsightly blemish on the back by most people. It‚Äôs possible the circular cutout isn‚Äôt meant for Touch ID at all.

The new video series that the tech titan posted on its page features yaks, breathing buildings and making one-half gallon of artificial sweat every day. As a part of the celebration, Apple told about its new headquarters based in Cupertino, California. 'Apple Park', which opened for its employees earlier in April, is the world's largest naturally ventilated building, projected to require no heating or air conditioning for nine months of the year. Apple's new headquarters replaced five million square feet of asphalt and concrete with grassy fields and over 9,000 native, drought-resistant trees, and is powered by 100 per cent renewable energy, the company said. With 17 MW of rooftop solar, Apple Park will run one of the largest on-site solar energy installations in the world. According to the '2017 Environmental Responsibility Report' Apple was now powering 96 per cent of its operations with renewable energy in the company's offices, retail stores and product distribution centres. Apple is now 100 per cent renewable in 24 countries, including all of its data centres. In the report, Apple also set an aim to help put an end to mining on earth and said it is planning to use 100 per cent recycled material to manufacture its products. In 2016, Apple launched Liam, the experimental automated technology that disassembles iPhone 6 for recycling. --IANS sku/in SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features India sizzles as heat wave grips states Assam soaks in joy, celebrates Bihu No bars on highways Rare April snow, heavy rains cut off Kashmir Dalai Lama's Arunachal visit rattles China, jubilates exiled Buddhists About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital ¬© Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2017.

The tech titan plans a one day move to a closed-loop manufacturing system in which it will use 100 percent recycled products. But the company is yet working on the probable and optimized way to implement the move. Moreover, on the occasion of Earth Day Apple has some other adorable plans for the celebration. Apple leads no mining campaign for tech-industry The company made a shout-out clearing its aim to preserve the environment by no mining in the Environmental Responsibility¬†Report released on Friday. The reason Apple is stretching the major shift is the electronics manufacturing companies' affect on our planet. Apple says that they are challenging themselves by making an attempt to stop mining and fetch the necessary things from rare earth minerals and recycled products. Here goes the statement, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt question these realities ‚Äî we challenge ourselves to ask what we can do about them in every part of our business‚Äù In a recent interview with Vice, Lisa Jackson, Apple‚Äôs VP of the Environment and Social Initiatives said that the company will not necessarily source from the earth the materials they need in its products. Jackson added that Apple is attempting a rare thing which is to announce the goal before figuring out its way. In 2011, after Tim Cook took over as Apple‚Äôs CEO, the company has raised many social programs. Currently, 100 percent of the electricity Apple uses to power their data centers and 96 percent of the electricity used by the facilities of Apple worldwide comes from renewable energy sources like hydro, solar and wind. To judge the environmental and social impact of the obtaining the material it uses, Apple creates¬†Material Risk profiles. It then checks out where the company can cut down the use concerning the effect on the environment. Apple seems serious with the unprecedented goal for the tech industry to drive improvements in the methods of sourcing materials. The tech titan is also making attempts in the recycling industry to innovate new ways or alterations in the policies that could bring metals, minerals and rare earth materials from the old devices. The Liam initiative by Apple which is a disassembly line of robots is a great move. The Liam robots can pull apart the old devices, saving more than the regular recycling process does. Apple celebrates Earth Day Earth Day is on 22nd April and to celebrate it Apple has launched a video campaign that highlights the key aspects of the tech giant‚Äôs environmental priorities this year. Moreover, on the Earth Day Apple employees will change from their standard blue shirts to Green Earth Day shirts.¬†Apple Watch users will also see new activity challenge ahead of Earth Day. Educational programs will be added in iPad to educate kids about the importance of the environment preservation. Apple will have a specialized logo with green accent leaf on the traditional Apple in its retail stores worldwide. Earth Day is one of the few days when Apple alters its logo. Apple has shown a great leadership by announcing a goal for the tech-industry of ‚ÄúStop mining‚Äù; commencing the initiative. So like Apple, be a leader in every aspect. ¬† Author Christy Gren Christy Gren is an Industry Specialist Reporter at Industry Leaders Magazine; she enjoys writing about Unicorns, Silicon Valley, Startups, and Business leaders and innovators.

By: Reuters | San Francisco | Published:April 22, 2017 10:03 am Apple application documents give some clues about the company‚Äôs highly secret self-driving effort, which it has never openly acknowledged. Apple Inc outlined a plan to train operators of self-driving cars in documents submitted to California regulators earlier this month, the latest clues to the company‚Äôs autonomous vehicle technology aspirations. Apple was granted a permit to test self-driving cars on April 14 by the California Department of Motor Vehicles but the company has never said anything about its plan. The state released 41 pages of Apple application documents to Reuters that give some clues about the company‚Äôs highly secret self-driving effort, which it has never openly acknowledged. The iPhone maker joins a long list of carmakers, start-ups and technology rivals, including Alphabet‚Äôs Waymo, that are testing cars on state roads. Apple is looking for new hit products and autonomous car technology is expected to revolutionize the traditional auto industry. As part of the application, Apple included a 10-page training plan that appeared to be related to operators taking back manual control of the car during automated driving exercises of the system, which it calls a development platform. Apple declined comment beyond the filing. The plan includes a document called ‚ÄúAutomated System: Development Platform Specific Training Overview‚Äù whose objective is ‚Äúto train safety drivers in various automated driving conditions.‚Äù ‚ÄúDevelopment platform will be controlled electronically (e.g. joystick) and safety drivers must be ready to intervene and take control,‚Äù the document reads. The document highlights different scenarios to be tested, from high speed driving and tight U-turns to lane changes. One letter sent from Apple to the state Department of Motor Vehicles noted that Apple‚Äôs development platform ‚Äúwill have the ability to capture and store relevant data before a collision occurs.‚Äù The document does not include detail on how Apple‚Äôs self-driving platform actually works or other technical details. It also does not say what kind of sensors are found on Apple‚Äôs three permitted vehicles, all 2015 Lexus model RX450h. The permit does not necessarily mean that Apple itself is building a full car. Apple could instead be designing a self-driving platform that can be integrated into other manufacturer‚Äôs cars.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Samsung's Galaxy S8 Success Will Come at a Cost And what it means for Apple. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 21, 2017 at 10:15PM By all indications thus far, Samsung's newest Galaxy S8 looks like it's going to be a massive success. The new flagship handset has a striking and unique design that sets it apart from anything Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has done, and the company played it conservatively in terms of the battery specs in order to ensure that the Note 7 debacle doesn't repeat itself. The Note 7's explosive tendencies were in part tied to Samsung pushing the envelope with the battery's energy density. The Galaxy S8 may very redeem the South Korean conglomerate's brand in the eyes of consumers. Assuming nothing goes wrong in the coming months, that success could come at a cost, as the Galaxy S8 promises to be one of 2017's best-selling phones. Image source: Samsung. Component costs are going up IHS Markit¬†has just released preliminary estimates on the bill of materials (BOM) for the Galaxy S8. Spoiler alert: It's expensive. The BOM totals an estimated $301.60, which is meaningfully higher than any previous Galaxy device. That figure is before you include other costs, such as manufacturing or licensing royalties. Tacking on another $5.90 in manufacturing costs brings the total to $307.50. Compare that to other flagship Galaxy phones, as well as IHS Markit's estimates for the iPhone 7 from last September: Device Estimated BOM Galaxy S8 $307.50 Galaxy S7 $264.16 Galaxy S7 Edge $271.21 iPhone 7 $224.80 Data source: IHS Markit. The Galaxy S8 starts at $720. IHS Markit notes that the Galaxy S8 is the first handset that has the technical capabilities to deliver gigabit speeds over LTE. While the market researcher doesn't break out the display costs in its release, display assemblies are often the most expensive component, and Samsung's new "Infinity Display" very likely contributed significantly to the increase. The device starts with a generous 64 GB of storage and 4 GB of RAM, further adding to the BOM, representing about $41.50. Taking the battle upmarket Given the Galaxy S8's strong critical reception thus far, there's quite a bit of pressure for Apple's 10th-generation iPhone to be a blockbuster, as Samsung has now raised the bar. IHS Markit director Andrew Rassweiler notes that BOM costs are trending up, which "reflects something of an arms race in features among Apple, Samsung and other phone manufacturers, as they all try to add new and distinguishing hardware features." One of the most widely held expectations for the 2017 iPhone is a high-end model featuring an OLED display that could cost upwards of $1,000. Given the aforementioned disproportionate impact on costs that displays have, Apple's first adoption of OLED technology will also drive up the component costs of the "iPhone 8" or "iPhone X" or "iPhone whatever-Apple-calls-it." Since Apple has much more aggressive margin targets than its frenemy, any increase in costs should translate into an even higher price point relative to Samsung's pricing strategy. (Hence the possibility of a $1,000 price tag.) At a time when average smartphone prices continue to trend lower, Apple and Samsung are taking their battle even further upmarket.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 22 April 2017 | MYT 10:00 AM Apple touts greater use of recycled metal in gadgets Apple has been encouraging customers to return used products for recycling and has melted down iPhone aluminium enclosures to make mini computers used in its factories. ‚Äî AFP NEW YORK: Apple wants to ‚Äúone day‚Äù end the need to mine materials from the earth to make its gadgets, the technology giant said in its annual environmental responsibility report.¬† ‚ÄùTraditional supply chains are linear,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúMaterials are mined, manufactured as products, and often end up in landfills after use. Then the process starts over and more materials are extracted from the earth for new products.‚Äù¬† ‚ÄùWe believe our goal should be a closed-loop supply chain, where products are built using only renewable resources or recycled material,‚Äù it added.¬† The company‚Äôs research concluded that recycled aluminium should come from Apple products rather than recycling facilities because of the high-grade quality required.¬† Apple has been encouraging customers to return used products for recycling and has melted down iPhone aluminium enclosures to make mini computers used in its factories.¬† ‚ÄùFor tin, we took a different approach,‚Äù the company said. ‚ÄúUnlike aluminium, there is an existing market supply of recycled tin that meets our quality standards.‚Äù¬† As a result, Apple has been using recycled tin for its iPhone 6s. ¬† The ultimate aim is ‚Äúto one day end our reliance on mining altogether,‚Äù the company said, without specifying a date.¬† Apple did not disclose the amount of recycled products currently used in its products.¬† ‚ÄùApple‚Äôs commitment to 100% recycled materials is ambitious, and highlights the need for greater urgency across the sector to reduce resource consumption and e-waste that are causing significant impacts on the environment and human health,‚Äù Greenpeace senior analyst Gary Cook said.¬† Making new gadgets with reclaimed material reduces demand for mined metals and increases the tendency for devices to be recycled, according to the environmental group.¬† Samsung last month said it would sell some Note 7 smartphones that were recalled for safety reasons as refurbished devices, in an effort to manage its stockpile in an ‚Äúenvironmentally friendly‚Äù manner.¬† The South Korean giant recalled an estimated four million of its flagship smartphones over concerns that batteries could overheat and burst into flames.¬† A Samsung statement said that salvageable components from devices would be detached, and metals extracted by companies that specialise in recycling.¬† While lauding a shift to devices made completely from reclaimed materials, Greenpeace analyst Cook urged technology companies to also design products that last a long time and are easy to repair and recycle.¬† Apple is also among Silicon Valley titans investing heavily in green energy for operations, saying that 96% of the electricity at its global facilities comes from renewable sources and that its new ‚Äòspaceship‚Äô main campus is powered entirely by renewable energy. ‚Äî AFP Related Stories You May Be Interested ‚ÄòAssassin‚Äôs Creed‚Äô creator releases ‚ÄòAncestors‚Äô tease Messaging app said to be used in White House does not work: lawsuit Lufthansa, Air France departures briefly hit by computer outage The Galaxy S8 is Samsung‚Äôs best value for money phone yet How to own your first home with zero down payment Pedalling to save the planet Others Also Read Hull, Swansea win to lift survival hopes, Boro sink deeper China's quota threat charges up electric car market Blockbuster FA Cup ties advertisement Latest News What‚Äôs the iPhone‚Äôs future?

View All Editorials ‚Üí Apple Hires Satellite Experts away from Google Bryan Chaffin @TMOBryan ¬∑ +Bryan Chaffin 1 minute read Apr 21st, 2017 9:05 PM EDT | Analysis Apple has hired away a pair of Google‚Äôs top satellite experts, according to Bloomberg‚Äôs Mark Gurman. Citing unnamed sources, Mr. Gurman reported that Apple hired John Fenwick, who previously led Google‚Äôs spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, head of satellite engineering at Google. They are part of a new hardware team at Apple headed by another former Googler, Dropcam cofounder Greg Duffy. Apple in the Skies? Apple Hires Satellite Experts The first question you might have is why Apple would want to make satellites. The answer to that could be in a recent Boeing regulatory filing. According to Bloomberg, Boeing is working on plans for a network of 1,000 satellites that would provide broadband internet access. That service could be offered anywhere, including areas with no wired or wireless telephone infrastructure. Boeing has reportedly talked to Apple about being part of the project. Whether or not that‚Äôs true, and whether or not Apple is going to work with Boeing, it‚Äôs easy to understand that Apple could be interested in offering that sort of service. Opening up the third world to high speed internet access is a goal of many tech giants, and that would certainly include Apple. The company could also turn such an operation into a direct revenue generator in the developed world. Bloomberg noted that Elon Musk‚Äôs Space Exploration Technologies Corp. forecasted $30 billion in satellite internet revenues by 2025. That‚Äôs serious money even for Apple. Apple could also use a satellite fleet for multiple purposes. The company could take its own photographs for Apple Maps, and sell those images on the open market like Google. Apple could also contribute to or compete with existing global positioning systems. Perhaps most importantly, Apple could use satellites to augment its own data distribution for iTunes and the App Store. Or Maybe Not Apple has tons of projects, most of which get killed along the way. Just because Apple hired two satellite experts and has them working in a new hardware team doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean Apple will ever be involved with satellites. In addition, just because these two folks are satellite experts doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean this team is even working on satellites. They‚Äôre reporting to someone who isn‚Äôt a satellite expert, for instance. But, it‚Äôs interesting news no matter how you slice it. I think many Apple fans would love for Apple to launch its own ISP, especially if it was dedicated to Apple‚Äôs existing commitment to privacy and security.

There are several amongst the low and middle income countries that have made hard target deadlines for rolling out internet access to their remotest regions, some of which will be satellite dependent. If Apple want to have access to these markets, and provide their services and platform, then engaging with Boeing or anyone else in that space (pun not intended), makes strategic sense. This also may provide Apple with an escape route around infrastructure controlled by a hostile or competing interests, be they government or private sector, as the privacy, censorship, and service wars continue to rage without sheriff or shepherd to serve as honest and empowered referee. There is little doubt that Apple have a longterm plan for the further development and consolidation of their platform, which will be dependent on an infrastructure that is future-proofed and option-rich.

Apple Glass concept. Credit: Tailosive Tech / YouTubeMore Apple Glass concept. Credit: Tailosive Tech / YouTube The leaked report, which was obtained by Gizmodo, makes note of over 70 incidents at Apple's campuses. Some of them are mundane, while other contain eyebrow-raising clues about the company's next wave of products. Several of these reports deal with eye strain issues, which gives a bit more weight to the possibility of an Apple AR headset. In one incident, an employee "experience discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points during the study." A separate report involved an employee dealing with eye pain after working with some sort of "new prototype."

One incident involved an employee getting hurt while out skiing to collect data that could be used to track skiing and snowboarding on an Apple Watch. Another report noted that an employee was hit by an Apple minivan, which, according to one of Gizmodo's sources, could be one of the vans that Apple uses to gather data for its Maps app. While injury reports are a strange place to find product news, some of these testing scenarios line up with rumored Apple products and features. The company has long been expected to jump into augmented reality ‚Äî Apple CEO Tim Cook has frequently championed the technology, and various rumors and patents have pointed to an Apple AR headset arriving some time in the near future.

John Fenwick, who led Google's spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, head of satellite engineering have left the company for a new hardware team at Apple which reports to Greg Duffy, co-founder of Dropcam. Fenwick co-founded Skybox Imaging in 2009 while Trela joined soon after as the company's first outside hire, according to their LinkedIn profiles. Skybox produced satellites about the size of a refrigerator, equipped to take detailed, near-constant images of the earth's surface. Prior to entering the startup world, Fenwick served in the U.S. Air Force and Trela was a spacecraft engineer at John Hopkins University. It's speculated that Apple could be looking to expand into satellite design and operation. One use for such technology would be a broadband service that could reach users who don't currently have Internet connectivity. It's also speculated that the executives could be working on a system to help Apple better collect mapping data, perhaps via the use of drones. Notably, rumors have suggested that Apple may be funding Boeing's V-band development work. Boeing has proposed a constellation of between 1,396 and 2,956 V-band satellites in 35-74 orbital planes at 1,200 km in altitude. The endeavor would create a global broadband system that would provide a wide range of advanced telecommunications services for commercial and governmental users.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple announces environmental progress in China Lens Technology has committed to power all of its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by the end of 2018, as part of Apple‚Äôs industry-leading supply chain clean energy program announced last year. Lens is the first supplier to make a¬†clean energy commitment for all of its Apple production, and will meet its goal through an unprecedented power purchase agreement with local wind projects. Apple is working with suppliers to help transform the environmental landscape in China, and is proud to announce all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL‚Äôs Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The UL standard certifies all of their¬†manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or, when necessary, converted into energy. Since the program began in January 2015, the sites have diverted more than 140,000 metric tons of waste from landfills. ‚ÄúWe want to show the world that you can manufacture responsibly and we‚Äôre working alongside our suppliers to help them lower their environmental impact in China,‚Äù said Lisa Jackson, Apple‚Äôs vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. ‚ÄúWe¬†congratulate Lens for their bold step, and hope by sharing the lessons we‚Äôve learned in our transition to renewable energy, our suppliers will continue to access clean power projects, moving China closer to its green manufacturing goals.‚Äù ‚ÄúOur power purchase agreement is the first of its kind in southern China and we hope it will serve as an example for other companies looking to transition to cleaner, more economical sources of power,‚Äù said Lens CEO Zhou Qunfei. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre pleased to be the first¬†supplier to commit to covering all of our Apple production with renewable energy, and proud to source from local Hunan wind farms to power our facilities in Changsha.‚Äù Lens‚Äô manufacturing with Apple currently includes two facilities in Changsha, Hunan province. Wind energy will cover 100 percent of the energy consumed producing Apple products at Lens facilities by 2018, avoiding nearly 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide¬†each year, equivalent to the energy use in 380,000 Chinese homes.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile These leaked iPhone 8 schematics are a travesty if they‚Äôre real Image Source: Moe Slah, ConceptsiPhone Zach Epstein @zacharye April 19th, 2017 at 10:31 AM Share Tweet After three straight years with the same iPhone design, Apple is expected to finally shake things up a bit in 2017. In fact, the company may be shaking things up more than usual. In years past, ‚ÄúS‚Äù updates feature (almost) the exact same design as their predecessors. This year, however, the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus are rumored to switch to a new design that features a glass back to facilitate¬†wireless charging. Then, of course, we have the iPhone 8, which is expected to be a bold reimagining of Apple‚Äôs iPhone design. Reports suggest that we can expect a sleek new ‚Äúfull-screen‚Äù design that does away with the home button and shrinks the bezels all the way around the new OLED display. But a new leak on Wednesday¬†shows a troubling design detail that would be an absolute travesty if the leak is genuine. Don't Miss: The best thing about Samsung‚Äôs new Galaxy S8, aside from the design We published our Galaxy S8 review on Tuesday morning, and we absolutely adore Samsung‚Äôs new smartphone design. It‚Äôs simply stunning, there‚Äôs no doubt about it. The build quality of the phone is outstanding, the performance is impressive, and the design is the best the world has ever seen. But the design isn‚Äôt perfect, and there‚Äôs one issue that really annoyed us. The back of a smartphone is the worst possible place for a fingerprint scanner, and we explained why in our review. In a nutshell, it‚Äôs simply not natural. If you keep your phone in your pocket, your thumb is naturally positioned where the home button is as you slide your handset out of your pocket. Even if you typically carry¬†your phone elsewhere, you‚Äôre always looking at the front of the device when you pick it up, so the fingerprint scanner should be on the front. If it‚Äôs on the back, you‚Äôre left feeling around the phone in an attempt to unlock it. Samsung compounded matters by placing the scanner off-center and far too high up the back of the phone, but anywhere on the back is bad news. That brings us to today‚Äôs new leak‚Ä¶ The above schematic was posted on Twitter on Wednesday by Sonny Dickson. Dickson has a mixed track record and he neglects to link the source that first posted the image, but the schematics appear to be taken from a Foxconn factory where the new iPhone 8 will be produced. If they‚Äôre the real deal, we‚Äôre not happy at all. Apple has been working for years on technology that would allow the company to embed its Touch ID fingerprint scanner beneath the display of an iPhone. The iPhone 8 has been rumored to be the first model that will actually feature the next-gen sensor. But more recent rumors have suggested that Apple is running into manufacturing issues that would prevent it from coming anywhere close to meeting demand if it does indeed opt for an embedded Touch ID sensor. Some reports have said that Apple is sticking with its guns, and it will embed the sensor in the screen. As a result, the iPhone 8 might not launch until sometime in October or even November. Other reports have claimed that Apple is scrapping the idea though, and it will instead move its fingerprint reader to the back of the iPhone 8. This would be awful, if true, and the schematic above pours more fuel on that fire ‚Äî an opening for a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner can clearly be seen beneath the Apple logo. It‚Äôs quite possible that this new schematic¬†is fake, or¬†that this is one of several designs Apple is toying with. Sadly, it‚Äôs also possible that this is the real deal, and that Apple plans to take a huge step backward with the iPhone 8 because it doesn‚Äôt want to wait another year before ditching the physical home button and shrinking those massive bezels.

The image above was part of the documents and describes how the setup includes the use of a Logitech wheel and pedals to actuate drive by wire. The document also talks about training drivers to test the system, which is mandated under California law, and it seems that drivers must pass seven tests before they can be considered fully trained. Each driver will be given two practice runs and three trials to pass each test which will be conducted on a private course. Now last we heard, Apple had given up on building their own car and could be choosing to focus on the software side of things instead. These documents and the permit does confirm that Apple is still interested in the tech, although exactly to what degree remains to be seen. After all many companies work on projects that don‚Äôt necessarily become a commercialized product, but we‚Äôll just have to wait and see. Filed in Apple >Transportation.

Boeing laid out a plan to provide broadband internet access through over 1,000 low-earth orbiting satellites in a 2016 regulatory filing, and a source ‚Äúfamiliar with the matter‚Äù told Bloomberg that Apple spoke with the aerospace company about coming an investor-partner in the project. Further, TMF Associates satellite and telecom consultant Tim Farrar wrote in a recent blog post¬†that industry insiders said Boeing‚Äôs project was being funded by Apple at the annual Satellite 2017 conference in Washington D.C. Farrar noted that¬†a Wall Street Journal article reported that Elon Musk‚Äôs Space Exploration Technologies has forecast $30 billion in revenue from satellite internet by 2025, showing the potential of the field. One of the major lures for tech companies like Apple, Google and Facebook to develop broadband internet is to tap into the large demographic of people who don‚Äôt yet have internet access, notes Bloomberg.¬†Facebook has long espoused this goal. The report also states that Apple might be putting its satellite experts to work on something else closely related ‚Äî such as drones or near space technology like high bandwidth radio transceivers or high-altitude balloons. Whatever it is, however, likely has its home in the sky.

That would be a pretty damn big deal for an autonomous vehicle network to have access to a dedicated and higher accuracy network of positioning sats. TrickyDickie We‚Äôll have to wait and see on the accuracy lol But it would be impressive. And within their mantra of controlling all aspects of their stuff. It‚Äôs Me true enough. But if it is only as accurate as the existing and publicly accessible GPS network, I don‚Äôt see Apple wanting to invest tens of billions of dollars to have their own. Controlling their own systems and supplies is important but only when their is some type of advantage. Boeing isn‚Äôt exactly new to the aerospace business.

Noodlecake Studios is a small indie game studio proudly based in Saskatchewan‚Äôs biggest city since 2011. Apple recently recognized the company as one of Canada‚Äôs top game makers in the newly minted ‚Äúmade in Canada‚Äù section of the App Store. ‚ÄúTo be profiled by a company like Apple as one of the top makers in Canada, the first one, is you know pretty humbling and we‚Äôre very excited to see where it can lead, because you never know,‚Äù said Ryan Holowaty, Noodlecake‚Äôs vice president of business. The company acknowledges that it‚Äôs based in an unlikely city. On its website, Noodlecake describes Saskatoon as ‚Äúa.k.a. the middle of nowhere Canada‚Äù and pokes fun at the fact it chose to plant roots in a ‚Äúbig patch of barren land in the middle of the country‚Äù over Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver. But its headquarters hasn‚Äôt held Noodlecake back. The studio started in its founder‚Äôs kitchen and had early success with games like Stickman Golf. The app has since had several sequels, was named one of the best apps of 2013 and has been translated into more than 10 languages. In six years, Noodlecake has designed hundreds of mobile games for both Android and Apple devices. The company now employs 15 game developers and also makes third-party video games comes to life. In a roundabout way, Noodlecake has become an ambassador of sorts for Saskatchewan. ‚ÄúIf we go to San Francisco to a conference and people ask where we‚Äôre from and we say Saskatchewan, and people are like, ‚ÄòWhere is that?‚Äô They have no idea where it is,‚Äù said CEO Jordan Schidlowsky. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think many people know that stuff like this is happening in Saskatoon or Saskatchewan, so it is cool to shed light on the tech industry.‚Äù With files from CTV Saskatoon Related Stories Startups in Japan getting ample cash but lack innovators 'Pokemon Go' or no?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Hardware Image Source: Shutterstock Not everyone is a fan of Apple‚Äôs recycling program Yoni Heisler @edibleapple April 20th, 2017 at 9:00 PM Share Tweet Perhaps more so than any other large-scale tech company, Apple prides itself for its commitment to the environment and for its ongoing efforts to ‚Äúleave the world better than we found it.‚Äù Earlier this week, with Earth Day on the horizon, Apple released its 2017 Environmental Responsibility Report and signaled its plan to eventually stop mining the earth for materials. Don't Miss: It‚Äôs official: Everyone hates the iPhone 8 design that just leaked ‚ÄúIt sounds crazy, but we‚Äôre working on it,‚Äù Apple‚Äôs report reads in part. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going deeper to pioneer a closed-loop supply chain, where products are made using only renewable resources or recycled material to reduce the need to mine materials from the earth. That means continuing to invest in ways to recover materials from our products‚Äîlike Liam, our line of disassembly robots‚Äîand encouraging our customers to return products through Apple Renew, our recycling program.‚Äù Incidentally, Apple introduced its Liam robot last year when it rolled out the iPhone SE, a video of which can be seen below. Now recycling old products is a great way to harvest materials, but some folks are claiming that the rules governing what¬†Apple‚Äôs recycling partners can and can‚Äôt do with old machines could be far more environmentally friendly. According to a report from Vice, Apple‚Äôs recycling partners are subject to contracts which prevent them from reusing, reselling or harvesting parts from older iPhones and MacBooks. Instead, piles of old Apple products are shredded into tiny sized pieces whereupon similar metals are grouped together and, per Apple, are then used ‚Äúfor production stock in new products.‚Äù It‚Äôs arguably a bit nit-picky, but some folks feel that Apple can do better in this regard. Jason Koebler of Vice writes: Kyle Wiens, the CEO of iFixit, notes that recycling ‚Äúshould be a last option‚Äù because unrecyclable rare earth metals are completely lost and melted down commodities are less valuable and of generally of a lower quality than freshly mined ones. Repair and reuse are much better ways to extend the value of the original mined materials. To be clear, Apple‚Äôs practices are often against the wishes of the recycling companies themselves, who don‚Äôt like to shred products that are still valuable. In a weird twist of fate, I visited ECS Refining before I knew that it did recycling for Apple. While I was there, I watched workers crowbar and crack open recent-model MacBook Pro Retinas‚Äîworth hundreds of dollars even when they‚Äôre completely broken‚Äîto be scrapped into their base materials. I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs fair to call Apple out in this regard but it‚Äôs an interesting point of view to consider nonetheless. The main problem with this critique, I think, is that it‚Äôs easy to nitpick about what Apple can do better while completely ignoring the industry-leading measures Apple has made with respect to environmental responsibility over the last few years.

Amazon Music Unlimited is Amazon's take on a subscription music streaming service. When you think about it, picking a music streaming service is no easy task. Between Apple Music, Pandora, Google Play Music, Spotify, and about a hundred other similar services, it's genuinely difficult to sort through the cruft and find something that's worth sticking with. If you happen to be in that sorting-through-the-cruft stage, you might want to give Amazon Music Unlimited a go ‚Äî the company's take on a subscription music streaming service is, at the very least, on par with most other offerings. To get a better idea of what Amazon Music Unlimited offers, you can peruse our FAQ! OK, at the very base level, what is it? Amazon Music Unlimited is a subscription-based music streaming service that'll run you anywhere between $3.99 and $14.99 a month (more on that later). It's Amazon's Apple Music. It's Amazon's Spotify. It's Amazon's Google Play Music ‚Ä¶ you get the picture. There are ‚Äî broadly speaking ‚Äî two types of music streaming services: radio and on-demand. The free version of Pandora is an example of the radio-style music streaming service; you choose a song, artist, title, or genre to start with and the service builds a playlist inspired by your choice. Skipping songs is typically limited and ads usually play between tracks. Limited skips and advertisements are the price to pay for a free music streaming service. Amazon Music Unlimited is the other type of streaming service, the on-demand type. When you subscribe to Music Unlimited, you get access to a catalog of tens of millions of songs that you can stream and download without ads and with as many hits of the next button as your heart desires. Nice! In what countries is it available? At last count, Amazon Music Unlimited was available in four countries: Austria, Germany, the United States, and the U.K. Got it. Next question: How big is the library? Amazon says there are "tens of millions" of songs available in the Amazon Music Unlimited library and sadly that's as specific as they get. See, here's the thing about most modern streaming music services: Deep down inside, they're all very similar. Most streaming music companies are able to get the same or similar deals for music distribution, so the size of the music library is bound to be pretty consistent across the industry. Because of these similarities, companies aren't motivated to be too detailed about specs unless they have a spec that sets them apart. Amazon says Music Unlimited has "tens of millions" of songs, Spotify says it offers "over 30 million tracks" ‚Äî so who has more? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è You can't be sure (and that's the idea). What devices does it support? ALL THE DEVICES! Music Unlimited is available on your iOS (or Android) devices, your Mac (or your PC), your Fire TV, Apple CarPlay, and Alexa devices like the Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, and Echo Tap. The only device it's not available on is your Apple TV. Sigh. Amazon Music on iOS - Free - Download Now Amazon Music on macOS - Free - Download Now Amazon Music on the web - Free - Check it out Does it offer student and family rates? No and yes, respectively. Amazon Music Unlimited offers a six-member family plan, but there's no special rate for students. But enough about family and student rates! Amazon Music Unlimited has one of the most interesting pricing models I've seen in a music streaming service. So interesting, in fact, that I'm going to go ahead and lay out all the details in a handy chart for you! Plan Prime Member Pricing (per month) Non-Prime Pricing (per month) Echo $3.99 $3.99 Individual $7.99 $9.99 Family $14.99 $14.99 Understanding Amazon Music Unlimited plans Music Unlimited Echo Plan: This plan is exclusive to owners of an Amazon Echo, Dot, or Tap. For $3.99 a month, users can stream from the full Amazon Music Unlimited library (tens of millions of songs) on-demand and ad-free. The only catch is it's exclusive to your Echo device ‚Äî your subscription won't grant you access to Amazon Music Unlimited on the web or in the app. Music Unlimited Individual Plan: This plan works on all your devices. For $7.99 a month for Amazon Prime members and $9.99 a month for non-Prime members, you get access to tens of millions of songs on the web, in the app, and on any of your Echo devices. Music Unlimited Family Plan: This plan also works on all your devices. For $14.99 a month for both Amazon Prime members and non-Prime members, you and up to six family members get access to tens of millions of songs on the web, in the app, and on any of your Echo devices. I should also mention there's an entirely separate Prime Music service that's exclusive to Amazon Prime members. You get access to over 2 million songs and can listen on-demand and ad-free. This service is free for anyone who subscribes to Amazon Prime and it's available for use on your Amazon Echo. How does it compare to other music streaming services? It's a whole lot like other music streaming services but there are a few differences. And y'know, I had so much fun making that last chart I thought it'd be great to build another one. Here's a glimpse at how Music Unlimited compares to other popular streaming services! Spotify Apple Music Google Play Music Amazon Prime Music Pandora Free trial period 30 days 3 months 30 days 30 days (with Prime membership) 30 days for Premium, 7 days for Plus Price $9.99/month ($14.99 for family up to 6 people) $9.99/month ($14.99 for family up to 6 people) $9.99 ($14.99 for family up to 6 people) Comes with Prime membership ($99/year), $7.99/month for Unlimited Pandora Premium: $4.99/month, $54.89/year Pandora Plus: $9.99/month, $109.89/year Library size ~ 30 million songs ~ 40 million songs ~ 40 million songs ~ 2 million (may differ depending on location), ~ 40 million (Unlimited) ~ 40 million Number of countries supported Over 60 Over 110 Over 60 See Amazon Australia, New Zealand, U.S.A.

Otherwise, they should at least allow for two people to stream from the plan at the same time for no additional cost. 0 4 days ago Reply RhymingDesigner Hey Mikah, good article. I especially liked your charts. I've been a Spotify paid member for three years and am happy ‚Äì but might be persuaded to switch someday. One thing I like about Spotify is that I can download 3,333 songs per device with a three-device maximum. You say that offline downloading is part of the Amazon package, but don't give specifics. Also, I know Spotify has a free trial, but what about AMU? I'm going to head on over to Amazon now for more info. 0 4 days ago Reply Paul5555p I've been using my free trial on Apple Music and its almost at its end (April 26). I will not be using it as a paid subscriber, just didn't seem to be a good fit for me. At the same time I've been using Amazon Music with my Prime membership and liking it very much, it does everything I want and seems to work great. I have had some, well several issues with Apple Music and the Siri interface, I ask Siri to play some things and no response or the wrong response. Amazon lets me tell it music I don't like and it won't play it or offer it up as a suggestion, very handy. For now its Amazon Music for me. 0 4 days ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Photo / Chris Ratcliffe After revolutionizing phones, Apple is testing self-driving cars and exploring augmented reality. Recent hires suggest the company is now also looking to the skies. The iPhone maker has recruited a pair of top Google satellite executives for a new hardware team, according to people familiar with the matter. John Fenwick, who led Google's spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, head of satellite engineering, left Alphabet's Google for Apple in recent weeks, the people said. They report to Greg Duffy, co-founder of camera maker Dropcam, who joined Apple earlier this year, the people said. They asked not to be identified talking about Apple's private plans. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment, as did Google. Fenwick, Trela and Duffy didn't respond to requests for comment. With the recruits, Apple is bringing into its ranks two experts in the demanding, expensive field of satellite design and operation. At the moment, these endeavors typically fall into two fields: satellites for collecting images and those for communications. In a regulatory filing last year, Boeing detailed a plan to provide broadband access through more than 1,000 satellites in low-earth orbit. The aerospace company has talked with Apple about the technology company being an investor-partner in the project, a person familiar with the situation said. It's unclear if those talks will result in a deal. At the annual Satellite 2017 conference in Washington D.C. last month, industry insiders said Boeing's project was being funded by Apple, Tim Farrar, a satellite and telecom consultant at TMF Associates, wrote in a recent blog. Continued below. Related Content Brian Gaynor: No reason to go back to the bad old days 60-plus, swindled and flat broke Imposing GST on low-value imports doesn't level the playing field A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. "It's not hard to discern why Apple might want to consider a satellite constellation," Farrar wrote, noting a Wall Street Journal report that Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp. has forecast $30 billion in revenue from satellite internet by 2025. A lure for technology companies like Apple, Google and Facebook is to connect billions of people who don't have internet access yet. The broadband services being explored by Boeing and others would feature low latency and faster speeds than existing cellular systems. "You have a new wave of enthusiastic people who aren't inhibited by the hard knocks of the past," said Roger Rusch, who heads satellite consulting firm TelAstra. Still, TMF's Farrar said there's no guarantee Apple will get involved in the Boeing project. The satellite industry is littered with bankruptcies and other failures. Satellite telephone company Iridium filed for bankruptcy protection in 1999, and Teledesic abandoned its "internet from the sky" plan more than a decade ago. It's not hard to discern why Apple might want to consider a satellite constellation. Tim Farrar, a satellite and telecom consultant at TMF Associates Indeed, Apple may have hired the Google executives for something other than satellite work. It's already trying to use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans. And in 2015, it acquired Aether Industries, which develops near-space technology such as high bandwidth radio transceivers and high-altitude balloons. Duffy, Fenwick and Trela's new boss, has mostly consumer product experience from Dropcam. It's internet-connected security camera stored images and video of homes and sent alerts to a smartphone app. Alphabet's Nest acquired the business in 2014. After a tumultuous stint there, Duffy joined Apple to form a new team reporting Dan Riccio, who oversees hardware teams for the iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple's augmented reality efforts, the people familiar with the matter said. Fenwick and Trela joined Alphabet's Google in 2014 when the search giant acquired Skybox Imaging, their satellite-imaging startup, for $500 million. However, this year Google sold the renamed business, Terra Bella, to startup Planet Labs, a one-time Skybox rival. Google also planned to invest about $1 billion in an internal satellite internet initiative run by industry veteran Greg Wyler, however Wyler left to start satellite communications firm OneWeb, and Google ended up investing $1 billion in SpaceX. Fenwick co-founded Skybox Imaging in 2009 while Trela joined soon after as the company's first outside hire, according to their LinkedIn profiles. Skybox produced satellites about the size of a refrigerator, equipped to take detailed, near-constant images of the earth's surface. Prior to entering the startup world, Fenwick served in the U.S. Air Force and Trela was a spacecraft engineer at John Hopkins University.

For Android users that might own an Apple TV that could have been a bit of a downer. Fret not, though. Much as doubleTwist was the first to bring AirPlay streaming to Android, they're one of the first to bring it back. I know that it's not very likely that Apple TV is a popular product among our readers, but for those that did make use of it the inconvenience after the recent 10.2 update must have been a bit annoying. For those out of the loop, it further locked down AirPlay by using a new pairing process, likely intended to restrict use of the protocol to Apple products. Thankfully for those that mix and match ecosystems, doubleTwist was able to work some magic on that proprietary mess and get things working again. Their full statement is available below. Back in May 2011, we were the first to bring AirPlay music streaming to Android, helping hundreds of thousands of Android users listen to their favorite tunes through their Apple TV and other AirPlay-compatible devices. Fast forward to April 2017 and Apple, in a surprising and anachronistic move, released a 4th generation Apple TV firmware update (tvOS 10.2) that blocked 3rd party apps from supporting AirPlay by requiring a proprietary pairing process conveniently restricted to Apple apps and devices. Yep, Apple wants you to switch to an iPhone if you happen to own an Apple TV! But users today demand interoperability between their devices. Modern households are diverse ecosystems of connected devices, full of iPhones, Android phones, smart TVs and a cacophony of gadgets. So we went ahead and added support for Apple‚Äôs new pairing process in the latest doubleTwist Pro release because we believe the era of walled gardens is long gone. The AirPlay functionality is also live for CloudPlayer so you can stream your cloud music to your Apple TV. Happy listening! If you mix and match things to such a degree that you need to side-load the app, APKMirror's got your back.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Wearables Image Source: iDropNews Apple is already using a screen technology that‚Äôs better than OLED, report says Chris Smith @chris_writes April 20th, 2017 at 6:04 PM Share Tweet Apple is widely expected to launch an OLED iPhone this year, which would be a first for the iPhone since its introduction 10 years ago. But a new report from Korea suggests that Apple is already working on a new screen technology that might debut with the Apple Watch Series 3 later this year. The next-gen wearable will have a new type of display, one that could then be used on future iPhone models, and potentially impact the bottom line of various Apple suppliers. Don't Miss: It‚Äôs official: Everyone hates the iPhone 8 design that just leaked According to Business Korea, the Apple Watch Series 3 will have a micro-LED display rather than an OLED screen as its predecessors. If micro-LED sounds familiar that‚Äôs because a flurry of reports in late 2015 and early 2016 claimed that an Apple team is working on this particular technology in a secret lab in Taiwan. Micro-LED screens should be smaller than alternatives, and more energy-efficient. Business Korea notes that micro-LED displays would also be thinner and lighter than OLED or LCD screens. LG, the exclusive provider of OLED screens for the Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2 is expected to take a financial hit to the tune of over $200 million when Apple makes the switch from OLED to micro-LED. The report says that Apple will actually begin mass production of micro-LED for the next Apple Watch in Taiwan at the end of the year. The worry here is that once the technology is further perfected, Apple might fully make the jump from OLED to micro-LED. The report says that Samsung and LG would lose around $1 billion a year should they lose Apple‚Äôs business. It‚Äôs not clear when Apple would be ready to use micro-LED display tech in bigger devices like the iPhone. The report says that Apple is likely to use OLED displays for the iPhone 9 that will be launched next year, but these panels would be manufactured by Chinese company BOE. Even in such a case, South Korean suppliers would lose some of Apple‚Äôs business. Multiple reports in the past years have detailed the efforts of various display makers, including Samsung, LG, Japan Display, BOE, and others to win Apple‚Äôs OLED display orders. Currently, Samsung is in an advantageous position, being the exclusive supplier of the iPhone 8‚Äôs OLED screen. Apple is likely looking to add more vendors to the mix, to make sure it has enough stock on hand, and that it can keep driving costs downwards.

It was a big thing for iPhone and Apple disciples, who have waited for the launch of new products since Tim Cook assumed the Apple chief executive officer seat. New products were promised for launch early this year, and it has been a long wait for Apple customers, who yesterday stayed glued to their favourite blogs and mobile apps for updates hours before the live launch streaming from the USA.¬† The new iPhones will run a new version of Apple‚Äôs mobile operating system called iOS 8, which the company first unveiled at its WorldWide Developers‚Äô Conference (WWDC) in June. The iOS 8 has a powerful new feature called HealthKit to monitor your health which will tie together data from fitness trackers and things like blood pressure sensors. It also has HomeKit, which can control a wide range of home automation devices like lights and central heating. To add glitz and fanfare to an already hyped up launch, Apple returned to the Flint Center, the first time in 30 years, for the announcement its newest batch of products. The Flint Centre is the historic site where a bowtie-wearing 28-year-old Steve Jobs first took the stage to unveil the world‚Äôs first truly personal computer: The Macintosh. Cook was hoping that yesterday‚Äô launch would prove to be defining moment for Apple, just as the 1984 unveiling of the Macintosh converted thousands worldwide into faithful followers of Apple.¬† Apple has been on the receiving end over the last period with enthusiasts questioning its ability to innovate new products, besides iPhone, iPods and Macs that have now become, they say, antiquated. Apple launched the iPad in 2010, three years after the iPhone that came six years after the first iPod. Everyone now is looking to see just how innovative can Apple be, by judging the newly released smartphones and tablets, not to mention the wearable device.¬† The problem with today‚Äôs smartwatches is that they‚Äôre essentially shrunken-down smartphones, not just in terms of design, but internal specs too. Smartwatches like Samsung‚Äôs line of Gear devices or LG‚Äôs new G watch use many of the same components as smartphones, which explains their chunky designs and generally terrible battery life.¬† ‚Äì Compiled from www.businessinsider.com TAGS Apple iphone iphone6 SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleN$65 000 for vulnerable learners Next articleConsumer Court ‚ÄòNommer Asseblief‚Äô (Number Please) RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Features MTC to launch iPhone 5C and 5S LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Please enter your comment!

According to The Korea Herald, some Galaxy S8 users are complaining about a reddish tint to their device‚Äôs display. The issues reportedly are affecting both the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8+. Samsung issued a statement¬†telling those suffering from the issue to adjust the color of the display in order to fix the problem.¬†According to some people experiencing the problem, adjusting the color balance does solve the problem. If this fix doesn‚Äôt help fix your display, Samsung recommends taking the device into a local service center¬†to receive a replacement device. This isn‚Äôt the only problem¬†plaguing Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ users. We‚Äôre also seeing complaints about battery life, issues with the fingerprint sensor (which, we might add, is in an awkward location), issues with various apps and services including Bixby, GPS problems, Bluetooth problems, weird lag, and issues with Wi-Fi. We‚Äôve also heard about problems with the initial setup/activation, Galaxy S8 shipping issues, and billing problems. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning¬†that the Samsung Galaxy S8 is reportedly extremely difficult to repair. iFixIt gave the device a 4 out of 10 with 10 being the easiest. This is just the tip of the iceberg and we expect the number of Galaxy S8 problems to grow in the near future. There‚Äôs no telling what you‚Äôll see when you startup your Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8+ for the first time so you‚Äôll want to be as prepared as possible. How to Fix Galaxy S8 Problems If you run into a Galaxy S8 problem there‚Äôs no need to panic. Chances are, you‚Äôll be able to fix your problem in a matter of minutes. Take a look at our list of fixes for the most common Samsung Galaxy problems before you take your phone down to a store or get in contact with¬†customer service over the phone or on the internet. Our list includes fixes for abnormal battery drain, Wi-Fi problems, Bluetooth issues, and various performance problems. It‚Äôs a great starting point for those of you struggling with problems. If you don‚Äôt find what you‚Äôre looking for there, here are a few other places to look for solutions to your Galaxy S8 problems: XDA-Developers Galaxy S8 Forums Android Central Galaxy S8 Forums Carrier Support¬†Forums (AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, etc) You also might try getting in touch with Samsung customer service or your service provider through their websites, customer service lines or through their social media pages on sites like Twitter. Where to Find Feedback As we push away from the Galaxy S8 release date, current and prospective¬†Galaxy S8¬†owners¬†should keep an eye on feedback. This feedback will alert you to potential Galaxy S8¬†problems and¬†the potential benefits/repercussions of installing¬†new software on your device. We expect Samsung and its carriers to push out bug fix updates to the devices in the near future. If you‚Äôre on the fence about buying the Galaxy S8, feedback from current owners will¬†help you make an informed decision. The first place to look are the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ reviews that‚Äôve popped up around the web. Again, reviews have mostly been positive but reviewers have encountered annoying bugs and problems. If you‚Äôre looking for something a little bit different, check out these Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ user reviews. We‚Äôve put together some early impressions of the Galaxy S8 and we‚Äôll have our full review with long-term feedback posted in the near future. Once Samsung and its carrier partners start pushing out new Galaxy S8 updates, you‚Äôll want to head XDA-Developers and official forums at carriers like¬†AT&T,¬†Verizon¬†and¬†Sprint. We‚Äôll see a ton of feedback emerge there. You should also use social media sites like Twitter to find valuable feedback from Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ users. Galaxy S8 Updates If you can‚Äôt find a fix for your Galaxy S8¬†problem know that you‚Äôll probably be on your own for¬†long¬†periods of time. Samsung and its carrier partners will push out periodic bug fix updates to the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ but they can be sporadic. The company‚Äôs already issued a global firmware update to both devices. The update delivers the April security patch. It also disables the ability to remap the Bixby button on the two¬†devices. New Galaxy S8 owners will be prompted to download this update once¬†the device is connected to the internet. According to¬†ZDNet,¬†Samsung is planning to issue a software update to fix the ‚Äúreddish tint‚Äù issues that‚Äôve plagued early adopters in the days since release. It sounds like the update will¬†regulate¬†the color balance of¬†the display. It should also expand the device‚Äôs color range so that users have more options when manually changing the appearance of the display. We don‚Äôt know when this update will roll out exactly but we expect it to be out for most devices before the end of the month. The company¬†will also roll out its¬†monthly security updates¬†to the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+¬†but there‚Äôs no guarantee these updates¬†will have bug fixes on board.¬†Most don‚Äôt. There‚Äôs also chatter about a Galaxy S8 Android 7.1 Nougat update but thus far, the company appears to be sticking with Android 7.0 Nougat. You can‚Äôt rely on Samsung or your carrier to fix your problems with the Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8+. If you run into an issue, you‚Äôll want to be extremely proactive. How to Prepare for Galaxy S8 Updates At some point, your device might get a bug fix update aimed at correcting some of these early Galaxy S8 problems. For instance, we wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Samsung issues another bug fix to address this¬†‚Äúreddish tint‚Äù issue. Software updates can be beneficial but they can also¬†cause some problems of their own so you‚Äôll want to be prepared. It‚Äôs impossible to predict what you might run into so it‚Äôs important to prepare your device before¬†you install a new update on your Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8+. A little prep¬†work can go a long way toward preventing issues. To help, we‚Äôve put together a game plan that¬†takes you through the steps we take before installing a new piece of software on our Galaxy devices. If the Galaxy S8 is your first Android device¬†or if you simply want some additional help, take a look at our walkthrough. 3 Reasons Not to Install Galaxy S7 Nougat & 7 Reasons You Should Install Nougat If You Want Better Security ¬† 1 / 10 Let's start with some basics. If you value your security, and most of you probably do, you'll want to¬†think about installing the Galaxy S7 Nougat update soon after it arrives for your device.¬† Every month, Google and Samsung release important security patches for Android devices. The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7¬†Android Nougat updates should bring the latest security patches to your device. Samsung's initial batch of Galaxy S7 Nougat updates¬†delivered the company's January security update¬†while upcoming updates could deliver the patches from the February security¬†update.¬†You can read more about their contents on Samsung's website.¬† If you failed to download or receive an older¬†security update (December, November, etc), the patches from those updates might¬†be baked into your version of Nougat. If not, you¬†might be forced to install them manually before you can download Nougat.¬† On top of the patches, Samsung's Galaxy S7 Nougat update brings Samsung Pass, a¬†way to secure¬†your identity using biometric data rather than entering your password or ID.¬† Samsung Pass is like a master key for your various logins and it relies on Galaxy S7's fingerprint scanner. The biometric data is encrypted and stored safely¬†by Samsung Knox. ¬† 1 / 10 One Response 04/22/2017 Dave Reply Got my Sprint S8 this past Wednesday April 20th and I started having problems as soon as it was powered up. For some strange reason it would not make or receive calls even though it was up on the network and able to access the internet and send and receive text messages. But, it is able to do so in Worcester Massachusetts at the Sprint store. I talked the store into swapping out the phone only to have the same issue when I got home. ;( Funny thing is that my old S6 and my wife‚Äôs S3 have absolutely no problems at all, never did. This situation has been going on for several days now with Sprint swapping my S6 back so I would have a phone to use till the problem is resolved. At this point I will be taking both the S8 and my S6 on a trip to the NYC area this week and having it activated again when I get there to test it out. My suspicion at this point is that the Sprint network in my small town area of S Central Massachusetts is lacking some unknown key signal component from the older Sprint tower causing the dropped calls situation. Sprint‚Äôs highest level tech support is working with me on this issue, we even had a conference call with Samsung, but they were absolutely no help at all. They had me clear the cash then pretended that they could not hear me and hung up when they wanted to cut me lose. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

The player, which Young promised would allow artists to sell their music in a form in which it was meant to be heard, really never made it far out of the gate. Announced five years ago, music lovers didn't adapt very quickly and, in July of 2016, the store that sold the downloadable music suddenly went into an "under construction" mode. Yesterday, Young posted a long note explaining what had happened to the product. The first problem was the high cost of the music which Neil says was forced by the record companies who thought consumers should pay more for a better quality product. Then, the company that was running the store, Omnifone, was purchased by Apple and almost immediately shut down. Young and company tried to develop their own storefront but the costs got too large and they had to abandon the effort. He finally confirmed what everyone had been suspected for some time, the store was not coming back and the product was dead:¬†"sadly with Pono gone..." Young, though, had not given up on bringing high-resolution music to the people but, this time, he is focusing on streaming. He is working with Orastream, a company in Singapore, to create Xstream, "the next generation in streaming". He is also working with the record companies to try and convince them that this is the way the music should be heard and that charging a premium for it is not the way to bring in consumers. "Good sounding music is not a premium. All songs should cost the same, regardless of digital resolution." It sounds like Young is truly dedicated to bringing high-resolution music to the masses but we do feel he has a long, uphill, battle against the ingrained money machine in the music industry. Young's full statement: It‚Äôs time to talk about Pono and the initiative we all started. As you know, together we‚Äôve been fighting a battle to bring high quality music back to the world that‚Äôs become used to mediocre, hollowed-out files. The cause seemed to be a win-win for everyone. The artists would allow their fans to hear what they hear in the studios, and the music lovers would hear the music the best it could be. This cause has been something I‚Äôve written and talked about for over 20 years. I cared and I assumed that most of the world would care. It‚Äôs been almost five years since we kicked off the campaign at SXSW to offer a player and download content that could fulfill my dream of bringing to you a music experience unlike any other for the cost. Thanks to our supporters on Kickstarter, the follow-on customers and some very good friends that supported the effort, we delivered on that promise. Our player won best digital portable product of the year from Stereophile Magazine, and we offered some of the best high resolution content to be found anywhere. We sold tens of thousands of players, every unit that we made. Thanks for that! But, despite that success, I was not satisfied. I had to put up with lots of criticism for the high cost of music delivered in the way all music should be provided, at full resolution and not hollowed out. I had no control over the pricing, but I was the one that felt the criticism, because I was the face of it. And I pretty much agreed with the criticism. Music should not be priced this way. Last year when Omnifone, our download store partner, was bought and shut down with no notice by Apple, we began work with another company to build the same download store. But the more we worked on it, the more we realized how difficult it would be to recreate what we had and how costly it was to run it: to deliver the Pono promise, meaning you‚Äôd never have to buy the same album again if was released at a higher quality; the ability to access just high res music, and not the same performances at lower quality, and the ability to do special sales. Each of these features was expensive to implement. I also realized that just bringing back the store was not enough. While there was a dedicated audience, I could not in good conscience continue to justify the higher costs. When it comes to high res, the record industry is still broken. The industry was such that even when I wanted to remaster some of the great performances from my artist friends at high res, Pono had to pay thousands of dollars for each recording, with little expectation of getting the money back. Record companies believe they should charge a premium for high res recordings and conversely, I believe all music should cost the same, regardless of the technology used. As you might imagine, I found it difficult to raise more money for this model: delivering quality music at a premium price to a limited audience that felt they were being taken advantage of with the high costs. So now, sadly with Pono gone, for more than eight months I‚Äôve been working with our small team to look for alternatives. Finding a way to deliver the quality music without the expense and to bring it to a larger audience has been our goal. That effort has led to a technology developed by Orastream, a small company in Singapore that we‚Äôve been working with. Together we created Xstream, the next generation of streaming, an adaptive streaming service that changes with available bandwidth. It is absolutely amazing because it is capable of complete high resolution playback. Unlike all other streaming services that are limited to playing at a single low or moderate resolution, Xstream plays at the highest quality your network condition allows at that moment and adapts as the network conditions change. It‚Äôs a single high resolution bit-perfect file that essentially compresses as needed to never stop playing. As a result, it always sounds better than the other streaming services and it never stops or buffers like other higher res services. When you play it at home with WiFi it can play all established low and high resolutions, including the highest, and thousands more levels of resolution in between. When you are in your car with poor cellular it might play better than an existing low res service, but at a location where robust wifi is available Xstream supports high resolution listening. Xstream is one file, streaming for all with 15,000 seamlessly changing levels of playback quality. So, this is what we‚Äôve been working on. But one of my conditions is that it should not have a premium price. I‚Äôve insisted that there be no premium price for this service. Pono tried that with downloads and it‚Äôs not a good model for customers. And I‚Äôve told the labels it‚Äôs not a good model for them to charge a premium for music the way it was meant to be heard. I firmly believe that music is in trouble because you can‚Äôt hear it the way it is created unless you pay a premium. No one gets to hear the real deal, so the magic of music is compromised by limited technology. Good sounding music is not a premium. All songs should cost the same, regardless of digital resolution. Let the people decide what they want to listen to without charging them more for true quality. That way quality is not an elitist thing. If high resolution costs more, listeners will just choose the cheaper option and never hear the quality. Record companies will ultimately lose more money by not exposing the true beauty of their music to the masses. Remember, all music is created to sound great and the record labels are the one‚Äôs deciding to not offer that at the normal price. The magic of music should be presented by the stewards of that music at a normal price. Let listeners decide on the quality they want to purchase without pricing constraints. I‚Äôve been meeting with and speaking with the labels, potential partners such as the carriers, and other potential investors. For many it‚Äôs a difficult sell. There are already streaming services, some doing well and others not. While there‚Äôs nothing as good as Xstream, or as flexible and adaptive, it‚Äôs still proven a difficult sell for companies to invest in. So, in my experience, today‚Äôs broken music industry continues to make major mistakes, but we are still trying. Bringing back the magic of great sound matters to the music of the world. Thank you all very much for supporting Pono and quality audio. Thanks to everyone who is or was associated with Pono, especially the customers who supported us. Thanks to Charlie Hansen and Ayre Acoustics for the great PonoPlayer. It has been a labor of love. I want you to know that I‚Äôm still trying to make the case for bringing you the best music possible, at a reasonable price, the same message we brought to you five years ago. I don‚Äôt know whether we will succeed, but it‚Äôs still as important to us as it ever was. Thankfully, for those of my audience who care and want to hear all the music, every recording I have ever released will soon be available in Xstream high resolution quality at my complete online archive. Check it out. We will be announcing it very soon.

While that sounds like a very big step forward, the company admitted it doesn‚Äôt yet have a viable plan to achieve this promise. In its latest Environmental Responsibility Report the iPhone-maker touted and sustainable products. The company is already running all of its data centers fully off of renewable sources, and it plans to bring a total of 4 Gigawatts of renewable energy online by 2020. Outside of renewable energy the company also focused on so-called conflict minerals like gold, tantalum, tungsten, tin, and other elements that are indispensable for the modern tech industry, but are usually marred in human rights abuses and disastrous environmental exploitation. Apple said it will eventually no longer need to buy newly-mined materials. The company highlighted its efforts to reduce the need for such mined minerals, through recycling older devices and redesigning products to use fewer resources. However, its executives admitted they‚Äôre still a long way from using 100% recycled materials and there‚Äôs no clear timeframe in place for reaching that goal. Still, environmental awareness and the focus on renewable energy has been driving the tech sector forward in recent years, not only because it‚Äôs good for the planet and us humans, but also because in most cases these approaches prove to be financially beneficial to the companies themselves. So we‚Äôll no doubt continue to see companies, including Apple, make efforts in these areas.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 376 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares557 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‚Äòello to Allo 5 I‚Äôve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin‚Äô 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life‚Äîif something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google‚Äôs messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google‚Äôs recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google‚Äôs master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google‚Äôs inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We‚Äôre getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‚Äò07-‚Äô09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google‚Äôs various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google‚Äôs messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let‚Äôs take a look at Google‚Äôs messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of ‚ÄúBabel‚Äù were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie‚Äôs business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google‚Äôs ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an ‚ÄúAssistant,‚Äù it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‚Äòello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? ‚ÄúI may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.‚Äù Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says ‚ÄúOk, go on.‚Äù As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I‚Äôve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin‚Äô RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said ‚ÄúJibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they‚Äôll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.‚Äù He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier‚Äôs pipes unless it‚Äôs profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that‚Äôs left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google‚Äôs messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won‚Äôt have any appreciable effect on Android‚Äôs market share. Keep doing what you‚Äôve been doing; keep an app folder called ‚Äúmessaging‚Äù on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone‚Äôs guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children‚Äôs children about what is was like ‚Äúback in the day‚Äù when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah üòÇ I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah üòÇ As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... üòÇ DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Hence the reason the text is upside down in our hemisphere. 2kool4skool Lol yeah, I didn't read your comment before I typed mine. TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes üôÑ) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl ‚Ä¶ üôÑ abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life‚Äîif something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed üò≠ Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted‚Äã to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall‚Äôs Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall‚Äôs Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall‚Äôs Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: ‚ÄúHaving chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders‚Äîno matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.‚Äù - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of ‚Äúabsolute‚Äù language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Wesley Da‚ÄôNomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? üôÉ Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tom√°s O‚ÄôMert√† How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here.

A mobile-phone application that SPIC (the Society for the Promotion of Information Technology in Chandigarh) has designed for the city's government colleges will also give you updates on admission, course, and seats, and tell you about the fee. "The e-Campus app for Android and iOS platforms will be launched under RUSA (Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan)," Jitender Yadav, state project director of the centrally sponsored scheme for funding higher education institutes, has said. "It will carry the personal details of the students." The teaching and staff modules will take account of attendance, lectures, and payment. The internal messaging module will make communication easier and help reform the admission process. To keep the application fast, all the background information about the colleges will be on the admission website. The higher education department will maintain the app. A centralised online admission process is in place in all six government colleges of the city, two of which are in Sector 11 and one each in Sectors 42, 46, and 50.

(AAPL) Stock in 2017 Nike Inc (NKE) Stock Is a Winner Again With Renewed Brand-Name Strength EBay Inc (EBAY) Is a ‚ÄòWait-and-See‚Äô Stock Before Earnings View All Posts While the stock market has experienced some roughness lately, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has largely bucked that trend. AAPL stock is up more than 22% year-to-date against the S&P 500 which is up less than 5%. Source: iphonedigital via Flickr AAPL stock had a¬†big first-quarter catalyst at the end of January which underscored growth in the company‚Äôs important Services segment, but more than ever, investors are flocking to Apple Inc.¬†because they view it as safe. Apple is a household name with a bunch of institutional support, lots of cash on the balance sheet, tons of cash flow, a much-hyped iPhone set to launch later this year and promising new business¬†growth. It‚Äôs hard not to be attracted to AAPL stock in that lighting. But Apple is stretched now, and there are major risks to the current rally. I think it‚Äôs time to exercise caution, and here‚Äôs why. Why Apple Stock Could Head Lower Everyone is getting excited about the iPhone 8 super-cycle, and analysts are telling investors to buy the stock. But there are some serious risks to the super-cycle living up to the hype. The iPhone 7 benefited from Samsung‚Äôs exploding phone debacle. With the Galaxy Note 7 exploding, getting banned and being recalled, the iPhone 7 was the obvious smartphone upgrade during the holiday season in 2016. That significantly helped Apple Inc. set a quarterly record for iPhone sales in the first quarter of 2017. But that ‚Äúlack of competition‚Äù tailwind won‚Äôt continue. Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) just unveiled its Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus, and response has been better than expected, according to the chief of Samsung‚Äôs mobile division. In other words, early reads on Galaxy S8 sales are that the exploding Note 7 debacle isn‚Äôt having much of a dent on Samsung‚Äôs brand. If that continues to be the case, the Galaxy S8 could sell quite well and SSNLF could take back smartphone market share. With so much hype built into the iPhone 8 super-cycle,¬†a Galaxy S8 success story is a serious risk to AAPL stock.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill today is news of more refurbished MacBook Pros going on sale. Today, we‚Äôll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Friday. Refurbished MacBook Pro: Apple is now selling more refurbished MacBook Pro computers, reports MacRumors. The tech company now sells refurbished¬†13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar laptops. This is the first time that AAPL has started selling refurbished versions of its MacBook Pro with Touch Bar in its store. However, it has already been selling other MacBook Pro computers from last year that don‚Äôt feature the Touch Bar. The refurbished Touch Bar models start at¬†$1,529. iPhone Scam: iPhone owners are being targeted by scammers with a new phishing attack, BGR notes. This attack has the scammers sending text messages to random iPhone devices. The message states that the users Apple ID has been suspended. It asks them to follow a link and enter credit card information to restore the account. However, users should not do this. One of the obvious sign of this scam is the typo ‚Äúinformations‚Äù. Data Center: AAPL is preparing to open a new data center in¬†Viborg, Denmark, reports AppleInsider. The new data center will have a special feature that makes it stand out. This feature allows it to send excess heat into the local heating system. This heat waste will then be used to warm the homes of residents that live nearby. The facility will also run completely on renewable resources. However, it will still be connected to the local power grid in case of emergencies.

Now a new report sheds some light on the system it‚Äôs developed to power the 3 Lexus RX450h SUVs and the 6 people driving them. According to a document titled ‚ÄòDevelopment Platform Specific Training,‚Äô Apple has created an ‚ÄòAutomated System‚Äô for its self-driving cars. The program is controlled electronically via a joystick during safety testing. The vehicle itself uses a Logitech wheel and pedals to get around. It‚Äôs apparently capable of supporting just one person at a time. Apple‚Äôs drivers are put through their paces before being allowed to gain access to a self-driving car. The company‚Äôs come up with a special training program which teaches them how to regain manual control of an autonomous vehicle. Also See: Leaked documents hint at Apple AR glasses Employees have to pass seven different tests before they are considered fully trained. Each person has two practice runs and three trials to pass through each evaluation. These tests appear to have been conducted on a private course, explaining why they haven‚Äôt been seen in public till date. Trials include scenarios like Low Speed Driving, High Speed Driving, Tight U-Turn, Sudden Braking, and Sudden Acceleration. Safety drivers have to be ready to intervene and take control of the car at any time. They can either step on the brakes or grab the steering wheel to disengage the electronic driving mode. Drivers also have the power to accelerate without overriding the ‚Äòdrive by wire‚Äô mode. Interestingly, most of the 6 chosen drivers appear to be Ph.D‚Äôs who specialized in machine learning and have worked in places like Tesla and Bosch.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 376 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares557 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‚Äòello to Allo 5 I‚Äôve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin‚Äô 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life‚Äîif something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google‚Äôs messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google‚Äôs recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google‚Äôs master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google‚Äôs inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We‚Äôre getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‚Äò07-‚Äô09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google‚Äôs various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google‚Äôs messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let‚Äôs take a look at Google‚Äôs messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of ‚ÄúBabel‚Äù were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie‚Äôs business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google‚Äôs ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an ‚ÄúAssistant,‚Äù it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‚Äòello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? ‚ÄúI may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.‚Äù Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says ‚ÄúOk, go on.‚Äù As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I‚Äôve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin‚Äô RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said ‚ÄúJibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they‚Äôll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.‚Äù He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier‚Äôs pipes unless it‚Äôs profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that‚Äôs left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google‚Äôs messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won‚Äôt have any appreciable effect on Android‚Äôs market share. Keep doing what you‚Äôve been doing; keep an app folder called ‚Äúmessaging‚Äù on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone‚Äôs guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children‚Äôs children about what is was like ‚Äúback in the day‚Äù when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah üòÇ I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah üòÇ As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... üòÇ DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do...

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes üôÑ) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl ‚Ä¶ üôÑ abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life‚Äîif something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed üò≠ Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted‚Äã to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall‚Äôs Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall‚Äôs Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall‚Äôs Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: ‚ÄúHaving chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders‚Äîno matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.‚Äù - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of ‚Äúabsolute‚Äù language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Wesley Da‚ÄôNomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? üôÉ Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tom√°s O‚ÄôMert√† How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) added $1.42 last week (about 0.9%), closing at $142.27 on Friday. The company remains the best-performing stock by a wide margin among the 30 equities that¬†comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The company‚Äôs stock is up 22.84% year to date, well above second-place Boeing‚Äôs 15.87% improvement. Apple stock closed at $140.68 on Wednesday and added $1.76 on Thursday to close at $142.44, the stock‚Äôs top-performing day last week. The share price dipped on Wednesday following a report that China‚Äôs internet regulators warned three app companies that they needed to do a better job of screening out pornographic video content. The regulators also said that they planned to speak to Apple about stricter control over the offerings in the App Store. But it‚Äôs hard to keep the high-flying company down. Reports on Apple‚Äôs plans for new iPhones continue to drive both interest in the company and the share price. For example, although there have been rumors for some time that the company plans to release three¬†new iPhones this fall, a report from Bloomberg probably ginned up more interest in the stock last week. Citing unnamed sources, there will be new 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhones, the same form-factor as current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The third device has been said elsewhere to be the same size as the 5.5-inch device but will employ a curved-edge design that will nearly eliminate the bezel and offer a screen size of up to 5.8 inches. Credit Suisse also reiterated its Outperform rating on Apple stock and raised its price target from $160 to $170. The analyst specifically mentioned Apple‚Äôs services business, saying it expects services to contribute 33% of gross profit by 2020, from $26 billion annually to $52 billion. Apple shares closed at $142.27 on Friday, in a 52-week range of $89.47 to $145.46. The consensus 12-month price target is $148.96 in a price target range of $104 to $185 per share.

Google, the biggest player in this industry, is at the center of the plan, although the company and its partners are keen to present the initiative as a group effort. The Coalition for Better Ads published a list of undesirable online ads earlier this year. Google plans to add a feature to its Chrome Web browser that would disable those ads. The feature is designed for publishers, rather than a tool for consumers, and would operate the same way Chrome already filters ads that are undesirable in other ways, such as those that drain computer batteries, people familiar with the plans said. The Wall Street Journal earlier this week first reported on Google‚Äôs potential decision, sparking criticism that the search ad giant was again exerting too much control over the market for digital ads. Now industry partners are stressing that the plan is a group effort and not finalized. They also distanced Google‚Äôs tool from existing ad blockers that prompted the initiative in the first place. ‚ÄúThere is no ad blocker that‚Äôs going into a browser,‚Äù trade group Interactive Advertising Bureau head Randall Rothenberg said, although he would not offer further details on the tool. ‚ÄúWhat we want is something that‚Äôs industry-wide, that can demonstrably improve user experience and that‚Äôs embraced by pretty much everyone.‚Äù Rothenberg helped set up the Coalition for Better Ads in September last year. Beyond Google, members include some of the largest marketers, ad agencies, media organizations and Facebook Inc. Last month, the group issued its list of ad units ‚Äî including those that take over entire screens or videos that start automatically ‚Äî that it claimed are most likely to prompt people to download ad blockers. The Chrome option is different from ad blockers, which are downloaded as mobile apps or Web browser plug-ins to zap most marketing messages, people familiar with the plans said. Instead, it might look like similar tools that Google builds into its browser. Last fall, Chrome began automatically disabling ads that use Flash multimedia, citing computer battery drain. People in the coalition said they expect Google to also hold its own search, display and YouTube ads to the same standards it imposes on the rest of the industry, although the terms have not been finalized. Google declined to comment on potential Chrome features. However, the company emphasized that its plans are part of a group effort. ‚ÄúGoogle alone cannot solve for the incentives users have to install ad blockers,‚Äù a company spokeswoman said. ‚ÄúWe need an industry approach that is data-driven and endorsed by everyone.‚Äù Stuart Ingis, a lawyer for Venable LLP, which counsels the Coalition for Better Ads, said the group is still months away from issuing policies on ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù ad standards. ‚ÄúAll the options are on the table,‚Äù he said. Leaders of the coalition said other tech companies, such as Microsoft Corp and Facebook, would be involved in setting standards. ‚ÄúSomething that‚Äôs only one browser is not really worth it,‚Äù Rothenberg said. Yet, while the group is large, it is not comprehensive. Apple Inc, which controls the Safari browser on iPhones, and Mozilla Corp, which runs the Firefox browser, are not members of the coalition. Firefox includes a browser setting that blocks ads and Apple began allowing third-party tools that block content on its mobile browser last year. 1 2 NEXT ‚Ä∫ This story has been viewed 1675 times.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AR/VR Apple‚Äôs latest patent fuels rumors it‚Äôs looking deeper into AR and VR Jamie Feltham, Upload VR@UploadVR April 22, 2017 8:02 AM Above: Apple's physical store in San Francisco's Union Square neighborhood. Image Credit: Jordan Novet / VentureBeat While it remains to be seen what Apple is doing in the VR space (if anything), the company has made its interest in AR clear over the past year. Today, a new patent from the company has been published, further supporting rumors it is getting increasingly involved with the tech. The patent details ‚Äúa method for representing a virtual object in a real environment‚Äù. To do this, the company has devised¬†a system in which a ‚Äúrecording device,‚Äù possibly an iPhone, captures a 2D image of the environment in front of it. The system then takes one aspect of that environment as a reference point for a virtual object‚Äôs position in the real world. This enables any virtual project to collide with items in the real world ‚Äúin a way largely close to reality.‚Äù In the context of the patent Apple utilizes a fairly common use case for both virtual and augmented reality: furniture placement. Several images and figures in the document show a virtual image of a chair being projected into the room and being placed next to an identical set of real chairs and a desk. The virtual chair appears to become obscured when moved around to the back of the table from where the user is looking. Apple‚Äôs patent claims this can provide an intuitive assessment ‚Äúof the suitability of various products for a purpose of use‚Äù or, in simpler terms, help you decide what stuff to buy without needing the real product there and then. So, in theory, with Apple‚Äôs AR method, you could have a game of Pok√©mon Go, where Pikachu isn‚Äôt always oddly at the very front of the screen but might become concealed by a chair if he walks behind it. It‚Äôs the latest in a string of patents from Apple that suggest the company is serious about AR. Last February we uncovered a filing for a ‚ÄúWearable Information System,‚Äù and we‚Äôve even seen one for a wireless VR headset using iPhone. Sadly the patent doesn‚Äôt go into explicit detail about what type of device might power this method, though if Apple is going to get into AR soon then it is a safe bet that the first attempts will appear on iPhone.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 376 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares557 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‚Äòello to Allo 5 I‚Äôve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin‚Äô 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life‚Äîif something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google‚Äôs messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google‚Äôs recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google‚Äôs master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google‚Äôs inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We‚Äôre getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‚Äò07-‚Äô09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google‚Äôs various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google‚Äôs messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let‚Äôs take a look at Google‚Äôs messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of ‚ÄúBabel‚Äù were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie‚Äôs business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google‚Äôs ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an ‚ÄúAssistant,‚Äù it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‚Äòello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? ‚ÄúI may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.‚Äù Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says ‚ÄúOk, go on.‚Äù As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I‚Äôve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin‚Äô RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said ‚ÄúJibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they‚Äôll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.‚Äù He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier‚Äôs pipes unless it‚Äôs profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that‚Äôs left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google‚Äôs messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won‚Äôt have any appreciable effect on Android‚Äôs market share. Keep doing what you‚Äôve been doing; keep an app folder called ‚Äúmessaging‚Äù on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone‚Äôs guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children‚Äôs children about what is was like ‚Äúback in the day‚Äù when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah üòÇ I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah üòÇ As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... üòÇ DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones.

Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it.

Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes üôÑ) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl ‚Ä¶ üôÑ abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life‚Äîif something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed üò≠ Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted‚Äã to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall‚Äôs Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall‚Äôs Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall‚Äôs Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: ‚ÄúHaving chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders‚Äîno matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.‚Äù - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of ‚Äúabsolute‚Äù language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Wesley Da‚ÄôNomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? üôÉ Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tom√°s O‚ÄôMert√† How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here.

Art Books Film Music TV Fiona Apple‚Äôs Debut Album ‚ÄòTidal‚Äô is Finally Getting a Vinyl¬†Release Music | By Moze Halperin | April 20, 2017 Pitchfork reports that 20 years after it came out, Fiona Apple‚Äôs beloved debut album¬†Tidal¬†will be released on vinyl for the first time. Vinyl Me, Please, the subscription service behind the release (it‚Äôs their May 2017 ‚ÄúRecord of the Month‚Äù), shared a Q&A with its head of music, Cameron Schaefer, in which he described the two year process behind the vinyl‚Äôs development¬†‚Äî including enlisting Ted Jensen, who mastered the original 1996 release, to remaster the album. Schaefer spoke about some of the differences you can¬†detect between the MP3 you might be listening to at this very moment and the upcoming vinyl version: There are parts on some songs‚Äîlike ‚ÄúSlow Like Honey‚Äù‚Äîthat don‚Äôt sound as sterile per se, as in there‚Äôs complete silence in the silent gaps between words and music. There were little pops on that and ‚ÄúThe First Taste‚Äù on the test pressing that were standing out to me, and it turned out‚Äîafter checking in with Ted, Fiona‚Äôs people (including her manager, who was a producer on the album), a rep at Sony‚Äî we realized that she was very, very close to the mic, and the mic picked up little sounds she was making with her tongue and her lips. Those sounds were straight through to the mic, to the tape, and onto the vinyl. Fiona Apple wrote¬†Tidal¬†when she was 17, but that didn‚Äôt stop her work from sounding like it came from someone who‚Äôd been through the wringer of a whole musical career, of multiple heartbreaks, of¬†trauma (on one autobiographical song, ‚ÄúSullen Girl,‚Äù she lyricizes¬†how¬†being¬†raped¬†when she was 12 left her ‚Äúan empty shell‚Äù), and of age itself. Unlike a lot of alternative pop released¬†in the mid-‚Äô90s, Tidal¬†holds up ‚Äî and Apple hasn‚Äôt diverged much from the earthquaking emotion of the contralto/piano/drums-driven work¬†she started doing at the time: simple, booming excellence and honesty transcends trends quite nicely. Watch the video for ‚ÄúSleep to Dream,‚Äù¬†Tidal‚Äòs first track: Unfortunately, you have to be a subscriber to Vinyl Me, Please to get it ‚Äî but you can become one, and find out more about the release, here.

Valentina Palladino - Apr 22, 2017 2:00 pm UTC reader comments 25 Share this story Video shot/edited by Jennifer Hahn. Not many companies try to do what Garmin does with the Fenix line of fitness watches. While Apple and Google have their own general-purpose smartwatches priced around $300 (neither of which comes close to the Fenix's tracking abilities), Garmin and a handful of other companies make super-expensive fitness watches that are meant for the most active among us. The new $599 Fenix 5S is one of the models in the new Fenix 5 line that promises premium design and style. It also has the most advanced tracking abilities‚Äîwith onboard GPS, GLONASS, barometer, altimeter, heart rate monitor, and other sensors‚Äîand it delivers a full smartwatch experience with Garmin's own UI, widgets, notifications, and app store. No matter how you look at it, $600 is a lot to spend on a fitness tracker. But if money is no object and you need the most capable tracker you can get, the 5S may be for you. Design The Fenix 5 line is Garmin's first family of fitness watches with different case sizes to fit various wrists. The largest is the 51mm Fenix 5X, and it dwarfs the 47mm Fenix 5 and the 42mm Fenix 5S. Garmin targets our review model, the 5S, toward women, not only because of¬†its size, but also because it offers a wider variety of finishes than the others: it comes with silver, black, white, and champagne accents. After seeing all of them side by side, the Fenix 5 seems to hit the sweet spot for anyone who likes larger-than-normal watches, no matter if you're male or female and regardless of¬†the size of your wrist. But the Fenix 5S is probably the best size for my wrist, even though¬†I like large watches‚Äîit sat comfortably on me without overwhelming or weighing down my wrist. It's still larger than most of my regular watches, but not large enough to attract unwanted attention. Aside from size, the Fenix 5 models only have a few differences between them, and they all revolve around the Fenix 5X. The largest Fenix 5 model supports full-color TOPO maps that you can use for hiking, running, and cycling workouts. This model has a slightly longer battery life than the other two smaller models. Garmin estimates the Fenix 5X will get up to 12 days of life on a single charge, 20 hours in GPS mode, and 35 hours in battery-saving mode. Our Fenix 5S model is estimated to get up to nine days on a single charge, 14 hours in GPS mode, and 35 hours in battery-saving mode. The Fenix 5's case has the same five physical buttons that the Fenix 3 has: two on the right to select and go back, and three on the left to turn on the¬†display's backlight, scroll¬†up and access¬†the menu, and scroll¬†down. The 1.1-inch circular, full-color Chroma display is easy to read in most lighting situations, and the backlight helps immensely when you're in the dark. While you can't change the color of the case, you can change out the bands and replace them with others. Garmin made "QuickFit" bands for the Fenix 5 that¬†feature a small, flat lever that you pull back to easily release it from the case. Some other devices have tiny pins that you pull back to unlock the band from the case, but these QuickFit bands are even easier to remove. Our model came with a silicone sport band, but you can get leather and metal options as well. Garmin's $599 Fenix 5S. Interchangeable watch-like bands. Optical heart-rate monitor. QuickFit release lever. Pushing the lever back lets you pop the sides of the band out. Weather displayed on the screen. Most recent workout information. Activity list. Features The Fenix series is one of Garmin's most comprehensive. At $600 per device, it should track any and every exercise you'd want to do. Options range from indoor and outdoor running and cycling to¬†more specific exercises like trail running, mountain biking, open water swimming, rowing, and more. Using the top-right button on the case, you can start recording any activity you want, add quick-access buttons for your most-used activities, and even create your own activity category. Any¬†workout categories you create yourself aren't just special names on the screen, either. After you name it, you can edit numerous aspects about the activity category: what data screens do you want to see during the workout?¬†Does the auto-lap feature kick in after one mile or two? Do you need 3D distance or speed turned on? Do you need the onboard GPS? All these options ensure you're tracking the data you need from your customized¬†workout. All the options you can change when creating your own workout are also available for the pre-made workout profiles. Pressing and holding the left-middle button on the case opens the watch's menu. Once there, you can access your settings and activity history, as well as change your watch face and mess around with features like alarms, timers, and stopwatches. While settings includes all of the watch's changeable features, the first option is "activities and apps," and that's where you can edit any feature of any workout profile. The Fenix 5S uses Garmin's Elevate optical heart-rate monitor, but the watch can also be connected to a third-party chest strap.¬†The 5S automatically sensed my¬†Polar H7 monitor nearby and asked to pair with it multiple times. If you're used to a chest strap and want to supplement the watch's readings with one, you have that option. Pairing the two devices is almost too easy. Further ReadingReview: Garmin‚Äôs Vivoactive HR is more hardcore than Fitbit‚Äôs Surge Heart problems At¬†first, the¬†5S's heart rate monitor wasn't as good as others I've tested in Garmin devices, which was unusual since Garmin sensors tend to be consistent across device families. The 5S regularly measured my heart rate as 20 BPM higher or lower than the Polar H7 chest strap I wore at the same time. This happened not just when my heart rate was in the high 170s, but also when it was in the lower 130s. I tried wearing the device tighter around my wrist. That helped, but¬†the Fenix 5S still wasn't perfect. The problem affected high heart rates more than low ones, so the heart-rate graphs for my daily activity were on point, but this is a serious fitness watch. It should be able to handle high heart rates just as easily as resting ones. The problems persisted, and Garmin sent me an identical, replacement Fenix 5S.¬†After using the new model, I realized my first device was clearly defective. The replacement 5S's heart-rate monitor was on par with my chest strap and typically landed within one to two BPMs of the chest strap's reading. It even fell from high BPMs to low BPMs at a similar rate as the chest strap; at most the Fenix 5S was about 10 BPM lower than the chest strap when my heart rate was coming down after a burst of intense work. One of my favorite heart-rate features on the Fenix 5S is the chart that shows your pulse for the last four hours. You can see the chart directly on the display, and it's one of the default widgets included that you can scroll through by going up or down from the watch face. It shows a thin bar graph of your heart-rate fluctuations over the past four hours. Pressing the select button while on that page shows you a line graph of your average heart rate over the past week as well. The Fenix 5S may not have Garmin's new stress-level feature like the recently announced Vivosmart 3 does. But seeing when my heart rate spiked throughout the past couple hours makes me think about what I may have been doing to cause a minor freakout. Widgets and GPS Other widgets include the VO2 max training status, daily steps taken, floors climbed, last sport or last run, calendar, and notifications. You can edit which widgets you want on the watch at any time, making them similar to the Apple Watch's dashboard page options. Widgets are useful because they make finding pertinent information quick and easy. Garmin devices hold plenty of information, particularly the higher-end devices like the Fenix 5S, so putting the information you need most only a few button-presses away from the clock is convenient. I also appreciated that you can see more than just your most recent workout in the Last Sport widget. More presses of the select button reveal at least the past five workouts you've recorded, in full detail, even if you've already uploaded that data to Garmin Connect. Further ReadingGarmin unveils $139 Vivosmart 3 with rep counting, guided breathing features Garmin's onboard GPS in the Fenix 5S works well, even if I didn't think so at first. You can start an outdoor workout before the GPS is technically ready to locate you throughout the duration, and my watch took about three minutes to fully locate me. However, the amount of ground I covered within those first three minutes was mapped in my final route map. That map is viewable on the watch after you finish recording or in Garmin Connect after you sync the data. Connectivity Like most other Garmin trackers, the Fenix 5S receives all your smartphone notifications, not just call and text alerts. By default, the watch vibrates when you get an alert, but you can change its reaction in Garmin Connect, turning off the vibrations or turning on audible tones. You can't do anything with those notifications besides view and dismiss them. Some users might find that limiting, especially considering there is a primitive¬†keyboard on the watch that you can use to name your own workout profiles. The side buttons are used to select letters in that case, and the keyboard is pretty cumbersome to use, so it wouldn't be the best for typing out messages. But even if you can't respond to notifications, I appreciate having all of them on my wrist instead of just a few. Garmin has been good about putting this¬†and other smartwatch-esque features, like music controls, in most of its devices. For higher-end devices like the Fenix 5S, you also have access to the Connect IQ store, where you can download developer-made watch faces and apps that run on the watch, without needing a smartphone companion app installed. The Connect IQ store isn't nearly that comprehensive for the Apple Watch or even Android Wear devices, but Garmin's smartwatch ecosystem is a refreshing alternative for fitness-focused users for whom an¬†Apple or Google device won't suffice.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Apr 22, 2017 3:00 AM PT Credit: HP More like this Lenovo's ThinkPad P71 will work with HTC, Oculus VR headsets Power to the portable: 3 high-performance mobile workstations HP Inc. begins life with a new 4K laptop Video Mingis on Tech: Diving into Windows 10 Creators Update and the future of OSes Apple's Mac Pro has been ignored for so long that even Windows 10¬†mobile workstations are catching up on features and performance. Take HP's latest Zbook laptop workstations , which were announced on Friday. These heavy built laptops -- which is why they are called mobile workstations -- have comparable memory and storage capacity technology to the Mac Pro, but excel in other areas. The laptops feature Thunderbolt 3 ports, DDR4 memory, Intel's latest Kaby Lake-based Core and Xeon processors, and the latest GPUs from Nvidia and AMD. By comparison the Mac Pro has Thunderbolt 2 ports, an old AMD GPU, DDR3 memory and Intel Xeon processors based on the Ivy Bridge architecture, which were released in 2013. Add that all up, and you can rely on the Zbook for work like content creation, VR and video editing that you would otherwise do on a Mac Pro. Windows desktop workstations, like HP's Z and Dell's Precision desktops, are already far superior in technology than the Mac Pro. And the Zbook laptops -- which come in screen sizes of 14-, 15.6- and 17.3-inch screens, are up to half the price of a Mac Pro. Apple has said it will upgrade the Mac Pro in 2018 or 2019, but the current version, which was released in 2013 and recently got a minor upgrade, is so behind that many have moved over to Linux or Windows PCs. The ZBook 17 is the most powerful of HP's new workstations. It supports up to 4TB of hard drive or SSD storage, 64GB of memory, and can be configured with Intel's Xeon E3 v6 or Core i5/i7 chips. It has two Thunderbolt 3 ports, which can support two 4K displays. It can support GPUs including Nvidia's latest Quadro P5000, which can handle VR content creation. The laptop can be configured with a 4K screen, and it also HDMI and USB 3.0 ports. It will be priced starting at US$1,519. The Zbook 15 has many features that are similar to the Zbook 17, but is a step down in some features. It supports up to 3TB of storage, and supports Nvidia's Quadro M2200 GPU, not the P5000. This laptop can be configured with a 4K screen, and is priced starting at $1,419. The Zbook Studio, which starts at $1,399, is like the Zbook 15, but much thinner and lighter at around 2 kilograms. It also has fewer features like half the memory and lesser storage capacity. Given its size, it supports only Nvidia's Quadro M1200M GPU. It also has a DisplayPort 1.2 port. These laptops are available worldwide. Other features include support for AMD's FirePro GPUs, and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. HP also announced the ZBook 14u with a 14-inch screen, which is only available with Intel Core i5/i7 processors. The laptop's price wasn't announced at the time of press.

Or does it? Well, that really depends on whether you‚Äôre using a software emulator, or a physical device. The ARMIGA Full Edition is an ARM-powered Amiga ‚Äúclone‚Äù, and we‚Äôre giving one away to you lucky retro gaming fans! Read on to find out how to enter. What is an Amiga? There was a time when the PC was not the all-powerful, all-conquering behemoth. A time when the IBM-compatible computers (as they were then known) with their replaceable components struggled for attention and processing power in the face of superior computers. Back when Apple was beginning its slide towards bankruptcy and Microsoft made command line operating systems, a team of coders were plucked from Atari by Commodore, and given funding to complete development of one of the most revolutionary computers of all time: the Amiga. A computer that lives on in emulators and YouTube videos, the Amiga had several iterations (most popular were the Amiga 500 and 1200 models) and even found itself packaged in two living room friendly CD-ROM devices (the CDTV and CD32). But by the mid-1990s, the Amiga was running out of steam in the face of more powerful PCs and games consoles. Several relaunches have been attempted, none of which managed to gain traction. The Armiga Project Explained So, what is this device we‚Äôre looking at, offering as a giveaway to one lucky winner? Well, it‚Äôs an ARMIGA, a dual-core ARM processor-powered Amiga clone (more on that below). Two versions are available: the larger, Armiga Full Edition, complete with built-in 3.5-inch disk drive (which we‚Äôre giving away); and a standard, small Armiga Small Sized Edition with a microSD card slot. Costing around ‚Ç¨190 from armigaproject.com, and offering HDMI output (720p) for HDTVs, games can be played in 16:9 or 4:3. A custom floppy controller has also been developed, for reading original Amiga disks, which is arguably the most impressive feature. This means Double Density disks can be imaged, and the data copied to your PC. The ARMIGA‚Äôs developers have also included support for loading up disk images of games and apps via microSD or USB. As with any emulation, you need to have the original title to use an internet-procured disk image legally. However, with a 3.5-inch disk drive built in, if you have your original disks, or have bought some from eBay, this won‚Äôt be a problem! The ARMIGA offers enough USB slots for a keyboard and mouse, or gamepad. A powered USB hub can also be connected. Capable of emulating the Amiga 500 with 1 MB of RAM (the second iteration of that model) and the Amiga 1200 with 2 MB (which also featured a different graphics chip), the ARMIGA Full Edition is the closest thing you‚Äôll get to an original Amiga. Unboxing the ARMIGA It‚Äôs almost 30 years since I first unboxed an Amiga 500 computer. With only dreams of possibilities that time, the anticipation remains memorable. This time, I‚Äôm almost excited, even though I sort of already know what to expect. In the box, we have the ARMIGA device, made in Spain and mounted in a 3D-printed case, evocative of the original computer. A HDMI cable is also included, along with a USB power supply, microSD card (already inserted in the computer) and SD adaptor card. On here, you‚Äôll find a collection of games to get you playing right away. Two games on traditional 3.5-inch floppy disks are also included. The ARMIGA In Closeup The grille, plastic color, and typeface each recall the 1980s Amiga devices. If anything, however, this is a more delicate piece of kit. It‚Äôs a little flimsy, which is probably due to the 3D printed case; the grille feels as though it could break with slight pressure. The case could probably do with some rubber feet, too, but these are easily acquired. A peek through the grille reveals the device doing most of the work ‚Äì a Cubieboard ‚Äì a Raspberry Pi-sized mini-computer, with some hardware customizations. Looking at the ARMIGA with the disk drive facing you, several slots are found around the sides. On the left is an Ethernet port, as well as a mini-USB port, which should not be used for powering the device. Below this, you‚Äôll find a reset button. On the rear of the ARMIGA are two USB slots, and the microSD slot, while on the right side are the HDMI cable slot, power connector, and power button. Underneath you‚Äôll find manufacturing details and confirmation that the device is powered by Cloanto‚Äôs Amiga Forever software, with legitimate, licensed v1.3 and v3.1 ROMs. Setting Up the ARMIGA Getting started with the ARMIGA is almost as simple as getting started with the original. Simply connect your keyboard and mouse, ensure that the microSD card is correctly inserted (otherwise it will boot to Android!) connect the power cable, and press the power button. As long as the HDMI cable is attached to your display, the Ubuntu-based operating system will boot up and drop you into the ARMIGA user interface. This can be controlled via keyboard or with a USB games controller. You‚Äôll be faced with the Home menu, which can be returned to at any time while playing games by pressing the F11 button. The menu on the left-hand side of the screen presents the options available to you. These are: Self made ADFs ‚Äî browse the ADF (Amiga Disk File) images that have been created with the disk drive. Browse SD card ‚Äî view the ADF files saved on the microSD card. Browse USB ‚Äî find ADF files imported from a PC. Savestates ‚Äî it is possible to simply stop playing a game at any point using F11, and save the game as an image to be resumed later. Settings ‚Äî alter aspect ratio, Fast Load toggle, and adjust the Graphic Filter (Pixel Doubler, Scanlines, CRT effect). Finally, there is a Power menu option, where you can switch to A1200 mode (default is A500 mode) Reboot or Shutdown the ARMIGA. Playing Amiga Games with the ARMIGA Want to get your favorite Amiga games running? You‚Äôll need a USB joystick or game controller, along with the ROM of the title in question. If you own the game already, better still, as you‚Äôll be playing it legally. There are three ways of getting game ROMs onto your ARMIGA ‚Äî all dead simple. The first is via USB stick. Simply copy the ROM files from your PC to the stick, insert it into the ARMIGA, and use the Browse USB¬†to browse the USB device. Alternatively, you can switch off your ARMIGA, and eject the microSD card. Slot this into the included SD adaptor and insert that into your PC. From there, copy the ROM files into the Games directory, safely eject the card, and return to the ARMIGA. After powering on, you‚Äôll find the game ROMs listed. You can also copy data to a networked ARMIGA via SFTP. See below for more on that. Happily, several game ROMs are already included with the ARMIGA, so you can simply use your keyboard or game controller to launch these. Simply navigate the Browse SD card screen, select the game you want to play, then Launch. Within a few seconds, the emulation software will have loaded up the game. We tried three titles, Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge (1990), Katakis (1988) and Worms (1995). All played well, although there was some delay in Katakis loading up. It‚Äôs Not Really a Clone By now you will have noticed something pretty relevant. The ARMIGA isn‚Äôt strictly speaking a clone of the Amiga. Rather, it is a system that has been painstakingly put together in order to reliably run Amiga software. In the case of the ARMIGA Full Edition, it is also capable of reading 3.5-inch Double Density floppy disks. But, it won‚Äôt boot them. Rather, when a disk is inserted, the ARMIGA will automatically create an image of it. This image (around 1.3 MB!) is then stored to the device‚Äôs microSD card. Using the main Home menu, you can then use the Self made ADFs¬†menu item to view the disk images and run them. Think of it less as a clone, and more of an ‚Äúemulator in a box‚Äù. Retrieving Old Data with the ARMIGA Do you own old 3.5-inch Double Density (or Single Density) floppy disks? If so, the ARMIGA Full Edition represents the most straightforward method of retrieving data. It can also image your game disks, converting them into ADF files, stored on the microSD. These can be launched as easily as the pre-installed games. As for legacy data, you‚Äôll need to insert a disk one at a time and wait for the automatic imaging to complete. It can take about five minutes to complete, and a pop-up notification will display on screen when this is done. You‚Äôll also hear the disk drive stop ticking. Self-made ADF files are listed in the Self made ADFs¬†view. You might prefer to rename each disk image, as default names¬†are initially assigned. Once done, simple select a disk image file and click Launch to play. But what if your imaged data needs opening on a modern desktop platform? Retrieve Legacy Data via SFTP With an Ethernet cable connected to an ARMIGA computer, you can access the device across your network via SFTP. For instance, in FileZilla, it‚Äôs a case of opening Site Management, clicking Add Site, and inputting the ARMIGA‚Äôs IP address. You‚Äôll find this by logging onto your router via desktop browser, and checking for new devices. You should use Port 22; set the connection type to SFTP. The username and password are both armiga. All you need to do next is copy the ADF files from your ARMIGA to your computer. A typical disk file will only be 1.3 MB, so this doesn‚Äôt take long. To view the Amiga disk image files on a Windows PC, you‚Äôll need software like adfview, a free tool that adds the ability to view the contents of an ADF image in Windows Explorer. The contents of the disk image should be copied and saved to a new directory for further investigation. Typically, these files won‚Äôt have file extensions, which requires some detective work. Using Microsoft Word, Notepad, and XnViewMP, I could open all of the text documents and image files retrieved from my old disks. Documents can be saved in modern formats using built-in features in Word; XnViewMP enables¬†the export of images into modern file formats. Great! ARMIGA Gaming Performance vs Desktop Emulator Rather than running a desktop Amiga emulator (or even an emulator on your smartphone), why would you want to opt for an ARMIGA? Well, performance is good across the board, and unencumbered by the requirements of a desktop operating system. The version of Ubuntu that is looking after things in the background has been customized to prioritize emulation. The result is a stable, enjoyable emulation experience. And just in case things don‚Äôt run quite as planned, there‚Äôs also the option to edit your visual settings! You can swap the aspect ratio from the default 16:9 to 3:2 or traditional 4:3, and tweak the display. This is best used for graphically slow games; the¬†Pixel Doubler, Scanlines, CRT effects can all present very different results. If neither of these work, disabling Fast Load can help. With the device‚Äôs creamy white finish and grille, plus the direct connection to your TV, it‚Äôs like having a real Amiga. Sure, there‚Äôs no automatic booting from floppy, but you can still run Workbench. With patient configuration, in fact, you can use an ARMIGA device just like a classic Amiga, running apps and games, saving data, and generally having the best retro computing experience. But that‚Äôs not all‚Ä¶ ARMIGA as an Android Device The ARMIGA is hiding something from you. Android! In Android mode, you can gain additional functionality with the ARMIGA plugged into your TV. While you wouldn‚Äôt rely on the emulation of a 2 MB gaming and multimedia desktop from 25 years ago, for streaming video, you shouldn‚Äôt rule this out. With Android as the OS, installed on 4 GB flash memory, and an Ethernet cable attached, you‚Äôre ready to enjoy all the awesome streaming services that are available to any Android device. Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, and more are all available to enjoy on the ARMIGA. This is all thanks to the Cubieboard 2 board hiding inside the case. Just make sure you‚Äôre running this with a keyboard connected, as a game controller isn‚Äôt quite up to it. Oh, and just to make the device even more perfect, you can use an ARMIGA in Android mode for gaming. Win an ARMIGA Full Edition! Enter below to win one of these classic devices for yourself, and relive the 80s all over again (or for the first time?) ARMIGA Amiga Emulator Giveaway Classic Amiga Fans Need an ARMIGA Despite the lightweight build quality of the case, the ARMIGA Full Edition is a superb piece of equipment. A dedicated emulator (with the option of switching to Android and enjoying media streaming), it is simple to get started and joyous to play with. Games you haven‚Äôt played for years are instantly revived; data you thought long lost is suddenly available to you again. Our verdict of the ARMIGA Full Edition: Quite literally offering the ultimate retro home computing experience, the Armiga Full Edition is a beautiful device, that stands up against the original in a way that most 16-bit era clones do not.910 Previous PostRugged and Under $250: The Blackview BV7000 Pro Review and Giveaway 1 comment Write a Comment Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Photo: Reuters / Robert Galbraith SAN FRANCISCO - Apple Inc outlined a plan to train operators of self-driving cars in documents submitted to California regulators earlier this month, the latest clues to the company's autonomous vehicle technology aspirations. Apple was granted a permit to test self-driving cars on April 14 by the California Department of Motor Vehicles but the company has never said anything about its plan. The state released 41 pages of Apple application documents to Reuters that give some clues about the company's highly secret self-driving effort, which it has never openly acknowledged. READ:¬†Apple gets green light to test self-driving cars The iPhone maker joins a long list of carmakers, start-ups and technology rivals, including Alphabet's Waymo, that are testing cars on state roads. Apple is looking for new hit products and autonomous car technology is expected to revolutionize the traditional auto industry. As part of the application, Apple included a 10-page training plan that appeared to be related to operators taking back manual control of the car during automated driving exercises of the system, which it calls a development platform. Apple declined comment beyond the filing. The plan includes a document called "Automated System: Development Platform Specific Training Overview" whose objective is "to train safety drivers in various automated driving conditions." "Development platform will be controlled electronically (e.g. joystick) and safety drivers must be ready to intervene and take control," the document reads. The document highlights different scenarios to be tested, from high speed driving and tight U-turns to lane changes. One letter sent from Apple to the state Department of Motor Vehicles noted that Apple's development platform "will have the ability to capture and store relevant data before a collision occurs." The document does not include detail on how Apple's self-driving platform actually works or other technical details. It also does not say what kind of sensors are found on Apple's three permitted vehicles, all 2015 Lexus model RX450h.

Apple could instead be designing a self-driving platform that can be integrated into other manufacturer's cars. ¬† Reuters Comment Now!

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 376 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares557 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‚Äòello to Allo 5 I‚Äôve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin‚Äô 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life‚Äîif something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google‚Äôs messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google‚Äôs recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google‚Äôs master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google‚Äôs inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We‚Äôre getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‚Äò07-‚Äô09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google‚Äôs various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google‚Äôs messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let‚Äôs take a look at Google‚Äôs messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of ‚ÄúBabel‚Äù were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie‚Äôs business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google‚Äôs ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an ‚ÄúAssistant,‚Äù it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‚Äòello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? ‚ÄúI may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.‚Äù Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says ‚ÄúOk, go on.‚Äù As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I‚Äôve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin‚Äô RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said ‚ÄúJibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they‚Äôll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.‚Äù He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier‚Äôs pipes unless it‚Äôs profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that‚Äôs left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google‚Äôs messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won‚Äôt have any appreciable effect on Android‚Äôs market share. Keep doing what you‚Äôve been doing; keep an app folder called ‚Äúmessaging‚Äù on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone‚Äôs guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children‚Äôs children about what is was like ‚Äúback in the day‚Äù when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah üòÇ I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah üòÇ As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... üòÇ DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do...

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes üôÑ) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl ‚Ä¶ üôÑ abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life‚Äîif something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed üò≠ Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted‚Äã to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall‚Äôs Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall‚Äôs Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall‚Äôs Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: ‚ÄúHaving chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders‚Äîno matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.‚Äù - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of ‚Äúabsolute‚Äù language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Wesley Da‚ÄôNomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? üôÉ Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tom√°s O‚ÄôMert√† How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here.

I‚Äôm Amy Merrick from An Apple a Day and I‚Äôm so thrilled to join the design*sponge team as an editor. Wow, I can‚Äôt believe I just got to type out that sentence (and better yet, have it be true!). About me: I‚Äôm crazy for antiques, live for a good handmade project and compulsively hoard houseplants in my Williamsburg, Brooklyn apartment. If you‚Äôre like me, sometimes you see a movie and just want to crawl in the screen and live in the character‚Äôs homes. Or hop into the pages your favorite book and never come out. Well, every Tuesday I‚Äôm going to be gathering a group of products that are inspired by your favorite books, movies, artists, restaurants or anything else makes you swoon‚Ä¶. Is it The Great Gatsby or The Secret Garden? Annie Hall or Am√©lie? Leave me a comment and let‚Äôs see where you‚Äôd want to live! Out of Africa One of my hands down, all time favorite movies is Sydney Pollack‚Äôs 1985 ‚ÄúOut of Africa‚Äù staring Meryl Streep and Robert Redford. Set in 1914 colonial Kenya, the movie combines a to die for mix of elegant, ladylike charm, utilitarian safari and spectacular handmade Kenyan crafts. Not to mention it‚Äôs just about the most romantic movie. Ever. Seriously, it can make me weep even after dozens of viewings. [image above, clockwise from top left: masai folding chair and footstool, brass anchor lantern $99, antique canteen set $3,850 (I had to include it, I‚Äôm sorry!), bronze binoculars $84, bulrush placemat $30, cotton hammock $11, brass pocket compass $26, canvas tent $606] Based on the true story of Isak Dinesen, a Danish women who struggles to make a place for herself in Kenya, it‚Äôs the kind of movie where the characters bring starched white shirts, limoges crystal and a fancy pants gramophone on safari. While I‚Äôll probably pass on investing in fancy crystal to use at a picnic in the park, I‚Äôm crazy about the idea of taking along a few favorite indoor items outside with you. A portable record player and some sweet chipped plates? Yes, please! [image above, clockwise from top left: hamman cotton towel $32, queen anne pitcher $99, white desk $349, African palm baskets $50+, bamboo room divider $95, market basket $42, wicker trunk $135, campaign bed $1250] Suggested For You 14 Last-Minute Handmade Gift Ideas 30 Gifts for the Entrepreneur In Your Life 2016 Gift Guide: Babies, Toddlers + Kids Comments Liz says: Oct 3, 2009 at 11:24 pm I realize that I‚Äôm way behind on the commenting, seeing as you posted this at the beginning of August, but puh-leeeeaaase do Atonement. So so so beautiful. reply Liz says: Oct 5, 2009 at 7:49 pm Ok‚Ä¶the living in idea is perfect, and all of these movies are some of my favorites! I mean, Mamma Mia? The Godfather? Little Women? Out of Africa? I feel like designsponge is reading my mind. I think an interesting idea would be A Little Princess ‚Äì totally a kid‚Äôs movie but the NYC Victorian girl‚Äôs school mansion in it was one of my favorite interiors‚Ä¶not to mention all the Indian influences! reply Connie says: Oct 9, 2009 at 2:33 pm years ago I had my furniture covered with the Out of Africa fabric from her living room. Is this fabric still available? Thanks. reply Kim says: Feb 10, 2017 at 10:58 am Do you know what it was called or who made it??? reply JACKIE says: Oct 19, 2009 at 7:14 am Excuse my english ! I am Parisienne Wonderful idea ! Movies and chair, bed, etc‚Ä¶ I love v√©ry much your blog reply Jennifer says: Nov 11, 2009 at 8:50 pm Out of Africa is one of those movies that I never get tired of. Every time I come across it on TV, I‚Äôm drawn in and sit through the whole amazing show again. I also adore the ‚Äúnew‚Äù version of Sabrina with Harrison Ford. I love, love, love the coach house. My third favorite movie is The Holiday. I can‚Äôt get enough of the house in California and the cottage in the English countryside. Keep up this fabulous column! Thank you. reply Kerry says: Nov 26, 2009 at 12:12 pm Ditto on the movie! The best thing I loved about the movie besides Meryls‚Äô gorgeous wardrobe is the spectacular house she lived in ! I dream of one day having a place such as that‚Ä¶ reply jessica ann says: Dec 8, 2009 at 8:05 pm -Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon -Blade Runner -Royal Tenenbaums -Hedwig and the Angry Inch I have come back to these design*sponge articles more than any others. So intriguing to look at. reply Greenly says: Dec 29, 2009 at 1:45 pm I absolutely adore Out of Africa and anything British Colonial from that time period. Also another stylistic favorite is The Three Colors: Blue, White and Red. Juliette Binoche‚Äôs home in the French countryside was breathtaking! reply Kathryn says: Jan 21, 2010 at 4:59 pm Gone with the Wind ‚Äì Tara!!!

Also the furnishings ‚Äì fun! reply Kathryn says: Jan 22, 2010 at 2:55 pm ‚ÄúWhat Lies Beneath‚Äù with Michelle Pfieffer and Harrison Ford ‚Äì beautiful house‚Ä¶. reply jennifer borrell anderson says: Jan 24, 2010 at 3:23 pm just found this series and it‚Äôs great! you‚Äôve already covered so many of my household/film fantasies, but i wanted to add Surviving Picasso with anthony hopkins ‚Äì his french coastal house. while i‚Äôm at it i‚Äôll add shadowlands‚Ä¶ debra winger‚Äôs peacock blue suit and the christmas paper ‚Äúparty hats and garland‚Äù! richard attenborough picks some darn good production designers. oh why not chaplin too? oh and i second the vermont house in babyboom. i also love the friend‚Äôs snowy-country modern house in bourne identity. OR michael caine‚Äôs house in children of men. anyway, REALLY good job so far, loved fantastic mr. fox and gosford park. thanks! reply Bernie says: Jan 28, 2010 at 8:46 am ‚ÄúPhiladelphia Story‚Äù (yes it is in black & white..1940) Introduce a whole new generation to Kathryn Hepburn‚Äôs fantastic wardrobe. ‚Ä¶and with Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart in the cast‚Ä¶and a great house. If you‚Äôve never seen it‚Ä¶..well it is a CLASSIC! mmmm I watch ‚ÄúSomethings Gotta Give‚Äù just for the house‚Ä¶and wish I had done my kitchen remodeling after I‚Äôd seen it. reply Kara says: Apr 20, 2010 at 1:32 pm I just started reading this feature and wondered if you‚Äôd done ‚ÄúOut of Africa‚Äù because it is the No. 1 movie I want to live in. Of course it was the very first! Thanks for doing this! reply Margaret says: May 2, 2010 at 12:55 am Did anyone identify the manufacturer of the fabric covering the furniture in Out Of Afrca? reply Amy says: Jun 1, 2010 at 11:29 am Twin Peaks was a big design influence for me‚Äì that Pacific Northwest hunting-lodge vibe. I second the request for Mad men. What about the Stepford Wives with Nicole Kidman? reply Benjamin W. Rouse says: Jun 5, 2010 at 11:08 am In the movie Out of Africa, when Karen is telling the boy to go to the hospital for his wounded leg, Baron Blixen comes out on the porch holding paper and a coffee cup. What company makes the coffee cup and no doubt the breakfast ware that goes with it (ie, saucers, plates, etc.)? I‚Äôd like to have a set just like it. The cup holds a generous portion of coffee and you can get your forefinger in it and best of all, it appears to be a light weight china cup. reply Gwynhwyfar says: Mar 3, 2011 at 3:53 am Where to live? Oooh, that‚Äôs tough! I‚Äôm drawn to all things Victorian and Edwardian and your ‚Äúliving in Out of Africa‚Äù idea is great! That house was fantastic. But I‚Äôd have to go with something more sumptuous, like Granny Mingot‚Äôs mansion in New York City in Scorcese‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Age of Innocence‚Äù. Or her summer ‚Äúhouse‚Äù in Newport, for that matter. (If you‚Äôre from NYC, you will get a thrill out of the recreation of all the different mansions in ‚ÄúOld New York‚Äù, ca. 1877). For more fantastic, turn-of-the-century, East Coast mansions and vacation spots, feast your eyes on Gillian Anderson as Lily Bart in ‚ÄúThe House of Mirth‚Äù. Ever see ‚ÄúOn the Wings of the Dove‚Äù, with Helene Bonham Carter? Her rented house in Venice is almost as evocative and decadent as Heath Ledger‚Äôs one of many in ‚ÄúCasanova‚Äù. Speaking of Europe, I‚Äôd move right into Diane Lane‚Äôs Tuscan Villa in ‚ÄúUnder the Tuscan Sun‚Äù! One of my all-time favorite houses is the Italianate country house in upstate N.Y., the stage for a re-telling of Shakespeare‚Äôs ‚ÄúMidsummer Night‚Äôs Dream‚Äù in Woody Allen‚Äôs early-1900‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Midsummer Night‚Äôs Sex Comedy‚Äù. It sits in a beautiful field, surrounded by woods and streams. For a ritzier, British version of this, how about ‚ÄúNorland manor‚Äù in Sussex, home of the Dashwood girls in ‚ÄúSense and Sensibility‚Äù? Though not in a film, I would kill to live in the Empress of Austria‚Äôs Edwardian summer ‚ÄúTea House‚Äù in the Salzkammergut mountains of Austria, which I visited one summer. They left it just as it was when she died! It was all pinkish stone, with a wraparound veranda, and inside, dark wood, inlaid floors, chandeliers, and huge, carved divans and pianos! *sigh* Also related to Austria, the retreat at Versailles, of Petit Trianon, in Sophia Coppola‚Äôs ‚ÄúMarie Antionette‚Äù was unbelievable! I could stay there forever! Totally out of character, I adore the lakeside cottage inhabited by Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) in Stephen King‚Äôs ‚ÄúSecret Window‚Äù. He takes endless naps on an overstuffed sofa, avoids writing and gets threatened by John Turturro. It‚Äôs scary, but at least comfy! (P.S. Films I would NOT want to live in, though I loved them, were mentioned, ‚ÄúGhost World‚Äù, ‚ÄúBabette‚Äôs Feast‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Piano‚Äù (the latter two, espcecially, were so dark and depressing!). I loved Mia Wallace‚Äôs ultra-modern house in ‚ÄúPulp Fiction‚Äù and the house Kate Winslet both lives in and rents in ‚ÄúThe Holiday‚Äù ‚Äì what a perfect, English cottage! While in L.Al, I wouldn‚Äôt mind kicking those girls out of the house in ‚ÄúCharmed‚Äù and moving in! reply Abbey says: Oct 26, 2011 at 11:58 pm I just ADORE THIS!! Hate that I‚Äôm just now finding it, but so glad I‚Äôve got a lot of reading material. :) I have two movies that I just adore that I thought I would share: Penelope & Waitress. Two beautiful and fabulous movies! reply Paul says: Jun 10, 2012 at 6:19 pm Does anyone know how to find the older ones? I can‚Äôt get to the Living In: Blade Runner to save my life. reply Deb says: Nov 9, 2014 at 5:07 am I‚Äôm looking to buy out of Africa sofa fabric..does anyone know if is still available ? reply Kim says: Feb 10, 2017 at 11:00 am Did you ever find it? I am looking for it now but I don‚Äôt know the designer‚Äôs name or the fabric name. reply Deb says: Apr 22, 2017 at 1:03 am No I never did find this fabric have you?? reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Design*Sponge reserves the right to restrict comments that do not contribute constructively to the conversation at hand, contain profanity, personal attacks, hate speech or seek to promote a personal or unrelated business.

Even if you land on the right word, you may not get there in the right way. App Store screenshot/MAG Interactive ¬† Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post ¬† ¬† Clips Apple has introduced a new app, Clips, which aims to tap into a little bit of Snapchat's social sharing magic. The app lets you take pictures or videos and append your own commentary to them by way of text, narration or goofy stickers. As with a Snapchat, Facebook or Instagram story, you can string multiple images or videos together into a single, shareable clip. Clips will automatically type as you talk, making it very easy to add your own text to an image or video. Users can share their clips over Messages with Apple users, as well as with Android users through SMS. As with Snapchat, it's possible to add filters to your clips, to give something a drastically different look. You can also trim or rearrange parts of your creation and add music. Free, for iOS devices. Wordbrain Language lovers with some time on their hands may want to try Wordbrain, a grid-based game that asks you to join tiles together to form particular words. The catch? Even if you land on the right word, you may not get there in the right way. To form a word, you have to trace your finger over adjacent tiles. If you can't make the right connections to complete both words, it's back to the drawing board for you. The levels start out fairly easy and get progressively harder. The game does have in-app purchases; players can buy hints if they're just not seeing the letters come together. Playing through the game successfully will let you accrue hints free, but you can pay a little extra if you need help now. Still, it's perfectly possible to play through this engaging word game with nothing but your wits. Free, for iOS and Android devices.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 376 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares557 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‚Äòello to Allo 5 I‚Äôve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin‚Äô 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life‚Äîif something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google‚Äôs messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google‚Äôs recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google‚Äôs master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google‚Äôs inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We‚Äôre getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‚Äò07-‚Äô09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google‚Äôs various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google‚Äôs messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let‚Äôs take a look at Google‚Äôs messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of ‚ÄúBabel‚Äù were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie‚Äôs business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google‚Äôs ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an ‚ÄúAssistant,‚Äù it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‚Äòello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? ‚ÄúI may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.‚Äù Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says ‚ÄúOk, go on.‚Äù As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I‚Äôve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin‚Äô RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said ‚ÄúJibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they‚Äôll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.‚Äù He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier‚Äôs pipes unless it‚Äôs profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that‚Äôs left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google‚Äôs messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won‚Äôt have any appreciable effect on Android‚Äôs market share. Keep doing what you‚Äôve been doing; keep an app folder called ‚Äúmessaging‚Äù on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone‚Äôs guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children‚Äôs children about what is was like ‚Äúback in the day‚Äù when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah üòÇ I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah üòÇ As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... üòÇ DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do...

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes üôÑ) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl ‚Ä¶ üôÑ abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life‚Äîif something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed üò≠ Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted‚Äã to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall‚Äôs Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall‚Äôs Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall‚Äôs Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: ‚ÄúHaving chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders‚Äîno matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.‚Äù - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of ‚Äúabsolute‚Äù language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Wesley Da‚ÄôNomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? üôÉ Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tom√°s O‚ÄôMert√† How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here.

Sunday 23rd April, 2017 Menu Home Breaking International News South Korea News Breaking Sports News Weather Network Volume No. 15/113 Samsung's Galaxy S8 goes on sale, aims to move on from recall crisis PanArmenian.Net - Saturday 22nd April, 2017 PanARMENIAN.Net - Samsung's new Galaxy S8 went on sale over the counter in South Korea Friday, April 21 as the world's biggest smartphone maker seeks to move on from a disastrous handset recall and corruption scandal that has hammered its once-stellar reputation, AFP says. The device, unveiled in New York last month and a challenge to Apple's iPhone, is the firm's first major launch since last year's humiliating withdrawal of the Galaxy Note 7 over exploding batteries. It also comes with vice-chairman Lee Jae-Yong and other executives on trial for bribery over their alleged role in the graft scandal that brought down former president Park Geun-Hye. But the company's profits are rising and the new phones have received good reviews, with more than one million pre-orders for the S8 and the larger S8 in South Korea alone. Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news) in Samsung Electronics jumped more than 2.5 percent Friday, adding around $7 billion to its market capitalisation. "Market reactions to the release of the S8 series are somewhat positive," said Lee Seung-Woo of IBK Investment Securities. Samsung could break the record 48.5 million unit sales it achieved with its S7 series, he added. "Barring the weakening of the US dollar, Samsung's second-quarter operating profit would reach 12 trillion won," Lee said. Pre-order deliveries began earlier this week, and in-store sales begin in the US and Canada later Friday, with the device due to be rolled out to around 50 more countries next week. Samsung Electronics is the flagship subsidiary of the giant Samsung Group, whose revenues are equivalent to a fifth of South Korea's gross domestic product, and the S8 series introduction comes at a delicate time for the embattled firm. The Note 7 recall debacle cost it billions of dollars in lost profit and hammered its global reputation and credibility, forcing it to apologise to customers and postpone the S8 launch.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 376 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares557 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‚Äòello to Allo 5 I‚Äôve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin‚Äô 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life‚Äîif something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google‚Äôs messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google‚Äôs recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google‚Äôs master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google‚Äôs inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We‚Äôre getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‚Äò07-‚Äô09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google‚Äôs various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google‚Äôs messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let‚Äôs take a look at Google‚Äôs messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of ‚ÄúBabel‚Äù were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie‚Äôs business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google‚Äôs ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an ‚ÄúAssistant,‚Äù it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‚Äòello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? ‚ÄúI may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.‚Äù Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says ‚ÄúOk, go on.‚Äù As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I‚Äôve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin‚Äô RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said ‚ÄúJibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they‚Äôll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.‚Äù He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier‚Äôs pipes unless it‚Äôs profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that‚Äôs left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google‚Äôs messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won‚Äôt have any appreciable effect on Android‚Äôs market share. Keep doing what you‚Äôve been doing; keep an app folder called ‚Äúmessaging‚Äù on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone‚Äôs guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children‚Äôs children about what is was like ‚Äúback in the day‚Äù when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah üòÇ I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah üòÇ As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... üòÇ DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do...

Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes üôÑ) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl ‚Ä¶ üôÑ abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life‚Äîif something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed üò≠ Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ‚úì·µõ·µâ ≥·∂¶·∂†·∂¶·µâ·µà I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ail√≠n √ì‚ÄôS Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted‚Äã to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall‚Äôs Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall‚Äôs Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall‚Äôs Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: ‚ÄúHaving chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders‚Äîno matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.‚Äù - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of ‚Äúabsolute‚Äù language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

But we're revamping right now our support system and allowing a manual IM registration (Americans are automatically verified) to allow us to offer our features to other countries, and we're about to translate our materials and app, while giving multi-language to the Awesome Bar, to make it more relevant. We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da‚ÄôNomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? üôÉ Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tom√°s O‚ÄôMert√† How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here.

By Luke Johnson / Published 22nd April 2017 GETTY IPHONE UPDATE: Apple's next phone could copy this undesirable Galaxy S8 feature The Samsung Galaxy S8 is a great smartphone, but its not without its faults. Chief amongst these is the positioning of its integrated fingerprint scanner. With the phone having ditched its predecessor‚Äôs biometrics hosting physical home button, Samsung has been forced to relocate the phone‚Äôs fingerprint scanner, positioning it on the rear of the device. Now, latest reports have suggested Apple will follow suit, moving the iPhone 8‚Äôs Touch ID fingerprint scanner to the back of the upcoming phone. Apple iPhone 8 - Leaked photographs, concept images and renders Friday, 6th January 2017 iPhone 8 is shaping up to be one of the most impressive Apple smartphones to date, with glass panels on the front and rear of the device, a curved borderless OLED display and no Home Button 1 / 10 VENIAMIN GESKIN ‚Ä¢ TWITTER ‚Ä¢ CONCEPT IMAGES Apple iPhone 8 will debut a brand-new all-glass look, with a curved OLED display and no physical Home Button The iPhone‚Äôs remodelled design has been teased via a newly emerged handset schematic. The blueprint designs, surfaced via reputed Apple tipster Sonny Dickson, have shown off a phone with a cut-out for a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. While the repositioning is sure to annoy many, it looks set to be less frustrating that the S8‚Äôs offering. That‚Äôs because unlike Samsung‚Äôs latest flagship phone, Apple‚Äôs moved sensor looks set to line up centrally on the phone‚Äôs rear, beneath the traditional Apple logo. TWITTER/SONNY DICKSON In contrast, the S8‚Äôs biometric scanner sits awkwardly off to the side, lining up alongside the phone‚Äôs integrated camera towards the top of the device. This has created hand contorting problems for early adopters and resulting in grimy fingerprints tainting the S8‚Äôs camera lens. Apple is reportedly looking to relocate the iPhone 8‚Äôs fingerprint scanner in order to make space for a larger, near edge-to-edge display without increasing the phone‚Äôs overall footprint. It was previously suggested that Apple was looking to slide the iPhone 8‚Äôs fingerprint scanner directly beneath the screen itself. Engineering issues, however, have seemingly put these plans on hold. This is just one design difference set to be bestowed on the eagerly awaited handset. Elsewhere, the iPhone 8 schematics have shown off a phone with a new, vertically aligned dual lens camera. This will, according to recent leaks, be backed up with a new, more powerful A11 processor and 3GB of RAM. On top of this, a new iOS 11 operating system will reportedly run the show following a WWDC 2017 unveiling this June. Although Apple is currently remaining tight lipped on the matter, the iPhone 8 us expected to be unveiled this September as one of three new high-end handsets.

Apple was granted a permit to test self-driving cars on April 14 by the California Department of Motor Vehicles but the company has never said anything about its plan. The state released 41 pages of Apple application documents to Reuters that give some clues about the company‚Äôs highly secret self-driving effort, which it has never openly acknowledged. The iPhone maker joins a long list of carmakers, start-ups and technology rivals, including Alphabet‚Äôs Waymo, that are testing cars on state roads. Apple is looking for new hit products and autonomous car technology is expected to revolutionize the traditional auto industry. As part of the application, Apple included a 10-page training plan that appeared to be related to operators taking back manual control of the car during automated driving exercises of the system, which it calls a development platform. Apple declined comment beyond the filing. The plan includes a document called ‚ÄúAutomated System: Development Platform Specific Training Overview‚Äù whose objective is ‚Äúto train safety drivers in various automated driving conditions.‚Äù ‚ÄúDevelopment platform will be controlled electronically (e.g. joystick) and safety drivers must be ready to intervene and take control,‚Äù the document reads. The document highlights different scenarios to be tested, from high speed driving and tight U-turns to lane changes. One letter sent from Apple to the state Department of Motor Vehicles noted that Apple‚Äôs development platform ‚Äúwill have the ability to capture and store relevant data before a collision occurs.‚Äù The document does not include detail on how Apple‚Äôs self-driving platform actually works or other technical details. It also does not say what kind of sensors are found on Apple‚Äôs three permitted vehicles, all 2015 Lexus model RX450h. The permit does not necessarily mean that Apple itself is building a full car. Apple could instead be designing a self-driving platform that can be integrated into other manufacturer‚Äôs cars.
