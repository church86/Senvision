The platform’s maturity advances mobile photo editing way beyond what it was in the early days of the iPad in 2010. With the better screen of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and the Pencil on both the smaller iPad Pro and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, hobbyist and pros alike can achieve amazing results. Many amateur enthusiasts could make use of the iPad Pro exclusively. Professionals could use it while they’re away from their desktops or laptops for quick edits, organizing photos and sharing them even if they still the extra power of a desktop or laptop photo editing environment. We’ll look at some of the best photo editing apps. Then we’ll list a few accessories that can make photo editing easier. Finally, we’ll suggest a simple workflow for beginning iPad Pro photo editors. We’ll focus on beginners since the pros will likely have a good workflow already. Apps for iPad Pro Photo Editing There are several useful and powerful photo apps for the iPad Pro. Let’s start with Pixelmator ($4.99) which does a great job of photo editing all by itself. Users can import photos from the iPad’s camera, iCloud Drive, Photos or create an image from scratch. This last option lets you create something using the artistic tools in the app. Pixelmator includes: Painting tools – will make the Apple Pencil a useful accessory Retouch – used to remove spots, annoying distracting background elements, fix red-eye, sharpening photos and more Distort – tool used to create crazy looks or even some fine touch up Adjust Colors – fix color problems like tint, temperature and adds filters. This also shows a powerful curves function like you’d find in high-end photo editors on a computer Select – to do things like cut or copy parts of an image Crop – start here to get the best composition Pixelmator brings with it iOS 9 compatibility which lets you access the app’s filters from within the iOS 9 Photos app. You can’t use the more advanced Pixelmator features unless you open it directly in Pixelmator. If all you want to do is add filters, this is a great way to efficiently do so from within the iOS 9 Photos app. The iOS 9 Photos app organizes your photos and offers some simple photo editing and sharing. However, the Adobe Lightroom Mobile (Free) app does a better job of all three. Use the built-in preset filters to quickly add a certain look to a photo. Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Mobile works like the computer program. Organize photos and group them into collections. Adobe gave the demo below at their 2015 Max conference. These collections can sync with Adobe’s Creative Cloud apps installed on other mobile devices or on a computer. Users will need a Creative Cloud subscription which starts at $10/month and costs as much as $70/month with all the Adobe apps plus access to Adobe Stock photos. The built-in editing tools transform an average photo into something special with the right adjustments. Once the user learns how to use the program, they can do some amazing things all using touch. Moving the adjustment sliders using touch feels more organic that trying to drag them with a mouse on a computer. I took the photo below recently on Ocracoke Island along the North Carolina coast. I edited it using Lightroom. It wasn’t a great shot, but thanks to the tools in Lightroom, it’s not bad for 15 minutes of work on an iPad Pro. A third app that deserves mention comes from Google. Snapseed (Free) also handles iPad Pro photo editing with some advanced features as well as simple tools. Each editing tool comes with X and Y axis manipulation. Slide up and down to choose the editing tools in that section. For example, under Tune Image slide up and down to choose from … Brightness Ambience Contrast Saturation Shadows Highlights Warmth Slide until you see Shadows. Then slide left and right to decrease or increase the levels of the darker areas (shadows) of the photo. The app also includes filters that quickly apply several adjustments at once. Once the user applies a filter, there’s a series of thumbnails across the bottom of the screen. Select them and then fine tune the filter by sliding left or right to decrease or increase the degree to which the filter is applied. Snapseed’s touch-focused adjustment tools makes editing photos easier than using a mouse on a computer or a trackpad on a laptop. A couple of other “honorable mention” editors include Polarr Photo Editor (Free), an advanced photo editor with pro-level editing features. Also, the great Camera+ ($2.99) app from Tap Tap Tap includes some awesome photo editing tools. Accessories for iPad Pro Photo Editing No one needs any accessories to edit photos on an iPad Pro, but a few will make life easier. First, get the Lightning to SD Card Camera Reader from Apple. At $29 it’s the fastest and easiest way to import photos from your point-and-shoot or DSLR camera. It plugs in to the iPad Pro and when the iPad Pro finds pictures on the card it opens the Photos app and offers to import all of them or just the ones you want to work with. Next, get the Apple Pencil ($99) because it gives the user fine control over drawing and touch up tweaks. Adobe supports it in some of their mobile iOS creative apps. At launch the Pencil was hard to find, but availability may loosen up by the time you read this. A third cool product comes from TwelveSouth, makers some of the best iPad accessories. The TwelveSouth ParcSlope ($49.99) stand holds the iPad Pro at a nice 18-degree angle, perfect for working with your pictures on the iPad Pro, whether you’re using the Pencil or your fingers. An Eye-fi card (starting at $29.99 for 8GB) will help users easily move photos from camera to iPad Pro. The SD card includes Wi-Fi built into the card. Be careful because this drains the battery more quickly than a traditional SD card. iPad Pro Photo Editing Workflow Photographers use different steps in their photography work flow. However, here’s a few general steps everyone needs to follow. Get photos onto the iPad Pro and back them up. Organize them and select the best shots to edit first while marking the ones you don’t want to bother with. Process the photos using digital photo editing tools. Share the best photos. Go back to the shots you didn’t select or reject in step 2 and find photos you’d like to work with further to turn them into usable images by repeating steps 3 and 4. We don’t have the time or space to cover the above steps in detail, but lets look at them briefly. Import Photos and Back Them Up A photographer will import photos and back them up differently depending on the source of where the shots came from. Shot on a point-and-shoot or DSLR camera – use the adapter above and import them to the iPad. Back them up using iCloud photos sync, using a service like Dropbox, OneDrive or some other app that automatically backs up all of your photos. Shot on an iPhone – set the phone to sync your photos using iCloud (Settings, iCloud, Photos, turn on iCloud Photo Library, Upload to My Photo Stream, iCloud Photo Sharing and any others you wish to turn on). Shot on an Android Phone – use a service like Google’s Photos app or Dropbox on the Android phone and then load the iOS versions of those apps on the iPad Pro. Then save the Photos you want to work with to your iPad Pro Photo library. Shot on iPad Pro – nothing needed. They’re already on the iPad Pro. The iPad Pro’s camera isn’t the best choice for taking quality shots, but you can use it when there’s nothing else available. Organize Photos My favorite photo organization tool on the iPad is the Lightroom Mobile app. Follow the link to learn more about it and how to use it. The above video shows off the iPhone app, but it works the same way on the iPad Pro. It also syncs with the desktop version on Mac or Windows. If you don’t subscribe to Adobe Creative Cloud, consider doing it. It’s only $9.99/month to get Lightroom and Photoshop on the computer and the mobile versions. The full suite will cost $40/month for the programs and access to mobile apps. Add Adobe Stock Photos for another $30. For those who can afford an extra $10/month, the Lightroom Mobile app offers the best solution for organizing photos, doing basic edits and syncing with your desktop system. After you import photos, tag or select the best shots that you want to work with. Also tag the shots that you don’t want to bother with, like blurry shots or images that just don’t work. Lightroom mobile calls this rejecting the photo. Once you finish selecting the best shots and rejecting the useless shots, take another look. This second round focuses on images that you could turn into quality works of art or that you want to save for memories, even if they’re not the best pictures. In Lightroom or Photos, the user can create collections and tag shots with subjects or locations. In Photos, do this by hitting the Select button and then choose the shots you want to work with and tap on Add To button and either add the shots to an album or create a new one. Lightroom offers a similar feature. Photo Processing We won’t talk about Photo Processing in detail. Each app works differently and the user should learn how to master their favorite app. Here are the steps most users should follow: Crop the image. Fix photo temperature (warm or cool). Fix exposure, color and saturation. Correct blemishes, like dust spots, distracting backgrounds or red-eye. Add creative touches like Photo filters or lens flare. Share the image.   Share the Best Photos Find a good online photo sharing service. The pros like 500px (Free), but that can get intimidating for a beginner. The best shots online often come from 500px. Flickr also offers a nice photo sharing service. Some like to use Facebook, iCloud photo sharing, or Google Photos. Flickr’s app will automatically upload photos from the iPad’s Photos. Next, select the photos from within the app and create a collection, make them visible publicly or with Flickr followers, and/or share a link to the photo collection with social networks like Facebook or Twitter. Don’t forget you can still share photos in printed form. Users can either grab a nice photo printer that supports iOS printing or use a good photo printing service. One of our favorite services for printing digital photos is Apple’s photo printing service. The photographer can make nice prints, photo books, cards and digital sharing using iCloud sharing. Apple’s service won’t let photographers print directly from the iPad Pro. Users will have to edit the shots and then sync them using iCloud’s sync services built into Photos. Then open the Mac OS X version of Photos and select the photos. Choose to Create a Photo Book, Card, Calendar, Slideshow or Prints from the Photos File menu. Upload your photos to SizzelPix! to get a large beautiful metal canvas print. SizzelPix! offers a beautiful and unique way to display your works of art. They print your photo on a large piece of “durable, though lightweight metal base.” The company prints the images on a metal canvas from 18-inches to 6-feet starting at $199. One of the best Photography podcasters/bloggers, Derrick Story, recommends them on his website. The company offers multiple hanging and framing options. They look amazing. A few other services come with apps that you can install. They include… Snapfish Shutterfly Photobucket 500px Many of them will also force the user to sync the photos to the service and use the browser to order prints. Finally, consider a Mosaic photo book. Upload the photos using the service’s app. Then order the book, which costs about $20 and arrives within a week. 3 Responses 12/01/2015 Herbertlgarcia Reply 0=00014 my best friend’s step-sister makes $62 every hour on the laptop .

Apple is doing this because the company has no stock left of the ageing and now discontinued fourth generation iPad, 9to5Mac website reported on Saturday. Apple has also asked its staff to inform customers of the replacement unit's colour and capacity. The iPad Air 2 introduced a new gold colour option, and has 32GB and 128GB storage options while 16GB and 64GB models were discontinued. For that reason, the users may receive a slight upgrade in storage when getting a replacement in addition to the device's newer and more powerful internals overall. The iPad Air 2 was launched back in 2014 as a replacement for the fourth generation iPad, which was discontinued in October the same year. Weighing in at 437 grams, the iPad Air 2 was powered by the Apple A8X SoC, and said to deliver up to 10-hour battery life. iPad Air 2 also came with an improved 8-megapixel camera. iPad Air 2 offered faster connectivity with 802.11ac Wi-Fi with Multiple-In-Multiple-Out (MIMO) technology.

The U.S. technology giant is considering investing at least several billion dollars to take a stake of more than 20 percent in a plan that would have Toshiba maintain a partial holding to keep the business under U.S. and Japanese control, NHK reported, citing unidentified sources. The proposal is aimed at allaying the Japanese government's concerns over any transfer of sensitive technology to investors it deems a risk to national security, it said. Foxconn, which participated in the first round of the auction, has been considered such a risk due to its deep ties with China. The bulk of Apple's iPhones are manufactured at Foxconn's extensive manufacturing base there. Toshiba Is $6.3 Billion in the Hole After Some Terrible Business Decisions Apple Inc is considering teaming up with its supplier Foxconn to bid for Toshiba Corp's semiconductor business, public broadcaster NHK said on Friday - the latest twist in the sale of the world's second-biggest flash memory chipmaker. NHK said Apple wants the Taiwan firm to own a stake of around 30 percent of Toshiba's chip business. Apple was not immediately available to comment. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, declined to comment. An investment by Apple would be its first direct stake in a major global memory chipmaker as it seeks to secure a stable supply of key components. Samsung is the biggest maker of flash memory chips, followed by Toshiba, SK Hynix, and U.S.-based Micron Technology Inc. The report comes as Western Digital Corp, Toshiba's partner and one of the bidders of its chip business, warned this week that the Japanese firm is violating a joint venture contract in plans to sell to its chip unit, and urged that it be given exclusive negotiating rights. The auction of the prized asset is essential to Toshiba's plans to cover multi-billion writedowns at U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse that have plunged it into crisis. Toshiba has narrowed down the field of bidders for its chip unit to four suitors, sources have also said. They are U.S. chipmaker Broadcom Ltd, which has partnered with private equity firm Silver Lake Partners LP; South Korea's SK Hynix; Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker, and Western Digital. Broadcom has put in the highest first-round offer of 2.5 trillion yen ($23 billion), while Foxconn offered 2 trillion yen, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters this week. Apple was not part of any of those four bids, according to the person. It is unclear whether it participated in the first round of the auction that sources have said drew around 10 offers. Apple, Amazon, Google join bidding for Toshiba chip unit - media Apple Inc is considering teaming up with its supplier Foxconn to bid for Toshiba Corp's semiconductor business, public broadcaster NHK said on Friday - the latest twist in the sale of the world's second-biggest flash memory chipmaker. Shares in Toshiba fell 5 percent on Friday, hit by a Bloomberg report that the chip business sale had been temporarily put on hold to address the concerns raised by Western Digital, which Toshiba denied. "It is not true Toshiba has put the chip sale process on hold," a Toshiba spokesman said.

Global Voices 17 April 2017 Share Apple TV is displayed during an Apple media event in San Francisco, California, 9 September 2015 REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach This statement was originally published on globalvoices.org on 10 April 2017. Satirical news show, China Uncensored, says that the Apple TV app store has blocked users from accessing it not only in mainland China, but also in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Curated by Chris Chappell, the show was launched on YouTube in 2012 and is currently aired by New York-based New Tang Dynasty Television (NTD.TV), which is affiliated with Falun Gong - a religious practice that is suppressed in China. The show mocks the Chinese Communist Party and its authoritarian rule by curating news about crackdowns on dissidents, persecution of religious minorities and state-sponsored hacking activities, and turning them into satirical reporting. Often times, its stories are a mixture of jokes and facts that are built upon the stereotypical image of a totalitarian China. In a press statement on April 5, 2017, Chris Chappell stressed: I totally understand why we're blocked in mainland China. We're clearly disrupting the Communist Party's harmonious propaganda… but Hong Kong and Taiwan are not supposed to be under Chinese law. Although Hong Kong is part of China, under the One Country Two Systems principle, the region has an independent legal system. As for Taiwan, it has been a de facto self-governed entity since Kuomingtang of the Republic of China was defeated by the Chinese Communist Party and fled to the island in 1949. In both regions, NTD.TV has reporters covering local news and Falun Gong members are free to practise their religion. in March 2017, Apple approved the China Uncensored Apple TV app for availability in most of the world, but removed it from app stores in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Apple's legal team said its decision is in accordance with local laws: Apps must comply with all legal requirements in any location where you make them available (if you're not sure, check with a lawyer). We know this stuff is complicated, but it is your responsibility to understand and make sure your app conforms with all local laws […]. And of course, apps that solicit, promote, or encourage criminal or clearly reckless behavior will be rejected. While your app has been removed from the China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan App Stores, it is still available in the App Stores for the other territories you selected in iTunes Connect. Chris Chappell responded with satirical questions in a press statement: Is Apple so scared of the Chinese Communist Party that it would censor China Uncensored in Hong Kong and Taiwan, just in case? […] Or is Apple just confused about which places belong to China and this was all an accident? They should probably consult a lawyer, like we've done. In a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook on April 3, Chappell urged Apple to unblock the China Uncensored in Hong Kong and Taiwan app stores and vowed that he was prepared to take both legal and political action: … we have retained a public interest attorney who will represent us and is prepared to bring in a major law firm to take legal action, although we would prefer to resolve this matter quickly and without lawyers. If necessary, we are also prepared to discuss this issue with US federal regulators, who, while having no jurisdiction over Hong Kong or Taiwan, are nonetheless concerned with Apple's business operations in general as Apple moves competitively into the television industry. Since 2013, Apple has started taking down apps - including banned books and circumvention tools - from its China iTunes store in order to comply with local laws. In June 2016, China tightened its control over mobile applications with the introduction of Provisions on the Administration of Mobile Internet Application Information Service. These regulations outlaw applications that spread rumors and information deemed harmful to national security. In January 2017, The New York Times was taken down from the Apple iTunes Store because of such provisions. However, the newspaper's app remains available in the Hong Kong and Taiwan versions of the store. In the letter to Cook, Chappell stressed that while he is aware of the restrictions in China, the management of Apple's Hong Kong and Taiwan app stores should be different: No doubt, China Uncensored likely falls under some of mainland China's dubious legal categories such as: Undermining national unity Spreading rumors Disrupting social order There is no point in disputing your app store decision with respect to mainland China… but Hong Kong and Taiwan are not ruled by the Chinese Communist Party. They are regions that operate under independent legal systems. China Uncensored launched a petition on April 4, urging its viewers and supporters to tell Apple to "uncensor" the China Uncensored app from its Hong Kong and Taiwan app stores. As at the time of this story's publication, more than 5,800 people had signed.

(Photo: Justin Sullivan / Getty Images) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE Washington — Automakers are rushing to put self-driving cars on the road, but questions remain about who will be responsible for accidents that occur when vehicles are in control of primary driving tasks. A consumer safety group is trying to get ahead of the problem by pushing automakers to assume responsibility for crashes involving self-driving cars that they are testing now. To date, no manufacturers have made such a pledge to the Safe Autonomous Vehicles (SAVe) Campaign. Carmakers argue existing state insurance laws that determine liability are sufficient. The debate occurs as Apple Inc. signaled Friday it’s in the autonomous vehicle game: California OK’d Apple’s application to test three self-driving Lexus SUVs. General Motors Co. plans to put as many as 300 more self-driving vehicles on the road, according to government filings; GM already is testing more than 50 self-driving Chevrolet Bolt EVs on public roads in Detroit, San Francisco and Scottsdale, Arizona. Against that backdrop, the SAVe Campaign says it has challenged executives from Audi, BMW, Daimler, Fiat, Ford, GM, Honda, Land Rover, Lyft, Nissan, Porsche, Tesla, Toyota, Uber, Volvo and Volkswagen to agree to take responsibility for future self-driving car crashes that occur at the highest levels of automated driving. Jeremy Warriner, national SAVe Campaign spokesman and motor vehicle accident victims’ advocate, said his campaign supports the development of self-driving cars, but he thinks automakers should be willing to stand behind their products. “It’s an important technology that has to be developed,” he told The Detroit News on Tuesday, pointing out that it will benefit many people who are restrained in their mobility. “It’s just got to be done safely.” Volvo promised several months ago it would be willing to assume responsibility for crashes involving self-driving cars. Håkan Samuelsson, president and chief executive of Volvo Cars, said in a high-profile speech at the Swedish Embassy in Washington in October 2015 that Volvo would “accept full liability whenever one if its cars is in autonomous mode.” Samuelsson warned that there could be extenuating circumstances that lead to self-driving car crashes that are beyond his company’s control such as hacking, which he defined as a criminal activity. “We are constantly evolving defensive software to counter the risks associated with hacking a car,” Samuelsson said then. “We do not blame Apple, or Microsoft for computer viruses or hackers.” However, Volvo did not respond to the challenge to accept liability for self-driving autos from SAVe, and the company did not respond to a request for comment from The News. Harry Lightsey, executive director of global connected-customer public policy at GM, said his company believes existing insurance laws that are usually decided by states will be sufficient for self-driving cars. “There’s 100 years of legal precedent,” he said. “We don’t see a reason why that should be changed for autonomous vehicles. We stand behind our product. Just like we stand behind our products that we put on the road today, we still stand behind our autonomous vehicles when we put these on the road.” Lightsey added that since self-driving cars will be “even safer than vehicles that are driven by a person, we don’t think anything extraordinary needs to be done.” He said GM’s plan is to initially develop self-driving cars that are deployed in limited geographic areas: “We would own them, so obviously we would accept responsibility for those.” The U.S. Department of Transportation has signaled in guidance for self-driving cars issued in September that it agrees states should continue to regulate liability issues that arise for autonomous vehicles. A series of Michigan laws enacted last year are designed to allow wide latitude for automakers to test and operate self-driving vehicles on public roads. The law says computer systems that are operating cars autonomously without a human operator will be considered the operator of a vehicle if they can “satisfy electronically all physical acts” that are required of a driver. Jeff Cranson, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Transportation, said “liability laws were not modified under the bills,” but he added that the issue is a key topic for the state’s Council on Future Mobility created in December. Cranson said the panel has had one meeting so far, but has issued no recommendations. President Donald Trump’s administration has also promised to review self-driving guidelines and other pending regulations put in place by the Obama administration. Consumer advocates have vehemently disagreed that states are equipped to regulate self-driving car liability. “We’ve already seen companies like Tesla and Uber blame the human instead,” said John Simpson, privacy project director at the Santa Monica, California-based Consumer Watchdog group. He was referring to a fatal crash in 2016 in Florida that involved a distracted driver operating a 2015 Tesla Model S with its automated driving system activated, and to a more recent accident in Arizona that involved a self-driving Volvo operated by Uber that flipped onto its side after another vehicle failed to yield. “In the long run, taking responsibility will help the companies,” Simpson continued. “If they don’t trust their own technology, how could consumers ever trust them and adopt self-driving cars?” James Lynch, vice president of data and information services and chief actuary of the New York-based Insurance Information Institute, said automakers are already held responsible for crashes if they are found to be caused by faulty parts in most cases. He acknowledged the liability picture become more murky when cars are fully autonomous. “We kind of have that now,” he said of the idea of holding automakers responsible for accidents caused by faulty products. “What it depends on is who the courts or the adjudication process finds to be at fault,” he said. “It could be with the manufacturer if there are defective parts. It could be with the state if they didn’t update their signs, or it could be with the driver if they didn’t download an update they needed to. But whoever the liability sits with, they’re probably going to have insurance.” Auto companies have been pushing for lax regulations that will allow for widespread self-driving car testing. They have largely tried to steer clear of thorny liability issues that will have to be solved before autonomous cars can roll on U.S. roads, arguing that cars that are fully autonomous will be much less accident-prone than vehicles are today. “Automakers expect to assume responsibility for properly utilized systems they design and install in a vehicle at the time of assembly,” said Daniel Gage, senior director of communications and public affairs at Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which lobbies for U.S. automakers in Washington. Gage said automakers are more worried about safety during the interim period when cars are partially self-driving using modes like autopilot are operating on roads alongside cars being driven by humans than they are about fully autonomous vehicles. He said most automakers have opted to focus on developing fully autonomous vehicle that can take over the driving task completely. klaing@detroitnews.com (202) 662-8735 Twitter: @Keith_Laing CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2oOeZBp TOP VIDEOS Ken Lingenfelter on his astounding car collection 2:30 IRS agent warns of tax scams 3:28 GM cars hoisted up to the Comerica Park fountain 0:50 Sen.

LIKE   TWEET   SHARE   PIN   SHARE   POST MAIL MORE Posted 2 hours ago by iClarified · 1191 views · Translate Apple is planning to update tvOS for Apple TV with multi-user support, picture-in-picture, and more, according to The Verifier. A 'reliable source' tells the site that Apple will unveil some significant updates to tvOS at WWDC in June. A key feature will be support for multiple users on the fourth generation device. The multi-user option allows each user to connect his or her Apple ID account to the TV using his or her iOS device (iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad) and create a unique profile for it. Once the account is synchronized, each user can listen to his music from Apple Music, view iCloud-backed photos and videos, watch downloaded content on his iTunes account, and of course use his own apps that support the TVs. Work on the multi-user feature is said to be in the advanced stages but there is no guarantee it will be in the first update to tvOS. Another big feature will allegedly be picture-in-picture support. When watching a favorite program or a short video, you can actually minimize the window to one of the screen corners and run another app at the same time, but playing other video or audio content will replace that. These new features are said to be in addition to Apple's plans for a live programming guide and a monthly subscription to select television streams. Recent reports suggest Apple could offer a bundle of HBO, Showtime, and Starz following its inability to negotiate deals for a larger conventional TV package.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Can Nokia 9 beat Xiaomi Mi 6, Samsung Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8? What we know so far Nokia 9 is expected to give Xiaomi Mi 6, Samsung Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8 a run for money when it is launched. Raymond Ronamai   April 17, 2017 08:56 IST Reuters The hype around Nokia devices is phenomenal as HMD Global is bringing them back from the brim of extinction. A few handsets, namely the Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6, have already hit stores in select countries. And now more handsets – Nokia 7, Nokia 8 and Nokia 9 – are in the offing. However, the Nokia 9 is the flagship and it will have to compete with the just-unveiled Samsung Galaxy S8 and the yet-to-be released Xiaomi Mi 6 and Apple's iPhone 8. Nokia 9 is expected to be released in the second half of 2017. Reports have claimed that it could be launched either in late July or early August. It is expected to come with a price tag of €749 in Europe, $699 in the United States and Rs 44,999 in India. Also read: Best Nokia smartphones of 2017: Details of Nokia 7, 8 and 9 It is almost certain that the Nokia 9 will take on some of the flagships of 2017, like the Samsung Galaxy S8, Xiaomi Mi 6 and Apple's iPhone 8. Here is how the handset will stack up against these premium flagships. The Nokia 9 is expected to have a new bezel-less design in the front, with dual cameras at the back. It is expected to come with features like an IP68 water-and-dust resistant certification, a fingerprint scanner, an iris scanner and an OZO audio. Under the hood, it is expected to have a 5.5-inch QHD OLED display with a 1,440x2,560 resolution, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, and an Android 7.1.2 Nougat operating system. Reports also claim that the device will come packed with a 6GB RAM and a 64GB/128GB internal memory (with microSD card slot), mount a 22MP PDAF camera with Zeiss optics and a 12MP front-snapper, and powered by a 3,800mAh battery with Quick Charge 4.0 support. On the other hand, the Xiaomi Mi 6 is expected to come in two variants. The regular model is expected to be priced at 2,299 Yuan (around $333 / Rs 21,800), sport a 5.15-inch display (1,920x1,080p resolution), powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, run Android Nougat OS, come packed with a 4GB/6GB RAM and a 32GB/64GB/128GB internal memory, mount a 19MP main camera with Sony IMX400 sensor and an 8MP front-snapper, and house a 3,200mAH battery. The other model, dubbed as the Mi 6 Plus, is expected to sport a 5.7-inch screen (2,560x1,440p resolution), powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, and run Android Nougat OS. It is also expected to feature a 4GB/6GB/8GB RAM, a 64GB/128GB/256GB internal storage, a 12MP dual lens camera with Sony IMX362 sensor on the rear, an 8MP front-snapper, and a 4,500mAh battery with Quick Charge 4.0 support. It will be reportedly priced at 3,499 Yuan (around $508 / Rs 33,200). Apple's iPhone 8 may be still months away before release but curiosity around it has started building up. It is expected to come in three variants, with an OLED screen, a new fingerprint ID solution, no physical button and with a wireless charger. The iPhone 8 is expected to sport a 4.7-inch display, iPhone 8 Plus with 5.5-inch screen, and a premium version with 5.8-inch display. The premium variant is expected to be priced at around $1,000 but key specifications are yet to be leaked. Samsung Galaxy S8Samsung The Samsung Galaxy S8 sports a 5.8-inch Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with 1,440x2,960 pixels (570 ppi pixel density), powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 (US model) / Exynos 8895 processor (EMEA), and run Android 7.0 Nougat operating system. It features a 4GB RAM, a 64GB internal memory expandable by 256GB via microSD card, a 12MP main camera with f/1.7 aperture, 26mm lens, phase detection autofocus, OIS, LED flash, 1/2.5" sensor size, 1.4 µm pixel size and 9MP image recording, an 8MP front snapper with f/1.7 aperture and autofocus, and a 3,000mAh battery. It is priced at $720 in the US (around €669 / Rs 46,706). Going by the specifications leaked so far, it seems that the Nokia 9 will come with the best technology currently available in the market and would be priced less than the iPhone 8 and the Galaxy S8, and a little more than the Mi 6. There are chances that people would be more attached to the Nokia device as it was the market leader at one point in time. So it is likely to beat the major flagships of 2017, or at least give them a run for money.

Apple TV New Report Claims Apple is Working On Multi-User Profiles for Apple TV By Arron Hirst 4 hours ago Share Tweet One of the perhaps more glaring omissions with the Apple TV – today, is the inability for users to setup specific profiles so that features, preferences and settings reflect that of the person who is currently using the device … While it is arguable that Apple’s streaming box already allows for this somewhat, with the switching out of both store and iCloud accounts in the device’s settings panel – (actions that will, in turn, replace the photos, music and other media of the previous user, with the current one), it’s currently not yet possible to do this via a streamline ‘login’ system; such as the one seen in macOS or when using Netflix, where users can instead simply select their profile picture to access their own personal content and settings. This feature, however, may not be too far away from coming to tvOS … and perhaps even, iOS. That’s because, according to a new report which surfaced over the weekend (via The Verifier), the Cupertino company is said to be considering adding support for the above described user profile system, alongside picture-in-picture in its next major planned update to the platform. Apple, Inc “[…] changing account[s] is said to be as simple as changing a TV channel,” 9to5Mac explains relaying information from the original report. “The site also claims that Apple will bring a version of Picture-in-Picture to the Apple TV. This will work similar to [PiP] on iOS 9,” it adds. Apple is currently expected to publicly detail -if not demo- its next software updates designed for iOS, Mac, Apple TV and Apple Watch at this year’s Worldwide Developer Conference, set to take place in June.

It has long been known that Apple is working on automotive-related projects, but the company has never publicly confirmed any details. The news was made public by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles on Friday. The agency said Apple has been given permission to test three cars manufactured by Lexus. Apple has not commented — other than to point to its letter late last year expressing an interest in the technology. The company was “excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation”, it said at the time. Rumours about Apple’s car ambitions have ranged from speculation it was building its own car to the suggestion it was instead focusing more on in-car software. Internally known as Project Titan, the project at one point was understood to have more than 1,000 employees working on it, though the current scale of Apple’s efforts is unknown. Encountering self-driving cars in California is a daily occurrence for those living around Silicon Valley. Apple has become the 30th company to be granted a testing permit. Among the stipulations for approval is the requirement to regularly report back statistics on the performance of the technology – including how often humans have to intervene when the computer gets it wrong.

The government, state and federal who continue to banter on who owns the waterways should be to blaim for these accidents. Why is it that shanties are only demolished and re-planned after people have built them, roads widened and created after communities have emerged and taxation imposed on business sectors where the government laid no foundation? Our governments are skilled in the art of reaping(where they have not sown) not sowing. It seems the traditional understanding of government as “Ijoba”(literally, eating the portion of the king) has infused our democracy so that the government sees itself as the one who harvests what the people sow and not as the one who plants on behalf of the people so that they may have something to sow.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile It looks like the iPhone 8 will be even sleeker than we thought Image Source: Vianney le Masne Yoni Heisler @edibleapple April 14th, 2017 at 8:51 AM Share Tweet With Apple reportedly still trying to improve yields associated with embedding the Touch ID sensor into the iPhone 8 display, a new report from iDropNews suggests that the company will not opt to place the sensor on the back of the device. This is particularly encouraging news as a recently leaked schematic of the iPhone 8 seemed to indicate otherwise. As it turns out, the leaked iPhone 8 schematic we highlighted yesterday is in the EVT (Engineering Validation Test) phase, which is to say that it’s just one of many prototypes Apple was busy exploring. Indeed, it’s no secret that Apple often tests a handful of different iPhone models before choosing a final design and sending it off for mass production. Once a final design is approved, it goes through DVT (Design Validation Test) phase. In other words, there’s still plenty of reason for iPhone enthusiasts hoping for a radical new redesign to get excited. Don't Miss: Galaxy S8 sales are already explosive That said, iDropNews, citing a source working within Foxconn, writes that Apple is currently testing two different iPhone 8 designs but that the design likely to enter mass production will be the sleek-looking device with an embedded Touch ID we’ve been dreaming of. [The] informant divulged there are two iPhone 8 prototypes currently being tested. The first model features Touch ID on the rear, however the second model does in fact feature Touch ID underneath the display. There are a few major differences between the two prototypes listed below. Based on the following information, we’re hoping this version becomes the official design for the iPhone 8, and the source is confident that it will be. According to the report, the iPhone 8 will feature 4mm bezels around the entire OLED display. Additionally, the report relays that the device will feature an ‘invisible’ front-facing camera along with a larger power button. Helping us envision what this mythical iPhone 8 might look like, iDropNews yesterday published some eye-popping new renders which provide us with clearer idea as to what the final iPhone 8 design will look like. Image Source: iDropNews Image Source: iDropNews Placing the Touch ID sensor on the back of the iPhone 8 would certainly make life easier for Apple engineers, but such a design would undoubtedly be a huge step backwards with respect to usability. An edgeless display is certainly something most everyone wants to see, but sacrificing easy access to Touch ID — a feature most people use dozens of times a day at the very least — would be a net negative as far as the overall design is concerned. Design issues aside, an analyst report recently disclosed that the iPhone 8 will include 3GB of RAM and will come in 64GB and 256GB storage options. Additionally, Apple’s next-gen device will reportedly include improved water resistance, fast-charging capabilities, and incredible battery life.

Apple Inc. started developing a self-driving car a few years ago before it pulled back and focused on first developing underlying autonomous technology, Bloomberg News reported last year. Apple provided its first public acknowledgement that it is working on self-driving technology in a notice to federal regulators late last year, but this is the first time the company has received approval to publicly test it. With an influx of both automotive and technology companies developing self-driving vehicles, California’s DMV instated an approval process in 2014 for testing on public roads.

The device, which could launch as the iPhone X or iPhone Pro, has been tipped to feature everything from a new design to integrated facial recognition technology. Now, however, it's been suggested that the device could play host to something not seen on any other mainstream flagship smartphone. The unusual feature in question is a second internal battery, with analysts claiming the phone will play host to two power supplies. Apple iPhone 8 - Leaked photographs, concept images and renders Friday, 6th January 2017 iPhone 8 is shaping up to be one of the most impressive Apple smartphones to date, with glass panels on the front and rear of the device, a curved borderless OLED display and no Home Button 1 / 10 VENIAMIN GESKIN • TWITTER • CONCEPT IMAGES Apple iPhone 8 will debut a brand-new all-glass look, with a curved OLED display and no physical Home Button It's currently unclear exactly how this internal overloading would work, or why two presumably smaller batteries would offer more of a benefit than a single larger power unit. However, the claim has an air of authority having been made by Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri. According to Mr Arcuri, "the 5.8-inch model will likely have extended battery life with two packs of batteries." This innovative handset is expected to drop alongside 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch devices that will line up as more traditional iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S updates. GETTY Aside from the unusual battery predictions, something that's not previously been teased and we'd suggest taking with a pinch of salt, Mr Arcuri has suggested the phone will feature a series of more conventional upgrades. This will reportedly include a move to 3GB of RAM with the phone also tipped to be made available in both 64GB and 256GB capacity options. By contrast, the revamped iPhone 7S and 7S Plus options are expected to echo Apple's currently flagship phones and drop in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB forms. Elsewhere, although the new phone will reportedly retain Apple's trademark Lightning connection, it's suggested the iPhone 8 will utilise USB Type-C Power Delivery technology for faster charging. Despite the recent flurry of rumours and speculation, the iPhone 8 isn't expected to launch for a number of months. Tipped to be formally unveiled in September alongside its two, less impressive siblings, it's currently unclear exactly when the phone will go on to hit retailers' shelves. While a late September release had previously been tipped, mutterings of potential delays have already started to emerge. According to Mr Arcuri, production issues and low yield rates on certain components could see Apple forced into holding off the release of the tenth anniversary iPhone.

Apple is now offering fourth-generation iPad owners a free iPad Air 2 upgrade in case their devices are in need of repair.  ( Justin Sullivan | Getty Images ) Advertisement Advertisement iPad owners are in for a sweet deal. Anyone who'll bring their fourth-generation iPad to Apple for service may have it upgraded to an iPad Air 2. Apple Offering 4th-Gen iPad Owners Free Upgrades To iPad Air 2 However, a caveat: The free upgrade only concerns customers in need of a full replacement, meaning minor touch-ups might not entail a full transition to the newer and more capable iPad Air 2. The upgrade will be available on Apple stores and authorized service providers. Apple has greenlit the policy as a way to properly allocate its inventory. It's readily allowing shipments of iPad Air 2 in place of fourth-generation iPads because stocks of the latter are becoming increasingly thin, if not totally unavailable, having been discontinued in 2014. Obtained by 9to5Mac, the internal memo reads: "Starting March 30th, iPad 4th generation whole unit repairs may be substituted to iPad Air 2." The memo also mentions that staff should inform customers of what color and how much storage capacity they'll receive. The iPad Air 2, for the uninitiated, introduced a new gold colorway, and most recently had available configurations of 32 GB and 128 GB. The iPad Air 2 16 GB and 64 GB models were discontinued earlier. To that end, users might be in for a sweet storage capacity upgrade, in addition to the iPad Air 2's more powerful internals, of course. The iPad Air 2 has also been discontinued recently, although Apple will keep shipping them until supplies of the fourth-generation iPad run out. Typically, Apple supports devices up to five years following their discontinuation. This means fourth-generation iPad users may continue to get repairs and services from authorized providers, in addition to Apple's own stores. It's worth noting that many Apple Stores can't facilitate repairs, so they might provide replacement devices instead. There's still no guarantee, however, that your fourth-generation iPad will be replaced by an iPad Air 2. Upgrades will vary depending on stock in specific regions, so if if you need to bring your iPad in for servicing, you should check with Apple stores or authorized service providers if you're eligible for an upgrade while there. Latest iPad Model Apple unveiled the newest iPad model late March as it officially bid goodbye to the iPad Air 2. It is now simply named "iPad." It sports a 9.7-inch screen and retails for a starting price of $329, targeted for budget users. The base model comes equipped with Wi-Fi connectivity and 32 GB of onboard storage. Bump it up to $459 and you'll get cellular connectivity on top of Wi-Fi. The refresh is seemingly aimed at users with old iPad models looking for an upgrade that won't break the bank. The new iPad comes equipped with an A9 chip with 64-bit architecture, an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera, a 1.2-megapixel FaceTime camera, Touch ID, and iOS 10 out of the box. Thoughts about the free upgrade? Do you have an erring fourth-generation iPad that's in dire in need of repair? Maybe it's time to upgrade — for free!

Kevin Purcell04/16/2017 The Apple Pencil does a great job for artists, students and anyone who wants to doodle or take handwritten notes digitally. Unfortunately, the Pencil doesn’t work with every iPad Apple makes. We’ll look at which iPads you can use the Pencil with and offer some alternatives if you don’t want to upgrade an incompatible iPad. We’ll also offer some Apple Pencil tips and tricks from our past articles. Apple Pencil and the iPad Pro 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch The Apple Pencil works with the 12.9-inch Apple iPad Pro that came out in late 2015. At first that was the only iPad it would work with. Then last year, in the Spring, Apple introduced the 9.7-inch Apple iPad Pro. These are the only two iPads that work with the Pencil. Apple iPad Pro 9.7-inch, available in Rose Gold, Space Gray, Gold and Silver, works with the Apple Pencil. Apple offers multiple styles including the two sizes, 9.7-inch (starting at $599) and 12.9-inch (starting at $899). The smaller size iPad Pro comes in four colors, Silver, Gold, Space Gray and Rose Gold. In the larger size, they only offer Silver, Space Gray and Gold. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro works with the Apple Pencil and comes in three colors, Space Gray, Gold and Silver. Apple just released an update to the regular non-Pro 9.7-inch Apple iPad. It costs less than any other brand new iPad ever introduced starting at $329, but it doesn’t work with the Apple Pencil, despite the fact that it’s the latest iPad out of Apple’s headquarters. It’s not an iPad Pro model, instead fitting more in the education and low-end tablet markets. That might surprise people used to Apple focusing on the high-end market ceding the budget devices market to the competition. With Chromebooks becoming more popular in schools, it seems Apple chose to go after them with this new lower cost option. However, they didn’t put support for Apple Pencil in the new tablet. Notice the three-pin connector on the edge of the iPad Pro. To keep prices low on this model, they didn’t include the Apple Pencil or the Apple Smart Connector that hooks up to their Keyboard Cover, which starts at $149 for the smaller model. The company also lowered the price on the iPad mini 4, which doesn’t work with the Apple Pencil or the keyboard either. The iPad mini 4 used to cost $399 for one with 32GB, but they dropped the 32GB model and lowered the price on the 128GB model to $399. Apple Pencil Alternatives for Non Pro iPads People who own a non-Pro iPad can still use a stylus and get fine-point inking to take notes or even draw and paint in beautiful art apps. We published a list of alternatives to the Apple Pencil. The tools from Adonit work best. They offer my favorite alternative, the Adonit Dash 2. It has a fine tip like the Apple Pencil and doesn’t need the user to pair it with Bluetooth, like most fine-tip stylus options. Wacom makes the Wacom Fineline 2, another great stylus for art and writing on the iPad. It cost $59.95 and comes in 4 colors. It works with every iPad, but the iPad Pro 9.7-inch for some reason. You get pressure sensitivity and a fine tip. Charge it with a micro-USB cable. Apple Pencil Tips and Tricks We published 12 tips and tricks that can help you get the most out of your Apple Pencil, if you do get one. First, make sure to get a case or attachment that will keep the Pencil with your iPad Pro. I like the Switch Easy Cover Buddy. It sells for $39 on Amazon. Hold the pencil normally and get regular lines. Hold it at an extremely low angle and draw using the side of the tip and you get shading. You can use the art features by doing two things. Press harder to get darker and wider lines in supported apps. Also, hold it like an art pencil and press using the side of the tip instead of the small tip to get shading as seen above. See the link above for other tips like putting paper over the iPad Pro screen and tracing through the Paper using the Apple Pencil.

Macs & Mac OS X | 04 Apr 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (13) Maca Culpa: Apple Admits Mac Pro Missteps and Promises More Transparency by Adam C. Engst In an unprecedented move, Apple invited five prominent industry journalists to an on-the-record meeting with top executives Phil Schiller, Craig Federighi, and John Ternus (VP of Hardware Engineering). The writers included John Gruber of Daring Fireball, Matthew Panzarino of TechCrunch, Lance Ulanoff of Mashable, Ina Fried of Axios, and John Paczkowski of BuzzFeed. The topic of discussion? The Mac Pro, why it has taken Apple so long to update it, and Apple’s commitment to the professional market. I’ll say more about that in a moment, but first, let me recommend that you read at least the first two of the articles linked above — Panzarino and Gruber, in particular, did an excellent job of capturing both what was said and the implications of those statements. In short, Apple did something it has never done before — assemble a panel of reporters for an on-the-record talk in which it acknowledged design errors and missteps with the current Mac Pro, pre-announced a new Mac Pro accompanied by a new pro display that won’t ship this year, and admitted that it needs to communicate better with its pro users. No, this wasn’t an April Fools prank. In essence, this is Apple arguing with my claims in “Understanding Apple’s Marginalization of the Mac” (21 November 2016) that the iOS platform reigns supreme within the company and conceding the point Josh Centers made about the slippery slope of losing pro customers in “What Apple Can Learn from Airwalk” (6 February 2017). To show how important the Mac remains to Apple, Phil Schiller said that the Mac user base is nearing 100 million users and is a $25 billion business — on its own, it’s nearly a Fortune 100 company. (Also interesting was the statistic that notebooks make up 80 percent of Mac sales, with desktops at 20 percent. It’s not surprising, given the stagnation of the Mac Pro and the Mac mini.) The Apple execs also came right out and said that the Mac and the pro audience were key. Schiller said, “The Mac has an important, long future at Apple, that Apple cares deeply about the Mac, we have every intention to keep going and investing in the Mac. And if we’ve had a pause in upgrades and updates on that, we’re sorry for that — what happened with the Mac Pro, and we’re going to come out with something great to replace it.” Craig Federighi chimed in, saying “The Mac is — we say it over and over, we’re saying it again here — a huge part of our future, we’re deeply invested in it.” But the entire point of this meeting was to address the pro reaction to Apple’s lack of either concrete actions or announcements in the past. Gruber asked whether Apple is aware of just how many serious Mac users have begun to doubt the company’s commitment to the Mac in general, and the needs of professional Mac users in particular, eliciting this response from Schiller: It’s a reasonable question, and this is why we’re here today, specifically, to address that question above all else. We’re committed to the Mac, we’ve got great talent on the Mac, both hardware and software, we’ve got great products planned for the future, and as far as our horizon line can see, the Mac is a core component of the things Apple delivers, including to our pro customers. At the moment, Apple has only words to reassure pro users, since the executives said that a completely redesigned Mac Pro and pro display are coming, but they won’t arrive this year. So communication is essential if pros are to stick with the Mac platform for another eight months minimum. But openness isn’t Apple’s style, so we’ll see if the company continues to share details about the future. Apple should be heartened to see that the community seems to be taking this increased commitment to transparency as a positive sign. In our informal Twitter poll, 75 percent of respondents said that it’s good news and isn’t too little, too late. (Next time we’ll run the poll longer, so more people have a chance to vote.) Other useful statements that came out of the meeting include: Existing configurations of the current Mac Pro are now available at lower prices (see “Apple Drops Cylindrical Mac Pro Prices by $1000,” 4 April 2017). The redesigned Mac Pro will not include a touchscreen like Microsoft’s Surface Studio. Federighi suggested that Apple’s approach will involve making the iPad Pro work better with the Mac. The iMac is slated to receive some upgrades this year, including configurations targeted specifically at the pro market. Apple had nothing specific to say about the future of the Mac mini, though Schiller did say that was because “it’s more of a mix of consumer with some pro use.” When Gruber asked about scripting and automation, Federighi replied, “We think scriptability and automation of the system remain super important.”   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment James Bailey   2017-04-04 15:10 Well I'm one of those users who absolutely loves my 2013 6-core Mac Pro. The design is perfect for me as a developer. I can add boatloads of RAM and I have a larger RAID array attached to the thunderbolt 2 bus. I write software for a living and live inside virtual machines all day. This computer is perfect for that use case. So while the design is clearly flawed for future updates, it isn't flawed in conception in my view. I am happy to learn that just about when my 2013 Mac Pro starts feeling a little old and slow, I will be able to upgrade to whatever is next but right now it does everything I need and more. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-04 15:37 The Apple guys said basically what you just did — that the current Mac Pro was great for some professionals, but that the design wasn't ideal for all pros. Reply Geoff Duncan   2017-04-04 21:16 I'm glad the cylindrical Mac Pro has been useful to some people, James! I do a lot of work in pro audio and a bit of multi-platform software development. I can count the number of cylindical Mac Pros I've seen in the wild on the thumbs of one hand. I see old Mac Pro towers in use all the time. I'm glad Apple said *something* about the state of desktop Macs and is trying to reach out to pro users. As someone for whom iMacs and MacBook Pros don't really work, I can't say I'm excited, though. Reply Lewis Butler   2017-04-06 13:54 The 2013 MacPro would have been my ideal machine had it had better GPUs. I know those GPUs are pretty good for things like Final Cut, but they are not that great for GPU intensive tasks like folding and gaming (which is what I mostly use GPUs for, and a little video encoding). As it stands now, I am waiting for the new iMac (iMac Pro?) and will buy that. My days of needing a Mac Pro are behind me (though not my days of *WANTING* a Mac Pro 😜😝) Reply Anonymous   2017-04-06 16:16 Isn't that driven by folks investment in specialized PCI based hardware? If one has $5k-10K invested in one of those setups then it's understandable to milk 10 years out of it. I think it's also reasonable for Apple for to move on and not maintain backward compatibility with specialized hardware after that many years. The ThunderBolt bus is just as fast and far more modular. It would allow one to switch out the underlying computer more frequently. Reply Geoff Duncan   2017-04-06 21:08 Yes, it's true that for a lot of audio and video pros, their Macs are essentially peripherals connected to their studio gear. Most of those setups use PCI cards. A thunderbolt chassis for PCI cards *can* work with some of those setups, as can Thunderbolt breakout boxes. The question for many pros is whether they want to go to the expense of getting those systems set up with a cylindrical Mac Pro (since that often means upgrading or replacing their external hardware as well), or just to migrate to an already-compatible and far less expensive PC. I think that's why the only cylindrical Mac Pro I've seen in the wild was in a studio facility built from scratch: everything ther was new, no legacy digital hardware at all. Reply Greg  2017-04-04 20:50 What about Pro apps? Aperture? FCP? Although from what I hear they've already lost the video/film editing business. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-05 10:45 Nothing was said about Aperture ("It's dead, Jim.") but Apple did talk about Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X. My understanding is that FCPX has gotten better over the years and may be more or less back to where FCP was before, but many people already switched. Reply Jon Hall  2017-04-06 17:19 A very welcome admission of a misstep with the MacPro. Will Apple please go the whole hog and resurrect Aperture? I know there are other options, but they're not palatable to me. Reply robtbass   2017-04-10 20:44 "We’re sorry for . . . what happened with the Mac Pro, and we’re going to come out with something great to replace it.” I have to say that that statement sounds uncomfortably like Donald Trump on the Affordable Care Act. Reply peter lees  2017-04-10 22:35 I wonder if they'll have similar regrets about the 2016 macbook pro? such a disappointment & has stopped me from upgrading... Reply Benjamin Lowengard  2017-04-11 07:31 Not so sure to tag this as GREAT news- but it is news. Thing is I still have Pro Users buying old Cheese Graters because Trash Cans make them invest so much more in new peripherals. Mac Mini, Mac Mini Mac Mini. I was ready to buy a new Mac Mini when the last version came out but it was so lacking that I bought a 2011 iMac instead. I think the Pro laptops are nice but so un-upgradeable -that that's because a cause of concern. I still think Apple could drop the Pro down another 500$, and if they go to 5 USB3 on the next iMac I might scream. BTW, I love my 2011 iMac and I have not maxed out upgrades to it yet! Reply Bruce  2017-04-14 06:50 I sold my 2009 Mac Pro that was totally kitted out with 48 gigs of RAM, SSD boot, excellent graphics cards - so I could buy a 27" iMac that was supposed to be a screamer. It was not. I've regretted it from day one. I now have a desk full of goodies that used to be inside the Mac Pro. I came close to buying a refitted 2010 MacPro this past weekend. Updated with super fast cards and SSD's. Apple seems to forgot that form without function is worthless to working creative professionals. I burn Blu-Ray back-ups of video and still files - along with backing up to hard drives. I could never back-up my files via the cloud. The original cheese-grater Mac was perfect - loads of space, load of OPTIONS and the it worked. My desk, with my 27" iMac looks like an OWC ad with all the extras drives and connectors. If Apple made a new "cheese grater" that actually worked, I would buy it in a heartbeat. If not, I'll switch to a BOXX computer and run Windows.

Apple Enters Self-Driving Car Race VOA News Facebook 0 Twitter 0 E-mail More Google+ LinkedIn KakaoStory April 17, 2017 08:19 Apple is joining the fiercely competitive race to design self-driving cars, raising the possibility that a company that has already re-shaped culture with its iPhone may try to transform transportation, too.  Ending years of speculation, Apple's late entry into a crowded field was made official Friday with the disclosure that the California Department of Motor Vehicles had awarded a permit for the company to start testing its self-driving car technology on public roads in the state. The permit covers three vehicles -- all 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs -- and six individual drivers. California law requires people to be in a self-driving car who can take control if something goes wrong. ◆ Apple Goes Mobile... in a New Way Apple confirmed its arrival in the self-driving car market, but wouldn't discuss its intentions. Its interest in autonomous vehicle technology, however, has long been clear . The Cupertino, California, company pointed to a statement that it issued in December. "Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,'' the company said then. "There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation.'' Apple released that statement after Steve Kenner, a former Ford Motor executive who is now Apple's director of product integrity, notified federal regulators of the company's interest in self-driving cars in a letter. Like others, Apple believes self-driving cars could ease congestion and save millions of people who die annually in traffic accidents often caused by drunk or distracted motorists. Self-driving cars could also be a lucrative new market. And Apple has been searching for its next act for a while, one that will take it beyond its mainstay phones, tablets and personal computers. The Apple logo is seen above a store location entrance, in Dallas, Texas on Sept. 19, 2013. /AP ◆ A Next Big Thing Although iPhone's ongoing popularity has helped Apple remain the world's most valuable company, the company hasn't had a breakthrough product since the 2010 debut of the iPad, currently in the throes of a three-year sales slump. The dry spell has raised doubts as to whether Apple lost some of its trend-setting magic with the death of co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Apple will be vying against 29 other companies that already have California permits to test self-driving cars. The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has been spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. Since Google began its work on self-driving vehicles eight years ago, Waymo's fleet of self-driving cars has logged more than 2 million miles on the road. That means Apple has a long way to catch up in self-driving technology. But it has often been a follower in markets that it eventually revolutionized. It wasn't the first to introduce a digital music player, smartphone, or tablet before its iPod, iPhone and iPad came out. ◆ Deep Pockets With $246 billion in cash, Apple also could easily afford to buy technology that accelerates its development of self-driving cars. There has been recurring speculation that Apple might eventually acquire Tesla, which has a market value of about $50 billion. Neither Apple nor Tesla has given any inkling that they're interested in joining forces, though. Speculation about Apple's interest in expanding into automobiles began swirling in 2015 amid media reports that the company had begun secretly working on building its own electric car under the name project "Titan.'' Apple never confirmed the existence of Titan, which is now believed to be dead. Copyright © Chosunilbo & Chosun.com Previous Next All Headlines Back to Top

In fact, he’s convinced Apple, Google and Facebook will be bigger in 2075, the theme of next weekend’s Silicon Valley Comic Con , “The Future of Humanity: Where Will We Be in 2075?” SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Steve Wozniak is no stranger to predictions. The three-day conference, which Wozniak helped create last year, explores the intersection of pop culture and technology. This year’s guests includes the 30th anniversary cast reunion of Star Trek: The Next Generation, actors William Shatner and John Cusack, former astronaut Buzz Aldrin and renowned architect Greg Lynn.SVCC is expected to draw 75,000 to 100,000 from April 21-23 to downtown San Jose. In addition to a start-up village and space exploration zone, its exhibit floor showcases entertainment companies, comic book vendors, and technology exhibits for virtual reality, robotics and smart devices. Panels and film presentations will weigh in on flying cars, aliens, Mars, the implantation of computers into brains and other space-age stuff, show organizers say.Wozniak is no stranger to predictions. In 1982, he said portable laptops would emerge. And he has strong opinions on how we’ll live in 58 years.”Apple will be around a long time, like IBM ,” Wozniak said in an interview on Friday. “Look at Apple’s cash . It can invest in anything. It would be ridiculous to not expect them to be around . The same goes for Google and Facebook.” Advertisement Woz shared some other predictions on what type of planet we can expect in 2075: New cities. Deserts could be ideal locations for cities of the future, designed and built from scratch, according to Wozniak. There, housing problems will not exist and people will shuttle among domed structures. Special wearable suits will allow people to venture outside, he said. The influence of artificial intelligence. Within all cities, AI will be ubiquitous, Wozniak says.

Updates to tvOS 9 focused a lot on feature parity with the previous Apple TV and recent iOS updates, and tvOS 10 updates introduced the new TV app and single sign-on feature. Here’s what we’re hoping to see this year from tvOS 11 at Apple’s developer conference in June. Sony A6500 TV Apple launched its new TV app last December through tvOS 10.1, but it’s still limited to the United States. The TV app does a decent job of presenting shows you watch in one interface instead of digging around for something to watch in multiple apps. The top request for the TV app this year is introducing it to more countries. Next on our list has to be true Netflix support. Some features work sort of by accident, but you can’t use the TV app to its full potential with Netflix like you can with officially supported services. Netflix was a big missing partner to start, and hopefully tvOS 11 offers something to resolve that. Finally, the TV app could benefit from a focus on presenting live content when available. You can already use Siri to jump to live content on specific channels with a feature called Live Tune In, but there’s really no visual user interface for this. The TV app would be the natural location for such an interface. I would also love to see Apple promote single sign-on apps more prominently on the tvOS App Store. They’re currently highlighted with an app tile that goes to the collection, but I wouldn’t mind seeing this promoted to a top-level navigation item. Siri We’re probably years away from this actually happening (who knows!), but the dream is talking to Siri on one device and having Siri do something on another device. For example, you could ask Siri on your iPhone to play Finding Dory on the family room Apple TV. You can already get part of the way there with the Remote app for iPhone and iPad. It lets you control Siri on the Apple TV from your iPhone, but the goal is having one Siri that you can activate in an instant versus a secondary Siri located within an app. Another example of something that Siri could someday pull off is asking Siri to play a specific song on Apple Music on multiple Apple TVs. In general, Siri on Apple TV has opportunities to come to feature parity with Siri on other devices before next level features are considered. AR Apple CEO Tim Cook loves, loves, loves AR. He called the idea of augmented reality something he considers ‘as a big idea like the smartphone’ recently, and he talks about the promise of AR any chance he gets. iPhone 8 AR concept One thing that isn’t clear yet is what Apple has planned for AR features within its ecosystem. The iPhone is the obvious platform for AR features with its portable display and sensors including multiple cameras. At least one unverified report has claimed Apple plans to use AirPlay between the iPhone and Apple TV to create an augmented reality experience as well. Smart Dark Mode tvOS 10 introduced something we all really want on iOS: dark mode. The old Apple TV software always used a dark theme, and tvOS 9 was introduced with vibrant theme that made it pop in comparison. Apple heard our requests for the return of a dark theme, however, and added a toggle in Settings that can also be controlled with Siri. With tvOS 11, we would love to see the ability to automatically switch between light mode and dark mode based on either time of day or sunset/sunrise. Light mode during the day, dark mode during the night. Apple TV can already detect local sunrise and sunset times as a trigger for HomeKit automation so the box knows when the specific event occurs locally. If you want to go a step further, tvOS 11 could introduce Night Shift like we see on the Mac, iPhone, and iPad, although color shifting on third-party displays over video content might not be a great idea in practice. Home App & Video When I wrote about tvOS 10 wish list items a year ago, my modest list included something that Apple delivered: HomeKit support for smart accessory control and automation. It makes perfect sense to tell Siri on the Apple TV to set your Movie Scene which dims the lights before you watch a film in the living room. This year I hope Apple goes a step further and introduces a Home app for Apple TV with tvOS 11. The Home app with iOS 10 is very useful on the iPhone and iPad, and you can already interact with HomeKit through Siri. Creating a Home app on Apple TV could create a dashboard that guests can easily access and control. HomeKit also gained the ability to work with video cameras last year, and video is ideal for Apple TV. You can already use the Apple TV to watch live video feeds from non-HomeKit cameras like Canary, but if there’s a way to view my HomeKit video camera feed on my Apple TV, I haven’t discovered it. Apple News & Video Speaking of video (and something we don’t expect to happen but would appreciate), Apple News could be a useful app on Apple TV and tvOS. Apple News is already popular with readers on iPhone and iPad (and we hear from a lot of readers who say they want a Mac version). Apple News on Apple TV could focus solely on video similar to how Twitter and Facebook have approached their own tvOS apps. You could even have a Watch It Later feature on the iOS app that lets you make a queue of videos to watch on your Apple TV through Apple News. Apple’s News team could also curate video content for Apple TV and feature a video tab in the Apple News app for iOS. More Other major changes to tvOS could come with new hardware to include more sensors like always-on mics, built-in or add-on cameras, and more. Apple TV already works with dedicated gaming controllers, but consoles also support other add-ons that Apple TV could follow. Apple TV’s Remote app has improved greatly over the past year with new features and an iPad version, but there are two more opportunities that I see as possible in the near future. First is Control Center access from iPhone and iPad. I keep the Apple TV Remote app on my first Home screen since I use it frequently, but I would really love Control Center access as a dedicated tile or an app shortcut next to or in place of Timer and Calculator. Second is the Remote app for Apple Watch. It works as a basic navigation controller, but it hasn’t adopted the features of the new Apple TV since it was first introduced and hasn’t changed. Siri and Dictation support would also go a long way. These are changes that could be included in iOS 11 and watchOS 4 but benefit tvOS 11 and Apple TV.

Video Mobile connectivity issues plague many enterprises When it comes to iPhone 8 (or iPhone X) scuttlebutt, there are rumors, and then there are leaks. This has been a big week for leaks... LEAKY IPHONE 8 Renders, schematics or whatever you want to call them were circulating wildly among Apple rumor mongerers and watchers this week. Appropriately enough, one such schematic surfaced on a site called /Leaks, and shows an iPhone with a vertical dual-camera set-up and a home button on the back, and a very comprehensive display on the front. MacRumors cautions that it's very hard to say how legit the schematic is, and that if it is for real, it could well be any of numerous prototypes that Apple engineers have tested. Apple Insider, meanwhile, insists: "No, Apple won't move the home button and Touch ID to the back of the 'iPhone 8'." Another leak, from the increasingly busy iDrop News, cites a Foxconn employee as the source. A front-facing Touch ID and a camera underneath the display, wireless charging and contoured glass on the front and back bordered by a metal edge are among the changes revealed here. Variations on most of this have been getting kicked around for weeks, but the more we hear this stuff the closer we get to a likely fall phone debut, the more real they start to become. APPLE GETS CHIPPY Neither of these chip-related rumors will actually impact the iPhone 8, but could have big consequences for iPhones beyond the 10th anniversary model. A financial analyst out of Germany got headlines flying after issuing a research note in which it cut its rating on Dialog Semiconductor from hold to sell because of word from unnamed sources that Apple is working on technology that could replace all or part of the Dialog power management chips in its smartphones. If true, this could be a huge blow to Dialog, which counts heavily on Apple for its revenue. The report, via Reuters, detailed that Apple has power management design centers in the works in Munich and California. The hope would be that Apple might have designs on ways to really boost iPhone battery life, which continues to be a product weakness, plus safeguard iPhones from potential shortcomings that could lead to Note-worthy news (See: Samsung Galaxy Note Phenomenal Phablet Flame-out). This report comes on the heels of news that Apple will build its own GPUs instead of using those from Imagination Technologies to power the increasingly dynamic graphics on its device screens. What's more, Apple is also said to be targeting a stake in Toshiba's memory chip business, which could also have ramifications for the innards of future iPhones. With Toshiba being the primary memory provider for iPhones, you'd think Apple grabbing a stake in the company might even help Apple lower the cost of making iPhones and pass those savings along to... Strike that. GETTING SNL OFF ITS BACK One outfit that might wind up cutting Apple lots of slack on its iPhone 8, regardless of how great or not it turns out to be, is SNL. It turns out the comedy show, which has skewered Apple on occasion in the past, is reported going to be creating some commercial content for Apple.   Variety reports that NBCUniversal is partnering with Apple to create commercials — not of the spoof variety — to be shown during ad breaks of the live show. One goal is to get more people to watch the show live, rather than in snippets in the following days, though not quite sure how new Apple commercials are going to get that done.

While at first I rarely ran my fingers across the 13-inch USB-C MacBook Pro’s secondary screen, I’ve found myself using it more frequently over the last few months, though I admittedly only reach for the Touch Bar with specific apps where its functionality feels seamless. This is because of one main reason: app support for the Touch Bar has improved significantly over roughly the last five months. The inherent concept of the Touch Bar remains a worthwhile endeavour for Apple. On a basic level, the Touch Bar is a display that constantly shifts and changes in the same way the screen of a smartphone or tablet does. It shifts in a dynamic manner, changing to suit whatever app is currently being used. In the context of a desktop environment, this gives users quick access to often-utilized functionality, coupled with the ability to constantly shift inputs, unlike the function keys featured in older MacBooks and other laptops. Unfortunately at launch, Apple’s Touch Bar was more of a hindrance than a sleek new addition to the company’s pricey Pro laptop line, a point most critics who reviewed the long-awaited laptop placed emphasis on. While some of the Touch Bar’s issues still remain when it comes to stability, with its screen crashing and locking up on rare occasions, it is slowly but steadily becoming more useful — though it’s still far from the necessary feature Apple likely envisions it becoming. So lets take a look at what has changed with the Touch Bar since the initial launch of Apple’s 13-inch and 15-inch USB-C MacBook Pro. One of my major gripes about the Touch Bar when it was initially announced related to its lack of Spotify integration. Roughly a month ago, however, Spotify finally added Touch Bar support to its Mac app, giving users quick access to skipping songs, as well as a time stamp scroll bar similar to Quick Time’s integration. Prior to the app’s release, changing songs was a chore via Spotify and required users to expand the standard tool bar each time they wanted to change a song, even with the app open. While that’s still the case when using an app that isn’t Spotify, in-app integration is a welcome and much-needed addition. Evernote has also entered the Touch Bar fray and though I’ve slowly stopped using the platform in favour of Google Keep, the app’s new integration is one of the most recent and arguably best examples of how developers can use the Touch Bar properly. With Evernote, the Touch Bar allows you to start a search, begin a new note and access tags, all simple actions that make sense in the context of a simple tap. The bar also turns into a slider when selecting colours (which could be confusing for some). The platform says the goal of its recently launched Touch Bar integration is to ensure the controls fall somewhere between traditional touchscreen controls you may expect on a smartphone, and keyboard shortcuts. The above examples are two relatively niche apps finally adding Touch Bar functionality, but there are other more substantial instances out there as well, including Microsoft updating its entire Office suite with support back in February. While much of the integration isn’t particularly useful, I’m fond of Office’s new Focus Mode that removes the standard navigation ribbon and drops it on the Touch Bar, resulting in less on-screen distractions while writing. Other simple shortcuts like text format changes and font styles, are included in the Touch Bar functionality. While Apple-developed apps like Final Cut and Logic should have launched with Touch Bar integration, Apple is only rolling out the functionality now. Touch Bar integration is mostly limited to shortcuts and basic volume controls, but in the crowded UI — especially if you’re using just one screen — the Touch Bar gives users quick access to controls that are typically buried, or at the very least cumbersome to find with multiple windows open. Apple’s iMovie and GarageBand also have similar, quick-access Touch Bar shortcuts available. While somewhat unrelated, the ability to record in both Logic and the mobile version of GarageBand and share content between both apps via iCloud, is also extremely useful. Other apps like Toronto-developed 1Password, Adobe’s entire Creative Cloud suite, Pixelmator and Sketch, have also added Touch Bar functionality. Some holdouts still remain unfortunately, with Google’s Chrome browser being unsurprisingly one of the many major apps that have yet to integrate Touch Bar functionality, though rumours indicate it could be coming soon. Apple doesn’t admit mistakes — unless you count the company’s uncharacteristic recent press briefing about the Mac Pro — and I don’t see the company admitting the Touch Bar was a side step anytime soon, though it certainly hasn’t lived up to the company’s lofty claims. As more app support arrives, Apple’s Touch Bar is set to continue becoming increasingly useful, though it’s unlikely it will ever become as integral to most user’s day-to-day activities as a traditional keyboard. Still, I commend Apple for trying something different in the typically stagnant laptop industry. If you temper your expectations, there’s actually lot to like about the Touch Bar now.

REUTERS/Charles Platiau By Reuters Apr 14, 2017 at 5:29 pm | Print View Apple Inc. has secured a permit to test autonomous vehicles in California, which allows it to conduct test drives in three vehicles with six drivers, the state Department of Motor Vehicles said on Friday. Although it has never openly acknowledged it is looking into building an electric car, Apple has recruited dozens of auto experts. The vehicles are all 2015 Lexus RX450h, according to the DMV. “This does confirm what’s long been rumored, that Apple is at least toying with the idea of getting into the autonomous game in some capacity,” said Chris Theodore, President of consultancy Theodore and Associates and a former vice president at Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler. The permit does not necessarily mean Apple is building a car. “This is not necessarily automobiles as initially rumored, but software or possibly hardware associated with autonomous technology,” Theodore said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment directly on the filing, pointing back to a statement when the company submitted its comments to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration late last year. After a five-page letter last November from Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, to NHTSA, the company was under increased speculation that they would enter into the competitive self-driving space. “The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” Kenner wrote.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « What's the Game Plan for the Ever Aggressive Foxconn? | Main April 16, 2017 A Major Warner Bros. Patent Reveals a Coming AR/VR Movie Delivery System for Theaters, Home systems & Headsets Years ago the big film studios began introducing 3D experiences for movies goers and handed out 3D glasses as you entered the theater. This week Patently Apple discovered a patent filing from Warner Bros. Entertainment describing new systems that are in development that will bring movie goers Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and mixed reality films. And yes, users will be handed 3D/AR/VR headsets to watch these next-generation movies. The difference with these films will be that they're being designed to work in the theater and at home with iTunes or Netflix. So next-gen headsets are going to be needed to be able to watch this kind of content. Warner Bros. patent notes that these movies will work on headset powered either by Intel or ARM processors.   The patent filing lists HoloLens and other types of headgear already in the market that will be compatible with this future system – but this is likely where Apple will step in with an ARM system. There's no way that Apple is going to miss out on this next-wave of movies from Warner Bros. and other studios.   So even though Apple isn't mentioned in the patent by name, it's clear that this form of entertainment is going to provide some of the needed content to make new headsets popular with consumers.   Likewise, the system may work with live streaming of film and entertainment and this is where 5G networks will come into play. The new 5G networks begin rolling out sometime in late 2018. I doubt that Apple will want to late to the party and so this is something we can expect in the not-too-distant-future. This isn't going to be a project for a decade from now, but more like two or three years down the road at the latest.   After reading the Warner Bros. patent, it's clear as day that AR and VR enriched movies will play an important role in exciting the market to join this next wave of devices supporting AR and VR movies, games and live experiences.   Patent Background   "Virtual reality" is a term that has been used for various types of content that simulates immersion in a three-dimensional (3D) world, including, for example, various video game content, and animated film content. In some types of virtual reality, a user can navigate through a simulation of a 3D environment generated based on the computer model, by controlling the position and orientation of a virtual camera that defines a viewpoint for a 2D scene that is displayed on a two-dimensional display screen. A variation of these technologies is sometimes called "augmented reality." In an augmented reality setup, the display technology shows a combination of the user's surroundings that is "augmented" by one or more digital objects or overlays. Augmented reality content may be as simple as textual "heads up" information about objects or people visible around the user, or as complex as transforming the entire appearance of the user's surroundings into a fantasy environment that corresponds to the user's real surroundings.   Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have been applied to various types of immersive video stereoscopic presentation techniques including, for example, stereoscopic virtual reality headsets. Headsets and other presentation methods immerse the user in a 3D scene. Lenses in the headset enable the user to focus on a lightweight split display screen mounted in the headset only inches from the user's eyes. Different sides of the split display show right and left stereoscopic views of video content, while the user's peripheral view is blocked. In another type of headset, two separate displays are used to show different images to the user's left eye and right eye respectively. In another type of headset, the field of view of the display encompasses the full field of view of eye including the peripheral view. In another type of headset, an image is projected on the user's retina using controllable small lasers, mirrors or lenses. Either way, the headset enables the user to experience the displayed virtual reality content more as if the viewer were immersed in a real scene. In the case of augmented reality (AR) content, the viewer may experience the augmented content as if it were a part of, or placed in, an augmented real scene.   These immersive effects may be provided or enhanced by motion sensors in the headset that detect motion of the user's head, and adjust the video display(s) accordingly. By turning his head to the side, the user can see the virtual reality scene off to the side; by turning his head up or down, the user can look up or down in the virtual reality scene. The headset may also include tracking sensors that detect position of the user's head and/or body, and adjust the video display(s) accordingly. By leaning or turning, the user can see the virtual reality scene from a different point of view. This responsiveness to head movement, head position and body position greatly enhances the immersive effect achievable by the headset. The user may be provided the impression of being placed inside or "immersed" in the virtual reality scene. As used herein, "immersive" generally encompasses both VR and AR.   Immersive headsets and other wearable immersive output devices are especially useful for game play of various types, which involve user exploration of a modelled environment generated by a rendering engine as the user controls one or more virtual camera(s) using head movement, the position or orientation of the user's body, head, eye, hands, fingers, feet, or other body parts, and/or other inputs.   To provide an immersive experience, the user needs to perceive a freedom of movement that is in some way analogous to human visual perception when interacting with reality. Content produced for VR can provide this experience using techniques for real-time rendering that have been developed for various types of video games. The content may be designed as a three-dimensional computer model with defined boundaries and rules for rendering as video output. This content can be enhanced by stereoscopic techniques to provide stereoscopic output, sometime referred to as "3D," and associated with a VR application that manages the rendering process in response to movement of the VR headset, to produce a resulting VR experience. The user experience is very much like being placed inside a rendered video game.   In other types of VR and AR, the simulated 3D environment may be used primarily to tell a story, more like traditional theater or cinema. In this type of VR or AR, the added visual effects may enhance the depth and richness of the story's narrative elements or special effects, without giving the user full control (or any control) over the narrative itself.   However, the technology for experiencing anything similar to cinematic content delivered using VR or AR equipment or methods is in a very early stage of development. Actual implementations of technology are quite limited, and users have thus far been largely or completely untouched by VR or AR in their experience of narrative content.   It would be desirable, therefore, to develop new methods and other new technologies for mastering cinematic content for VR and AR use, that overcome these and other limitations of the prior art and enhance the appeal and enjoyment of narrative content for new immersive technologies such as VR and AR.   Warner Bros. Entertainment Solution   The invention by Warner Bros. Entertainment relates to the production, configuration, and providing, by a computer, of digital data for virtual reality or augmented reality output.   In one aspect of the invention, a computer-implemented method includes communicating, by a cinematic data distribution server over a wireless network, with multiple immersive output devices each configured for providing one of an augmented reality (AR) output or a virtual reality (VR) output based on a data signal, wherein each of the multiple immersive output devices is present within eyesight of a display screen.   For example, the multiple immersive output devices may be worn by moviegoers or home theater users. The method may include configuring the data signal based on digital cinematic master data that includes at least one of VR data or AR data. The method may include transmitting the data signal to the multiple immersive output devices contemporaneously, such that each of the users receives and processes the data and shares a contemporaneous immersive video experience.   In another aspect, the method may include outputting an image based on a video data portion of the digital cinematic master data on the display screen, contemporaneously with the transmitting. The users may thereby enjoy an AR experience in addition to the video on the screen, or if using fully VR equipment that obscures the screen, may enjoy a cinematic presentation that both supplements and duplicates the presentation on the screen.   For serving AR immersive output devices, configuring the data signal may include encoding the AR data for augmenting video data for output on the display screen, and including the AR data with the video data in the data signal.   The AR data may be configured to provide various effects. In an aspect, the AR data, when received by the multiple immersive output devices, continuously extends images on the display screen to areas beyond an outer limit of the display screen, for each person viewing AR output on one of the multiple immersive output devices.   For example, a person wearing an AR immersive output device may see elements of the scene that extend upwards, downwards, or sideways beyond the frame.   In another, alternative aspect, the AR data, when received by the multiple immersive output devices causes images that do not appear on the display screen to appear in a non-screen display volume to each person viewing AR output on one of the multiple immersive output devices.   For example, the non-screen object may be caused to appear in front of, above, or below the display screen, or even behind the viewer. These effects may similarly be provided by configuring VR data for a VR output device.   The data signal may be configured to provide each user with an "objective" experience, a "subjective" experience, or a mixture of objective and subjective experiences.   To provide a subjective experience, the cinematic data distribution server configures the data signal such that the images that do not appear on the display screen (i.e., the images that are visible only using an AR or VR output device) appear in a coordinate system defined relative to the each person viewing AR or VR output on one of the multiple immersive output devices.   To provide an objective experience, the cinematic data distribution server configures the data signal such that the images that do not appear on the display screen appear in the same coordinate system defined relative to the display screen, or in other words, a coordinate system that is relative to the cinema or home theater and the same for all immersive output devices.   To provide a mixed experience the cinematic data distribution server configures the data signal such that at least one visible object is defined individually relative to each person's subjective coordinate system, while at least one other object is defined in the common coordinate system and is the same for all viewers.   In another aspect, a user may be able to interact with objects depicted in AR or VR output. Accordingly, the method may include providing in the AR data or VR data code enabling each person viewing AR output on one of the multiple immersive output devices to interact with at least one of the images, causing the AR output or VR output to change.   In a related aspect, the method may include changing video output shown on the display screen based on the each person's interaction with at least one of the images. For example, different versions of a scene may be provided in stored cinematic data, and the version selected at runtime may be selected based on an aggregate of feedback from the different users.     Warner Bros. Entertainment patent FIG. 4 above illustrates a concept diagram illustrating elements of a system for outputting immersive content to multiple users in a cinema or home theater setting; FIG. 6 is a schematic diagram illustrating components of a stereoscopic display device for providing an immersive VR experience.   Patent FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating components of, and concepts concerning, a cinema or home theater space for multi-user VR or AR; FIG. 8A is a flow chart illustrating elements of serving VR or AR data to an AR or VR output device providing a cinema experience.   In another area of the patent filing, Warner Bros. explains that several viewers of a home theater or cinema presentation may be equipped with the content consumption devices. The apparatus may include, for example, a processor based on Intel's architecture a system-on-a-chip designed by ARM, or any other suitable microprocessor.   The processor may be communicatively coupled to auxiliary devices or modules of the 3D environment apparatus using a bus or other coupling. Optionally, the processor and some or all of its coupled auxiliary devices or modules may be housed within or coupled to a housing having a form factor of a personal computer, gaming console, smartphone, tablet, laptop computer, set-top box, wearable googles, glasses, or visors, or other form factors.   A user interface device may be coupled to the processor for providing user control input to an immersive content display process operated by a VR or AR immersive display engine executing on the processor.   User control input may include, for example, selections from a graphical user interface or other input (e.g., textual or directional commands) generated via a touch screen, keyboard, pointing device (e.g., game controller), microphone, motion sensor, camera, or some combination of these or other input devices.   Control input may also be provided via a sensor coupled to the processor. A sensor may comprise, for example, a motion sensor (e.g., an accelerometer), a position sensor, a temperature sensor, a location sensor (for example, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and controller), an eye-tracking sensor, or a microphone. The sensor may detect a motion or other state of a user interface display, for example, motion of a virtual-reality headset, or the bodily state of the user, for example, skin temperature or pulse.   The device may optionally include an input/output port coupled to the processor 202, to enable communication between a VR/AR engine and a computer network, for example a cinema content server or home theater server.   Such communication may be used, for example, to enable multiplayer VR or AR experiences, including but not limited to shared immersive experiencing of cinematic content. The system may also be used for non-cinematic multi-user applications, for example social networking, group entertainment experiences, instructional environments, video gaming, and so forth.   While many forms of devices are covered, they note specifically "In a fourth type of device, a laser projector or projector mounted to the user's head and directed to the user's eyes projects images directly on the user's eyes, making the retinas the only screen on which the augmented content is displayed.   Examples of devices for immersive and non-immersive AR output include Microsoft's HoloLens; Google Glass by Google; Digital Lightfield by Magic Leap; Space Glasses by Meta Company; and castAR glasses by of castAR.   Patent FIG. 1 noted above is a schematic block diagram illustrating aspects of a system and apparatus for the production and configuration of digital data for virtual reality or augmented reality output coupled to a distribution system; FIG. 13 is one of many flowcharts associated with the AR/VR System for Cinemas and Home Theaters.   Warner Bros. Entertainment's patent application was filed back in Q4 2016 and published this week by the U.S. Patent Office..

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software iOS Has Dropped To Its Lowest Market Share In Three Years In China By Ali Salman Apr 13, 2017 30Shares Share Tweet Submit According to the latest data collected by Kantar’s Worldpanel, Apple’s iOS has dropped to its lowest smartphone market share in China since July 2014. In today’s report, the smartphone shares around the world are detailed for the three months ending February 2017. Let’s dive in to see some more details on the statistics. iOS Smartphone Market Share Dropped To Its Lowest In Three Years Compared to the same time last year, devices running the company’s iOS has dropped 8.9 percent, a decrease from 22.1 percent of the market in China. After the drop, Apple’s iOS rests on 13.2 percent, while Android tops the chart with 86.4 percent of the total smartphone market share in the region, Android’s year-over-year score grew by 9.3 percent. Related Here’s An Easy Way To Peek At The Status Bar In Fullscreen Apps On iOS 10 While the aforementioned stats are said and done, Apple’s iPhone 7 and its bigger ‘Plus’ variant still remains the top selling devices in China. With that said, the Cupertino giant does face a hard time competing against China’s local vendors like Vivo and Oppo. This is due to the fact that local vendors manufacture cheaper alternatives which are easier for users in China to get their hands on. Advertisement “In the three-month period ending February 2017, iOS accounted for 13.2% of smartphone sales in urban China, a decline of 8.9 percentage points from 22.1% a year earlier. This marks iOS’ lowest share since the three-month period ending July 2014,” reported Tamsin Timpson, Strategic Insight Director at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech Asia. “That said, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus remained the top selling devices in the region, accounting for 8% of smartphone sales. By comparison, iPhone 6s and 6s Plus accounted for 14% of smartphone sales in the three months ending February 2016.” Compared to the Chinese smartphone market share, iOS continues to grow in the United States while Android’s market share continues to move in downward trajectory. iOS increased by 3.7 percent to 42 percent while Android decreased by -3 percent to 55.9 percent. Apart from the United States, iOS also saw an increase in the rate of its adoption in France, Germany and the Great Britain by 4 percent, 4.1 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively. The next quarter might be the most crucial point for both iOS and Android. This is due to the reason that Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and the LG G6 will mold the results in favor of Android. However, the iPhone 7 (PRODUCT)RED might help the company retain its market share to some extent. This is it for now, folks. What are your thoughts on iOS dropping smartphone market share in China?

According to a unverified report from The Verifier published today, the Apple TV is set for a significant update with the addition of Picture-in-Picture and multi-user modes … The best, strongest, Lightning cables ... buy braided cables here As shown in the mockups provided by the site, tvOS 11 will add a way to handle multiple Apple IDs for the different people in the house. When selecting one of these profiles, users will see only see their songs and playlists in the Music app, view their personal iCloud Photo Library in Photos, change the app home screen to display their apps and layout, and more. In the report, The Verifier says that changing account is said to be as simple as changing a TV channel. Up to now, iOS devices are generally based on a single user account metaphor. Apple added Shared iPad features for education with iOS 9.3 last year. This isn’t mentioned in the report explicitly but if the Apple TV is adding multiple account support, it would make sense for iOS 11 to include this as well. The site also claims that Apple will bring a version of Picture-in-Picture to the Apple TV. This will work similar to Picture-in-Picture on iOS 9. The user will be able to start watching a video in an app, then watch that video in a smaller window docked to the sides of the screen whilst browsing the rest of the Apple TV. This means tvOS 11 would enable Apple TV users to watch Netflix whilst checking the weather in another app or playing a game. However, it would not be possible to watch two videos side-by-side. If a PIP window is active, playing another video would pause/stop the PIP stream. This mirrors the behavior of iOS where only one video can be playing at a time. The report ends with a brief claim that Apple continues to explore a TV subscription service, with plans to integrate a live EPG into the Apple TV UI. The Verifier has risen to prominence in the Apple rumor community this year with a string of reports about the company’s plans. It has said that iOS 11 will enhance FaceTime with group video calling capabilities and that iOS 11 will integrate Siri with iMessage. It has also made a very dubious claim that the iPhone 8 will include a Smart Connector. However, The Verifier’s reliability record is still very much in doubt as none of these reports have been proven correct … yet. We’ll see what Apple actually does with tvOS 11, iOS 11, macOS 10.13 and watchOS 4 at WWDC 2017, which kicks off on June 5th.

(GuruFocus) Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) shares were up 0.7 percent on Thursday following a new report from RBC Capital discussing all the reasons why an Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) buyout of Disney would make sense. While Disney investors would certainly love a buyout at a premium to market price, investors should make sure not to overlook the caveats RBC provided in its note as well. Analyst Amit Daryanani is far from convinced a deal will happen. “We see a confluence of events that make an acquisition of DIS a ‘greater than 0 percent’ probability event (while odds are low),” Daryanani said. 5 Arguments Against The Buy In addition to his arguments in favor of a merger, he also included a list of five things naysayers could point to as evidence that Apple will never buy Disney: Apple’s largest past buyout has been Beats Inc at only $2.2 billion. Disney’s market cap is currently $180 billion. A Disney buyout would be a departure from Apple’s recent business strategy. A Disney buyout would conflict with Apple’s long-term goal of being a one-stop shop for all digital media content (not just Disney’s). There would be integration risk. A Disney buyout might signal to investors that the iPhone business is reaching its maturity. Rumors of potential mega-mergers make for fun, attention-grabbing headlines. But while these types of deals certainly occur from time to time, traders should keep their expectations in check and understand that a Disney buyout is a long-shot at best.

He said the dedicated showroom is the first of its kind in the Middle East and more showrooms would be opened in the future.  The Intertec official said the people's perception of smartphones are changing now.  "Gone are the days when the iPhone was a status symbol. Now the iPhone is being used by all sections of the society. On the contrary, Huwaei has its own technology which is very appealing to all."

Another report recently said that Huawei's global sales were up 26.7 percent in 2016, while Samsung and Apple experienced sales declines of 4.3 percent. On the other hand, sales growth pushed Huawei's smartphone market share to 8.9 percent, up from the previous period's 7.3 percent. Samsung's full-year market share fell to 20.5 percent while Apple's influence dropped from 15.9 percent to 14.4 percent. In November 2016, Huawei set itself a goal to overtake Apple in two years.  Despite the substantial gap between Huawei, Apple and Samsung, the Chinese vendor is now largely considered to be the main competitor of the two giants. Huawei's expansion into premium smartphones has seen it shrink the gap between it and Samsung during Q4 2016, a difference of 36 million units. In the same period last year, the gap between the two vendors was more than 50 million units.

He said the mutual relationship with its stakeholders would give them many opportunities to develop business and realise their goals.  "We see a world of growth and expansion in the years ahead of us.''  To celebrate Huawei's first-ever exclusive showroom in the Middle East, Intertec Group announced special inaugural prices on all purchases from the showroom. Meanwhile, Huawei Consumer Business Group and Intertec Group unveiled four new digital gadgets including Huawei P10 and P10 Plus cell phones. The two new additions to the P Series, co-engineered with Leica, come in striking colours. Both have built-in Leica front and back cameras with portrait features to make every shot a cover shot.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile The Voice Behind First Siri on iOS 5 Spills Beans About Her Experience and What it Took to be the Voice of Siri By Zara Ali Apr 14, 2017 22Shares Share Tweet Submit Siri premiered on Apple with the iPhone 4s in 2011 and at that time, iOS was at version 5. The voice behind Siri on iOS 5 was the voice actress Susan Bennett. In an interview with Typeform, Bennett spilled a few beans about her experience being the original voice behind the popular Siri voice assistant. The interview features audio of Bennett’s voice, which will sound familiar to listeners. Bennett delved into sharing her first moments when she took up a new project in 2005 for a text-to-speech company – ScanSoft. She was told that the project was for a phone messaging program, but it later turned out to be the development ground for Siri. The first iPhone (4s) with Siri debuted two years after the project started. Related Spotify Is Partnering With A Third-Party Developer To Bring The Official Apple Watch App Bennett’s contribution to Siri was not a cakewalk. She was asked to recite “nonsense phrases”. Even the male voice actor behind Siri, Daniel, also revealed a similar training process that he went through for recording his voice for Siri. ScanSoft ultimately announced a merger with Nuance, which is the guiding force behind Siri’s voice and speech capabilities. The entire project was kept under wraps, so even Susan and Daniel had no idea about Siri. Talking about “nonsense phrases”, Bennett revealed a few tongue twisting lines: Malitia oi hallucinate, buckry ockra ooze, Cathexis fefatelly sexual ease stump, Say the shrodding again, say the shroding again, say the shreeding again, say the shriding again, say the shrading again, say the shrudding again. The partnership between ScanSoft and Bennett did not last for long. Bennett was hired on an hourly wage, and she was later offered a five-year contract, but she refused it due to lack of creativity in the project. Well, we can’t blame Bennett, parroting lines leaves no window for creativity at all. As she described the project as “the complete opposite of creative”. Advertisement It was only after Siri’s release when Bennett realized that every phrase that she said, geared Apple with “all of the sounds of the English language.” These phrases allowed Apple to “reform them into new phrases and sentences,” as stated by Bennett. Not just her work at ScanSoft, Bennett also revealed the mystery behind Siri’s name. She explained that former Apple employee, Dag Kittlaus, who was a co-creator of Siri, planned to name his daughter Siri but he got blessed with a son instead. Kittlaus then decided to use the baby girl name for his creation – Siri. Related Apple Music for Android Gets iOS 10 Inspired Makeover, Here’s What Has Changed Opening up about Siri’s name origin, Bennett says: In Norwegian, the word Siri means “beautiful woman who guides you to victory.” Of course, we know better, she’s the feisty chick who tells you where to go, right. But, Dag and his wife were expecting a child, they thought it was going to be a girl, and they planned to name her Siri. But when the baby arrived it was a boy. So they gave the name to the app instead. And that’s where Siri got her name. Surprisingly, Bennett found out that she was the voice behind Siri on the iPhone 4s, after two years. She initially found the discovery to be “a little creepy”. Bennett kept quiet for two years and then she made the big revelation at a CNN interview in 2013. In the same year, Apple removed Bennet’s voice from Siri and replaced her with someone else for the revamped of iOS 7 update. Reflecting back on old times, Bennett admitted that everything eventually turned out to be perfect for her. Association with Siri opened up a new world of opportunities for her. Bennett introduced Steve Wozniak at the 2013 Dallas Digital Summit, and she also presented a TED Talk in 2016. To read the full interview of Susan Bennett on Typeform – click here.

A mobile store on ​Dien Bien Phu Street, ​Hanoi, removed the “half-eaten apple” logo on its banner. A manager of a mobile store on Thai Ha Street, Hanoi told Viet Nam News that even though signs with the logo were attractive, they would change and remove the logo as it belonged to Apple and was protected. A store owner on Xa Dan Street also said that his store respected the rights of Apple. “Even though the logo makes it easy for buyers to recognise that our store is selling Apple products, we will repair our shop banners soon because it is the trademark of Apple.” However, he said that there would be other ways to make buyers realise the store sold Apple products such as writing “iPhone” or “iPad” in Vietnamese like “ai phon”, “ai pat” or using photos. Apple Inc’s legal representative in Vietnam, VOTRA Co Ltd, recently sent documents to Vietnamese phone stores on their illegal use of the brand’s trademark without Apple’s permission. The Apple legal representatives mentioned stores using the “half-eaten apple” logo, trademarks “Apple”, “iPhone” or other names such as “Apple Store”, “App Store”, “iPad”, “iPod” and “MacBook”, which are protected in Vietnam. The Vietnamese representative of the US technology company requested the stores stop using Apple’s trademark within seven days of receiving the letter. VOTRA also asked the stores to stop selling fake products under the Apple brand name. Apple has increased its presence in Vietnam since the end of 2015 when it opened an office in HCM City. In 2016, Apple hired VOTRA as its legal representative. Nguyen Ngoc Duy My from attorney office TriLaw in HCM City told news website ndh.vn that under Article 123 of Vietnam’s Law on Intellectual Property 2005, trademark owners had the right to use, allow or prevent others from using their trademark. "Because of these rights, if Apple does not give written permission to allow others (in this case Vietnamese stores) to use its trademark, these stores do not have the right to use them,” said My. My also noted that just because a store sold Apple products did not mean they could use Apple’s trademark without written consent. In term of fines, the lawyer said shops could be fined from 500,000 VND (22 USD) to 250 million VND (11,000 USD) depending on the level of their violation, business scale and commodity value. Violators could also receive other punishments such as business suspension from one to three months, material confiscation, or be forced to destroy the infringing goods, she added.  VNA Apple bites into illegal shops in Vietnam, IT news, sci-tech news, vietnamnet bridge, english news, Vietnam news, news Vietnam, vietnamnet news, Vietnam net news, Vietnam latest news, Vietnam breaking news, vn news   Name: * Email from: * Email to: * Messages:     Send      Read on Vietnam, Czech firms sign MoU on cyber security cooperation Motorbike mechanic manufactures machines Going hand in glove with sign language Transmission & broadcasting companies report losses Domain name registrars join domain name market Mobile network operators compete in tight 4G race Da Nang to host 7th International Conference on Information Science and Technology Online hate speeches threaten Vietnamese Internet users Apple takes actions on unauthorised VN shops VNPT to offload stake in two subsidiaries     Top Stories Air pollution from vehicles top concern of city authorities Government paves the way for the development of sport betting businesses Popularity of cash-prize games and horse races surges in VN Vietnam struggles with environmental crimes Vietnamese physicists publish article in int'l research journal for first time Confrontation between Vuivui and Tiki anticipated Overseas remittances fall, worrying real estate developers Retail premises in high demand in 2017 4G race expected to reposition mobile network operators What is the status of Vietnam’s natural disaster warning ability?

The final iteration will arrive later this spring. Apple updates iPhones and iPads for all users, regardless of your cellphone service provider or your model. However, Apple observes a five-year horizon for updates, meaning products older than five years cannot install new updates. This is longer than for most Android devices, which update for two to three years, depending upon the manufacturer. Google updates its own products, Nexus and Pixel, for only two years. Unless you own a Google branded Nexus or Pixel, you are at the mercy of your cellphone company or hardware manufacturer for updates. Those sometimes arrive six to nine months after Google makes them available. The final version of Apple's iOS 10 not only will be the last to work on many older Apple products, but it will be the last to work with some applications (apps). Unless the app creator upgrades the app to work with iOS 11 it will cease functioning. This is the final transition from a 32-bit to full 64-bit operating system. For example, Expedia, the parent of Mobiata, the creator of the very popular app FlightBoard, ceased support of the product a couple of months ago. Besides financial considerations, it wasn't worth the effort to transform it for the new operating system. Those of you eligible for iOS 11, when it arrives late this year, should verify that your most precious apps will work with it. Update to the newest operating system, because beyond usually modest performance enhancements, the update contains important "bug fixes" and security improvements. With Apple updates, wait a week before installing, because often, Apple updates initially contain flaws that could adversely affect your product. Android issues fewer operating system updates, although like Apple, an initial release may contain bugs that need correction. Android 7.01 "Nougat" shortly superseded Nougat 7.0. While we're on the subject of Apples and Androids, Apple AirPlay and Android Auto are not created equal. Recently we heaped accolades upon Android Auto. A reader failed to feel the same love from/for Apple CarPlay. "No such joy with Apple CarPlay. For your awareness, my 2016 Honda Accord has Apple CarPlay, and I cannot stream Google Maps from iPhone 6 via Apple CarPlay. With my iPhone 6, CarPlay does not facilitate using Google Maps either in voice only mode or in voice plus display mode. From my online research, I believe this is due to Apple restrictions on all Apple CarPlay systems and not just the Apple CarPlay in my 2016 Accord and/or my iPhone 6. CarPlay is indeed a nice feature in my Accord though, as it facilitates media center touch screen control of music streaming services like Pandora, Spotify, etc. It just doesn't facilitate Google Maps. Good news, however, I am able to get my iPhone 6 to feed audio of Google Maps directions to my Accord info center via Bluetooth. After pairing my iPhone to the media center Bluetooth, I can listen to other iPhone Bluetooth-streamed music on the car speakers such as Pandora, and when the Google Maps voice direction occurs, the current music is muted and one hears the Google Maps voice direction, then the current music unmutes and continues uninterrupted after the Google Maps voice direction ends. All control of Google Maps directions, etc. stays with the iPhone." Generally, CarPlay and Android Auto require a hardwired connection for full functionality. Bluetooth wirelessly provides some features, but usually not all. Also using the car's USB connection charges the phone's battery. While Apple and Android each provide a standard template, every phone and automobile may implement it slightly differently. Check the instructions for your phone and your car to make the most of tethering your phone to your car. Rich Warren, who lives in the Champaign area, is a longtime reviewer of consumer electronics.

But the new Product Red editions of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and the updated iPhone SE, are just the appetizer. The main course will be a dramatically redesigned iPhone -- coming later this year, according to the rumors. When will we see the iPhone 8 -- or whatever Apple decides to call it? Frankly, the rumors are all over the place. Fall is a good enough guess, given that Apple has scheduled September introductions for every major iPhone since the iPhone 5 in 2012. Popular Searches UBS AG FIHD/IV ▼ 137.90 -1.37 -0.98% Top Glove Corp Bhd TGLVY = 4.72 0.00 0.00% JC Penney Co Inc JCP ▼ 5.91 -0.11 -1.83% Thai Beverage PLC TBVPF = 0.6600 0.0000 0.00% This time, however, things could be different. For the 10th anniversary edition of the iPhone, we're expecting Apple to come out swinging with some real breakthrough innovations. And, according to the most recent rumors, some of these hot new technologies could be making it tough for Apple to deliver the goods by September. More on that below. Bottom line: the iPhones released in March were small potatoes. A much more grandiose introduction is likely to come later this year. As we edge closer to the launch, we'll continue to assemble the most important rumors below. Specs we might see on the iPhone 8 - A variety of possible sizes, including 5.8-inch, 5.5-inch, 5-inch, and 4.7-inch models - Curved, edge-to-edge OLED display with True Tone technology - Home button located on back or integrated into display - The next generation of Touch ID with face or iris scanning - Wireless charging - Dual-lens camera, possibly in a vertical configuration and/or with AR capabilities - Support for the Apple Pencil - USB-C replacing Apple's Lightning connector - Enhanced water resistance - Apple's next-generation processor (the A10X or A11) - Glass and stainless steel body - Upgraded storage starting at 64GB and 3GB of RAM - Priced somewhere between $850 and $1,000 The iPhone... what? For now, we're calling it the iPhone 8, though we don't know officially what the company will call it. As seen most recently with the new iPad -- with the iPad Air 2 succeeded by the iPad -- Apple may take a freewheeling approach to nomenclature. It does seem likely that the company will offer up an iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus -- updated versions of the current models -- as less expensive alternatives to the next generation flagship. For the 10th anniversary model itself, however, anything is possible. The iPhone 8 is the conservative bet but we've seen rumors about an iPhone 10; an iPhone X; and the offbeat iPhone Edition, seemingly inspired by the premium Apple Watch Edition. The iPhone... when? We expect Apple to announce in September, as usual. That noted, there is a steady torrent of reports that Apple is having manufacturing issues with some technologies slated for for the iPhone 8. This is driving a number of alternative theories including a launch in October or November or an announcement in September with deliveries delayed until later in the fall. There's also a credible theory circulating that that Apple could use a September launch event to release the "S" series edition of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, featuring incremental hardware and software upgrades, leaving the iPhone 8 debut for October or November. It's also possible that Apple could introduce a new iPhone at its 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference, scheduled for June 5-9 in San Jose, California. But probably not. A new display After months of debate and conflicting rumors, there is consensus: the next iPhone will have an OLED display. In fact, it's this new display technology -- well, new for Apple, Samsung has been using it for years -- that may be one of the factors involved in a potential September launch delay. In February, the Wall Street Journal predicted that the iPhone 8 would come equipped with a curved OLED screen. More recently, Nikkei Asian Review reported that Apple had placed an order for 70 million "slightly curved" OLED panels from Samsung. And Barclays analysts have predicted that all three forthcoming iPhones -- the 7S, 7S Plus, and iPhone 8 -- will come equipped with Apple's True Tone technology, which adjusts display settings for ambient lighting conditions, and which is currently featured on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. (The next edition of the iPad Pro is also rumored to have a True Tone display.) Home button gone wild The nature and location of the iPhone 8's home button is a hot topic. The latest buzz is that Apple might move it to the back of the phone, as shown in alleged render images leaked on Chinese site Weibo (via /LEAKS).  It's also quite possible that Apple could ditch the home button altogether, following in the footsteps of Samsung with its Galaxy S8, or somehow integrate it into the display. Which brings us to... Touch ID 2.0 MacRumors reports that Apple is attempting to integrate Touch ID into the iPhone 8's new OLED display -- and having big problems. And there are some interesting theories about the company's contingency plans in the event that it can't work it out. These include relying on the phone's expected new facial and/or iris recognition functionality; relocating Tough ID to the back of the phone; or delaying the launch altogether. Meanwhile, DigiTimes reports that Apple has developed its own in-house fingerprint sensor, which may or may not the be technology at the heart of the integration problems. And Apple Insider has surfaced a patent application filed by Apple for "acoustic imaging system architecture" that could ostensibly authenticate users by the acoustic properties of their fingerprints. Sounds cool. Price point This issue remains way up in the air. Sources ranging from Morgan Stanley to Fast Company are talking about an iPhone 8 that will cost more than $1,000. More recently, a UBS analyst theorized that the 64GB entry-level model would start at $850 -- just like the new Samsung Galaxy S8+ -- and that the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus would cost $649 and $749, respectively. Wireless charging Reuters reports that there are multiple groups at Apple working on technology for an iPhone that supports wireless charging. The Verge reports that Apple has been staffing up on wireless-charging experts. The Nikkei Asian Review reports that Foxconn, one of Apple's main manufacturing partners, is making wireless charging modules. Though Apple would likely make this feature available on the premium iPhone 8, MacRumors reports that Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has suggested that all new iPhone models -- that would include the "S" series, presumably -- will get it.  Material shift Apple could replace the traditional aluminum iPhone design with a new glass and steel body, according to a rumor reported by DigiTimes and corroborated by Nikkei Asian Review. Previous rumors about the possibility of a ceramic body have faded out (for now). USB-C vs. Lightning Apple dropped the 3.5mm headphone jack with the iPhone 7. A report published by the Wall Street Journal suggests that the company will exclude its Lightning connector from the iPhone 8 in favor of the emerging port du jour: USB-C. Enhanced waterproofing Apple could walk away from the Lightning port and not add a USB-C connection, of course, which would make the iPhone more resistant to water. On that note, the Korea Herald reports that the next iPhone will have a higher water resistance rating -- IP68 compared with the current generation's IP67, for those keeping score. Augmented reality Multiple analysts have predicted that the iPhone 8 will come equipped with 3D sensors that will enable augmented reality (and enable facial and/or iris recognition, too). Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has supported the 3D sensor theory, adding that Apple will equip with the iPhone 8 with a new front-facing camera system equipped with an infrared transmitter and receiver. More storage Apple may dump its 32GB model and offer a 64GB and 256GB model, according to TrendForce; the report also suggests that the company will boost the amount of RAM to 3GB. This incremental bump would follow the recent precedent of Apple ditching its dreaded entry-level model (formerly 16GB) when it released the iPhone 7. Bringing the GPU in house Apple is developing its own graphics chips to be used in future versions of products including the iPhone. But the timeframe for phasing out its current supplier is 15 to 24 months, so it's unlikely that an Apple-manufactured GPU will make it into the next iPhone. We're probably looking at 2018 or 2019 for this one. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem. Please try again.

Apple is considering a range of options from partnering with Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. to joining with Japanese investors on a bid, said the people, asking not to be named because the matter is private.  SoftBank Group Corp. is considering getting involved in the Toshiba chip unit bidding and may cooperate with Hon Hai or Apple, the people said. Apple’s entry into the auction may improve Toshiba’s prospects for emerging from a fiasco in its Westinghouse nuclear business that has led to billions of dollars in losses. Toshiba needs to raise money from the semiconductor sale to plug the hole in its balance sheet, but the bidding process so far has been rocky. The Tokyo-based company is wary of Hon Hai’s bid to take full control of the chips unit on its own because it anticipates Japanese and U.S. governments would object. Mitsuhiro Kurano, a spokesman for SoftBank, declined to comment. Representatives for Apple in Japan didn’t respond to calls for comment. Toshiba’s Slide Into Obscurity Should Worry Shareholders: Gadfly The iPhone maker’s move caps a hectic week for Toshiba. First, the 142-year-old electronics conglomerate  warned it may not be able to continue as a going concern because of the Westinghouse losses. Then, amid signs of progress in the company’s efforts to sell its semiconductor unit, joint-venture partner Western Digital Corp. notified Toshiba such a sale may violate their contract. “How do you even judge what happened this week for Toshiba?” said Kazunori Ito, an analyst at Morningstar Investment Services. “One positive is that the company showed third-quarter profits in the memory business, giving some assurance it may sell it for a good price. But there are so many negatives, I don’t even know where to begin.” Toshiba’s memory chips are used in smartphones, personal computers and data centers, putting them at the heart of a shift away from hard drives. The semiconductor unit, which reported this week healthy profit growth in the memory unit, has fetched proposed prices of 2 trillion to 3 trillion yen, with Hon Hai, Korea’s SK Hynix Inc. and chipmaker Broadcom Ltd. emerging as the most aggressive bidders. The twists and turns won’t go away anytime soon. Toshiba’s Westinghouse unit, which is behind a 716.6 billion yen impairment at the center of the imbroglio, is mired in lawsuits and has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring. Toshiba’s Fight for Survival After Nuclear Collapse: Timeline On Tuesday, Toshiba took the unusual step of reporting third-quarter earnings without approval from its auditors. Toshiba said losses last year had left it with negative shareholders equity of 225.6 billion yen at the end of December. Toshiba has been at odds with PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata over accounting at Westinghouse, where the billions of dollars in losses stem from cost overruns on nuclear construction projects. This further jeopardized Toshiba’s listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The TSE kept Toshiba on its list of securities on alert in a December announcement, after originally being included for overstating profits from 2008 through 2014. Toshiba last month submitted a report detailing plans to improve internal controls. If deemed insufficient, the company will face delisting. Then in the middle of the week, news emerged that Steve Milligan, Western Digital’s chief executive officer, warned a sale may violate a joint venture it has with Toshiba. He wrote a letter to Toshiba’s board on April 9 advising them that they should negotiate exclusively with his company before any sale and that the proposed offers were more than the fair and supportable value of the chip business, according to a person familiar with the process. Toshiba shares fell as much as 8.1 percent in Tokyo on Friday, but pared losses after NHK, Japan’s national broadcaster, reported on Apple’s plans. The stock fell 5.4 percent to 198.7 yen in Tokyo, leaving it down 30 percent this year. Apple has not made a definitive decision about what role it will play in the chips sale, if any, the people said. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company has an interest in the unit’s future because iPhones and iPads use flash-memory. Apple could take a minority stake in the chip business with Japanese finance firms, as well as working with Hon Hai or SoftBank, the people said. It’s not clear whether SoftBank is weighing an investment in the Toshiba chips unit or another role, the people said. The Tokyo-based company is in the process of raising a $100 billion fund and has yet to close the initial investment round. “The share price right now is a pretty reasonable assessment of what Toshiba is worth without the flash memory business, assuming there is no delisting or bankruptcy,” Morningstar’s Ito said.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Spotify Is Partnering With A Third-Party Developer To Bring The Official Apple Watch App By Ali Salman Apr 12, 2017 14Shares Share Tweet Submit Andrew Chang, a third-party developer was recently in the news for developing an unofficial Spotify app for the Apple Watch named “Spotty”. When the music streaming giant showed concerns regarding the copyright, the name was changed to “Snowy”. The app had to face various dilemmas with Spotify’s legal team who cited that the app featured various UI similarities to the company’s first party iOS app. Let’s dive in to see some more details on the matter. Spotify Is Making Its Way To The Apple Watch Due to this clash, news related to the Spotify app for Apple Watch, Snowy, slowed down for the past few weeks. However, this week, the developer of the third-party app gave out a pretty big news. The developer details that Snowy will not be terminated due to an official partnership with Spotify itself. What this means that Spotify will now work with the developer to incorporate the platforms features in an app for the Apple Watch. Related The Voice Behind First Siri on iOS 5 Spills Beans About Her Experience and What it Took to be the Voice of Siri Hi all, thanks for your patience and understanding. I’m thrilled to announce that I’ll be working closely with Spotify to bring Snowy to the Apple Watch as part of an official Spotify iOS app. Spotify’s powerful iOS SDK made it possible to develop Snowy, but I can’t wait to take things to the next level with the expertise and tools available at Spotify. While I can’t give any estimates as to when it’ll be available, you can rest assured that a Spotify Apple Watch companion app is in the pipeline. However, at this point in time, there’s no news when the app will hit the shelves. In addition to this, the developer did not detail the amount of features which will be added in the Apple Watch app compared to the iOS. However, some of the features have been listed on Snowy’s website which includes offline playback, complications support, hands-free gestures as well as Siri support. Advertisement Previously, Spotify announced that it had reached 50 million paid subscribers, which has grown from 40 million recorded in September 2016. Apple Music on the other hand has gathered enough traction to stay well ahead of many music streaming platform as well with 20 million subscribers in December of 2016. However, it beats Spotify in the category of monthly  unique users which is due to the three months free trial period.

The permit that was granted allows Apple to perform self-driving vehicle testing operations in 3 different vehicles, with 6 different drivers. The vehicles in question are all 2015 Lexus RX450h models, it should be noted — rather than those little “Apple Cars” that we had seen a bit before. That seems to suggest that earlier reports that Apple is backing away from car development and refocusing on self-driving vehicle tech were accurate. The news means that Apple joins the likes of Google/Waymo, Ford, GM, Tesla, Uber, Daimler, Baidu, and perhaps others in the possession of a California DMV self-driving vehicle testing permit. The President of Consultancy at Theodore & Associates, and also a former vice president at Ford Motor Company and Chrysler, Chris Theodore, commented on the matter to Reuters: “This does confirm what’s long been rumored: that Apple is at least toying with the idea of getting into the autonomous game in some capacity. … This is not necessarily automobiles as initially rumored, but software or possibly hardware associated with autonomous technology.” My personal guess would be that Apple is working towards the development of complete self-driving vehicle tech + vehicle operating systems — in other words, towards development of Apple-branded self-driving vehicle operating systems and hardware. Presumably, there would be a strong market for such a thing, considering how many people buy Apple smartphones, tablets, and laptops. Reuters provides a bit more: “An Apple spokesman declined to comment directly on the filing, pointing back to a statement the company made in November when it wrote to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on the subject of regulating self-driving vehicles.” That statement from Apple’s director of product integrity (previously of Ford), Steve Kenner, included this line: “The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” To add to my earlier statements on the matter, I’m curious, how many people reading this would prefer that their self-driving vehicle’s tech and operating/infotainment system be designed by Apple rather than in house by an auto manufacturer?

That’s the news going around this weekend, thanks to the discovery of a company memo which states that an iPad Air 2 may be given as a substitute replacement due to low stock levels of the aging iPad 4. You certainly shouldn’t break your fourth-gen tablet and run to Apple with high hopes, but if you’ve been putting of repairs, now might be the time to take it in. The iPad 4 was first released in fall of 2012, but hasn’t been manufactured for some time. So while Apple has been supporting the tablet for the last five years, it’s likely that the company is simply running out of units to offer as replacements. According to 9to5Mac, Apple employees have been told that the iPad Air 2, which was released in late 2014 and manufactured for over two years, can be used as a replacement when stock of the older model is unavailable. Now, it’s important to note that taking in a damaged, five-year old iPad is not guaranteed to net you a shiny newer model. Apple Insider has clarified that this is not a hard-line policy from Apple, rather store managers can decide if an in-stock iPad 4, iPad Air, or iPad Air 2 is used as a replacement for servicing. It’s certainly true that supply levels of the iPad 4 are running low, but individual stores note that they can still receive serviced units in “fits and spurts.” In other words, if you’re hoping to take advantage of this situation, you might need to check at different Apple Store locations to see what they’re willing to do.

Color is viewed as a form of self-expression, just like the hue of shoes or a necktie you may buy. As a tech industry observer, I used to think that new phone colors targeted niche markets. I was wrong. When Apple released a new red iPhone 7, the first time the company adopted crimson in its most important product line, social media was abuzz. Netizens were clamoring for information on where to get their hands on the new color phones. It all went beyond niche. Information technology aficionados and journalists covering the industry, who understand the iPhone operating system, have complained about the lack of technical innovation in recent generations of Apple iPhones, but they don’t quibble about color. “Color says things,” said Li Jun, who works at a Shanghai-based design firm and produces artistic pictures of new models for smartphone vendors. It can “market products and define user groups,” a commercial concept just entering the smartphone industry, he added. In the new “color battle,” Huawei, the world’s No. 3 vendor behind Samsung and Apple, went out of its way to stress hues. At the recent release of Huawei’s 2017 flagship P10, Yu Chengdong, the company’s head of consumer business, showed models with new colors, including one called greenery. He spent 10 minutes talking about “design and trends” in colors before introducing other advantages, such as the camera. That was a bit surprising since the new phone is being marketed as a “portrait photography master.” Huawei has allied with US-based Pantone to put the “color of the year” on the P10. Since 2000, the Pantone Color Institute has declared a particular “color of the year,” which is often quickly adopted by fashion designers, florists and other consumer-oriented companies. The color this year is green, or, as Pantone calls it: greenery. “Greenery is symbolic of new beginnings,” Pantone said on its website. “It is a fresh, zesty yellow-green shade that evokes the first days of spring, when nature’s greens revive, restore and renew. Consumers are increasingly comfortable using color as a form of expression. It is a medium through which individuals can express themselves to the world around them. Huawei recognizes this evolving consumer dynamic.” Meanwhile, the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus, which will be available on April 21, are being offered in an exotic palette, including midnight black, orchid gray, Arctic silver, coral blue and maple gold. Domestic brands Oppo and Vivo have already adopted color as a strategy, not only on their products, but also on accessories, packaging and even outlet store colors. In the IT circle, Oppo is called the “green company” and Vivo “the blue company.” Samsung, Apple, Huawei, Oppo and Vivo were the top five global smartphone sellers in 2016. “The smartphone has become a necessary consumer accessory, like handbags and wallets,” said Jia Mo, an analyst at Shanghai-based Canalys. In the supply chain, changing colors is relatively low cost and easy to achieve, compared with the huge investments required for chip and camera upgrades. That makes color a great opportunity for marketing strategy, said Jia. In the not-so-long history of the industry, color has created waves. Though the Nokia brand has faded from market prominence, the debut of its Lumia 800 in 2011 still looms large in the memories of many phone buyers, including me. It’s still hard to forget the elegant blue color and curved screen that came on the market six years ago. Another recent example was Apple’s first gold iPhone. It sold out quickly in official stores, creating an extra cost of 3,000 yuan (US$435) in the “gray market” — much higher than the same model in other colors. The popularity was dubbed the “rich gold wave” by Chinese, who consider gold the symbol of luck and fortune. For my part, I really like the green models of Huawei and Oppo. Oppo’s R9s and green mobile audio speakers are particularly popular among women. Several female journalists called them “cute” gadgets. Still, I have no plans to change my iPhone 7 Plus, even though it’s a standard dull black. I am used to Apple’s interface and systems already. Color doesn’t change them. Jia sounded a warning about the new color strategies. “Colors won’t be unique advantages for long because they are easy to copy,” he said. “For big brands, offering too many colors also creates unnecessary pressures on supply chains.” Some journalists have speculated that Apple’s red iPhone release is designed to reverse a waning market shares in China. That’s not the whole story. For 10 years, Apple has had a partnership with (RED), a charity established in 2006 by Bono and others to support HIV-AIDS programs that provide counseling, testing and medicine. So far, the program has raised over US$130 million through the sale of authorized (RED) products, said Apple on its website.

The report suggested that this was due to low stock of the iPad 4 which has been discontinued which was why Apple would replace units in for service or repair with an iPad Air 2. According to a new report, that’s not a universal policy and will only be done in certain conditions. The report claims that even though there have been many reports about this, there’s actually no official Apple policy that mandates iPad 4 service replacement with an iPad Air 2. Apple is leaving it up to store managers to decide if they’re going to replace an iPad 4 with an in-stock iPad 4, iPad Air, iPad Air 2, and even in some rare cases the 2017 iPad. AppleInsider hears from sources inside Apple stores that iPad 4 service stock “arrives in fits and spurts” after it’s depleted. Basically, Apple has allowed stores to make this swap if they have no service stock available of the fourth-generation iPad. Some stores have been without service stock of this tablet for quite some time now so even though it’s not official policy yet, users may experience this change at some point if they take in their iPad 4 for a service or repair.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « California DMV Lists Apple as one of 30 Permitted to Conduct Autonomous Car Road Tests | Main | A Major Warner Bros. Patent Reveals a Coming AR/VR Movie Delivery System for Theaters, Home systems & Headsets » April 16, 2017 What's the Game Plan for the Ever Aggressive Foxconn?   Last year Foxconn acquired Sharp (one and two) and pushed hard to reinvent the company to quickly tool up to make OLED displays for Apple's iPhones as one of it's new products. In January we learned of Foxconn/Sharp's plan to manufacture OLED displays at an iPhone plant in China. We also learned that Foxconn/Sharp was aiming to grab some of Apple's iPhone camera lens business and that they were given the green light to test wireless charging modules for Apple's top end iPhones for 2017. Foxconn's Chairman also dropped the hammer on Samsung and stopped their LCD business with Samsung who was in a panic to find a replacement and eventually had to deal with their arch rival LG for LCDs. Those were just some of Foxconn's noteworthy activities in 2016.   To kick off 2017 we learned that Foxconn was a known investor in Andy Rubin's new smartphone venture. Google's Eric Schmidt sat on Apple's board during the crucial years prior to the iPhone's launch wherein Schmidt was privy to developments of the iPhone while at the same time Google was backing Andy Rubin's Android OS to compete with Apple's revolutionary iPhone. Wasn't that a direct conflict of Interest that Schmidt should have told Steve Jobs about? Yes, of course but he didn't. Schmidt played Judas to Jobs. So Andy Rubin's new smartphone company called "Essential Products Inc" is no friend to Apple. The "Essential" smartphone is rumored to be ready to launch prior to Apple's World Wide Developer Conference. Foxconn is backing this company and is likely to manufacture the new smartphone.   Foxconn manufactures a lot of devices that compete with Apple, but this is different because Foxconn has taken a stake in the company. Wouldn't it be in Foxconn's interest to let Rubin in on Apple's latest product developments to better help Essential compete with future Apple iPhones? Is Foxconn really getting into the camera lens for Apple or Essential? Is Foxconn really working on wireless modules for Apple or Essential? Considering that we learned that Apple has been working with Broadcom on a wireless charing solution for two years, why would Foxconn get the nod for charging modules?   Apple has a great relationship with Foxconn and it's chairman Terry Gou. Patently Apple posted a report in December covering Tim Cook's visit to Shenzhen back in October. Foxconn's Founder and Chairman Terry Gou accompanied Cook to meet Chairman Xu Shaoshi of China's National Development and Reform Commission and other senior Shenzhen officials. Apple's new facility will be in the same city as the new ARM chip design center. So it appears that Foxconn and Apple are tied at the hip.   I think most of us realize that the press and rumors get some interesting facts but could be slightly inaccurate in the finer details. The report that Foxconn was an investor in Essential was an alert to say the least. But the Foxconn's connection to Essential may have been a little off course.   In March Patently Apple posted a report titled "Politics Likely Played a Role in Softbank's Decision to Back Off their Investment in a new Apple Rival Led by Andy Rubin." Our report covered the Wall Street Journal's report stating that "SoftBank Group Corp. scrapped a planned $100 million investment in a smartphone startup founded by the creator of Google's Android software, partly because of the Japanese investor's increasingly close relationship with Apple Inc., according to people familiar with the matter." Was Foxconn personally involved via the potential SoftBank investment or are they still invested in Essential?"   Yet no matter how you look at it, it sounds like Apple caught wind of this investment, forcing SoftBank to pull out. It's a political game that we'll never know the exact details of, but it's a little troubling.   Today we're learning of another venture that Foxconn is pushing with a questionable twist. The Nikkei is reporting that Foxconn/Sharp is mulling reentry into the PC market.   The Nikkei reports that "The Japanese electronics manufacturer is weighing the possibility of selling PCs and other devices made by its Taiwanese parent, Hon Hai Precision Industry, under the Sharp brand."   The twist is Sharp's President Tai Jeng-wu adding that they had "no plans of restarting its smartphone business." Yet if Hon Hai is willing to back a plan for Sharp to reenter a shrinking or dying market, wouldn't smartphones be next?   Is Foxconn's connection to the new Essential smartphone a possible clue that Foxconn has bigger plans for the new smartphone – as in getting Sharp to become a major partner backing it? Wouldn't that be a way for Foxconn to get more smartphone manufacturing business so that their reliance on Apple is reduced?   The ever aggressive Foxconn is a major Apple partner, but recent moves into wireless charging and camera lenses and the likely link to an investment in Essential is enough to make anyone wonder if Foxconn could one day pull-off another shocker like they did with their one-time partner Samsung for LCD displays. One moment Samsung was a major customer and, without warning, Foxconn left them stranded. If you're an Apple fan that could have been a humorous moment if not ballsy, but what if Foxconn ever pulled that off against Apple? I don't think we'd find it funny in the least.   At the moment, Apple-Foxconn is like Lennon-McCartney. They're teams that you think could never breakup. But the inconceivable happened and it was a nasty breakup for the Beatles. I now have to wonder if Foxconn has a longer game plan in mind that doesn't involve Apple at all. And when you think about it, if a trade war ever broke out between China and the U.S. Apple would be one of the top U.S. companies that would be hit which would put Foxconn at great risk. So even as a back-up plan, Foxconn has to be ready for any surprising developments, because in the end, business is business.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Apple Enters Self-Driving Car Race Sunday, 16 Apr 2017 11:41 AM Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Apple is joining the fiercely competitive race to design self-driving cars, raising the possibility that a company that has already re-shaped culture with its iPhone may try to transform transportation, too. Ending years of speculation, Apple's late entry into a crowded field was made official Friday with the disclosure that the California Department of Motor Vehicles had awarded a permit for the company to start testing its self-driving car technology on public roads in the state. The permit covers three vehicles — all 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs — and six individual drivers. California law requires people to be in a self-driving car who can take control if something goes wrong. APPLE GOES MOBILE ... IN A NEW WAY Apple confirmed its arrival in the self-driving car market, but wouldn't discuss its intentions. Its interest in autonomous vehicle technology, however, has long been clear. The Cupertino, California, company pointed to a statement that it issued in December. " Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems," the company said then. "There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation." Apple released that statement after Steve Kenner, a former Ford Motor executive who is now Apple's director of product integrity, notified federal regulators of the company's interest in self-driving cars in a letter. Like others, Apple believes self-driving cars could ease congestion, prevent millions of crashes and save thousands of lives annually in traffic accidents often caused by drunk or distracted motorists. Self-driving cars could also be a lucrative new market. And Apple has been searching for its next act for a while, one that will take it beyond its mainstay phones, tablets and personal computers. A NEXT BIG THING Although iPhone's ongoing popularity has helped Apple remain the world's most valuable company, the company hasn't had a breakthrough product since the 2010 debut of the iPad, currently in the throes of a three-year sales slump. The dry spell has raised doubts as to whether Apple lost some of its trend-setting magic with the death of co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Apple will be vying against 29 other companies that already have California permits to test self-driving cars. The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has been spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. Since Google began its work on self-driving vehicles eight years ago, Waymo's fleet of self-driving cars has logged more than 2 million miles on the road. That means Apple has a long way to catch up in self-driving technology. But it has often been a follower in markets that it eventually revolutionized. It wasn't the first to introduce a digital music player, smartphone, or tablet before its iPod, iPhone and iPad came out. DEEP POCKETS With $246 billion in cash, Apple also could easily afford to buy technology that accelerates its development of self-driving cars. There has been recurring speculation that Apple might eventually acquire Tesla, which has a market value of about $50 billion. Neither Apple nor Tesla has given any inkling that they're interested in joining forces, though. Speculation about Apple's interest in expanding into automobiles began swirling in 2015 amid media reports that the company had begun secretly working on building its own electric car under the name project "Titan." Apple never confirmed the existence of Titan, which is now believed to be dead. © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Photo: Robin Choo mail print View all comments Tweet By Toh Ee Ming - toheeming@mediacorp.com.sg - Published: 10:40 PM, April 16, 2017 Updated: 12:20 PM, April 17, 2017 SINGAPORE — Having lost his sight about 10 years ago because of a retinal detachment, Mr Zahier Samad, 30, often had to rely on his family or “the kindness of the public”. With the help of technology, however, he can now message his loved ones, use a smartphone app to pinpoint when the next bus is coming, and access his emails or surf the Web via a screen-reader software — restoring his sense of independence, which he values fiercely. Mr Zahier, a waiter at Nox - Dine in the Dark, was among a group of some 20 participants in a recent workshop at the Enabling Village on assistive technology, organised jointly by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and Apple. As part of its push for a digitally inclusive society, Communications and Information Minister Yaacob Ibrahim announced last week that the IMDA will work with tech companies such as Apple and Microsoft to train a pool of people with special needs to be Assistive Technology Ambassadors, to widen the use of such technology. Rather than fork out for expensive, specialised technology, people with disabilities should be able to enjoy mainstream devices like everybody else, said Mr David Woodbridge, who is blind. The senior adaptive technology consultant at Vision Australia, the leading provider of blindness and low-vision services in Australia, had led the workshop and shared his experience with assistive tech features across the suite of Apple products. Rather than depend on “eight to 10 different devices” to help him with his daily chores, the 53-year-old can rely on his iPhone to live independently. He has his appointments read out, controls his air-conditioning through Siri, gets his daily fix of caffeine from a Bluetooth-enabled coffee machine, has his Apple watch tell him the time through a series of taps, and navigates the X-box using built-in speech output. As a social worker in the 1980s, Mr Woodbridge was told that he could not get access to a database because he was blind, so he became determined to find a way to access it on his own. “From that point on, I wanted to be part of the other side of the system that gave people appropriate information about things they could do, rather than couldn’t do,” he told TODAY. He has since devoted himself to being “the best expert” he can be, working with tech giants to evaluate technology and equipment, for instance from Apple, Microsoft, Google and Samsung, for use by people who are blind or vision-impaired. He also consults with developers on how they can make their apps more accessible for the low-vision and vision-impaired community. The passionate advocate shares tips, tricks and tutorials on his podcast iSee, through the iTunes store and the AppleVis website, a community-powered website for blind and low-vision users of Apple products. The topics include how to find and watch audio-described movies, how to play a blind cricket game and how to change the straps of an Apple Watch. In calling for more awareness of the potential of assistive technology and for information to be shared better among people with disabilities, he urged people not to think of it as “scary technology”. He noted that people can now buy it off the shelf and trawl for information online, and said: “If you don’t give it a go, then you’ll never know you can do a lot (with it).” While Mr Zahier was initially “sceptical” about the workshop, he said he picked up useful tips and features he was not aware of previously. “I was inspired by it, and I love to be an advocate of assistive technology and help people like myself lead a better life,” he said. The IMDA said it hopes to reach out to about 160 persons with visual, hearing, physical or intellectual disabilities at more of such IT and assistive technology workshops, which will be conducted with Apple and Microsoft this year on a quarterly basis. mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most Singapore READ COMMENTED “Good progress” made in containing oil spillage after recent collisions “Bedding-in” period of several months to be expected for DTL2: Khaw ‘Zero tolerance’ for religious preaching that fans violence: Shanmugam ‘You have made Singapore very proud today’: PM Lee to Yip Pin Xiu ‘Wrecked dorm’ videos an isolated incident: SCDF ‘I hope winning the Olympics gold with Fiji doesn’t mean it goes downhill from here’ Yusof Ishak Mosque opens Woman, 60, charged with running unlicensed employment agency US outdoor gear maker confirms axing Singaporean company over dog abuse video Two teens arrested for impersonating police officers TODAY's morning briefing for Monday, April 17 TODAY's morning brief for Wednesday, April 12 TODAY's morning brief for Tuesday, April 11 TODAY's morning brief for Thursday, April 13 TODAY's morning brief for Monday, April 10 Inside Today World Turkey's Erdogan declares referendum victory, opponents plan challenge China's graft watchdog investigates senior inspector in drive to tackle internal rot Pence stresses 'era of strategic patience' over as he visits Korean DMZ Taiwan says ready to review Chinese activist's asylum request A homebody President skips his honeymoon Business Stocks, dollar under pressure after soft U.S. data Oil falls after failed North Korean missile test, U.S. rig count gains Steel, stimulus drive China's strongest economic growth since 2015 China's first-quarter property investment accelerates, defying curbs Private home sales double in March as demand increases Sports Othman Wok: The man who built the National Stadium Chelsea has 'six finals' to go and only 50 percent chance of winning title: Conte Lucky Saints are new kings of Under-14 Schools Sevens World No 1 shuttler Tai smashes to fifth straight title with S’pore Open win Canada cap fairytale run at Singapore 7s with maiden Cup win Entertainment TOP AWARDS: Who won what at the Star Awards Zoe Tay wins Best Actress at Star Awards Edmund Chen files police report against former 'employee' Will Zoe Tay win Best Actress at the Star Awards on Sunday?

The permit allows it to conduct test drives in three vehicles with six drivers, the state Department of Motor Vehicles said on Friday. The vehicles are all 2015 Lexus RX450h, according to the DMV. Although it has never openly acknowledged it is looking into building an electric car, Apple has recruited dozens of auto experts in recent years, and the permit pulls the curtain back a bit on any possible plan. "This does confirm what's long been rumored: that Apple is at least toying with the idea of getting into the autonomous game in some capacity," said Chris Theodore, president of consultancy Theodore & Associates, and a former vice president at Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Chrysler. FILE PHOTO: The Apple logo is seen on the facade of the new Apple Store in Paris, France, January 5, 2017. REUTERS/Charles Platiau  The permit does not mean Apple is definitely building a car. "This is not necessarily automobiles as initially rumored, but software or possibly hardware associated with autonomous technology," Theodore said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment directly on the filing, pointing back to a statement the company made in November when it wrote to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on the subject of regulating self-driving vehicles. "The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation," Apple's director of product integrity, Steve Kenner, wrote in that five-page letter. Apple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. Apple joins a growing list of traditional carmakers, technology companies, and small start ups to test drive cars in California - all vying to be the first to have commercially viable vehicles on the roads.\ Companies that have been issued permits also include Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google unit, Ford Motor Co (F.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) and General Motors Co (GM.N). Many companies have said the first cars will launch in 2020 but some experts believe it may take much longer due to regulatory challenges. Shares of Apple closed down 0.5 percent at $141.05 on Thursday.  What others are reading First 100 days: Akufo-Addo gov't on right footing - Governance expert Latest Stories First 100 days: Akufo-Addo gov't on right footing - Governance expert 100 days of change under Akufo-Addo; vigilante terror in economic freedom Easter Soup Kitchen: Beneficiaries thank Joy FM for lavish treatment University of Ghana lecturer robbed at gunpoint Joe Mettle, I am super proud of you Previous article Multimedia Group apologises to NPP, reps over Newsfile gaffe Next article Photos: Show Time Dancers thrill patrons at Joy FM Easter Soup Kitchen LIFESTYLE Mothers with autism: ‘I mothered my children in a very different way’ ODD NEWS Pet goat 'Speedy' helped save family from house fire AUTOS The Junction Mall Auto Show TECHNOLOGY Apple gets permit to test self-driving cars in California OBITUARY Nana Yaa Tamakloe (Nee Ansere) ELECTIONS EC holds district elections in Nkoranza after 2015 disruption Home News Politics Business Sports World News Opinion More Sections Entertainment Elections Health Odd News Automobile Technology Media Audio on Demand Photo Gallery Online Radio Videos On Demand Live TV Social RSS Feeds Twitter Facebook Youtube Google+ Instagram LinkedIn Myjoyonline Advertise Online Team Privacy Policy Services Contact us Feedback Our daily bread porn videos url shortener sohbet
About us Our staff Contacts Home Business Health Science Tech World Apple gets permit to test self-driving cars in Calif. April 16, 2017 Paul Smedley Leave a comment Apple Inc. has received permission from California to test autonomous vehicles on the state’s public roads, joining a growing list of tech companies, startups and auto makers jockeying to make self-driving cars a common sight globally. California then revoked the registrations of the company’s cars, so Uber took its test cars to Arizona, where no such registration is required. Although there have been a multitude of reports regarding Apple’s secretive Project Titan over the past year, including some that indicated the company had scaled back its autonomous ambitions, the company has remained tight-lipped about its intentions. TM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries. Editor’s note: An earlier version of this story misidentified the Lexus crossover that Apple has received permission to use in testing autonomous vehicle technology in California. “These rules expand our existing autonomous vehicle testing program to include testing vehicles where no driver is present”, said DMV Director Jean Shiomoto. Not many companies have actually done tests even though they have permits, and this is evidenced by the lack of “miles driven” in their reports to the DMV. The Department of Motor Vehicles in the company’s home state confirmed on Friday the permit had been issued (via Reuters). But by last October, many in the team had reportedly left or been reassigned as a result of a strategic shift by the company to focus on the software side of self-driving technology. Apple is still in the vehicle business. Like Google did in the past, Apple will most likely be fitting these vehicles with it’s own software and hardware to test in real-world conditions what they’ve been secretly developing in their own labs. This is presumably for Project Titan, the on-again, off-again self-driving vehicle that has been in the works for several years. It’s no secret, Apple has been working hard on a self-driving auto. Apple declined to comment, referring to public remarks that it had submitted to federal highway authorities in November on its research into automation.

It seems unlikely at this point that the company will suddenly compete with vehicle makers with an Apple auto. Pictured here is an autonomous vehicle on a test run north of London. Apple joins a growing list of traditional carmakers, technology companies and startups to conduct trials in California, all vying to be the first to bring self-driving cars to the masses. Apple believes that self-driving cars can save lives and accidents along with easing congestion. The thing is, the permit is for the cars themselves, but actually applies to the technology behind the self-driving capability of those cars. By no means does this confirm an "Apple Car", in fact the permit granted to Apple covers the use of Lexus RX450h vehicles. In addition, Apple has six drivers permitted to operate the vehicles. Companies that have been issued permits also include Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL) Google unit, Ford, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) and General Motors Co (GM). Apple has been working on Project Titan for several years, but has never formally acknowledged it. Late a year ago, Apple submitted a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in which it said that it was "investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation". While GM is already testing autonomous vehicles through its Cruise Automation unit in California, Arizona and MI, the new initiative will ramp up those efforts. Hopefully, Apple won't be one of them but, rather, be one of those companies that will push forward its technology in public, letting people see how close they are (or how far they are, as the case may be) to fully autonomous cars of the future.

By Aaron Brown Aaron Brown PUBLISHED: 12:00, Sun, Apr 16, 2017 | UPDATED: 12:19, Sun, Apr 16, 2017 IDROPNEWSiPhone 8 will include a dual camera set-up and an edge-to-edge display, reports suggest Apple is reportedly facing delays with the iPhone 8, which should be launched worldwide in September 2017. The Cupertino-based company is believed to be having issues with low yield-rates for the new display. Apple wants to eliminate the hefty bezels that surround the screen on the current generation of iPhone, dropping the physical Home Button so that the display can extend to the very edge of the chassis. This will allow Apple to reduce the physical footprint of the device, despite an increase in the screen size. The iPhone manufacturer was reportedly hoping to embed the Touch ID fingerprint scanner technology, traditionally baked into the Home Button, beneath the glass display. But the yield rates for this new Touch ID technology are unsustainably low – triggering a bottleneck in iPhone production, Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri claimed earlier this week. Apple iPhone 8 - Leaked photos, concept images, and renders Sun, January 1, 2017 iPhone 8 is shaping up to be one of the most impressive Apple smartphones to date, with glass panels on the front and rear of the device, a curved borderless OLED display and no Home Button Play slideshow VENIAMIN GESKIN • TWITTER • CONCEPT IMAGES 1 of 24 Apple iPhone 8 will debut a brand-new all-glass look, with a curved OLED display and no physical Home Button As a result of this bottleneck, leaked schematics from manufacturing plant Foxconn appeared to show Apple moving to a simpler design. The technical drawings of the iPhone 8, which were shared across social media website Weibo, showed Apple relocating the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the rear of the phone. There are also a number of disadvantages to moving the fingerprint sensor to the back of the phone. Not least, the fact that you cannot unlock the phone with your fingerprint when it's resting on a desk or table without picking it up. And since the fingerprint scanner is out of your line of sight, you can find yourself blindly fumbling, which can lose time – especially when you're trying to authorise a contactless payment. WEIBOImages shared on Weibo purportedly show the technical drawings of the next iPhone But there is hope. Despite sending schematics for an iPhone with a rear-mounted Touch ID sensor to Foxconn, the design may not be the finalised. Apple might still be planning to make the no-holds-barred smartphone long-rumoured to mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone range. As shown in the table with the leaked Weibo image, this technical drawing is supposedly an image of the Apple iPhone 8’s Engineering Validation Test third revision.  Engineering Validation Test, or EVT, is an early stage in Apple's product development cycle. iDROPNEWSThe next iPhone will reportedly feature razor-thin 4mm bezels surrounding the OLED display The iPhone must still pass a Design Validation Test and Production Validation Test stage before being finalised ready for the September release date. According to an anonymous source speaking to iDropNews, this iPhone may never see the light of day. The technology blog reports: “[The] informant divulged there are two iPhone 8 prototypes currently being tested. The first model features Touch ID on the rear, however the second model does in fact feature Touch ID underneath the display. “There are a few major differences between the two prototypes listed below. Based on the following information, we’re hoping this version becomes the official design for the iPhone 8, and the source is confident that it will be.” According to the report, the iPhone 8 will feature razor-thin 4mm bezels surrounding the OLED display.  iDROPNEWSLeaked schematics show the rear camera set-up rotated 90-degrees Additionally, the source believe the 10th anniversary iPhone will feature an almost-invisible front-facing camera embedded beneath the glass display, along with a larger power button. iDropNews has published a handful of eye-catching renders based on the latest information about the iPhone 8 design. Apple iPhone 8 will reportedly feature a new five-inch display size, wireless charging and dual camera set-up. That display size refers to the primary touchscreen area, which will be around 5.15 inches, according to the latest whispers from Cupertino. Meanwhile, the rest of the touchscreen – which will reportedly bleed to the very edges of the phone – will be reserved for a row of virtual on-screen buttons. DRIBBLE • ALHASAN HUSNIConcept artists reveal the new Function Area at the bottom of the five-inch touchscreen This separate Function Area, housed beneath the main display, will replace the physical Home Button and include the Touch ID fingerprint scanner embedded beneath the glass display. The Function Area touchscreen will intelligently adapt to whatever is happening on screen, bringing menu items and shortcuts to your fingertips, similar to the Touch Bar included on the latest MacBook Pro models. According to Ming-Chi Kuo, the overall footprint of the smartphone will be similar to that of the iPhone 6, iPhone 6S and iPhone 7 – which all have a 4.7-inch LED display. Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive is reportedly designing the phone so that it resembles "a single sheet of glass". The news comes as reports that the iPhone 8 would cost more than $1,000 were dismissed by another prominent analyst. "Apple is about mainstream luxury, so a $1,000 phone seems less likely," the note from analyst firm UBS explained.

Sign up By Jessica Ferrera , Christian Post Contributor Apr 16, 2017 | 12:29 PM x An alleged set of schematics for the upcoming iPhone 8 has been leaked, and it suggests that the smartphone might sport a vertical dual lens camera design while the physical home button will still exist. Reuters/Lucy NicholsonThe iPhone 7 smartphone is displayed inside an Apple Inc. store in Los Angeles, California, U.S. in September 2016. On Thursday, rumored iPhone 8 schematics were shared through Slash Leaks by someone going by the username LEAKSPINNER who has a 79 percent accuracy rating (out of 284 posts) on the website. The alleged iPhone 8 schematics suggest that the upcoming premium smartphone from Apple will have a redesigned dual lens camera found at the rear side. The Cupertino, California technology company debuted a horizontally aligned dual lens on their iPhone line with the iPhone 7 Plus last September 2016. On the other hand, the bigger surprise in the schematics concerns the physical home button. Since rumors about iPhone 8 started circulating, analysts repeatedly echoed that Apple will opt for a bigger screen through the slimming down of its bezels. To achieve that, it would also be necessary for Apple to take away the physical home button. So speculations were quick to spread that after ditching the 3.5-millimeter headphone jack on the iPhone 7, the iPhone 8 would also have to bid goodbye to its signature round physical home button. However, the recent leak says otherwise. The green round button found in the middle of the rear side is rumored to work as the physical home button, which simply means that Apple is not bidding farewell to the said key – they just might relocate it. Meanwhile, iDropNews has also reported that a Foxconn employee shared there are currently two prototypes for the iPhone 8 that are being tested before the production phase starts. One of the modules works with the Touch ID placed in the rear while the other has it embedded underneath the display panel. Apart from that, the same source mentioned that some of the most likely iPhone 8 features would be 4mm bezels, contoured glass in the front and back, a wireless charging function, a front-facing camera embedded in the screen and more. The iPhone 8 is highly expected to be released this year. Share on facebook Share on twitter Share Email Print Share Tweet Pin Linkedin Google+ Reddit Free sign up cp newsletter!

Ahead of its release, Apple put the iOS 10.3 update into beta for developers and those in the free Beta Software Program. The iOS 10.3 beta helped Apple gain valuable feedback about potential bugs and problems. Of course, that didn’t prevent iOS 10.3 problems from emerging in the final release. The bug list included unspecified issues that ultimately forced Apple to halt the iOS 10.3 updates for the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c. Apple’s replaced iOS 10.3 with an iOS 10.3.1 update, a tiny maintenance update. iOS 10.3.1 didn’t go through a beta, probably because the update is just a few MB in size. And while iOS 10.3.1 might be tiny, it too is causing issues for some iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users. With that in mind we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners need to know about iOS 10.3.1 problems as we push away from the update’s release. This roundup takes a look at the current state of iOS 10.3.1 problems, shows you potential fixes for the most common iOS 10.3.1 issues, and provides some resources that could come in handy if you start to see trouble with your version of iOS 10.3.1. It also takes a look at what’s next from Apple in terms of bug fixes. iOS 10.3.1 Problems It’s early but we’re already hearing about some of the iOS 10.3.1 problems iPhone and iPad users are encountering after installing Apple’s brand new update. The early list includes the usual suspects. iPhone and iPad users are encountering installation errors, weird battery drain, Wi-Fi issues, busted Bluetooth, Touch ID, Siri, and some issues with third-party applications including Facebook. Apple’s discussion forums, Reddit, and social media sites like Twitter are starting to fill up with various complaints about the iOS 10.3.1 update and we expect the list to grow as more people find and install the new software. It seem like Apple didn't fixed the major battery drain in 10.3-10.3.1 update. I swear, my battery wasn't behaving like that back in iOS 9! — Ian Kelly (@ianjsays) April 7, 2017 https://twitter.com/SaranMufc_/status/850568176555261952 @Apple @AppleSupport IOS 10.3GM and 10.3.1 both seem to have high battery drain can you address please. Iphone 7+ thanks. — Myklo (@3JustMike3) April 4, 2017 @My_AppleGadgets experiencing battery drain with ios 10.3.1 — Kurt Gilchrist® (@Kurtgilchrist) April 4, 2017 Sensing that iOS 10.3.1 may have introduced a few Bluetooth reliability issues. Anyone else? — Michael Firth (@TechFirth) April 10, 2017 It’s virtually impossible to predict what kind of performance you’ll see on your phone or tablet and this is precisely why we always recommend doing a some prep work before installing an iOS release, even before a small release like iOS 10.3.1. We’ve put together a step-by-step process that will take you through the pre-iOS 10.3.1 installation process we used on our iPhones and iPads. At the bare minimum you’ll want to make a backup of your device. This way you won’t lose any important files. Where to Find Feedback As we push away from the iOS 10.3.1 release date it’s important to keep tabs on the update’s performance. Part of this is monitoring your version of the update for issues. Part of it is digging into feedback from other iOS 10.3.1 users. Digging into some of this iOS 10.3.1 feedback will alert you to potential iOS 10.3.1 problems and it’ll help you find potential benefits of the iOS 10.3.1 update. To start you off, we’ve put together some reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.3.1 update on your device right now. If you’re on the fence about making the move to iOS 10.3.1, start there. We’ve also starting putting together our own impressions of the iOS 10.3.1 update. We’ve started with the iPhone 7, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6, iPhone 5, and the iPad. As always, we also recommend keeping an eye on YouTube, Apple’s discussion forums, social media sites like Twitter/Facebook, and the MacRumors forums for additional feedback about the current version of iOS 10. How to Fix iOS 10.3.1 Problems If you do run into an iOS 10.3.1 problem on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, there’s no need to panic. Chances are, you’ll be able to fix your issue from the confines of your home or office. Before you take your iPhone or iPad down to an Apple Store or carrier store you’ll want to try and fix your issue(s) manually. We’ve put together a list of the most common iOS 10 problems and fixes and it’s a great place to start if you’re in trouble. We also recently released a list of tips that could help you improve performance. Some of these will take seconds to complete, others are a little more involved. If you’re unable to find a fix for your issue there, you should go to Apple’s discussion forums for help. There are tons of helpful users there. If Apple’s forums don’t help, you can get in contact with Apple Support via Twitter or the company’s website. If that doesn’t work, schedule an appointment to see a Genius at a local Apple Store. You Can’t Downgrade We’ve got some bad news for those of you dealing with iOS 10.3.1 problems. Apple is no longer signing off on iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.2.1 which means you can no longer downgrade from iOS 10.3.1 in an effort to improve your device’s performance. This is a permanent change and it means those of you who are experiencing iOS 10.3.1 problems are on your own. Apple’s next iOS update is probably a few weeks away. Those of you who haven’t made the move to iOS 10.3.1 yet should take note. Once you upgrade, there’s no going back to whatever version of iOS you’re on. For more on the downgrade process, take a look at our detailed walkthrough. It’ll help you prepare for next time. What’s Next A new version of iOS 10.3 is confirmed. The iOS 10.3.2 update is official and it’s currently in beta for developers and those in the free Beta Software Program. The update arrived alongside new beta software updates for tvOS, watchOS, and macOS. The iOS 10.3.2 update appears to be a maintenance release which means it will likely have critical bug fixes and security patches on board. Unfortunately, we don’t know when iOS 10.3.2 will be released to the general public. Apple typically releases several beta updates before pushing the final product. If you’re dealing with an iOS 10.3 problem, make sure you keep a close eye on iOS 10.3.2 and the iOS 10.3.2 beta. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 7 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 11 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 11 13 Responses 03/30/2017 DopplerDon Barker Reply I installed (or did I) iOS 10.3 and now my phone (6S) will not get past the updating iCloud settings screen despite hard reboots x3. 04/16/2017 B Reply Me too 04/03/2017 jenny Reply My phone keeps searching,fixed it just within 4days its searching again 04/05/2017 Yacine Reply Hello i have mutch problems touch id very slow and the 4g data problems you turn on very slow not fast that all i can say please Apple fix this i have a iPhone 6s 128gb Apple give updates but nothing working good i hope fix this message app little bit slow thanks!!!! 04/07/2017 Josh Orlando Reply I’m currently extracting 10.3.1 as I write this comment since my phone crashed while trying to install last night. First time having any issues with any iOS updates, so I will take precaution going forward. Luckily I backed up my phone not too long ago. 04/07/2017 Michele Reply My 7 Plus was stable. My phone advised there was an update so I went forward with it. Now my Bluetooth isn’t working, all my messages have been erased and none of the messages buttons work (like send for example), when I swipe up from the bottom to access my Control Panel is completely locks up my phone, and even a factory reset with backup restore didn’t work. I am trying a complete reset now with setup as a new phone to see if I can resolve my issues. I will update once done. 04/07/2017 Michele Reply Had to do a full factory reset with start as a new phone options. Appears to have fixed the issue but lost a lot of information. No big deal tho. At least the phone is fine. 04/09/2017 Brooke Reply Updated to 10.3.1 last night and less than 12 hours later my 6 plus has died. Will not turn on and can get no response from it. 04/12/2017 Dot parnell Reply Since I downloaded 10.3 my Facebook does work – anyone know what I can do. 04/13/2017 W Stephen Wilson Reply The update destroyed my IMAP path functionality so I can no longer do email. 04/13/2017 Rosie Reply Ever since I purchase iPhone 7Plus I had nothing but problems. I uploaded the 10.3.1 on 4/11/2017 with the following problems: It’s stuck on the iCloud setup Delete email in Allmail and it creates a duplicate; therefore I have to delete the mail twice. Apple why don’t you hire some computer technology people that know what they’re doing. This will be costing you money and making you look inadequate to the world. 04/14/2017 David Pearcey Reply I tired to update but it messed up my iCloud authentication somehow. It goes into a password authorization loop and disabled my iMessage, FaceTime and Family services functions. The update actually failed during Verifying Update phase of the install. It didn’t install (probably a good thing), and after it failed I got the above mentioned issues. I called apple support and they couldn’t fix it.They upgraded my issue to the engineering department and I haven’t heard from them since. After waiting a couple of days I decided to try doing a full reset and restore on my iPad Air2 and it fixed the issue. I will not be installing 10.3.1 until I hear back from Apple. Very uncharacteristic instability coming from Apple these days :( 04/16/2017 Gourmetdrummer Reply iOS 10.3.1 slows down the search function in contacts if you have a large contact list. I tested this with less than 5,000 contacts and it worked fine, but when I loaded the full 12,000+ contacts it takes 3-4 minutes to pull up a searched contact. I then restored to my backup with the older software version and it worked fine. Is anyone else seeing this? Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Apple will replace it with an iPad Air 2 Have a broken Apple iPad 4? Apple will replace it with an iPad Air 2 Posted: 16 Apr 2017, 00:38, by Alan F. Share Tweet Share Tags : iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ Tablets-Tablets+ The Apple iPad 4 was launched back in 2012. It was the first of Apple's iOS powered slabs to employ the company's proprietary Lightning port. At the time, it also was a major improvement with double the processing and graphics power compared to the previous model. With inventories of the iPad 4 basically non-existent, Apple doesn't have any more units lying around to replace any busted models. But don't fret. If you qualify for a replacement slab, Apple will be more than happy to send you 2014's Apple iPad Air 2 instead. An internal memo from Apple that was leaked reads, "Starting March 30th, iPad 4th generation whole unit repairs may be substituted to iPad Air 2." And going from the iPad 4 to the iPad Air 2 should be considered an upgrade. After all, it was the iOS flagship tablet in 2014, powered by the Apple A8X chipset with 2GB of RAM inside. The 9.7-inch screen carries a 1536 x 2048 resolution, and the lights are kept on by a 7340mAh battery. The rear-facing camera weighs in at 8MP with an f/2.2 aperture. A 1.2MP front-facing camera handles selfies and video chats. The iPad Air 2 measures a svelte 6.1mm thin, 1.4mm thinner than the original Apple iPad Air, and 3.3mm trimmer than the iPad 4. In addition, those turning in a busted iPad 4 could end up with a gold-hued iPad Air 2 since it was the first Apple tablet to come in that color. In addition, the iPad Air 2 comes with 32GB and 128GB of internal storage, which means that turning in the a broken iPad 4 can turn into a total upgrade in every way possible. source: 9to5Mac Editor's pick   U Ultra vs GS7 edge vs iPhone 7 Plus vs G6: camera comparison!   Beware the dragon: Xiaomi Mi 6 rumor round-up The free iOS app of the week is space game Hyperburner 15 Apr Prev news Google is testing UI changes for the Android powered YouTube app 16 Apr Next news Close newer posts WhatsApp Beta for Windows Phone tests new feature that alerts contacts 16 Apr Best multiplayer games for Android and iPhone (2017) 16 Apr Has Microsoft quietly killed off Windows 10 Mobile? 16 Apr Google is testing UI changes for the Android powered YouTube app 16 Apr Now reading: Have a broken Apple iPad 4?

I have only one iPad in my family and had it since 2012 -iPad 3 - and it works good. posted on yesterday, 08:51 0 Reply 12.

Apple May Replace It With A Sweet iPad Air 2 It came as quite the surprise when Apple recently introduced a new generation 9.7-inch iPad model at a lower price point than previous generation models, and with more onboard storage to boot. Does Apple just not care about the tablet market as much anymore? That might be the case, as also surprising is a new report that Apple is instructing employees to replace faulty 4th generation iPad models with iPad Air 2 tablets. An internal memo obtained by 9To5Mac reads, "Starting March 30th, iPad 4th generation whole unit repairs may be substituted to iPad Air 2." The memo also instructs Apple employees to let customers know of the iPad Air 2's color and capacity options. That is relevant to customers seeking an upgrade because the Apple introduced a new gold color option with the iPad Air 2. And more recently, Apple dropped its 16GB and 64GB SKUs, leaving just 32GB and 128GB models. What all of that ultimately means is that anyone who has a defective 4th generation iPad will essentially receive an upgrade all around. The iPad Air 2 is more powerful than the 4th generation iPad, and because Apple changed the storage options, users would also receive a bump in capacity. Talk about turning a frown upside down—this is nothing short of a win for 4th generation iPad owners in need of a repair. The iPad Air 2 was introduced in October 2014 and is now discontinued. Apple replaced it with a $329 model dubbed simply "iPad." The new model is slightly thicker than the iPad Air 2, but boasts an upgraded custom Apple A9 SoC and more storage for the money. While not an official policy, Apple usually supports its products for five years or more after being discontinued. The 4th generation iPad was discontinued in October 2014 with the release of the iPad Air 2. Assuming nothing changes, Apple can be expected to repair, support, and replace (as needed) 4th generation iPad models up through at least around the end of 2019.

Technology brings history to life: App enables people to listen as they walk the Stations of the Cross JOAN KERN | LNP CORRESPONDENT Apr 15, 2017 (…) Buy Now BLAINE SHAHAN | Staff Photographer Jay Anderson show the app for the Stations of the Cross at Saint James Episcopal Church on an iPad. Buy Now Blaine Shahan Braille has been added to the signs marking the Stations of the Cross at St. James Episcopal Church. Buy Now Blaine Shahan An app for mobile devices has been made for the Stations of the Cross at Saint Thomas Episcopal Church. Jay Anderson is the senior warden at Manheim Township’s St. Thomas Episcopal Church and professor emeritus of computer science at Franklin & Marshall College. The two roles came together when Anderson attended an Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco in June 2016. “It offered tech support and an inspirational speaker who was blind and deaf and who spoke about making software accessible to the handicapped,” Anderson said. St. Thomas had hung 14 subtle, yet moving sculptures representing the Stations of the Cross on the walls of its sanctuary, at 301 St. Thomas Road, in 2005. The permanent installation, crafted by sculptor Virginia Maksymowicz, associate professor of art history at Franklin & Marshall College, was meant to be touched. While listening to the Apple conference speaker, it occurred to Anderson that St. Thomas’ Stations of the Cross could be shared with the blind and visually impaired by simply adding braille to the signs that identify the stations and adding voices to the app, “Stations at St. Thomas.” Signs in braille Last month, his ideas became reality. New signs now hang beside the stations that include braille, and the app, which he created (for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch only), includes full audio for meditations from the Episcopal “Book of Occasional Services.” An android version of the app does not yet have audio, but will soon, Anderson said, adding that people also can use the apps from the comfort of their homes. “There’s also a version on Apple TV, but that’s very much a small item,” Anderson said. The audio includes the Rev. Philip and Mrs. Kluane Snyder, members of St. Thomas, reading scripture and prayers, with responses by a group of parishioners. The public may walk Jesus’ journey from his condemnation to his crucifixion before and after 8 and 10 a.m. Sunday services and by appointment from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Thursday. Call the church office at 569-3241. For an appointment outside of these hours, call Anderson at 371-5252. The self-guided tours are available year round, although Anderson said Holy Week is the most popular time of the year. A recent publication by the Episcopal Diocese of Central Pennsylvania includes an article Anderson wrote about the stations. “They are very excited about it,” he said, noting that because the stations are more a Catholic than an Episcopal tradition, people from St. James, St. John’s and St. Edward’s, Lancaster’s other Episcopal parishes, have walked the stations at St. Thomas. Casting the parts In a 2006 interview for an LNP story about the stations, Maksymowicz, an observant Roman Catholic, said she cast the lightweight fiberglass sculptures from live body parts to depict, among other features, Jesus’ roped wrists, wounded torso and fallen knee. To represent the diversity of the “body of Christ,” referring to the church as one body, she used models of various ages and ethnicities, including Chinese, Argentinean, Irish, Polish, Sicilian, Ashkenazi and African-American. Mary’s hands are Maksymowicz’s in the fourth station, “Jesus meets his mother.” Jesus’ arms and legs belong to Abe Geasland, a sculptor formerly of Millersville. Jesus’ face — the only revealed face in the sculptures — is former F&M professor Josh Goldstein’s. The sculptures were made possible by a bequest from church member Gladys “Toni” Lehman, with the stipulation that it be used “solely for the artistic enhancement of the parish.” Maksymowicz, of Philadelphia, received the commission for the $27,000 project, which took five years to complete. While the sculptures are museum-quality works of art, the artist said she wants visitors to feel free to touch and rest their hands on them. And because she made them for a church setting, she antiqued them to blend with the brick walls. “The whole idea of art in a church setting is to enable the prayer life of the community,” she said. “When you go into a church, you focus on community and your relationship with God. ... You’re not there to focus on artwork.” More Headlines Lancaster police officers punched, stabbed with pen during incident at Farnum Park 31-year-old man remains in serious condition after Lancaster shooting Young archer Casey Kaufhold driven to meet lofty goals Police seek 19-year-old Berks County man for shooting 13-year-old boy in his home Press Table: Slow cooker sloppy joes make an easy dinner even simpler Sample a Taste of the River Towns at April 23 restaurant fair in Columbia Lancaster County lawmakers call for release of Stack report, independent Office of Inspector General Lancaster Watchdog: East Earl readers question manager's hiring; Brownstown traffic signal causes backup Tiny Town, a kid-sized indoor village powered by children's imaginations, to open in Lancaster Saturday 5 moments from the ninth annual LAUNCH Music Conference and Festival Peeples assesses Barnstormers' roster during Fan Fest game vs. Blue Crabs LancasterOnline Sections News Sports Business Features Entertainment Obituaries Celebrations Homes Opinion Editorials Letters To The Editor Special Sections Contests & Promotions Customer Care Contact Us Renew Subscription Pay Bill Vacation Delivery Stop/Restart Delivery Problems Submit News/Email Tips insider FAQs e-Newspaper Newsletters Careers at LNP Advertise LNP Rewards Program Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions LancasterOnline Commenting Guidelines More … Mobile iPhone Android Apps BlackBerry Email Tips Follow Us Classified Place an Ad Jobs Cars Classified Homes About Us lancasteronline.com 8 West King Street, PO Box 1328 Lancaster, PA 17608 Copyright © 2017 LancasterOnline.

Hold the applause. After gathering a handful of journalists to what I can only imagine is the company’s secret volcano lair, Apple copped to screwing up the trashcan-shaped Mac Pro, and vowed to do better. But what might a newer, more modular Mac Pro look like? “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY Designers at CURVED/labs took a stab at it. The conceptual design looks a lot like the Mac Mini, but in the best way possible. It features two slots for full-sized graphic cards — hello GTX 1080 — and an easily accessible area housing the processor, RAM, and storage. Perhaps most importantly, it can breathe. The fundamental flaw with the Mac Pro — aside from it being ignored for over three years now — was its design. The trashcan-shaped PC wasn’t built for upgradability, and even the parts it shipped with caused heat issues. In the artist’s rendering, the newer, Mac pro would have holes on top designed to allow hot air to escape, making this a far better option than the existing Mac Pro — even though it doesn’t exist. It’ll have Touch ID for power, a Touch Bar for… something, I’m sure, and ports out the wazoo: USB-C, USB-A, and HDMI. It’s sort of a Mac-lovers wet dream. I’d buy this right now. Sadly, though, we’ll all have to wait. Some rumors suggest the product won’t be done until 2019. It’s kind of odd, really, as the iPod — arguably Apple’s most innovative creation — was designed, manufactured, and shipped in all of nine months. Taking on the Mac Pro is a solved problem — PC gamers have been building high-powered rigs for years. I can’t, for the life of me, figure out how it can take this long to design a new PC. But, then again, does anyone ever truly understand what Apple is doing? via MacRumors CURVED/labs: der modulare Mac Pro on Curved Read next: Google brings in-browser VR to Cardboard AppleTech Share on Facebook (1345) Share on Twitter (228) Bryan Clark is a reporter from San Diego, CA.

Customers who need to replace their fourth generation iPad will now get a newer and more capable iPad Air 2 as a substitute from Apple Stores and authorised service providers, a media report said. Apple is doing this because the company has no stock left of the aging and now discontinued fourth generation iPad, 9to5Mac website reported on Saturday. Apple has also asked its staff to inform customers of the replacement unit’s colour and capacity. The iPad Air 2 introduced a new gold colour option, and has 32GB and 128GB storage options while 16GB and 64GB models were discontinued. This comes after the company announced the new iPad 5th generation last month without much fanfare. The new iPad is simply called iPad and replaces the iPad Air 2. All Apple has done with the new device is rename it and bump up the SoC to the A9 chip found in the iPhone 6s lineup. The more powerful iPad Pro lineup uses the A9X SoC. The new model is slightly thicker and fractionally heavier than the device it replaces. The iPad will be available in a 32GB and 128GB variant with Wi-Fi only or Wi-Fi + Cellular options. Prices start at $329 (around Rs 22,000) for the base Wi-Fi only model and can go up to $559 for the 128GB Wi-Fi + Cellular model (around Rs 37,000). Note that these are US prices. Apple does not have more stock for the iPad 4th generation as it has discontinued the device, and instead of refusing the replacement units the users may receive a slight upgrade in storage in addition to the device’s newer and more powerful internals overall.

 This trick lets you extend the warranty on your smartphone or laptop from 1 to 2 years for free Nathan McAlone Apr. 16, 2017, 8:30 AM 23,600 facebook linkedin twitter email print Justin Sullivan/Getty Images AppleCare+ can sometimes be a lifesaver, but it is, every time, annoyingly expensive. And yet even with the high price, when you are staring at your shiny new MacBook in the Apple Store and the salesperson reminds you it can break, many of us cave. "OK, yes, I would like to buy AppleCare+." It doesn't have to be that way. There's a simple trick you can use to get your manufacturer's warranty extended from one year to two years — and it doesn't cost you a cent. This trick not only works with MacBooks, but also with iPhones, cameras, or any electronic device with a warranty. The key is paying for your new gadget with the right credit card. The major credit cards — Visa, American Express, MasterCard, and Discover — all offer free warranty extensions in one form or another. But they aren't all equal. American Express is the one I've had experience with. AmEx's terms for warranty extension are generous. If you use any AmEx card to buy a product with a US manufacturer's warranty of five years or less (this doesn't mean that your product had to be made in the US), AmEx will provide an extra year. If it breaks during the second year, AmEx will cover the cost of repairs up to the amount you charged on your card — and technically to a maximum of $10,000. Here's my story: I bought a MacBook Air in 2012 and decided against getting any additional protection because, at the time, the price of the laptop itself seemed high enough. Fast forward a year and a half and my keyboard stops working for no discernible reason. I got AmEx on the phone to make an extended warranty claim. They spoke to me for a few minutes and then sent me this follow-up email: Nathan McAlone All I had to do was go to the Apple Store and get a repair estimate, then screenshot the receipt Apple had emailed to me when I originally purchased the laptop. A few days later I was approved, and I got a completely new keyboard for my laptop for free. And, as a side note, you would be appalled to hear how much Apple wanted to charge me for that keyboard repair (around $200). But you have to pick the right card. Visa is the trickiest. It only offers a warranty extension on its "signature" cards, but on those, it will extend the warranty (up to one year) on warranties of three years or less, according to its website. MasterCard also offers to extend your warranty up to one year, and Discover offers to extend it by one year for warranties of three years or less. MasterCard and Discover don't state any restrictions as to the type of card, but they say some could be excluded. This brings me to an important point: Always check with your credit card company before assuming your purchase will qualify. Some of them have fine print that could potentially exclude certain cards. They can also have exclusions for items that are still under "installment billing," so depending on how you are paying for your iPhone, it is good to check whether it is covered. But other than that, there is no reason not to take advantage of these plans. You could end up getting a free MacBook repair. EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Cars Image Source: Shutterstock Apple just got a permit to test driverless cars in California Chris Mills @chrisfmills April 14th, 2017 at 12:40 PM Share Tweet That Apple is doing something with autonomous vehicles is one of the worst-kept secrets in Silicon Valley. Rumors have circulated for years that Apple is planning some kind of car, and now we know for sure that a research group is testing something. The California DMV awarded Apple a permit to test autonomous vehicles in the state on Friday. Apple has not commented on the application for a permit, but a spokesperson instead referred to a previous statement that said Apple continues to invest in autonomous technology, AI, and machine learning. Don't Miss: The new MacBook Pro has a shiny new problem The obvious point here is that you don’t apply for a permit to test autonomous vehicles unless you actually want to test autonomous vehicles. This doesn’t remotely mean that Apple is building an Apple Car, just that it’s working on some kind of driverless technology. The majority of the companies that are permitted to test in California aren’t trying to build their own vehicle platform. Instead, most companies take an off-the-shelf car and attach some kind of sensor package, which is most likely what Apple’s doing currently. This is not the first confirmed interest that Apple has had in vehicles. The company attempted a takeover of McLaren, a British racing car company, late last year. Reports suggested that Apple initially considered making its own fully-electric car to rival Tesla, codenamed Project Titan. It sounds like that project ended, and Apple decided instead to focus on the technology side of car-making.

Macs & Mac OS X | 04 Apr 2017 | Print  | Comment (13) Apple Drops Cylindrical Mac Pro Prices by $1000 by Josh Centers It will be 2018 at the earliest before we see the redesigned Mac Pro that Apple has promised (see “Maca Culpa: Apple Admits Mac Pro Missteps and Promises More Transparency,” 4 April 2017), but if you need a cylinder-style Mac Pro in the interim, there’s some good news: Apple has rejiggered the configurations to provide existing higher performance options at lower prices. (These changes have been called a “speed bump,” but in our opinion, a speed bump requires the introduction of a faster CPU that was previously unavailable. In comparing the technical specs, it seems clear that all Apple did here was drop the prices on existing configurations.) For $2999, the new low-end configuration gets the specs of the previous high-end configuration, which equates to a $1000 price drop. It moves from a 3.7 GHz quad-core Intel Xeon E5 CPU to a 3.5 GHz 6-core Xeon E5 and from dual AMD FirePro D300 graphics processors with 2 GB of VRAM to dual AMD FirePro D500 graphics processors with 3 GB of VRAM. The new $3999 high-end configuration moves from a 3.5 GHz 6-core Intel Xeon E5 CPU to a 3.0 GHz 8-core Xeon E5. It too gets beefier graphics processors, trading dual AMD FirePro D500 graphics processors with 3 GB of VRAM for dual AMD FirePro D700 graphics processors with 6 GB of VRAM. These aren’t new options, and our best guess based on current prices is that this configuration also received a $1000 price drop. Oddly, given the fact that these are existing options, the Apple online store reports this configuration as “Currently unavailable.” Both models now feature 16 GB of RAM standard, up from 12 GB for the low-end model, with upgrades to 32 GB ($400) or 64 GB ($1200) available. They come standard with 256 GB of flash storage, and you can boost that to 512 GB ($200) or 1 TB ($600). For the ultimate performance, you can still upgrade to a 2.7 GHz 12-core Xeon E5 CPU ($2000). A tricked-out Mac Pro still costs a whopping $6999! Nor do any other specs change. Notably, the Mac Pro still relies on Thunderbolt 2, so you can’t connect new accessories like the LG UltraFine 5K Display. Besides the six Thunderbolt 2 ports, it still has four USB 3.0 ports, two Gigabit Ethernet ports, one HDMI 1.4 port, and yes, a 3.5mm headphone jack with optical digital output. For wireless connectivity, it features Bluetooth 4.0 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. These improvements aren’t likely to make anyone jump on the Mac Pro train, but if you need to buy additional units for your business in the near future, they’ll provide more performance for the money. For many desk-bound professionals, the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display is a better choice, and most of us here at TidBITS now use that machine.   Create a Squarespace website to launch your next idea.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Michael Lever  2017-04-04 17:43 I have a 27inch 5k retina display. When i switch off at the end of each day, the screen sometimes displays an array of coloured lines before finallty turning off. I say sometimes because it's random. Is this normal or a sign of problems to come? Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-05 10:48 I almost never actually power my 27-inch Retina iMac down (only when I go on vacation), so I'm not sure if this is in any way normal or not. I haven't seen what you describe, or at least not enough that it has registered. For the most part, there isn't much win in turning the iMac off as long as you let it sleep so it's using almost no power while it's not in use. Reply trippp  2017-04-09 23:18 The new iMacs seem to have an issue with the colored lines at shutdown. This is something the Geniuses thought Apple was working on. It seemed to me like an obfuscation, but at least it was an acknowledgment that someone thought there was a real issue that needed to be dealt with. In the past I have considered this sort of thing a sign of trouble. That was four months ago now and the issue is still with us. I chalk it up to yet another example of Apples thinking that a 25billion dollar Macintosh business is not really worth their time when there are iOS devices to be be designed and sold that bring in many times that figure. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-04-11 00:16 Adam, I've found from actual experience that on days I have my iMac powered down the most, I save electricity. I track my daily KwH consumption and normally I have my iMac powered up from about 7 AM to about 2 AM, or 19 hours. If I'm going to be gone most of the day, I power it down when I leave. Since I have it scheduled to power up at 10:30 PM and power down at 2 AM on the days I'm gone, it may only be on those 3.5 hours, saving me about 15.5 hours of energy. That savings shows in the daily readings. Sure it may only be a few KwH per day, but when you are paying 20¢/KwH the savings add up. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-11 10:13 An iMac uses about half a watt while turned off, and about 1.3 watts in sleep. So there's almost no difference in power usage and minuscule cost savings. Call it 20 watt-hours of usage for a day, or .02 KwH, which works out to less than half a cent per day. http://images.apple.com/environment/reports/docs/imac_27inch_per_may2011.pdf I'd have to do some testing with a power meter, but my suspicion is that the spike in power usage at power on might result in overall higher usage than regular sleep/wake cycles. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-04-13 11:27 Well, all I know is on days the iMac is off, my total daily consumption is at least 1 or 2 KwH less. Perhaps it is because with the iMac down, Time Machine and Carbon Copy Cloner can't run so my external TM and CCC drives never power up? We have to remember that peripherals are part of the "computer system" and when the "system control" is powered down the other elements are usually asleep. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-13 14:24 It sounds like your Energy Saver settings, or other tasks, were preventing the Mac from sleeping properly. Hard drives should be set to spin down there too, for just that reason. I don't have a sense of how much additional power would be used if you have Power Nap enabled, since that lets the Mac wake on its own periodically for certain types of tasks. Reply Laine Lee  2017-04-04 18:36 If you've ever seen Star Wars Episode I, you know that a communications disruption can mean only one thing: invasion. If you've followed Apple for a while, you know that a substantial price reduction can mean only one thing: imminent release of a new model. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-04 19:08 Except that they explicitly said that there would be no new Mac Pro this year. Sorry! Reply James  2017-04-06 09:27 This is the second site I've seen with this headline. They didn't drop the price, they bumped the specs up. The price for the low end machine is still the same as it was, and the price for the high-end is still the same... you just get slightly more power for your $ now. Reply Steve Nicholson  2017-04-06 10:09 Just like with relativity, it all depends on your frame of reference. If you're looking at it from the amount of money you're spending, it's a speed bump. If you're looking at it from the machine you're buying, it's $1000 cheaper. Both points of view are valid. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-06 12:07 As I said in the article, in our opinion, it's not a speed bump if there are no new configurations. Had Apple made a previously unavailable CPU available with a faster clock speed, that would be a speed bump. This is all three-year-old technology at lower prices. It's still welcome, it's just not the same thing. Reply Charles Jacobs  2017-04-08 09:01 Could this now be the super Mac mini that so many have asked for? Is the price still too high? I just checked - a fully decked out Mini is $1999!!! Certainly this is twice the performance.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: YouTube Galaxy S8 vs. original Galaxy S: From copying the iPhone to outpacing it Chris Smith @chris_writes April 12th, 2017 at 11:15 AM Share Tweet Apple announced the iPhone in 2007, and it soon became clear to Samsung that the iPhone was the device to replicate to succeed in the mobile business. The company has often been accused of copying everything about the iPhone with its Galaxy S phones. Lawsuits between the two revealed that “books” were written at Samsung about how to copy the iPhone, but this didn’t stop the huge conglomerate from continuing to get inspiration from Apple’s mobile creations. However, Samsung significantly improved its design game in recent years, and the Galaxy S8 is a culmination of those efforts. A comparison between the original Galaxy S and the Galaxy S8 shows how far we’ve come in just a few short years. Don't Miss: It looks like Samsung’s Galaxy S8 design might be even more impressive than the iPhone 8 The Galaxy S8 is probably the best-looking smartphone out there right now, thanks to its gorgeous Infinity Display and its curved design. The iPhone 8 is expected to feature a similar design, a rumor that actually predates all Galaxy S8 leaks — so in a way, Samsung already had a hunch this was going to be the next mobile design trend. The original Galaxy S was probably one of the best iPhone alternatives back in 2010, and it was the handset that helped Samsung conquer the smartphone business in the years that followed. Today, the Galaxy S is definitely not the phone you want to carry in your pocket, especially considering what 2017 smartphones can do. YouTube channel EverythingApplePro created a thorough comparison between the Galaxy S8 and the original Galaxy S that shows Samsung’s incredible progress over the years, and it’s a pretty fascinating video. Check it out below.

It's got the biggest screen and the thinnest body I have ever seen in a phone. It does so much more than my last phone. And its not even an Apple product. It takes better photos and the screen's eye-popping resolution definitely makes Netflix more cinematic. This changes everything, just as the advertising promised. Although perhaps not quite everything. The baby still wakes me up in the night. My ongoing battle with customer services about returning a faulty printer continues. Everything has not changed. Perhaps I should call advertising standards for misrepresentation. Pixabay 'This changes everything' has become an empty cliché. It was the advertising slogan for the first iPhone in 2007 and although it can be argued that Steve Job's combination of a phone and an iPod and an internet communicator was a major innovation, it has not solved world poverty or brought world peace. Yes, it was the most profitable product in history. But it could not cure the pancreatic cancer that took the life of its creator. Steve Jobs is dead. The visionary director of Apple who has left his mark on the world's of technology, music, software, movies and animation and lived his life with a desire to 'make a dent in the universe' is no longer with us. He ended up with nothing, just as he told his biographer Walter Isaacson: 'I saw my life as an arc and that it would end and compared to that, nothing mattered...You're born alone, you're going to die alone...And does anything else really matter? I mean what is it exactly that you have to lose, Steve? You know? There's nothing... I want to believe in an afterlife... That when you die, it doesn't just all disappear. The wisdom you've accumulated. Somehow it lives on... But sometimes I think it's just like an on-off switch. Click and you're gone. And that's why I don't like putting on-off switches on Apple devices.' I wonder if turning off any of your devices reminds you of your mortality? And yet if one of the wealthiest and most influential men in the world wrestled with his own mortality despite being surrounded by incredible wealth, a rapidly expanding business empire and fulfilling and innovative work, there's every reason for all of us to be thinking about life and death. Every person you see walking down the street, gathered round the coffee machine at work, standing at the school gate has to settle this issue one way or another. Is there something beyond the grave or is death the final switching-off? Unlike my new phone, the events on that first Easter Sunday really do change everything. If Jesus really did die, stay dead for three days and then not just resuscitate in the tomb but rise victorious from the dead, this really does reshape the essence of human existence. Advertisement Here are 10 things to start with: 1. Life is not futile. It really does have a meaning ( 1 Corinthians 15: 12-20). 2. Jesus' resurrection is just the beginning – we will all be raised ( 1 Corinthians 15: 20-23). 3. The sacrifice of Jesus for the sins of the world was effective ( 1 Corinthians 15:21-24). 4. Christianity has evidence unlike any other faith to support its veracity ( 1 Corinthians 15: 16-19). 5. There's more to life than the accumulation of wealth and pleasure ( 1 Corinthians 15: 29-34). 6. Death is not the last word ( 1 Corinthians 15:54). 7. Our work is purposeful ( 1 Corinthians 15:58). 8. Death is not an escape. We will all have to give account of ourselves before God ( Hebrews 9:27). 9. Jesus is declared with power to be the Son of God ( Romans 1:4). 10. Everything that Jesus claimed is true. I find it relatively easy to evangelise on behalf of my phone. I am convinced that its low-light photography is the best in its class. Chances are that even today I will find a way to drop that into conversation, or I will share a photo demonstrating its effectiveness on my Instagram feed. When I am having coffee with one of my colleagues or with a client and they spot my new phone, chances are that I have at least three reasons ready to give them as to why I decided to buy this particular model. But no product has changed the universe like the resurrection of Jesus. I am reminded to be quicker and more confident to spread the word about the resurrection. It really does change everything. Krish Kandiah's new book 'God is Stranger: What really happens when God turns up?' is published by Hodder (2017) and explores the challenging problem of why we so often we find it so difficult to recognise God and relate to him.

And after a lengthy stint in beta, the iOS 10.3 update is now available for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. As expected iOS 10.3 is a huge update for Apple’s mobile devices bringing new features, fixes and a ton of security patches with it. An iOS 10.3 release is confirmed. Today we want to take an updated look at the most important things to know about the iOS 10.3 update and its release. We’ll continue to update this roundup with new details so check back for frequent updates as we push into the month of April. iOS 10.3 Review We’ve downloaded the iOS 10.3 update on the iPhone 7, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 5. The iOS 10.3 update is massive, over 600MB for the iPhone 7, and the installation process took a lot longer than usual due in part to Apple’s new APFS file system. We didn’t run into any issues but the download/installation took upwards of 20 minutes on all of these devices so make sure you set aside some time to monitor the download and the installation. So far, we haven’t noticed any major problems with any of these devices. In fact, we’ve seen some nice improvements on the eldest device. Battery life is currently holding up on all four phones. We haven’t experienced any weird drain when in use or standby. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and cellular data are also stable. We’ve noticed some improvements to the iPhone 5’s boot speed and its UI. The user interface feels faster and more fluid than the previous versions of iOS 10. As of right now, iOS 10.3 is treating these three devices well and it’s recommended if you’re interested in iOS 10.3’s features, protecting your device from potential harm, or if you’re suffering from an unfixable iOS issue. If you’re doing fine on iOS 10.2.1, you might want to wait a few days for more long-term feedback to emerge. We’ll keep you posted. In the meantime, we’ve put together a list of reasons to, and not to, install the iOS 10.3 update right now. If you’re having an excellent experience on iOS 10.2.1 or below, we highly recommend digging into those reasons before making the move to iOS 10.3. iOS 10.3 Problems iOS 10.3 went through a lengthy beta but problems have slipped through the cracks. iOS 10.3 users are complaining about a wide range of issues including weird battery drain, issues with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, lag, random reboots, and issues with third-party apps. As of right now, these issues are isolated. They’re also extremely common after a major iOS update release. Most of these iOS 10.3 problems can be solved from the comfort of a computer chair at work or your home. If you’re seeing an issue after downloading iOS 10.3, take a look at our list of fixes. You’ll also want to report it to Apple so that its engineers can get to work on a fix. Downgrade & iOS 10.3.1 If you decide to download the iOS 10.3 update know that there is no longer a way to drop down to another official version of iOS 10. If iOS 10.3 is causing problems for you you’re stuck until Apple rolls out a new version of iOS 10. Apple’s no longer signing off on iOS 10.2.1 which means you can’t drop down to it if you’re unhappy with the iOS 10.3 update’s performance on your iPhone or iPad. Unfortunately, you can’t drop down to anything older than iOS 10.2.1 either. Also note that you can now “upgrade” to iOS 10.3.1. Apple’s released an iOS 10.3.1 update with bug fixes for iPhone and iPad. The update is tiny but it could have an impact on your device’s performance. For more on the iOS 10.3.1 update, take a look at our walkthrough. It goes over performance, problems, and more. Clips Now Available for iPhone & iPad A new feature, which requires the iOS 10.3/iOS 10.3.1 update is now available. Earlier this year, Apple announced a new Clips application. The company promised a release in April and Clips is now out on the App Store. Clips allows select iOS 10.3/iOS 10.3.1 users to create unique videos. It lets you combine video clips, photos and music that you can share via iMessage, Instagram, Facebook or another popular social networking platform. It also features Live Tiles which will let you create animated captions and titles using your voice. You’re then able to add effects like comic book filters, speech bubbles, shapes and full-screen animated posters. For more on Clips, take a look at our roundup. Clips isn’t available for the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or iPad 4. What’s Next Apple’s already confirmed the next iOS 10.3 update. The iOS 10.3.2 update is currently in beta ahead of an unknown release date. As of right now the update appears to be a maintenance release which means it’ll probably deliver bug fixes and security patches as opposed to features. While you might be tempted to try the iOS 10.3.2 beta ahead of time, be aware that Apple’s early software can cause problems. Issues with apps and services, connectivity, and battery life are common beta issues and we expect these, and other problems, to plague the iOS 10.3.2 update as it passes through the company’s beta program. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 7 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 11 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 11 11 Responses 01/10/2017 Stephen Reply Really a very terribly written article, with numerous grammar mistakes.

Reason is availability of jailbreak and different tweaks. 02/22/2017 Pavan Reply My iphone not have 10.3 update 02/26/2017 Paul Reply Any news on fixing the clumsy way email threads now appear? Previously, it was visually clear and quite functional. Now it’s a mish-mash jumble which Apple unbelievably continues to defend. 03/22/2017 CT Reply Man I really hope they bring back swipe to unlock, I hate pressing the home button. 03/28/2017 Tony Reply Funny, I wouldn’t be able to stand clicking then having to swipe again! One click with fingerprint recognition and it’s unlocked and you’re in, or on my air 2, two clicks on the home button. Job done. 03/29/2017 SD Reply I suggest that every iPhone users should backup their iPhone before the major system updates. Who knows what problems will happen! I backup my iPhone with MacX MediaTrans to prevent the potential data loss. And I think maybe you should also do it. Here’s how to backup iPhone with MacX MediaTrans https://www.macxdvd.com/mobile/how-to-backup-iphone-to-mac.htm 04/04/2017 Adam Reply If you are having problem update iPhone 5 to iOS 10.3 then you should check out the link below. I follow the link and it work well. https://youtu.be/xBy6WUnn08I 04/13/2017 RcR Reply The new update cleared my calendar 04/16/2017 Pete Reply From what I have read the update size of 10.3.1 is around 30 mg, but on both my iPhones the update size is over 600mg. Both my phones are on 10.3 so if anyone can con confirm this it would be appreciated . Thanks. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website  ×  six  =  54 Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Readers of Money Morning who acted on the Apple supplier stocks recommendations I made just four months ago have made as much as 55%. On Dec. 7, I shared seven Apple supplier stocks I thought would outperform broader markets. Each of these stocks had a high exposure to Apple – that is, a large percentage of their business comes from supplying Apple. My expectation was that as the hype over the upcoming iPhone 8 began to build, forecasts of blockbuster iPhone sales would follow. Because this year is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, the new models are expected to have at least one gotta-have-it feature that will spur a tremendous wave of upgrades. The anticipation of a big sales boost from the iPhone 8 has helped push Apple stock to new all-time highs in recent weeks. But I knew that as Wall Street came to realize how those higher sales also would boost the biggest Apple suppliers, their stock prices would rise as well. The biggest winner was InvenSense Inc. (NYSE: INVN), which is up a little more than 55% since I shared those suppliers with readers on Dec. 7. INVN stock jumped just days after that article appeared on rumors that Japanese electronics company TDK Corp. was in talks to buy InvenSense. The rumors proved to be true. TDK announced Dec. 21 its intentions to buy InvenSense for $13 a share, or $1.3 billion. There was some luck involved in that pick – a major acquisition deal is a quick road to profits – but of the seven Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) suppliers I recommended in December, six are in positive territory. Four (including INVN) are up more than 25%. New Report: Grow Your Wealth Effortlessly with These Five High-Yield Stocks Today I've got two more Apple supplier stock picks for you. First let's take a look at each of December's other winners. How Our Apple Supplier Stock Picks Have Performed Jabil Circuit Inc. (NYSE: JBL): Jabil makes iPhone casings and tends to be sensitive to Apple/iPhone news. Since Dec. 7, it's up about 35%. JBL stock has risen steadily over the past four months as talk of the iPhone 8 "supercycle" has ramped up. Jabil is also seeing growth from its non-Apple customers, which means this stock should continue to rise. Broadcom Ltd. (Nasdaq: AVGO): Broadcom stock is up 27% since Dec. 7. It makes the chips the iPhone needs for wireless communications. In February, an analyst for JPMorgan suggested Broadcom and Apple are collaborating on wireless charging technology, which could be a future catalyst for AVGO stock. And just two weeks ago we got more good news on the Apple-Broadcom front: the companies signed a three-year deal. That ensures Broadcom's chips will be featured in the iPhone for at least the next few product cycles. AEHR Test Systems (Nasdaq: AEHR): Apple is AEHR's largest customer; it tests the chips used in the iPhone. Over the past four months AEHR stock is up more than 25%. New features in the iPhone 8 will require new chips, which means more business for AEHR. Like Jabil, AEHR stock shows promise for continued gains. Knowles Corp. (NYSE: KN): Knowles stock is up about 13%. The company makes specialty microphones that go into the iPhone. Its tech helps make Siri possible. In addition to the extra sales the iPhone 8 will bring, Knowles is ideally positioned to gain business from the spread of voice assistant tech, such as Amazon.com Inc.'s (Nasdaq: AMZN) Alexa. Cirrus Logic Inc. (Nasdaq: CRUS): CRUS stock is up about 12% over the past four months. This company is one of the most dependent on Apple, with two-thirds of its business reliant on the tech giant. While Cirrus stands to get a big boost from the iPhone 8 in the year ahead, some analysts suspect that Samsung has included its noise-cancelling tech in the headphones for the Galaxy S8. Glu Mobile Inc. (Nasdaq: GLUU): Glu is the only stock in the group that has declined since we took a close look at these Apple suppliers. It's down about 3.5%. While not a supplier per se, Glu develops games and other apps for the iOS system that runs the iPhone and the iPad. Half its business comes from iOS products. Unlike the chip suppliers, GLUU won't see any benefit from the iPhone 8 until after customers buy it and start buying apps for their shiny new toy. Expect Glu stock to be higher by early 2018. Now here are the two Apple supplier stocks I promised you – one for investors who want a "safe" bet and a riskier one for investors looking for maximum gains… Two Apple Supplier Stocks to Buy Now Join the conversation.

(YouTube) One of the most anticipated redesigns of Apple’s upcoming flagship smartphone is the removal of the home button. However, iOS users have been conditioned to press the physical control option to activate their iPhone and switch between apps – leaving users to wonder how they will operate the iPhone 8. Read more: The rumor mill: A radical redesign for the iPhone 8? A new video has leaked online showing what claims to be the next-generation handset, and how users would work it without the home button. The clip has suggested that gestures could be used, or a digital home button that would be positioned towards the bottom of the display. Scroll down for videos    A new video has leaked online showing what claims to be the next-generation handset and how users would work it with the home button under the display. The clip has suggested that gestures could be used or the digital home button who be positioned towards the bottom of the display Although the iPhone 7 sold out within a week of hitting the market, many saw it as nothing more than a refreshed iPhone 6 – which has put some pressure on Apple to impress its users this year. Read more: Now you can add wireless charging to your iPhone And if all of the rumors that have been floating around the web are true, it seems the Cupertino company is pulling out all the stops for the iPhone 8 family. But the most talked about move is the removal of the physical home button, which will allow for an edge-to-edge screen. However, iPhone users are curious to how the new design would play out. Domenico Panacea, with macitynet, released a video concept showing two different ways the home button could be operated in the revamped design. The video begins with what could be, the iPhone 8, which boasts an edge-to-edge screen. The first scenario suggests that the home button will disappear once the phone is unlocked and a gesture is used to activate it again.  Users would press firmly on the left side of the screen to bring the feature back and are then able to swipe through pages to get back to the home screen. Another way is Apple could design the home button to always be visible. It would sit towards the bottom of the display with a row of apps placed above it – similar to where the physical home button is, but this design would place it on the screen. The iPhone 8 is said to be the best smartphone Apple has released, but because the firm is still working on ironing out the kinks, users may have to wait a little longer to get their hands on one. The news regarding a later shipping date was revealed by Economic Daily News (via Digitimes), which suggested Apple has yet to iron out all of the kinks in its highly-anticipated smartphone, reported 9to5Mac. 'Technical issues related to the lamination process of curved OLED panels, and the adoption of a 3D sensing system may cause the delay of the new iPhone devices,' said the paper. However, Apple has experienced manufacturing issues in the past, so have many other phone makers, but 9to5Mac has shared supporting evidence that suggests this time might be the real deal. A report from March revealed that the Cupertino firm would not start mass production of the so-called iPhone 8 until September. This was believed to be a result of Apple's custom fingerprint sensor that is set to replace the TouchID – the firm is believed to be building its own system and needed more time for manufacturing. It was suggested that Apple has passed over both the Synaptic's Natural ID touch fingerprint sensor and Qualcomm's Sense ID for the iPhone. It is, however, going with its own technology for a fingerprint recognition solution – Authentec algorithm combined with Privaris glass identification technology. 'Apple's in-house developed fingerprint ID solution will be fabricated at TSMC's 12-inch line using 65nm process technology, sources told DigitTimes in a March interview. Read more: Why it’s time to update your iphone LARGER BATTERY  Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has revealed that Apple plans to put a larger battery in the 4.7-inch iPhone 8.  Kuo explained that it will be designed with a 2,700 mAh battery - putting its battery capacity on par with the iPhone 7 Plus.      Another feature rumored to appear in Apple's next iPhone is a larger 'L' shaped battery (middle', which would put battery capacity on par with the iPhone 7 Plus Will use a 'substrate-like PCB mainboard', which will allow the firm to implement an OLED display in the flagship handset.  The new components are believed to be much more expensive in anything used in an iPhone before, which could increase manufacturing costs by 80 percent.  However, it was revealed last week that iOS users should expect to pay a hefty price tag for their next iPhone. The sources also said the move would push production for the OLED iPhone back until September, which means the handset will not go on sale until October. Another clue is that, according to 9to5Mac, Foxconn, a Taiwanese multinational electronics contract manufacturing company, has not shared as many leaks as it normally does around this time of year. 'By April, we normally see a flood of next-gen iPhone cases, schematics leak and blurry photos from the factory floor,' Benjamin Mayo with 9to5Mac wrote. 'This is yet to happen for iPhone 8.' 'Either Apple has tightened security to improve secrecy … or the devices are yet to be produced in mass quantities.' However, it is also believed that Apple will still go on with the event it holds every September, where it could just unveil the device – but hold off on the official launch. The firm might also just release the two minor-upgrade devices in September and leave the premium version for a later date. But with all the technology that is causing the highly-anticipated smartphones delays, users should start preparing themselves to pay $1,000 for their iPhone 8 when it does finally launch.  By Stacy Liberatore Join Albawaba Business Follow Albawaba Business © Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Trending in Apple WWDC Wishlist: How Apple Watch could improve with watchOS 4 this year Trending in Apple How to power the MacBook Pro with an eGPU using Nvidia’s new Pascal drivers Trending in Apple WWDC Wishlist: How iPhone and iPad could improve with iOS 11 this year Trending in Apple WWDC Wishlist: How Mac could improve with macOS 10.13 this year April 12 AAPL: 141.80 0.17 NYU student reports on life as an iPhone factory worker after 6-week undercover mission Ben Lovejoy - Apr. 12th 2017 4:27 am PT @benlovejoy iPhone Pegatron View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit You might expect an NYU student to seek out a summer internship doing something more interesting than spending 12 hours a day inserting a single screw into an endless production line of iPhones, but Dejian Zeng did exactly that for his summer project. He wanted to find out what life was like for workers in an iPhone factory, so spent six weeks as a Pegatron worker in a facility on the outskirts of Shanghai. He reported back on everything from the sleeping patterns to the need to download apps to qualify for free Wi-Fi access in the dorms … NordVPN In an interview with Business Insider, Zeng said that the typical working day, including overtime, short breaks and security checks was about 12.5 hours. 30 minutes to clear security to enter the factory 2 hours of work 10-minute break 2 hours of work 50-minute lunch break 2 hours of work 10-minute break 2 hours of work 10-minute break 2.5 hours of overtime The overtime is theoretically voluntary, Zeng says, but not so much in practice. The overtime thing, from my experience, it’s involuntary. You can’t leave easily. And then every time you ask, “Can I leave?” they would just say, “You have to work on the assembly line.” And so you know that every station needs to have somebody doing it. And if you leave, who is going to do it? It’s not easy to ask to not do overtime. It’s involuntary. I would say that’s the issue. Workers don’t have a choice. If I don’t want to work, if I’m really tired today and I don’t want to work, I can’t do that. I think that’s the issue. Even where workers actively seek overtime, he says, that’s due to financial pressure. Sometimes you hear about a worker who demands that “I want to work overtime. I want that money.” But they are being pushed to that path because the base salary is just too low. I can’t make a living without doing overtime, that’s why I “volunteer,” quote unquote, to do that. The factories know it also. The workers, too. They know that when you get into the factory, you need to do overtime to get your payment. Apple told BI that it requires its suppliers to limit working weeks to a maximum of 60 hours, and that audits – including no fewer than 16 at the factory where Zeng worked – showed 99% compliance. In its most recent Supplier Responsibility report, Apple said that compliance across its supply chain was 98%. Zeng says he suspects Pegatron has a way to hack the audits, but he doesn’t know how. I think they have a different standard during busy season and not busy season. I don’t know how the factory gets past the system where workers need to record their working time. Because when you go to work, you swipe your card. And my friend said they do swipe their cards when they work on Sunday. And I think it’s an obvious violation of Apple policy. I don’t know how the factory gets past that. Pegatron was, though, very sensitive when Apple staff were visiting. They tell you. They say, “The client is here.” They call Apple “the client.” Sometimes Apple staff comes to do an audit or something like that. They walk around the assembly line. They were always very serious about it, and we would be told, “The client is here.” Pegatron was serious about safety training, he said, because Apple monitored it carefully. But the company had a simple way to deal with tiredness. When the subfactory’s leader comes, they say, “Listen, are you pregnant? Raise your hand.” And then nobody did. And then he said, “If you think you are going to be too tired standing up, you can come up to me now.” […] And then nobody stood up. The reason […] is that if somebody stood up, they lost their job. He claimed that because Apple monitored worker evaluation of the company’s training, workers were told they had to rate the quality highly. It was a scale where one was the worst and five was the best. They said we could do four or five. And so everybody did four and five, and they submitted it. Zeng also said that opportunities for education and training were in practice limited by the hours people work. In the new report, they said a lot of workers get opportunities for training in some programs — they can develop their careers and stuff like that. But when you are working 12 hours, you are exhausted. And the only thing you want is some rest, and there’s not enough time for that. When it comes to time off, workers have access to Wi-Fi in the dorms where they live eight to a room, but need to either pay for it or download apps to qualify for free access. To access the Wi-Fi, you need to do something. You need to either download some apps for them or click something — comments or something — to earn some virtual coins. You use the coins to get on the Wi-Fi. Twenty-four hours is 20 coins. And then downloading apps sometimes are like 20 to 30 coins or something. So is it you can buy coins — like I remember it’s like 100 coins about 5 yuan, something like that. But a lot of people just keep downloading. It’s like a business. You need to need to do that to get access to Wi-Fi. The obvious suspicion here is that the system is being used to inflate download numbers for apps, presumably in return for payment to Pegatron. The work is repetitive, he said. At first it’s hard to keep up with the speed of the production line even carrying out a simple task, but eventually you can do it with your eyes closed. One of his jobs, he said, was to put a single screw into the speaker on the case. The first couple of days you’re very concentrated because you couldn’t catch up the speed of the assembly line. You need to be very quick to catch up. So you’re very, very focused. It makes you very tired, but it keeps your mind on it. You have no time to think about things. I need to get quicker and quicker. And then, after awhile, you get more familiar to it, and that in the end, I can even do this screw by closing my eyes. Workers are not allowed to bring electronic devices into the factory, so they cannot alleviate the boredom by listening to music or podcasts. He said that production of pre-production iPhones was easier but especially boring because of the slow pace. He worked on a trial production of the iPhone 7. Because one day for 12 hours, you only produce five phones. You sit there and have nothing to do, waiting for two hours. Sometimes they don’t allow you to speak. You just sit there quietly and have nothing to do, and wait until the next phone comes in. You’re trying to assemble it, and then you put it back and you wait for another few hours for the next one to come in. Zeng said that stories of the pay being really high by local standards weren’t true – the role was equivalent to being a security guard or housekeeper – but it is easy work to get. Because you need no skills, you just get into the factories. They don’t even ask you any questions. During the interview, you can just get in that day. And then they take care of your meals and your dorm. Zeng also joined the many people casting doubt on the idea that Apple could bring iPhone production to the USA. Chinese people are getting 2320 yuan, which is about $400 per month. How much are you going to pay for the US workers in terms of base salary? If it really happened, if factories actually really moved to the US, I won’t see it create a lot of jobs. I would see workers getting replaced by a lot of machines, because a lot of the work I see in the factory can actually be done by machine. The only reason why we do it is because the labor is even cheaper than the machine. The whole piece is worth a read.

Internally, however, Apple has taken things a step further and has been running a #CloseTheRings competition, offering free physical goods such as t-shirts and pins. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case As detailed in a report from French website WatchGeneration, Apple has internally organized a program offering retail and corporate employees physical rewards for filling their rings. It’s unclear when the program started and how often it is run, but Apple has recently been sending employees rewards for their involvement. Over the past few days, images have popped up on Instagram showing rewards such as t-shirts and different color pins. There appear to be three different levels of rewards as part of this program – bronze, silver, and gold. The t-shirt employees have received show an image of filled Activity Rings on the front and an Apple logo on the back. The program was organized internally and consists of 40,000 retail and corporate employees. It’s unclear, however, as to how many employees have been rewarded with a pin or t-shirt. The promotion is being run through the iOS app Challenges, developed by FitNow, a long time proponent of wellness and fitness. Apple employees have a unique code that they must enter in order to join the competition. The app is similar to the social component of the Activity app, with rankings and challenges between friends based on earned points. And of course, there is a reward at the end, in addition to the trophies … The t-shirts and pins received by Apple employees will no doubt become a hot item among Apple collectors. It’s also unclear as to just how rare these shirts are and how rare they’ll stay, as Apple may continue the program through the coming months. View some images of the goodies Apple employees receive as part of the promotion in the Instagram posts below.

The prediction was made by Credit Suisse analysts, who said that the company was at ‘moderate to high risk’ of losing its Apple contract. The prediction follows Apple’s warning that it plans to stop using Imagination Technologies GPUs within two years, causing the company’s stock to drop dramatically, and a separate report suggesting that Apple also planned to drop Dialog as a supplier … NordVPN Synaptics acquired the display driver chip technology from Renesas in 2014 in a $475M buyout. It had been rumored at the time that Apple might buy Renesas directly, but Reuters reported that those talks failed. Apple may not have been best pleased with Synaptics when the company announced in 2015 that it would be making force-sensing touchscreen controllers for Android smartphones just a month after the announcement of 3D Touch on the iPhone 6s/Plus. Business Insider saw the analyst note from Credit Suisse which attempts to predict which current Apple suppliers are most at risk of losing their contracts as the company moves more deeply into in-house chip design. The analysts highlighted the fact that Apple has hired a ‘significant number’ of former Renesas engineers. Synaptics (SYNA, Sector Weight) Risk: Medium to High. We see moderate to high risk of Apple looking to insource its display driver IC, given (1) as we previously noted, Apple has hired a significant number of former Renesas RSP engineers, and (2) we believe Apple has been developing its own internal OLED DDIC. We believe Samsung will use its own internal DDIC for the OLED iPhone and Synaptics for the next- generation LCD smartphones. Why would it make sense? By optimizing and using its internal solution, Apple could optimize power and performance with its internal graphics engine. Additionally, it would lessen its reliance on Samsung for OLED displays. Cirrus Logic was felt to be at ‘medium to low’ risk of losing its Apple business, while RF Suppliers and Skyworks Solutions were considered at low risk. Apple’s increasing focus on in-house chip design lends further weight to the idea of eventual ARM-powered Macs using Apple-designed CPUs.

Will it stick with a design similar to the current cylinder, aka the trash can? Or perhaps it will return to a more classic Mac tower or box design, or something new entirely, in order to accommodate the machine’s so-called “modular” design that will allow easy upgrades for key components. Imagining the possibilities, the folks over at Curved.de put together the concept below. The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac The concept takes a form-factor somewhere between the Mac mini and a smaller version of Apple’s old “cheese grater” Mac Pro design. The box includes side doors that can swivel and rotate to open, 2 slots for full-size graphics cards, replaceable hard disks and SSD drives, and, well… a slot for replacing just about everything. There aren’t a ton of specifics or suggestions on how this would be achieved in such a box, but we can only dream that Apple is reaching for something similar when it said “modular.” The concept also has an SD card on the front, and USB-C, USB, FireWire, LAN, and HDMI on the back. We’re not sure the integrated Touch Bar on the front of the machine makes a lot of sense, but Apple’s new iMac coming later this year is said to include a new keyboard and we’d love to see the touch screen come to a standalone Apple keyboard like the company detailed in a recent patent. To go along with its vision of what a new modular Mac Pro might deliver, Curved also imagines what a new Apple Display could look like. Apple confirmed this month that it will return to making external displays alongside the new modular Mac Pro. That news came after reports that Apple was exiting the standalone display business following its decision to promote LG-made displays as official options for its new MacBook Pro.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software How to Increase Apple Watch Haptic Feedback Intensity By Uzair Ghani Apr 12, 2017 8Shares Share Tweet Submit Here’s how you can increase the haptic feedback intensity of your Apple Watch so that you never miss a notification ever again. watchOS Lets You Increase the Haptic Feedback Intensity of Your Apple Watch – Here’s How The Apple Watch is a wonderful little extension of your iPhone, allowing you to quickly glance at notifications and take actions without having to whip out your smartphone from your pocket. However, if the haptic feedback intensity is set to a bear minimum on your Apple Watch, then missing out on something important can become fairly common in your daily routine. In order to combat this problem, the best thing to do is increase the haptic feedback intensity while also enabling the built-in Prominent Haptic feature. The latter, when enabled, will pre-announce certain notifications using a heavy vibration pattern, ensuring you don’t miss anything at all. Related Fix iPhone Personal Hotspot Not Working Issue – How to Tutorial 1. On your Apple Watch, press the Digital Crown to go to the home screen, then open the Settings app. 2. Scroll down and then tap on Sounds & Haptics. Advertisement Related How to Activate YouTube Dark Mode in Windows 10 & macOS 3. See that Haptic Strength slider? Crank it up to number 3, and also tap to enable the Prominent Haptic feature. From here on in, whenever you receive a notification, you’ll feel a heavy buzz on your wrist. This is a good thing obviously, since you won’t be able to miss anything at all. But the obvious downside of this feature is that it may affect battery life to some extent, given how much notifications you see pouring in on a daily basis. Still, it shouldn’t be too drastic at all. It’s best to experiment around a little before achieving the optimal level of haptic feedback on your Apple Watch for daily use. It would have been great if the Apple Watch had a built-in feature for creating custom vibration patterns, much like how you can create one on an iPhone for incoming calls. But given how small the device is, I’m sure Apple has its reasons for omitting such a thing. If you found the above guide useful, then be sure to let us know about it in the comments section below.

Follow him on Twitter and Google+ Apple Music has been on Android for a while now, and it's now on par with its iOS counterpart. When Apple acquired Beats Music as part of its takeover of Beats, the service went away and was replaced by Apple Music. Windows is still out in the cold, but Apple surprised us by creating an Apple Music app for its main competitor, Android. Apple Music on Android has, until very recently, had its own identity that fit in with the platform it calls home. Recent updates have brought it into line with what you'll find on iOS, so it's time we took a fresh look at it from across the mobile nations (see what I did there?) and see what it looks like from an Android user's perspective. Almost identical siblings Apple Music on Android has had a visual overhaul which brings it straight into line with the iOS version. So we're looking at a lot of white, some red accents, and very bold headers. The biggest visual difference is in where you find the navigation bar — Android prefers a hamburger menu over Apple's static bar running across the bottom, so your app sections are tucked away on Android. If anything, hiding that stuff actually makes the Android app look a little better. It's a little cleaner, with no additional on-screen clutter. Everything you need is always just a swipe away. Lyrics for your songs are present and correct. Just scroll down in the player and you'll see an option to show them if you want to sing/rap/shout along. Aside from font differences and the placement of things like the volume bar, the two apps are about as identical as you could hope for. Apple has given the Android app the look of iOS, but without taking away important platform specifics, like navigation or the playback widget you'll find in the notification area. So. Much. Content. The iTunes catalog is gigantic. There's no other way of putting it. Apple Music isn't just a mass of albums, artists, and songs, either. Connect is a social feature you'll either enjoy or completely ignore, but it does what it sets out to do by bringing you a little bit closer to your favorite artists. Everyone knows how much music you can get through Apple, but the real story is in the curation. If you can't find a curated playlist that hits the right notes for you on Apple Music, you won't find one anywhere. You tell the app from the get-go what sort of music you like, which then pulls up plenty of suggestions to get your head banging (or the pop music equivalent). Generally speaking, if music is available for streaming, you'll find it on Apple Music. There will always be exceptions, but those are the minority. Beats 1 brings the noise If you're into Beats 1, you can listen to it on Android, too. Just open Apple Music on Android and tune right in. You'll find the same live and on-demand content as you would on iOS. Whether you like Beats 1 or not is a different question for a different day, but it's here, complete with all the Zane Lowe you can handle. Beyond Beats 1, you'll also find Apple's curated radio stations. If you don't know what to listen to, Apple will do the work on your behalf. Should you use it? If you like Apple Music already there's absolutely no reason to switch away if you move over to an Android phone or tablet. It's a harder sell, however, to convince someone who doesn't use any Apple products to jump on Apple Music on Android. There's so many alternative choices out there. Google, Microsoft, Spotify, Pandora, Tidal; if there's a streaming music service in the world, it's available on Android (I know, I know, it's probably on iOS, too). But Apple Music has a lot going for it with a huge catalog, excellent curation, a well designed app and a family subscription plan. Android users shouldn't turn up their noses just because the Apple name is over the door, that's for sure. Underneath, Apple Music has recycled everything that made Beats Music so good before it was swallowed up. There's a free trial available. Everyone should at least give it a go. It's one of the best music services around, regardless if you prefer Apple or Android.

So about five seconds' worth then. 0 4 days ago Reply fittobeknitted Was there a magic change just recently? Apple Music on Android is pure awful. Half the time, the music wouldn't play. You would download a song to your device, only to have the device say the song wasn't downloaded. Then later, it would show it downloaded. Then, even on wifi, it would just skip songs randomly. No reason why. The experience using Apple Music on Android and iOS are DRAMATICALLY different. Just because the apps look identical doesn't mean they perform similar. 0 4 days ago Reply DannyJJK I believe most of these issues have been fixed now 0 3 days ago Reply bobbob1016 Don't they prevent you from starting an account on Android? As in it could only be created on iOS? Google Music lets you sign up from iOS, but does the 30% upcharge that Apple charges them. Apple could at least let you sign up from the phone. My main dislike for this is that it seems all of these music apps try to force their choices on me. I just want a stupid music app that lets me put my songs on it, and play those easily. I don't want 5 taps to get to my music, I want 5 taps to get to their "curated" list as I use that a lot less. 0 3 days ago Reply DanRJones91 I know it's probably fine now, but I used it using the initial 3-month period (the enforced beta they marketed as a "free trial") and it put me right off Apple Music since then. I just can't trust their services. 0 2 days ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

By Serenity Caldwell Wednesday, Apr 12, 2017 at 12:01 pm EDT 19 Comments Serenity is the Managing Editor at iMore. She's been talking, writing about, and tinkering with Apple products since she was old enough to double-click. In her spare time, she sketches, sings, and in her secret superhero life, plays roller derby. Follow her on Twitter @settern. The fitness company has the vision, but it has been struggling with products and engineering as of late. I've wanted to love Fitbit since long before the Apple Watch: I bought my first tracker (a Fitbit Zip) in 2012, in theory to help me stay active while working from home — but secretly because I wanted to see if a step tracker could track roller derby. I quickly found my answer: not if you don't plan to kill it with sweat in a few practices. After my unfortunate experience with the Zip, I stayed abreast of Fitbit's offerings at work but didn't have the spare cash to justify getting one for personal use. And, of course, once I got an Apple Watch, any Fitbit hardware lust I had faded into the distance. Muddling the message The thing is, I still love Fitbit's message and community; it was one of the first companies to really capitalize on everyday fitness, focusing on getting people moving daily without needing to be a gym nerd. Like the Tamagotchi craze of the 90s, Fitbit made tracking your steps an obsession — and one that you could share with your friends. Fitbit's excellent app made connecting to your smartphone a piece of cake and viewing your data even easier. But Fitbit struggles with retention. If people don't get hooked on the social network aspect or find enough value in the data, it's not unusual to see a user's Fitbit find its way to an abandoned drawer after a few months. Unfortunately, in chasing the holy grail — a tracker with enough valuable data to continually keep users hooked — it appears that Fitbit has lost its focus. I look at the product line now and my head hurts: I can figure out from sizes that these accessories are organized by least expensive to most, but beyond that, if I'd never heard of the Fitbit line, I wouldn't have the least idea which product to buy. The Zip kind of looks like a Tamagotchi, so I'd assume (as a stranger) that it would track steps; both the Blaze and Surge kind of look smartwatch-y; and the One, Flex 2, Alta, Alta HR, and Charge 2 are… all bands with various thicknesses that probably track things? Which Fitbit should you buy? From a consumer perspective, the whole line feels disorganized and split: Instead of adding new features to existing products, Fitbit has slowly grown its product line to encompass a sextet of circular bands and two clip-on trackers, all of which have slightly different features. From the main page alone, I don't know who these bands are for. I don't know why I should buy them as a fitness newbie or a pro. The dropdown menu is a bit better, categorizing each into their main features, but I still don't know why I'd get an Alta over a Flex 2. It's not until the product's individual page that you really get a sense of each's strengths and weaknesses: the Alta has a screen and HRM-enhanced sleep tracking over the Flex's lack thereof; the Charge has GPS and fitness level tracking while the Alta HR just adds a heart rate sensor. But even there, I look at Fitbit's lineup and I shake my head. The Flex, Alta, and Alta HR are separated in price by $49.95 ($79.95 if you go for the HR's special color editions). Are users so fickle that they need three different price points for tiny extra features (sleep tracking and heart rate)? Company in crisis As much as it pains me, a lot of balls in the air does not a professional juggler make. And Fitbit is a company made up of a lot of moving parts. It's trying to compete in software with its Fitbit social app and Fitstar and Fitstar Yoga exercise programs. It targets casual fitness users with the Zip, One, Flex, and Alta. The Alta HR, Charge, and Surge offer advanced fitness tracking, while the Blaze offers a cheaper alternative to the fitness smartwatch. It's even supposedly working on Beats X- and Jaybird-style exercise headphones. In theory, having many active products in development isn't necessarily a terrible thing; diversifying allows you to keep from ending up a one-hit wonder. But Fitbit's current line isn't so much trying to diversify as it is lacking focus. In trying to constantly capture the fitness narrative, the company has been repeatedly reinventing the wheel — building product after product from scratch without taking lessons and workflows from the previous model. Sales flagged in 2016, despite the company's two newer high-end trackers, the $200 Blaze smartwatch and $150 Charge 2 (which iMore writer Luke Filipowicz previously described as "a fitness tracker on steroids"). Though Fitbit shipped over one million Blaze trackers a month after its official release, by the end of the year Fitbit had to let 107 employees go due to Q4 earnings losses. I had hoped that this served as a wakeup call for Fitbit. At the end of March, Fitbit formally reorganized its leadership team, with Chief Business Officer Woody Scal and EVP of Interactive Tim Roberts departing the company; both had joined the company in its early days. Roberts oversaw software and design, including many of Fitbit's social projects and third-party integrations. The company also promoted Samir Kapoor to Senior Vice President of Device Engineering (from his former VP role), and hired a new EVP of Operations, Jeff Devine, to "[streamline] the integration between firmware, hardware and advanced R&D, with the goal of speeding up the company's product development process." In addition, Fitbit announced that it was focusing its products around two major categories: Consumer Health and Fitness, and Enterprise Health (focusing on providing more accurate health tracking data to insurance companies and other health providers). Whatever changes have been made internally, however, they have yet to affect the company's external presentation. Fitbit still has a lineup replete with different trackers. Spring 2017's Alta HR tracker replaced the older Charge HR, but both the original Alta and Charge 2 remain active products. Additionally, Yahoo Finance reporter JP Mangalindan claims that the Fitbit Blaze's smartwatch successor continues to be riddled with delays, pushing launch back to Fall 2017 at the earliest. "In one of the more final prototypes, the GPS wasn't working because the antennae wasn't in the right place," one of those sources told Yahoo Finance. "They had to go back to the drawing board to redesign the product so the GPS got a strong signal." Fitbit's design team also ran into problems making its smartwatch fully waterproof, even though that's a key design element for the Apple Watch Series 2. Indeed, it's still unclear as of the publication of this article whether the device will launch with the waterproof feature. If it isn't waterproof, critics may perceive it to be an inferior product to Apple's — especially given that the device will launch roughly a year after the Apple Watch Series 2. Mangalindan also reports that the watch will have a similar build to the rather clunky Blaze, which — like many smartwatches before it — wasn't great for small wrists. Fitbit's desire to continue to compete with the Apple Watch makes sense from a logical perspective: As one of the originators in the tracking space, the company sees the potential for both profit and adding more fitness professionals to its community. And this isn't the first time a Fitbit product has been delayed; almost all the company's trackers have had internal hardware hiccups that required dropping features before launch. But in throwing so many resources at this one problem — an issue that Fitbit may not even be well-equipped to solve — the company is neglecting what made it popular in the first place: simple, easy, and fun fitness tracking. The power of fun fitness Like Apple, Fitbit's strongest asset is in its software. The Fitbit app is fun to use and builds community and camaraderie amongst your friends; at the end of 2016, Fitbit reported 23.2 million active users and claimed the title of the largest social fitness network in the world. Additionally, Fitbit's 2015 Fitstar acquisition provided the company with the resources to help its users train and see measurable improvement. Between its scientific resources, social network, and training options, Fitbit has the potential to deliver users (and companies) with smart, specific data that truly helps them improve their lives. But for the company to be able to process that data, people either need to be using Fitbit hardware, or Fitbit needs to change its policies about hooking into third-party systems like the iPhone's Health app or the Apple Watch. Ultimately, if the company plans to continue in the fitness space, it needs to distinguish itself from its competitors and prove what makes Fitbit a brand worth buying. The company may not currently see smaller startups like Misfit as a threat, but if they keep iterating while Fitbit stays stagnant, there will soon be a problem. For instance, Misfit's newest tracker, the Flare, takes direct aim at the Zip, One, Flex, and Alta. Like Fitbit's entry-level tracker, it's just $59.99 and offers up to four months of battery life, but also offers a capacitive touch screen, a sleeker look on your wrist, water resistance to 50 meters, taggable activity types, and sleep tracking. It also offers limited functionality with your phone, letting you customize its side button to control devices or snap a photo on your phone. To get all of these features in a Fitbit, you'd need the $130 Alta. Worse, the $59.99 Zip looks positively archaic when compared to Misfit's newest tracker. But anyone can make a new low-end tracker. What's most interesting is Misfit's software pitch: You can upgrade the water-resistant Flare to track your swimming laps with an in-app purchase. On its own, it's a tiny gimmick, but in the larger scheme of the world, in-app purchases and subscriptions have proven extremely successful at continuing to hook users into an ecosystem where they might otherwise have gotten bored or tired of the product. Where does Fitbit go from here? Right now, Fitbit still has the edge with its software and community, but that's not going to last if the company isn't careful. There is so much potential in an interconnected device that helps you actively manage your fitness and health, but trackers have so far publicly focused on gamification and data fetishization — challenge your friends, track your steps. Fitbit has a ton of smart people working on making the software more powerful, and the company's venture into Enterprise Health makes me think executives are aware of the potential power of health data on a companywide scale. But the company isn't alone. Apple and Google have both put significant resources into building their health and fitness teams, hiring doctors and engineers to better understand how people can track their information, visualizing it effectively, and what parts are most important. If Fitbit can't figure out how to balance its software, entry-level hardware, and smartwatch goals, it may well be relegated to a drawer — eclipsed by the Apple Watches, Gears, and even Flares of the fitness world.

What Fitbit (or Apple Watch) measures (outside a few vertical applications) is relatively meaningless. Unless you're doing things right (both with exercise, but especially diet) the biggest impact is between some movement, and no movement. I suppose in that regard... for the person who formerly sat in a chair for 12 hours, being reminded to get up and walk around every hour or two will make *some* impact. Do we really need a Fitbit (or Apple Watch for that?!). However, if this is really about health, beyond the above, than a LOT more focus needs to be placed on correcting diet. And, then where exercise is concerned, it's doing a small to moderate amount of the *right* kind (which a Fitbit or Apple Watch is unlikely to help much with). 5-10 minutes of strength training or high-intensity exercise is more valuable to health than running a marathon each week. (In fact, the latter can actually be dangerous or detrimental.) Our bodies aren't simplistic calorie machines. The eat less, exercise more as a generality is a fallacy. It's about the right kind of exercise and hormones. If you really want to make a health impact, it's about education, lifestyle shift, and THEN a bit of the right kind of exercise. I suggest following this resource: http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/podcasts/ Since it's a podcast, you can even get that education in while you're doing your Fitbit steps. :) 0 4 days ago Reply Coffee4ever I have a lot of apple products and have been thinking about the Apple Watch but its way too expensive for what I needed. I'm just getting back into being active and needed something simple to track my heart and steps. The Alta HR just came out, so I got that and I've been very happy with it. The battery last me for a week and I enjoy the sleep tracking as well done with the app. It does just enough for what I need. I didn't need all the Apple Watch does or its short battery life. The Alta HR is small and light and I often have to check my wrist to see if I'm still waring it. Since it feels like its not there. The Alta HR is helping me. I haven't been active in 3 years or hardly on my feet due to health problems. So I want to see how my heart is doing. The Alta HR tracks my heart all day and night. I am grateful for this tool and it is helpful to me. Its just what I needed. 0 4 days ago Reply Fred Stein Fitbit may suffer from what I call "first mover disadvantage", similar to MySpace and Yahoo. Also, from what I've seen tech in sports holds great promise, but remains fragmented. As fitbit tries to grow, each segment will be crowded leaving little room for attractive margins and growth. 0 4 days ago Reply RayGorman FitBit lost a lost of credence when the Charge models were shabbily built and fell apart after a few months. Even the Charge HR that replaced it suffered from the same issues. It was cheerfully replaced by Fitbit after 6 months- the FIRST time, but since they clock the warranty from ORIGINAL pair date, when the second one fell apart 7 months after that, it was now out of warranty. I complained and reminded them that the wristband issue was a KNOWN problem for quite awhile and I would be taking our business elsewhere in future. Surprisingly, they "reconsidered" their position and is now sending a THIRD device. The glut of models can't help either with quality control since they're trying to get the latest out there before they might be ready and fully tested. US car makers had the same problems in the past. Too many models and combinations of equipment almost doomed any chance at quality. 0 4 days ago Reply badMojo69 I've owned several Fitbit devices and IMOP they suck.

They have amazing software, great community, and even better stats to keep you motivated. Can't say the same about the hardware. Their Charge trackers are awful as the bands don't last long enough. I switched to the Blaze now and like it a lot. Surely it lags far behind Apple Watch, but for what I want (battery life and very detailed stats, including amazing sleep stats) these products don't even compare. Not really interested in Apple Watch. Not into fashion. I'm interested in functionality. 0 4 days ago Reply Richard Azia UV exposure tracking would be a good move. As Spring moves towards Summer people who spend a lot of time in offices are going to go out in to the sun and get sunburned. A fitness tracker that knows how much UV radiation you've been exposed to and warns you would be interesting. I saw that withings is tracking oxygen level with one of their devices. Another device maker tracks respiration rate. I am not sure that community is the biggest seller for fitbit. When you rock climb, cycle, swim or practice other sports Fitbit does not know unless you use the app and tell it. It's a shame that none or at least most devices are not waterproof. I upgraded from one device to another because I wanted to track floors climbed and then I wanted to update because I wanted to track sleep. Fitbit could expand their community reach by allowing people to track steps via mobile phones. They're missing out on a larger user base. 0 4 days ago Reply eloise_UK How can you talk about Fitbit without asking where their acquisition of Pebble fits in? 0 4 days ago Reply rednocturne307 My thoughts exactly! 0 4 days ago Reply MoreData Agreed. I was waiting for my Pebble Time 2 to arrive when Fitbit snatched them up. The dropped the the Pebble hardware which real shame. The Pebble 2 and Time 2 were real smartwatch/fitness combo that put the Blaze to shame. Waterproof, heart rate monitor, 10 day battery life. The Pebble worked with Apple and Android. Fitbit could have integrated the Pebble with their phone apps and released them under the FitBit brand and we wouldn't be reading this article. 0 3 days ago Reply Caymancroc "How does Fitbit find its way back to fitness and financial success?" Simple answer...it doesn't. It is what I call drawer tech. Total fad and stupid. After initial excitement wears off, these are found in a drawer years later without charger and no way to hook up. Data they produce is mostly useless. Eat right and workout. Not hard to figure it out. I still can't believe people fall for and pay for this gimmicky BS. 0 4 days ago Reply GilbertBJ I have a Charge HR and the quality is simply horrible. I found out on the discussion group I am not the only one: a flood of complains. The band lasts like 6 months and breaks, among other problems. Makes most users run away from the brand. The software and app are OK but quality... 0 4 days ago Reply divyan Honestly I don't have anything against Fitbit and some of their trackers are kind of cute. But when it comes to utility, most of their products fall flat - except their ageing original Charge. However for me Charge is too boring .I have waited eagerly for Blaze, and kind of liked it when it announced. But I was disappointed by the lack of GPS and 'real' water resistance. Same is the case for Charge 2. Now I use a Garmn Vivosmart HR Plus for daily use and Vivoactive HR whenever doing some serious activity. I would like a tracker from FitBit if it is 1. Seriously waterproof 2. GPS enabled. 3. Count stairs climbed. 4. Counting less 'false' steps ( counting car gear changes as steps). 5. Reasonably sturdy. I have had a look at fitbit appication, and really liked the simplicity of it. So, please Fitbit. Make use of the expertise when you acquired Pebble and produce a kick-*** fitness tracker. 0 3 days ago Reply quakerotis Devices don't help people get healthier, smarter or better looking. 0 3 days ago Reply inietop I think that Fitbit story would resemble the rise and fall of many other companies that were swallowed by Apple & Google giants and their incredible capacity of spreading their tentacles to areas that compliment or enrich their business. Previous examples were Palm (hand held devices), Nokia (mobile phones) or, maybe accidentally and much more surprisingly, Kodak. Another example could be Spotify, in a near future. Apple and Google are now including in their mobile ecosystems frameworks to collect and use health data, and many manufacturers are building devices to integrate with these frameworks, which make Fitbit competitive position weak, not only in its software proposition, but also in the hardware (big companies are now in the health game such as Garmin, Samsung and Apple). The golden days are over for this company. 0 3 days ago Reply nyc_rock I honestly think fitbit would be best off being bought by Apple or Google. Either that or make their software compatible with the Apple Watch or Android Wear. They have a huge user base, if they could keep people using their software, that has to be better than this downward spiral. Fitbit's hardware is either one dimensional, exercise tracking only, or, is a poor excuse for a smartwatch. I want something that ticks all the boxes. The Apple Watch does it. I use the watch for its basic notifications and then use runtastic for my fitness tracking. I would much prefer using fit bit software though, as I think its much better, but not good enough for me to wear two devices. There is only so much "share of wrist" and Fitbit has lost its relevance. 0 2 days ago Reply A Danz FWIW, I still love my Fitbit One and I wear it clipped to my shirt or in a pocket, despite wearing an Apple Watch. Why? Because I do a lot of my walking (an hour or more a day) at a treadmill desk, and my wrist is steady enough that I don't get 'credit' for a bunch of my steps... But the Fitbit gets them all! Also because the Fitbit, unlike the Apple Watch, has a good handle on 'gamification', comparing my 7-day average step count with my (1-2 dozen) Fitbit friends; supporting "step challenges" for a workweek, a day, a weekend, etc. As for product quality... I bought my Fitbit One back in November 2012 and I'm still wearing it, though it DOES appear to be dying - it won't sync with my phone or iPad until I reboot it, for a few days this week... And when it gets into that state, it drains the battery in 9-10 hours. Frustrating. But I ordered a new one on Ebay and it'll be here early next week... :) 0 2 days ago Reply khkeet I have had the Charge2 for around 4 months, and I have to say I like it a lot. I got it on sale ($109 vs $149), which was a plus! I did not want to spend big bucks on the AppleWatch- which for me is too big, too expensive, and does more than I care to do with my "watch". With the Charge2, I get fitness info, and more. I love the notifications from my text and phone, so I don't have to take my phone out to see who is calling, and can quickly ready most texts to decide if I need to dig out my phone to respond. The silent alarms are a gentle way of waking up (although if I have to be up really early, I do set a separate alarm for 5 minutes after the silent one goes off!), the reminders make me aware of how little I sometimes move while sitting at my desk, and the step tracking and calorie burning helps me stay on track every day. I am disappointed in the latest software/firmware release where they have been touting better sleep analysis for a couple of months, but it isn't actually available (even though their marketing materials say it is). That just frustrates current owners and causes potential new owners to give pause to purchasing the device. I hope they find a way to come back to success, as I think they have some good devices, and I like the price point for what you get. 0 20 hours ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Fortunately, retailers like Amazon are here to ease the financial pain of buying Apple's top-of-the-line machines. Currently, the online giant offers the 2015 15.4-inch MacBook Pro for $1,799.99. That's $200 under the Apple Store's direct price and the cheapest price we've seen for this laptop since it launched in May of 2015. (Excluding refurb prices). This media powerhouse packs a 2.2-GHz Haswell Core i7 quad-core processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. Unlike the 2016 MacBook Pros with Touch Bar, the 2015 MacBook Pro has all the essential connectivity you need including two Thunderbolt 2 ports, two USB ports, HDMI, and an SD card reader. If $1,799.99 still seems like a lot — or if you don't need that much horsepower — Amazon also has the current-gen 13.3-inch MacBook Air with 128GB SSD for $799.99 and the 13.3-inch MacBook Air with 256GB SSD for $999.99. In both instances, the machines are $200 cheaper than Apple's price and the best deals you can currently find for these ultraporables, which — despite having dated tech and no Retina display — are still solid picks for students and other cash-strapped Mac fans who value portability and battery life over raw power. 6 Reasons to Still Buy a MacBook Air Best Apple Laptops 2017 Best Laptop Deals of Today Add a comment Email Firstname Name Comment Back to top Find a Review All Categories Laptops Tablets Accessories All Subcategories Business Desktop Replacement Gaming Multimedia Student Brand ASUS Acer Alienware Aorus Apple CTL Corp.

A touch of a finger unlocks the phone — no password required. With services like Apple Pay or Android Pay, a fingerprint can buy a bag of groceries, a new laptop or even a $1 million vintage Aston Martin. And pressing a finger inside a banking app allows the user to pay bills or transfer thousands of dollars. While such wizardry is convenient, it has also left a gaping security hole. New findings published last week by researchers at New York University and Michigan State University suggest that smartphones can easily be fooled by fake fingerprints digitally composed of many common features found in human prints. In computer simulations, the researchers from the universities were able to develop a set of artificial “MasterPrints” that could match real prints similar to those used by phones as much as 65 percent of the time. The researchers did not test their approach with real phones, and other security experts said the match rate would be significantly lower in real-life conditions. Still, the findings raise troubling questions about the effectiveness of fingerprint security on smartphones. “It’s almost certainly not as worrisome as presented, but it’s almost certainly pretty darn bad,” said Andy Adler, a professor of systems and computer engineering at Carleton University in Canada, who studies biometric security systems. “If all I want to do is take your phone and use your Apple Pay to buy stuff, if I can get into 1 in 10 phones, that’s not bad odds.” Full human fingerprints are difficult to falsify, but the finger scanners on phones are so small that they read only partial fingerprints. When a user sets up fingerprint security on an Apple iPhone or a phone that runs Google’s Android software, the phone typically takes eight to 10 images of a finger to make it easier to make a match. And many users record more than one finger — say, the thumb and forefinger of each hand. Since a finger swipe has to match only one stored image to unlock the phone, the system is vulnerable to false matches. “It’s as if you have 30 passwords and the attacker only has to match one,” said Nasir Memon, a professor of computer science and engineering at NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering, who is one of three authors of the study, which was published in IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security. The other authors are Aditi Roy, a postdoctoral fellow at NYU’s Tandon School, and Arun Ross, a professor of computer science and engineering at Michigan State. Memon said their findings indicated that if you could somehow create a magic glove with a MasterPrint on each finger, you could get into 40 to 50 percent of iPhones within the five tries allowed before the phone demands the numeric password, known as a personal identification number. Apple said the chance of a false match in the iPhone’s fingerprint system was 1 in 50,000 with one fingerprint enrolled. Ryan James, a company spokesman, said Apple had tested various attacks when developing its Touch ID system, and also incorporated other security features to prevent false matches. Google declined to comment. The actual risk is difficult to quantify. Apple and Google keep many details of their fingerprint technology secret, and the dozens of companies that make Android phones can adapt Google’s standard design in ways that reduce the level of security. Stephanie Schuckers, a professor at Clarkson University and director of the Center for Identification Technology Research, was cautious about the implications of the MasterPrint findings. She said the researchers used a midrange, commercially available software program that was designed to match full fingerprints, limiting the broader applicability of their findings. “To really know what the impact would be on a cellphone, you’d have to try it on the cellphone,” she said. She noted that cellphone-makers and others who use fingerprint security systems are studying anti-­spoofing techniques to detect the presence of a real finger, such as looking for perspiration or examining patterns in deeper layers of skin. Phone-makers also said that the ease of touching a finger to unlock a phone meant more users actually turned on security features instead of leaving their phones unlocked — a common habit in the early days of smartphones. Still, the team’s fundamental finding that partial fingerprints are vulnerable to spoofing is significant, said Chris Boehnen, the manager of the federal government’s Odin program, which studies how to defeat biometric security attacks as part of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity. “What’s concerning here is that you could find a random phone, and your barrier to attack is pretty low,” Boehnen said. Phone-makers could easily increase security by making it harder to match the partial fingerprint, he said, “but the average phone company is more worried about you being annoyed that you have to put your finger against the phone two or three times than they are with someone breaking into it.” Memon said that despite his research he was still using fingerprint security on his iPhone. “I’m not worried,” he said. “I think it’s still a very convenient way of unlocking a phone. But I’d rather see Apple make me enter the PIN if it’s idle for one hour.” More Business articles »     RG Business Local business news sent to your inbox every Thursday.         Today’s Business stories Business Tasting the market: A growing local business provides food samples in stores Business When to pay for ‘free’ shipping Business Phone fingerprint sensors may not be so safe after all National Teachers cash in by putting lessons up for sale Business As prices of new vehicles keep going up, used cars looking shinier to some buyers Business Business Datebook Business Business Beat     Opinion Editorial Removing a barrier When Secretary of State Dennis Richardson announced last week that he would move to reduce the number on inactive voters in Oregon, he stressed his intent to avoid partisan overtones.

Between more IoT devices hitting the market, better connection types, and the endless accumulation of hours spent untangling wires, people were never designed to live in a wired world. Alpha, a Kickstarter success story, is one such brand taking on the first challenges of trying to live in a wirefree world, and are doing so with their SkyBuds. Similar in nature to the French made PK K’asq earbuds we reviewed late last year or Apple’s recently released AirPods, Skybuds are a bluetooth connected set of earbuds that are charged through a dock system and have absolutely no wires (except from the charging dock to the dock). However, unlike the other two competing devices, SkyBuds fit and lock into your ear, are incredibly low-profile, and feature a similar battery life. To put the latest earbuds to the test we took the SkyBuds on several sweaty runs, a few bike rides, and of course casually wearing them over the course of a month. Audio Quality Audio first, cool tech second. It’s really as simple as that. For SkyBuds, it feels like the tables are flipped as these pack a lot of great tech, but the audio can be lacking in a couple of areas. Similar to our thoughts on the PK K’asq earbuds, at times these buds don’t get quite loud enough. A bit of this can be remedied by ensuring you have the proper fit or even going up a size on the earbud tips, but more importantly you need to download their app. Evidently the audio controls within the app don’t necessarily correlate with the sound level you have on your phone, so it’s almost as if there was an initial governor on the audio output until you crank it all the way up. However, and more importantly than the volume, the quality of what comes out sounds pretty damn good. Between the highs and mids, SkyBuds sound great for alt-rock, podcasts, and pop music, but when you get to rap or dubstep, you’re going to be missing out on bass. Earbuds and lows (bass) don’t really go hand-in-hand, so it’s hard to hold much against Alpha for this one. Beyond that, the earbuds produce crisp audio, and even though it doesn’t get incredibly loud, it remains clear at full volume. We also felt that some of the tones didn’t feel as full as you’d hope for, but generally it was good. Overall the audio quality of SkyBuds are good, but are not great. For the price point you’d probably expect some top notch audio quality, but it’s just not quite there yet. Connectivity and Battery Life Audio quality or not, the SkyBuds may have the best connectivity of any wireless earbuds we’ve tested (even with the bud-to-bud sets). Over the course of a month and in a variety of settings, SkyBuds never lost connection to its connected iPhone 7, iPad, or computer. Not only do the earbuds have great connectivity, they only cut out when you’d actually want them to. Sure, you can press the button to pause the audio, but by simply removing the buds from your ear they will auto-pause. For as small as the earbuds are, you’d expect some issues when it came to the microphone. Being a distance away from your mouth and it placed snuggly in your ear, that’s a lot of potential interference. Between several test calls, both indoors and out, the audio quality was good. Just as important as remaining connected, the battery life on SkyBuds are about the norm for wireless earbuds. Just shy of Apple’s five hour AirPods and on par with previous sets we’ve reviewed, a four hour hold will get you through most activities. However, through use, we did find that the right earbud burnt through its charge more quickly than the left. This is likely due to how the connection between the right and left earbuds work, but either way you are likely to get a bit less than four hours out of them. WIth the charging dock you get several addition full charges without having to plug it in. In total, the dock will give the SkyBuds an additional 24 hours of play time. Additional Features The tech within SkyBuds is what sets it apart from the competition. In a recent update, Alpha added to new features: Awareness and Finder. While running, if you have the volume all the way up, chances are that you won’t hear much of the outside world. By turning on Awareness mode, audio from your surrounding will come in through the microphone and pipe through the earbuds. This can either be set to on, off, or automatic. As we tested these during a race, and organizers tend to frown upon you using earbuds, it was nice to be able to hear their instructions without having to take them out. Finder on the other hand is straightforward. Earbuds are small and you lose things. By using their app, you can now track down the earbuds as long as they are within range. It works essentially like how Tile can help you locate a set of keys. Between Awareness and Finder, Alpha’s associated app is in fact actually worth the download. We’ve seen several that will over basic features like an equalizer, but for the most part it’s just wasted space. More than just the special features, the SkyBuds app is actually awesome. It looks great, they provide some helpful usage tips, you can easily see how much charge each bud has left and their status, and it even shows if the dock is open or closed in real-time (this adds nothing, but it’s just neat). In fact the only issue we had tied to the additional features and app was from the recent update. For some reason it took nearly two hours to complete, but we’re impatient, so there is that. Overall the additional features packed into the Skybuds certainly give you more bang for the buck and improve upon the user experience. Design and User Experience It’s not all that common, but some startups truly understand the value of investing in the user experience. When you first pop in the Skybuds you’re not greeted with a harsh audio tone or what sounds like a bad Russian voice over (looking at you PK K’asq), but one that is reminiscent of an old Windows bootup sound. When it connects to a device by bluetooth, it also has a simple audio queue as well. Alpha also did a solid job of building in a simple user-interface on the buds, especially since each one only has a single button. However, the only shortcoming here is that there is no way to change the volume without either adjusting it on your device, within the app, or using something like an Apple Watch (this works great for running). On a more basic level, the SkyBuds also have the design features you’d expect from wireless earbuds. They are sweat and water resistant, there are several eartips included to ensure a proper fit, and they come in three different colors: silver, white, and black. Most importantly, the earbuds are incredibly lightweight, which means they fit comfortably in your ear. Overall the SkyBuds team did a great job on the design and user experience tied to both setup and regular use. Specs 5.18mm balanced armature driver Frequency response 20Hz – 20KHz, <2% THD at 1K Bluetooth 4.1 Weight: 0.18 ounces Passive noise cancellation Sweatproof and water resistant Pros and Cons Highs Great connectivity Awesome user experience Neat unique features like awareness mode Lows Volume change done on associated device Not much bass Sort of expensive Overall Thoughts Should you buy the SkyBuds earbuds? If you’re active, prefer low profile earbuds, and want something reliable, SkyBuds are for you. Over the next few years we’ll continue to see wireless earbuds hit the market, but as the competition stands, SkyBuds offer a lot of bang for the buck. Sure, they are a bit expensive, but overall the sound quality is ideal and the added features seal the deal for us. We give SkyBuds a 4 out of 5 due to the overall offering being good, but a bit lacking in bass, battery in the right bud, and competitive pricing.

Apple receives permit to test Self-driving cars on Public roads 15.04.2017 at 8:53 pm By BellaNaija.com Leave a Comment Photo Credit: Zhang Peng/LightRocket via Getty Images The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has granted Apple a permit allowing it to begin testing self-driving cars on public roads. Apple became the 30th company granted the permission on Friday after the DMV updated its list of manufacturers testing self-driving cars. According to Autotrader executive analyst, Michelle Kreb, few details have been revealed about Apple’s plans for self-driving cars. She, however, added that Apple could be a “major player” in the autonomous vehicle industry. In a statement released by the California DMV to ABC News, the permit will cover three types of vehicles — all 2015 Lexus RX540h models –and six individual drivers. The first car company to be granted this permit was the Volkswagen Group of America. Other big brands who have been granted this permit are Google, Tesla and Ford.

(AAPL) Stock Is Still a Top Buy AAPL stock has gained more than 20% year-to-date, and many fear a reversion. Here are three reasons that won't happen.

(AAPL) Stock Is Still a Top Buy Nokia Oyj (ADR) (NOK) Stock: A Decent Dividend, But Not Much More View All Posts Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has gotten its groove back. For the year so far, AAPL stock has logged an impressive 22% gain, outpacing other tech heavyweights like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL). Heck, Apple’s even edging out Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) at the moment. Granted, I’d understand if investors get cautious here. Apple, which sports a massive $743 billion market cap, will have a tough time mustering the buying power to continue its standout gains. There are other concerns, such as the political situation. Might the Trump’s Administration hawkishness on trade have an impact, especially in China? Or could a border tax make outsourcing more expensive? And what about the growing restrictions on immigration? A repatriation tax has been baked into AAPL stock, too, but it actually has to happen for Apple to wring any value out of it. These are all legitimate issues, but Apple still has many key advantages that should bolster returns. Today, we’ll look at three. There’s Still Value in AAPL Stock Apple stock still remains a decent bargain despite its outstanding run-up YTD. Right now, AAPL trades at just 14 times earnings, versus 21 for growthier Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), but even MSFT trades at 20x. Meanwhile, the average multiple for the S&P 500 is roughly 20. Apple has also attracted the attention of some of the world’s best value investors, including Joel Greenblatt’s Gotham Asset Management, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s (NYSE:BRK.B) Warren Buffett. Apple certainly has enormous financial resources, which it can use to execute more buybacks or pump up its regular dividend, which right now yields just 1.6%. In talking about the Trump administration’s potential for a repatriation tax holiday, realize that likely would go toward a big stock repurchase program or a special dividend, but because it’s not consistent cash flow, that would be less likely to go toward raising the regular payout. Still, Apple has a lot of money to work with — roughly $245 billion in cash and investments. The iPhone Supercycle The fate of AAPL stock is ultimately tied strongest to the iPhone, which still produces 60% of the company’s sales. The good news is that the latest model — iPhone 8 is the most likely name — should soak up substantial demand. This is the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone, and Apple has made no bones about wanting this one to be a statement.

This is particularly encouraging news as a recently leaked schematic of the iPhone 8 seemed to indicate otherwise. As it turns out, the leaked iPhone 8 schematic we highlighted yesterday is in the EVT (Engineering Validation Test) phase, which is to say that it’s just one of many prototypes Apple was busy exploring. Indeed, it’s no secret that Apple often tests a handful of different iPhone models before choosing a final design and sending it off for mass production. Once a final design is approved, it goes through DVT (Design Validation Test) phase. In other words, there’s still plenty of reason for iPhone enthusiasts hoping for a radical new redesign to get excited. Don't Miss: Galaxy S8 sales are already explosive That said, iDropNews, citing a source working within Foxconn, writes that Apple is currently testing two different iPhone 8 designs but that the design likely to enter mass production will be the sleek-looking device with an embedded Touch ID we’ve been dreaming of. [The] informant divulged there are two iPhone 8 prototypes currently being tested. The first model features Touch ID on the rear, however the second model does in fact feature Touch ID underneath the display. There are a few major differences between the two prototypes listed below. Based on the following information, we’re hoping this version becomes the official design for the iPhone 8, and the source is confident that it will be. According to the report, the iPhone 8 will feature 4mm bezels around the entire OLED display. Additionally, the report relays that the device will feature an ‘invisible’ front-facing camera along with a larger power button. Helping us envision what this mythical iPhone 8 might look like, iDropNews yesterday published some eye-popping new renders which provide us with clearer idea as to what the final iPhone 8 design will look like. Read More Placing the Touch ID sensor on the back of the iPhone 8 would certainly make life easier for Apple engineers, but such a design would undoubtedly be a huge step backwards with respect to usability. An edgeless display is certainly something most everyone wants to see, but sacrificing easy access to Touch ID — a feature most people use dozens of times a day at the very least — would be a net negative as far as the overall design is concerned. Design issues aside, an analyst report recently disclosed that the iPhone 8 will include 3GB of RAM and will come in 64GB and 256GB storage options. Additionally, Apple’s next-gen device will reportedly include improved water resistance, fast-charging capabilities, and incredible battery life.

The permit allows it to conduct test drives in three vehicles with six drivers, the state Department of Motor Vehicles said on Friday. The vehicles are all 2015 Lexus RX450h, according to the DMV. Although it has never openly acknowledged it is looking into building an electric car, Apple has recruited dozens of auto experts in recent years, and the permit pulls the curtain back a bit on any possible plan. "This does confirm what's long been rumored: that Apple is at least toying with the idea of getting into the autonomous game in some capacity," said Chris Theodore, president of consultancy Theodore & Associates, and a former vice president at Ford Motor Co and Chrysler. The permit does not mean Apple is definitely building a car. "This is not necessarily automobiles as initially rumored, but software or possibly hardware associated with autonomous technology," Theodore said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment directly on the filing, pointing back to a statement the company made in November when it wrote to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on the subject of regulating self-driving vehicles. "The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation," Apple's director of product integrity, Steve Kenner, wrote in that five-page letter. Apple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. Apple joins a growing list of traditional carmakers, technology companies, and small start ups to test drive cars in California - all vying to be the first to have commercially viable vehicles on the roads. Companies that have been issued permits also include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co. Many companies have said the first cars will launch in 2020 but some experts believe it may take much longer due to regulatory challenges.

Taylor, visionary in birth of personal computing and internet, dies at 85 UPDATED: Sat., April 15, 2017, 9 p.m. Bob Taylor in 2008 (Gardner Campbell / Creative Commons) By Michael Hiltzik Los Angeles Times Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS In 1968, Robert W. Taylor made a prediction that would guide the course of computer science for decades to come. “In a few years,” he wrote, “men will be able to communicate more effectively through a machine than face to face.” Taylor, who died Thursday at the age of 85, became the single most important force in making his own vision come true. As a civilian official at the Pentagon’s Advanced Research Projects Agency in the 1960s, he approved the funding to launch the government computer network that would ultimately evolve into the internet. And as one of the original laboratory chiefs at the fabled Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, or PARC, he supervised the work that produced the first personal computer; the graphical user interface that was the model for Microsoft Windows and the Apple Macintosh display; the laser printer; the Ethernet local network; and many more advances. Taylor, who suffered from Parkinson’s disease and other ailments, died at his home in the San Francisco Bay Area town of Woodside, according to his son Kurt. Taylor may have been little known to the general public, but he was a revered figure among computer scientists and designers – many of whom received their earliest funding or developed their pioneering concepts with his help. Taylor’s lab at PARC spawned companies and concepts that would help to place California’s Silicon Valley at the center of the digital business world. “From the early 1960s, Bob always had a very clear vision of the potential of the computer at a time when very few other people had really grasped it,” recalled Butler Lampson, one of the designers of the Alto, PARC’s groundbreaking personal computer. “He certainly was the one with the overarching vision of what we were trying to accomplish.” Born in 1932 in Dallas, Taylor never lost the West Texas twang he acquired during his Depression-era upbringing as the adopted son of a Methodist minister and his wife. He earned a master’s degree in psychology at the University of Texas, and eventually joined the Pentagon as a research official. His superior, psychologist J.C.R. Licklider, was devoted to “finding ways to make computers easier to use” – and especially making them interactive, Taylor recollected years later. At that time, computers were room-size monstrosities that operated on the “batch” principle. A user would write an entire program on punch cards or spools of punched tape, feed it into the machine, wait for it to be processed, and then correct or rewrite it and feed it all back in. “It was an unbelievable rigmarole,” Taylor recalled. Moreover, every brand of computer ran on a proprietary language that made them all mutually unintelligible. At the Advanced Research Projects Agency, Taylor witnessed the drawbacks of this arrangement firsthand. He had three terminals in his office, each linked to a computer project he was funding at three separate academic institutions. They could communicate with him, but not with one another, which prevented rather than fostered collaboration among ARPA’s researchers. “You don’t have to be half-smart to see that this thing ought to be designed such that you just have one terminal and you can go wherever you want to go,” Taylor explained many years later. In 1966, he proposed such a system to ARPA’s chief, Charles Herzfeld, who saw the point immediately and approved the “million dollars or so” Taylor told him he needed to get the project off the ground. “That,” Taylor remembered years later, “was literally a 20-minute conversation.” From that conversation was born the ARPAnet, which over the ensuing decades evolved into the internet. By 1969, Taylor had become disaffected with ARPA, which was losing its independence as a civilian research unit and becoming more focused on military projects related to the Vietnam War. He left the agency, and soon after received an invitation from Xerox, which was launching a research outpost on the West Coast. Xerox hoped to diversify beyond its enormous franchise in large-scale office copiers and develop technologies for what it called the “office of the future.” The new operation, founded in 1970 as its Palo Alto Research Center – a year before the term “Silicon Valley” first appeared in print – became better known as Xerox PARC. Shortly after arriving in Palo Alto, Taylor stopped by the desk of a secretary who was showing off her new IBM Selectric typewriter, which used a distinctive golf ball-shaped mechanism to imprint letters on paper. He tapped it with his finger and said, “We’re going to make this thing obsolete.” He was right. Taylor assembled a brilliant team of resourceful computer designers in part by raiding the academic programs he had funded at ARPA. He passed on his vision that the computer should be an interactive device, which responded command by command to its users’ needs. In their 1968 manifesto “The Computer as a Communication Device,” Licklider and Taylor asserted that the “programmed digital computer . can change the nature and value of communication even more profoundly than did the printing press and the picture tube.” The goal was “making the response time short and the conversation free and easy” in a network of computers – not just in one machine. The problem was that the hardware and software necessary to make this vision real didn’t exist yet. Taylor’s lab at PARC invented it. His hand-picked team included Lampson and Charles Thacker, who were brilliant at computer design, and Alan Kay, a seminal thinker who perceived the computer as a device to enhance individual creativity. They believed the computer should be endowed with a high-quality display, on the principle that the most efficient path to the human brain came through the eyes. Kay, Butler Lampson, and Thacker designed and built the first personal computer, the Alto, following a path that Taylor laid out in rough strokes: “He would set down broad goals and coax us into working on them,” Lampson recalled. The Alto was equipped with a screen about the size and orientation of a paper page, and a graphical display that became the precursor of Microsoft Windows and Apple’s Macintosh screen. The Alto was a genuinely personal device – every PARC computer scientist soon had his or her own – and began to approach the computing power to fulfill Kay’s dream of a computer that could not only perform calculations, but allow “the communication of the owner with himself.” Lacking formal training in computer science or engineering, Taylor created the environment for his scientists – typically willful, intellectually self-confident, and self-absorbed – to do their work. It may have been his greatest accomplishment. He instituted weekly team meetings known as “Dealer,” after the book “Beat the Dealer,” which described a winning blackjack system. At Dealer, the scientists would sit on hideously upholstered beanbag chairs to subject a presenter’s work or theory to ruthless, sometimes rude, but invariably incisive critiques. The idea was to create the sense of an extended family amid the unfettered testing of ideas – with the ideas the key element. “If somebody tried to push their personality rather than their argument,” Taylor recalled, “they’d find that it wouldn’t work.” “He knew how to get lone wolves to cooperate so there was maximum synergy in the room,” Kay said. Taylor also expended enormous energy building a wall around his team to fend off constant pressure from Xerox to align their work with the corporation’s most immediate goals. This generated friction not only with corporate management, but with other labs at PARC that were competing with his computer scientists for corporate resources. “He showed maximum pugnaciousness upward,” Kay said, “and maximum nurturing downward.” Taylor’s “key idea,” Kay added, was to “fund people, not projects” – bringing together the best scientists in the world to solve the problems they thought were the most important. In time, Taylor and his team became frustrated by Xerox’s inability or unwillingness to commercialize their work. In December 1979 the first breach in PARC’s wall occurred after Apple’s Steve Jobs accepted an investment from Xerox on condition that he get a look inside the research center. During two separate demonstrations, Jobs and his associates were shown the Alto and much of its key software. Many of the concepts made their way into the Lisa, Apple’s first large-scale product. Some Apple engineers would try to minimize how much they gleaned from these visits, but there was little doubt that both Apple and Microsoft took PARC’s display and other features of its work as a model for their own software. According to Walter Isaacson’s 2011 biography of Jobs, Microsoft’s Bill Gates answered Jobs’ accusation that Microsoft had stolen the Windows graphical display from Apple by observing, “It’s more like we had this rich neighbor named Xerox and I broke into his house to steal the TV set and found out that you had already stolen it.” Taylor’s determined defense of his team eventually led to his unhappy departure from PARC. In 1981, new management arrived at the research center determined to align the center, especially Taylor’s team, with corporate goals. Within a year Taylor was goaded into resigning. Taylor moved to Digital Equipment Corp., where he presided over more advances, including the early search engine Alta Vista. But he never matched the accomplishments of his PARC years, in part because the advances there had seeded so many other new technologies that it became difficult for any single lab to remain in the forefront for long. Indeed, after Taylor’s departure, the trickle of resignations by PARC scientists seeking new outlets for their work turned into a flood – and his influence is visible in almost every corner of the digital world today. Software designer Larry Tesler moved to Apple; Hungarian immigrant Charles Simonyi, who had developed Bravo, a word-processing program on what-you-see-is-what-you-get (or WYSIWYG) principles to take advantage of the Alto’s display, took his program to Microsoft, where it became the kernel of Microsoft Word. Robert Metcalfe, the co-inventor of Ethernet, founded 3Com Corp. to commercialize the technology, and programming aces Charles Geschke and John Warnock left to found Adobe Systems. “He was one of those unique people,” Kay said, “who was a central factor in a deep revolution of ideas.” Updated: April 15, 2017, 9 p.m.  Tags: Apple, computer, computing, interface, internet, mac, Macintosh, Obit, obituary, robert w. taylor, science, Tech, Technology, Xerox Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Masthead Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Here’s how to downgrade from 10.3 or 10.3.1. Apple released the iOS 10.3 update in mid-March and the iOS 10.3.1 update in early April. You can no longer downgrade from iOS 10.3.1 to either 10.3 or 10.2.1. Do not attempt this process. Unfortunately, there is no way to go back to iOS 10.2, which you can jailbreak. Officially Apple does not support a way to downgrade iOS updates, but there is an easy way to do this in iTunes for a short time after Apple releases an update. Apple closed the option to downgrade to iOS 9 long ago, but you can still downgrade to iOS 10.2.1. In order to downgrade iOS 10.3 to iOS 10.2.1 you will need to download the file and Apple still needs to sign the file. This normally only happens for a week or two after Apple offers a new update. How to downgrade from iOS 10.3 to iOS 10.2.1. Apple’s upgrade system includes a check to make sure that Apple is still activating, or signing, the software you want to install. If Apple is no longer signing this update you will not be able to install it. How to Downgrade iOS 10.3 to iOS 10.2.1 Here are the steps you need to downgrade from iOS 10.3 or IOS 10.3.1 to iOS 10.2.1. You cannot downgrade to iOS 9.3 or to iOS 9.2, which is frustrating for some users. You cannot downgrade back to a jailbreak-able version of iOS 10 either. Backup Your iPhone Before you start you should make sure that your iPhone or iPad is backed up to your computer. You can’t restore a iOS 10.3 backup to your iPhone after you downgrade to iOS 10.2.1, but it is important to make sure you have a backup in case something does go wrong. Make sure you have a backup before you start the iOS 10.2 downgrade to iOS 10.1.1. When you downgrade you will need to completely erase your iPhone. If you have a backup from iOS 10 you can restore to that. Download the iOS 10.2.1 Update To do this you will need to plug into your Mac or PC using a Lightning cable and you will need to make sure that you have the iOS 10.2.1 update file for your device. Here’s where you can download iOS 10.2.1 ipsw files for any of the iPhone or iPad devices that runs this update. If the row is green and there is a check in the Apple Signing Status, then you know that you can continue. If Apple is no longer signing iOS 10.2.1 you should stop. In a surprise move, Apple is still signing iOS 10.2.1 as opf April 10th. Start the iOS 10.3 Downgrade to iOS 10.2.1 Once you have the file downloaded to your computer, and unzipped if needed, you will want to plug in your iPhone to Mac or PC with a Lightning cable. Start the downgrade to go back to iOS 10.2. Open iTunes and click on your iPhone or iPad to launch the device summary page in iTunes. Make sure you turn off Find my iPhone before you start. You will need to special click on “Restore iPhone…”. That is a alt/option click on Mac or a Shift click in Windows. Hold the key and then click. This will open up a prompt so that you can search for the iOS 10.2. ipsw file you downloaded.   Complete the iOS 10.3 downgrade to iOS 10.2.1 Find the file and click Open to start the downgrade process. You will see a message on the screen that iTunes will erase and restore your iPhone to iOS 10.2.1 and will verify the restore with Apple. Click Restore to start. When this finishes you will have a blank iPhone on iOS 10.2.1. You can choose Restore Backup and choose a previous backup from before you installed iOS 10.3. Alternately, you can choose to start over from scratch. What’s New in iOS 10.2.1 & iOS 10.2 New iOS 10.2 Emoji   1 / 6 There are over 100 new iOS 10.2 emoji in this free update. You don't need to buy any apps or subscriptions to unlock them. Simply install iOS 10.2 and you will be able to start sending new faces, food, animals, sports and professions. The people you send the new iOS 10.2 emoji to will need iOS 10.2 installed to see them. They may need iOS 10.2 to see some of the redesigned emoji based on our testing during the beta. Some of the new iOS 10.2 emojis include; Clown Emoji Prince Mother Christmas Rolling on the Floor Laughing Lying Face Drooling Emoji Nauseated Face Sneezing Face Shrug Man in a Tux emoji Pregnant woman Face Palm Cal Me Hand Fingers Crossed Emoji Handshake Gorilla Fox Face Deer Rhino Bat Eagle Duck Owl Lizard Croissant Baguette Peanuts Bacon Egg Milk Whisky Emoji Spoon Scooter Canoe First Place Medal Goal Net Fencer Wrestlers Apple also adds in new professions to the emojis including male and female versions of these new options including artists, astronauts, cooks, factory workers, farmers, firefighters, health worker, judges, mechanics, office workers, pilots, teachers and much more.   1 / 6 20 Responses 03/22/2016 Thelma Reply Friends…!m­­­­­­­­­y room­­­­­­­­­ate’s e­­­­­­­­­x-w­­­­­­­­­ife ma­­­­­­­­­kes $83 e­­­­­­­­­very ho­­­­­­­­­ur o­­­­­­­­­n th­­­­­­­­­e inter­­­­­­­­­net .

About us Our staff Contacts Home Business Health Science Tech World Apple gets permit to test self-driving cars in California April 15, 2017 Paul Smedley Leave a comment The list includes major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, as well as one of its biggest rivals in technology, Google, whose testing of self-driving cars has been spun off into an affiliate called Waymo. The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has released an updated list of companies with the ability to test autonomous vehicles in the state, and at the bottom of that new list is Apple, Inc. Apple would have loved to keep this under wraps, but unfortunately, they have to get a permit before they begin testing. But by last October, many in the team had reportedly left or been reassigned as a result of a strategic shift by the company to focus on the software side of self-driving technology. For quite a while, rumors swirled that Apple was creating a self-driving vehicle under Project Titan, but past year, it was reported that the company gave up on this plan in favor of developing a software-based autonomous drive system. An Apple spokesman declined to comment beyond a statement issued in December when the company filed paperwork with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regarding safety practices for self-driving cars. “Applying for the permit also doesn’t necessarily mean Apple will start actively testing immediately, as some companies apply for the permits, but take a bit longer to actually start driving their autonomous vehicles on the roads”, said Akshay Anand, an analyst with Kelley Blue Book. The permit covers the registration of three Lexus RX450h SUVs, and allows six drivers to operate them. While GM is already testing autonomous vehicles through its Cruise Automation unit in California, Arizona and MI, the new initiative will ramp up those efforts. It seems that Apple’s overall strategy is still up in the air. A quarter of all miles driven in the USA may be traveled in shared, self-driving electric cars by the end of the next decade, Boston Consulting Group said this month. This is not the first time Apple has leapt into the automotive space. The company is only testing components of a self-driving auto. And in July, the company brought in Bob Mansfield, a highly regarded Apple veteran, to take over the effort. Others said Apple was more likely focusing on software that could be used to control a vehicle, or to upgrade a auto by injecting it with autonomous capabilities.

As much as I use my Apple Watch as a fitness tracker I'm continually reminded how much more there is to it. Beyond even Apple Pay, notifications, and Siri and HomeKit. It's only when I see things like this — the built in SOS feature from watchOS 3 literally saving lives — that I appreciate just how important having a connected computer strapped to my wrist can be. From The Daily Mail: Casey Bennett, from Laytonsville, Maryland, was driving home from school the night of April 6 when he was struck by another vehicle – sending him and his Jeep Patriot flying through the air. Bennett, 22, found himself hanging from the driver's seat by just his seat belt, but his iPhone was too far out of reach to call for help. However, he remembered the Apple Watch included the SOS Emergency feature – he held the side button down and contacted 911 for help, who were on the scene in six minutes. If you're not already familiar with SOS, please take a moment and read this: How to use SOS on Apple Watch: The ultimate guide SOS exists on iPhone as well, and thankfully so. But Apple Watch has the advantage of permanency of place. It could be smashed or otherwise rendered non-functional, certainly. But, as long as it's working, you never have to worry about remembering which pocket, bag, or cup holder it's in, or if it got dropped or was sent flying away. It's right there. On your wrist. Where you can reach it. Always. Right after WWDC 2016, my colleagues Georgia Dow and Serenity Caldwell and I discussed how important a feature SOS would turn out to be. I can't wait to see what Apple has in store for watchOS 4 at WWDC 2017.

The US firm plans to financially support Taiwan’s Hon Hai, which has reportedly bid some 3 trillion yen ($27.6 billion) in the initial tendering round for the memory chip business, the Mainichi Shimbun said. Apple, which uses Toshiba’s memory chips for its iPhone, hopes to secure stable supplies of the key parts by supporting Hon Hai’s bid, the daily said. Hon Hai, which acquired Japanese electronics maker Sharp last year, is separately asking SoftBank to join the team, the daily said. The Japanese telecom company may help Hon Hai negotiate with local banks currently supporting Toshiba, it said. Among other bidders are Google and Amazon as well as US private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners and American chipmaker Broadcom, news reports have said, quoting unnamed sources. Local media said any foreign buyer would need to pass a Japanese government review, given concerns about security around systems already using Toshiba’s memory chips. Toshiba is the world’s number two supplier of memory chips for smartphones and computers, behind South Korea’s Samsung, and the business accounted for about a quarter of its 5.67 trillion yen in revenue last fiscal year. But it plans to sell-off the chip business, seen as crucial for the cash-strapped company to turn itself around, after suffering huge cost overruns and construction delays at its US nuclear power unit Westinghouse Electric, which filed for bankruptcy protection late March.— AFP About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← US labour market tightening, inflation trending higher GCC risk premiums will rise as credit downgrades continue: Fisch → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent ‘Israa and Miraj’ holiday on April 25 Pay more on ticket ‘refund’ and ‘reissue’ Submit voluntary projects for award from May 1 Oman, China seek to enhance cooperation in journalism Read More ...

According to an internal memo obtained by 9to5 Mac, users who need service on that model could walk out of the store with a shiny new iPad Air 2. Image: Apple According to the US report, the memo simply states, "Starting March 30th, iPad 4th generation whole unit repairs may be substituted to iPad Air 2." The fourth generation iPad was discontinued in 2014, but Apple tends to support its devices for up to 5 years after their debut. Customers who bring in a device for repair at locations that don't offer that service will often be given a new device for the sake of convenience. Now that supplies of the fourth generation are dwindling, Apple has apparently freed its employees to substitute an iPad that's two generations newer. The iPad Air 2 has also been discontinued but that move only occurred last month, so this is a relatively current tablet and it's still dang good. The iPad Air 2 did not offer the 16GB and 64GB models, so you'd likely be getting a storage upgrade along with the overall more advanced tech. So, just FYI, if you take your old fourth-gen iPad in for service and they try to replace it with the same model, maybe shop around to see if you get something better. We don't recommend intentionally breaking the tablet, you never know what Apple might say and you could end up with nothing.

Approved government agencies can access that data without a warrant. It's not private information, either.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Where Are My iCloud, iTunes & App Store Options After iOS 10.3 Update? By Uzair Ghani Apr 13, 2017 11Shares Share Tweet Submit If you are wondering where iCloud and iTunes & App Store options went from Settings app after iOS 10.3 update, we’re here to help. Apple Shuffled a Few Things After iOS 10.3 – Moves iCloud and iTunes & App Store to a New Location iOS 10.3 introduced a bunch of new features to iPhone and iPad users. But perhaps the most noticeable change lies in the Settings app, where you’ll see for yourself that the iCloud and iTunes & App Store entries are not where they supposed to be. In fact, they are still there, but Apple moved them to a dedicated location making things easier to manage when it comes to your Apple ID. Related iOS 11 Will Reportedly Drop 32-bit App Support This Fall If you launch the iOS 10.3.x Settings app right now, you’ll notice at the very top there’s an entry for Apple ID, iCloud, iTunes & App Store. Simply tap on it and you will see everything there is pertaining to your Apple ID in one place. Tapping on the iCloud entry will take you to what was once accessible by going to Settings > iCloud. Same goes for iTunes & App Store as well. As a long time iOS user myself, I find the change rather odd since I’m used to the old position of the entry more in the Settings app. But over time, I’ve managed to get used to the new change, and quite frankly, it’s a change for the better as well. Putting everything Apple ID related under one roof was an excellent move from Apple’s end. Advertisement Using the iCloud page, you can turn certain features on or off such as email, contact syncing and whatnot. Most importantly, this is the place where you can toggle Find My iPhone on or off. Therefore it’s highly recommended that user get to grips with this new change immediately. Related You Can No Longer Downgrade to iOS 10.2.1 or iOS 10.3 iOS 10.3.x is a nice little upgrade that promises speed improvements as well.

Study Watch is meant for research and will be put to work in several studies including a multi-year study to identify patterns in the progression of Parkinson’s disease, according to a blog post by Verily team members David He, Tushar Parlikar, and Harry Xiao. “The ability to passively capture health data is critical to the success of continuous care platforms and clinical research,” the post from the Google sister company said. “Study Watch represents another step in our targeted efforts to create new tools for unobtrusive bio-sensing.” Study Watch appeared styled after a traditional wrist-worn timepiece, and boasted features including long battery life and encryption for stored data. “Multiple physiological and environmental sensors are designed to measure relevant signals for studies spanning cardiovascular, movement disorders, and other areas,” the blog post said. “Examples include electrocardiogram, heart rate, electrodermal activity, and inertial movements.” Verily was part of the Google X lab known for big vision projects such as self-driving cars and internet-service delivered by high-altitude balloons, but was spun into an independent unit at Google-parent Alphabet in mid 2015. The debut of Study Watch comes as Apple continues to enhance capabilities of its smartwatch along with supporting Health Kit and Research Kit software for use by researchers and care providers as well as individuals interested in fitness. A secret team is working on enhancing Apple Watch sensors to monitor the blood sugar levels of wearers in what would be considered a diabetes breakthrough, according to a report this week by CNBC news. — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Watch these awesome drone trick shots!

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Gabor Balogh Dubious report claims iPhone 8 hype is already stifling Galaxy S8 sales Yoni Heisler @edibleapple April 12th, 2017 at 7:38 PM Share Tweet A new research report from TrendForce argues that growing demand and excitement for Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 will have an adverse impact on Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus sales. According to the report, the S8 will not have a major impact on Samsung’s bottom line due the hype for Apple’s next-gen and completely revamped iPhone model. “Major brands such as Samsung, LG and Huawei have begun to ship their flagship devices for the year,” the report notes, “but the market demand going into the second quarter is expected to remain relatively weak as consumers are holding off their purchases in anticipation of the 10th anniversary iPhone devices that will arrive in the third quarter. Don't Miss: Now other airlines are brutally trolling United Airlines, and it’s hilarious TrendForce’s report about Samsung’s prospects with the S8 and S8 Plus is a tad curious given that demand for the company’s upcoming flagship devices appear to be incredibly strong. In a statement released just a few days ago, a Samsung spokesperson relayed that “pre-orders of the Galaxy S8 and S8+ in the US are outpacing those of the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge with strong double digit growth.” Additionally, we’ve also seen reports that demand for the premium-priced S8 Plus has been stronger than what Samsung was expecting, even prompting the company to boost S8 Plus production as a result. All that said, it’s probably far too early to accurately gauge how the impending iPhone 8 vs Galaxy S8 battle will play out. While the iPhone 8 will likely usher in the largest refresh cycle in iPhone history, it remains to be seen if the device will be compelling enough for traditional Android users beholden to Samsung to make the switch. While the number of Android to iPhone users seemingly increases each and every year, we have no data as to whether or not those users are leaving premium or more budget-friendly Android devices behind. Further, we still have to wait and see what the iPhone 8 brings to the table and when it might actually see the light of day. Indeed, there have been a few reports claiming that the iPhone 8 release might get pushed back a few weeks. More ominous reports have relayed that the device might not even hit store shelves until November.

By Shirley Leung Globe Staff  March 31, 2017 It’s probably not completely fair to say that a deer changed the course of one of the world’s great companies, but one might assume that as Jeff Immelt stared out the window of his office in suburban Connecticut, he saw one too many. He didn’t want to see deer. He wanted to see engineers, techies, kids with big ideas and sharp minds out to change the world. Advertisement Immelt didn’t want or need to change the world. He just wanted to change General Electric Co. and to change just about everything about it. Which in no small way explains why the chief executive officer of a famously staid conglomerate now works in a suite with exposed brick smack in the middle of the crowded Fort Point Channel district of Boston. In the makeshift headquarters, the executive dining room has been replaced with common space that features free Jack’s Abby craft beer on tap. Get Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Sign up for more newsletters here You see, the company cofounded by Thomas Edison in 1892, that made its proudly generic name by producing achingly reliable light bulbs, refrigerators, and microwave ovens, now wants to be a tech company — an Apple for modern industry, bringing smarts and the power of the Internet to hulking gear like jet engines, turbines, and MRIs. Immelt, Harvard MBA and a second-generation GE man, is close to completing a corporate transformation that is as radical as it is methodical, as essential to the company’s survival as Steve Jobs’s iPhone was to Apple’s. After 16 years at the helm, the GE Immelt has built is unrecognizable from the one he took over from his legendary predecessor, Jack Welch. Immelt has sold off signature parts of the company — plastics, appliances, NBC, and the bulk of a finance division so big it rivaled Wall Street banks. Consumer lighting — yes, those light bulbs — could be next. Advertisement It is a brazen reshaping of one of America’s most stalwart companies, yet outside of business circles, Immelt is hardly a household name like Welch was. The Salem native was one of America’s first celebrity CEOs, presiding over GE during the frothy ’80s and ’90s. He earned the admiration of Wall Street by producing predictable profits and the antipathy of Main Street by ruthlessly cutting jobs. Immelt has been the anti-Jack: the Midwestern math major who is partial to sweater vests, the guy who likes to drive his own car to work and park in public garages at night, the industrial titan whose subdued public persona exudes extreme competence more than charisma, and who has a talent for bringing out the best in the people who work for him. On top of it all, he has had the unglamorous job of steering the company through sobering times, including cataclysmic events such as Sept. 11 and the Great Recession. In uprooting the headquarters to Boston last August, Immelt might finally get to have as much fun running GE as Welch did. In May, the company will break ground on a $200 million futuristic complex overlooking the Fort Point Channel. Immelt gets giddy over what many Bostonians take for granted, marveling how one city can be home to some of the world’s leading life sciences companies and teaching hospitals. He is beside himself when he thinks about the brainpower at the universities from MIT to Harvard, and the fact that all of this is just a 10-minute drive from his office door. “That just kind of lets you see why being here matters,” he said in an interview at GE’s Boston office. Or, put it another way, he was lonely out amid the tranquil lawns of GE’s Fairfield, Conn., compound, where the company had been headquartered since the ’70s. Kathy Willens/Associated Press Jack Welch, left, spoke during a news conference in 2000 as Jeff Immelt looked on. Impatience on Wall Street “He would say you would walk out of the building, and there’s no one to play with,” said Sue Siegel, who oversees GE Ventures, the arm that invests and collaborates with startups. “When you think about innovation, you want access. You want to feel it.” Life would be great for Immelt — if not for Wall Street. His vision banks on a long-term payoff, but shareholders are growing impatient. While Welch notched astronomical returns over two decades, investors in Immelt’s GE would have made more by putting money in a plain-vanilla index fund. Immelt recently said the company would tie executive bonuses to the performance of GE’s industrial operations, a step taken after discussions with Nelson Peltz, a big shareholder who is pressing GE for better returns “He’s been down there fighting the gators for a long time,” said Nick Heymann, an analyst who follows GE for the investment banking firm William Blair. “If he can climb the wall, on the other side is finally going to be Jeff’s promised land.” The real question: Is Boston that promised land? When Immelt took the reins from Welch on Sept. 7, 2001, among the rookie CEO’s biggest concerns was getting out of his predecessor’s shadow. Neutron Jack was legend, Fortune magazine’s “Manager of the Century.” Love or hate him, everyone knew who Welch was — and who would want to be measured against his record? But four days later none of that mattered after terrorists turned planes into weapons attacking the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Two GE employees were killed, a recession kicked in, and the company’s stock plummeted. GE’s aviation businesses — jet engines and commercial aircraft leasing —took a big blow with the world not knowing if flying would ever be the same again. Later, when the 2008 recession hit, GE Capital, which had been producing more than half of the company’s operating profit, was battered just like the big banks it competed against. Along with companies such as Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, GE took a government lifeline to stabilize its finances and restore the confidence of investors and customers. A lesser executive might have cratered, but Immelt came to the top job having been groomed from the day he landed at GE after graduating from Harvard Business School in 1982. He was a rising star at GE Plastics when Welch himself plucked him in 1989 to become president of consumer service for GE Appliances. It was Immelt’s first big test, landing right in the middle of a massive recall of 3 million refrigerators with bad compressors. “I was like 32 years old. I had 7,000 employees, and it was a crisis,” he recalled. “I grew up a decade in two years. It taught me about managing people in a crisis. How you communicate, how important showing up was. . . . It taught me a lot about how to be a good operating leader and how to be methodical in how I did things.” He passed the test and bigger assignments came his way, eventually returning to the plastics division as general manager and later running GE’s health care business before being named at 45 years old as Welch’s successor. “I think Jeff is as skilled in crisis management as anyone in the country,” said New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. How would he know? The billionaire owner is among a cadre of Boston business power brokers Immelt has gotten to know through the years, including State Street CEO Jay Hooley, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, and Bain Capital chairman Steve Pagliuca. Kraft formed a bond more than a decade ago with Immelt back when GE still owned NBC. Kraft headed the league’s broadcast committee, and Immelt wanted the network to air NFL games on Sunday nights. The two stitched a deal together. But that’s not how Kraft came to know Immelt’s crisis management prowess. As Kraft and the Patriots became embroiled in the Spygate and Deflategate scandals in recent years, advice came from an unexpected place. “On a personal level, he has been a great friend to me,” said Kraft. “Jeff called me literally from the other side of the world — one time was the Middle East, the other time was Asia. When everyone was coming after us, he gave support, advice, and counsel. That has meant so much to me and endeared me.” Immelt, who played football at Dartmouth College, makes it out to a Pats game with Kraft at least once a year. “In today’s world of CEOs of public monolithic companies, he’s a real people person,” said Kraft. Frank O’Brien/Globe Staff Dartmouth College offensive lineman Jeff Immelt, center, wore a pained expression in the fourth quarter against Harvard in 1977. Innovation for survival Every CEO talks about making his or her company more innovative, but for GE it’s a matter of survival. GE is a corporate mainstay, the only original stock left in the Dow Jones industrial index, which began tracking the performance of large public companies in 1896. It must succeed now in a world in which the only constant is change. His task is monumental because GE is nothing like a startup; it’s a behemoth. Immelt has to find a way to bring along some 300,000 employees in 180 countries at a company that generated almost $124 billion in revenue last year. Immelt’s first decade as CEO was spent fixing the house that Jack built. Immelt knew a lot of Welch’s tactics to drive growth would no longer work. The hardest breakup would be with GE Capital, which required shedding some $500 billion in assets. Still, Immelt hasn’t been afraid to reshape GE through dramatic deals. He bought the power and grid business of French multinational Alstom in 2015 to expand GE’s holdings in that sector, and last year announced a deal for Houston oil services company Baker Hughes, doubling down on GE’s oil and gas business. “He doesn’t accept the status quo. He doesn’t accept the easy way,” said Brackett Denniston, who was GE’s longtime general counsel until he retired in 2015. “He refocused the place completely on its inventiveness and its strength in innovation.” Coming to Boston was a way to show the world how serious GE is about transformation. When Bain cochairman Pagliuca first visited the new headquarters, he thought he was in the wrong place. “I was shocked,” said Pagliuca, who was a Harvard MBA classmate of Immelt’s and has done business with GE through the years. “This felt like Silicon Valley.” Immelt hasn’t done all this solely by imposing his will. Ben Shapiro, one of Immelt’s faculty advisers at Harvard Business School, recalls how his easygoing nature put classmates at ease. Immelt wasn’t the academic star of his class, or the hardest worker in that workaholic realm, but he was notably good with people. “What impressed me the most about him is that he was a very good listener,” said Shapiro, now an emeritus professor of marketing. “Jeff had this good mixture of emotional IQ.” He also, from an early age, recognized that success requiredunleashing the creative energies of everyone around him. “He is not the type of person you would lock up in a closet and ask to come up with an answer in six months,” said Shapiro. These days, as he tries to cement GE’s new image, Immelt at times can act more like a student of business than the leader of one of the biggest companies in the world. Since moving to Boston, he has asked Siegel, the GE Ventures CEO, to convene dinner salons at the headquarters attended by local and national players. The first one, in October, was on the future of work and was anchored by a presentation from the cofounders of Catalant, a Boston startup that received funding from GE Ventures in 2015. Catalant, which began as a class project at Harvard Business School in 2013, has created an online database of business expertise that helps companies find talent for specific projects. Immelt invited about 15 senior executives from major companies, as well as Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria and Cambridge venture capitalist David Fialkow, whose General Catalyst firm is also an investor in Catalant. Fialkow works with other big-name CEOs but had never met Immelt until that evening. What impressed Fialkow was Immelt’s command of the many GE businesses, while also knowing what his company is good at and what it isn’t. He “does not have any N.I.H. — Not Invented Here. That’s really important,” said Fialkow. “Let’s get the best solutions whether inside or outside GE.” Fialkow, who has been actively finding ways to help Boston keep its young talent, also recognized the moment as a huge opportunity for Catalant and other local startups Immelt may take under his wing. GE Ventures has invested in 10 Boston-area companies since it was founded in 2013. “For the CEO of GE to bring his peers to this dinner,” said Fialkow, “was the greatest business development event you can ever imagine.” Beyond the dinners, GE has hosted other local events to establish itself as a thought leader, including a hack-a-thon to dream up new ways to attack the opioid crisis and a forum to showcase its advanced manufacturing. The company has also become a sponsor of startup accelerator, MassChallenge, formed an alliance with MassRobotics, and swiftly inked partnerships with MIT and Northeastern. Siegel, who has spent most of her career working in Silicon Valley, was wary about coming to GE nearly five years ago and wrestled with whether Immelt was committed to changing the company’s culture. She has no doubts now. He routinely brings in new economy founders, such as Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, to talk at leadership meetings. More surprising is that Immelt carves out time to regularly meet entrepreneurs who aren’t household names. Take Catalant, which only has 130 employees, but the three cofounders have been meeting with Immelt twice a year. “He is wildly innovative, entrepreneurial and willing to try to new things,” said Pat Petitti, the CEO and one of the cofounders of Catalant. “You wouldn’t expect that to be the case.” Jonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff Patriots Owner Robert Kraft, left, was on hand with Jeff Immelt at a Boston College luncheon in 2016. Massachusetts has stake It’s not just GE shareholders who are anxious to see Jeff Immelt deliver results, but Massachusetts taxpayers. The state’s relocation package is worth as much as $125 million while the city agreed to give GE a $25 million break on property taxes. Critics have lined up, wondering why GE, a company with a stock market value of about $255 billion, needs any taxpayer help. Besides, the company has a reputation for taking advantage of laws to minimize its tax bills. In his public appearances, Immelt is acutely aware of the need to show a return on investment for his new hometown. Upon its arrival, GE pledged $50 million in philanthropy over the next five years to community health centers, Boston public schools, and workforce training throughout the state. But Immelt sets the bar even higher than that. In his mind, Boston can lead the next digital revolution, the same one GE is trying to engineer. It’s as if he is willing us to think bigger. Immelt has seen firsthand what the right company at the right time can do. One of his first jobs at GE in the early ’80s was in the plastics division, which required him to spend time in Silicon Valley. He would call on Steve Jobs and other computer titans to persuade them to buy GE casings for their processors. Immelt saw how anchor companies like Hewlett-Packard became what he has called a “centrifugal force” in transforming that region into the tech powerhouse it is today. GE, he believes, can play that same role for Boston in building the industrial Internet, a world in which software and data analytics govern jet engine performance and MRIs as so smart they will know when to replace a part or how to sift through images. “It’s real, and it’s going to happen,” Immelt told business leaders gathered at a Boston College Chief Executives Club lunch last year. “If Boston isn’t the headquarters of that flow, shame on both of us.” Keith Bedford/Globe Staff Jeff Immelt, right, shared a laugh with Governor Charlie Baker, center and Boston Mayor Martin J.

Kodi's open-source media center is a perfect way to bring that first generation Apple TV you have stuffed in a cupboard back to life: It's not officially available on the App Store, but it's still a perfectly legal app to install it on your first-generation Apple TV. What is Kodi? A brief explainer from the official Kodi website: Kodi (formerly known as XBMC) is an award-winning free and open source (GPL) software media player and entertainment hub that can be installed on Linux, OSX, Windows, iOS and Android, featuring a 10-foot user interface for use with televisions and remote controls. It allows users to play and view most videos, music, podcasts, and other digital media files from local and network storage media and the internet. Our forums and Wiki are bursting with knowledge and help for the new user right up to the application developer. In the very early days, Kodi — or XBMC as it was first known — was a hack to add true media center functionality to the original Xbox console. As it has evolved, it has turned into one of the most powerful systems available. Kodi itself is perfectly legal: It's a piece of media center software and does not provide nor condone piracy; there are also a number of legal add-ons that can be attached to Kodi, as well as connecting live TV and your own media library. What you need There's not a lot of supplies needed to get this little project rolling. Besides your first-generation Apple TV — 40GB or 160GB, it doesn't matter which — you need a PC or Mac to download the files you need, along with an 8GB or larger USB flash drive. You'll also need an Ethernet cable to hook up your Apple TV to your local network during the install process. If you want to further upgrade your Apple TV, you can even swap out its Wi-Fi card for an HD decoder in its place. (More on that below.) Before you begin: Visit your Apple TV's settings and find the option for RGB High. Make sure this is enabled, otherwise you risk issues with your picture quality — no one wants their screen covered by a pink tint, and if you forget this step, you'll have to restore the original Apple TV operating system and start again. How to download Kodi to the first-generation Apple TV Get your weekly dose of Rene Ritchie on Kodi! For the first generation Apple TV you can go one of two ways with your Kodi install: OpenElec or OSMC. Both are custom builds of Kodi that work great on older or less powerful hardware; they're popular with Raspberry Pi fans. For the purposes of this guide, we'll be using OSMC. It's a great Kodi build with a really nice custom user interface that works great on a TV. You can run it solely from a USB flash drive if you wish, but for this guide, we're installing it directly to the internal HDD. Grab your PC or Mac and your flash drive, then follow these steps: Head over to osmc.tv/download in your browser. Select the installer for the operating system you're currently using. Download the installer and launch once complete. Connect the flash drive to the computer. Select Apple TV from the drop down box. The next stage is to select the build. Choose the latest version from the dropdown box for HDD. The next step will ask you where to install, but it won't let you change the options. So just click next. Select your flash drive location. Accept the license agreement and the install can begin. How to install Kodi to your first-generation Apple TV Plug the USB flash drive into the back of the Apple TV. Boot your Apple TV. After a small delay, you'll see a Linux-style boot screen (OSMC is based on Linux). If everything went to plan, the OSMC installer will begin: Go make a coffee and wait. If you didn't boot into the installer, reboot the Apple TV and try again. How to customize Kodi on your first-generation Apple TV From here on out, Kodi is yours to build out into the media center of your dreams. Kodi itself has no content pre-filled, but you can download any number of legal add-ons; these include well-known names like YouTube and Twitch, along with clients to hook into your own cloud media from sources like OneDrive and Dropbox. You can also plug your Plex server directly into Kodi and your HDHomeRun tuner for live TV. Both services have official add-ons. Best legal add-ons for Kodi What if I need a remote? Good news: You already have an awesome physical remote with your Apple TV, assuming you didn't lose it. The stock Apple white IR remote will work just fine with Kodi, allowing you to navigate the interface and control playback without the need for additional hardware. You can also get additional remotes easily on your iPhone or iPad by downloading one of the Kodi remote apps from the App Store. There are a few to choose from, but I recommend Blue Remote and Armchair Remote, which both Apple Watch companions; Blue Remote is totally free, while Armchair has a paid upgrade to unlock everything. Download Blue Remote from the App Store Download Armchair Remote from the App Store How to restore Wi-Fi to your Apple TV Kodi disables your internal Wi-Fi antenna, but you can get it back if you need with a USB wireless dongle. (Note: If you're running Kodi from a USB stick, you'll need a USB hub to add a wireless dongle.) If you're looking for the right Wi-Fi adapter, the Kodi/OSMC forums are a great help. We also recommend the OSMC Wi-Fi adapter; it's been certified for all OSMC compatible devices, including the first-generation Apple TV. See at OSMC How to add a hardware HD decoder Since you won't be able to use the internal Wi-Fi card with Kodi, if you're feeling brave enough for a hardware project you can swap that card out for a Crystal HD decoder; there are things that old hardware just can't do. It's a pretty inexpensive card and a simple swap — as long as you have a bit of free time and patience for the stubborn screws on the bottom. The OSMC folks have put together an in-depth guide on how to tackle this upgrade: How to install a Crystal HD decoder in your Apple TV Your tips?

She is scheduled to fly back to her southern California base Tuesday, trainer John Sadler said. "She looks good," Sadler said Saturday. "She ate up. Everything looks tip-top." Sadler, who trains Stellar Wind for Hronis Racing, said Stellar Wind likely will make her next start at home, in the Grade 1, $400,000 Beholder Mile on June 3 at Santa Anita. The race is the former Vanity. Editor's Picks Stellar Wind returns strong in Apple Blossom The champion Stellar Wind started her 5-year-old season in stirring fashion on Friday, taking down the Grade 1, $600,000 Apple Blossom Handicap at Oaklawn Park. Stellar Wind on Friday ran a powerful race in the Apple Blossom, stalking the pace from the rail, moving outside of horses, then running down a stubborn pacesetter in multiple Grade 3-winner Terra Promessa. Stellar Wind covered the 1 1/16 miles in a sharp 1:42.75, winning by 1 1/4 lengths in her first start since finishing fourth to Beholder in the Breeders' Cup Distaff in November. "You're always concerned about fitness when you're shipping out of town, and we did a little bit more with her this year because we knew we'd be running on a surface we weren't quite as familiar with, and so she's good and fit. "She'd been training really well and we thought she'd run well. We're just glad everything worked out." Stellar Wind was the champion 3-year-old filly of 2015. Last year she distinguished herself by twice defeating Beholder in Grade 1 races in southern California. Sadler said he is looking forward to the season ahead with Stellar Wind. "We're hoping she can be a little better this year than even last year," Sadler said. "So, she's definitely in the top group in her division. You know, there's Songbird out there and she's coming back, so there's always a lot of really good horses. But she's one of the best ones out there." More from Daily Racing Form MORE HEADLINES FROM DAILY RACING FORM BET YOUR FAVORITE TRACKS AND GET A $125 CASH BONUS DRF LIVE: STAY INFORMED UP TO THE MINUTE Stellar Wind is a daughter of Curlin, as is Apple Blossom runner-up Terra Promessa. Trainer Steve Asmussen said Terra Promessa will head to Churchill Downs on Monday. Plans for her will be determined, he said, after discussions with Stonestreet Stables. Asmussen said he was pleased with the race from Terra Promessa. "Nothing but respect for Stellar Wind and the champion that she is," Asmussen said. "Terra Promessa, I thought it was a new level of effort for her. Very proud of her effort, and she came out of the race in great shape." Streamline, a Grade 2 winner who was third in the Apple Blossom, will be part of a division of horses trainer Brian Williamson said he plans to send to Churchill. Sadler was winning his first Apple Blossom. He had sent out Switch to a runner-up finish to Havre de Grace in 2011.

Tags Tencent Salary Business Highest-paid exec at tech giant Tencent made $56 million in 2016 AsiaOne | Sean Yap | Monday, Apr 17, 2017 Photo: Reuters Sean Yap AsiaOne Monday, Apr 17, 2017 Want to work in a company that pays its employees and executives the best? In the past, the tech giants of Silicon Valley, including Apple, Facebook and Google, would be foremost on most people's minds. But now, it might be better to look closer to home. In a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Chinese Internet giant Tencent revealed that one of its executives received a whopping HK$311 million (S$55.78 million) in pay and bonus in 2016. By comparison, CNBC reported that the highest-paid executive at Amazon, Andrew Jassy, made US$35.61 million (S$49.67 million) in total compensation; while Apple's top-paid executive, Angela Ahrendts, was paid "just" US$22.9 million last year. According to the South China Morning Post, the amount also exceeded the HK$201 million (S$36.05 million) that Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong Hutchison Holdings paid to its co-managing director Canning Fok, who is Hong Kong's highest-paid employee. Tencent did not reveal the identity of the highest-paid individual. However, its filing did show that its next three highest-paid individuals received compensation packages of between HK$231 million and HK$263 million. Photo: Screengrab / Tencent Meanwhile, Tencent's founder and CEO, Pony Ma - despite not being the best-paid in the company - seemed satisfied with his 18 per cent pay hike last year. His total pay for 2016 was 39 million yuan, up from 32.8 million yuan the year before. Ma has an estimated net worth of US$26.8 billion (S$37.38 billion), and was ranked 31st in the world and 3rd in China in Forbes' billionaires ranking. Tencent, which is based in Shenzhen, is one of China's largest companies and operates web portal QQ.com as well as instant messaging platform WeChat. It also owns a stake in e-commerce platform JD.com. However, the company made headlines for the wrong reasons earlier this year, when a video surfaced online of employees participating in a sexually suggestive party game at a company event.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill today is news of leaked iPhone 8 schematics. Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Thursday. iPhone 8 Schematics: Schematics for what may be Apple’s iPhone 8 have leaked, reports 9to5Mac. The schematics show a smartphone that is much different than what predictions have been expecting. Starting off the strangeness is the moving of the Touch ID sensor from the front of the device to the rear. It also has a vertical dual-camera on the back, which is a change from the iPhone 7 Plus camera. The leak allegedly comes from AAPL supplier Foxconn, but may be of an early design that went unused. iPhone RAM: A new report claims that all three 2017 iPhone devices will have the same amount of RAM, MacRumors notes. According to this report, the tech company will be including 3 GB of RAM in all of its 2017 smartphones. The tech company is expected to release an update to the iPhone 7 line, which will likely be called the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus, as well as the iPhone 8. These devices will likely come out this Fall. Glucose Tracking: Apple may have a secret lab that is working on new ways to track glucose levels, reports CNBC. The idea of finding a new way to track glucose levels was reportedly one of the late Steve Jobs’. A lab in Palo Alto, Calif is believed to be working on this task.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 17 April 2017 | MYT 12:53 PM Apple receives permit in California to test self-driving cars: DMV Apple joins a growing list of traditional carmakers, technology companies, and small start ups to test drive cars in California – all vying to be the first to have commercially viable vehicles on the roads. — Reuters Apple Inc has secured a permit to test autonomous vehicles in California, fuelling speculation that it is working on self-driving car technology in a crowded arena of companies hoping to offer those cars to the masses.  The permit allows it to conduct test drives in three vehicles with six drivers, the state Department of Motor Vehicles said on April 14. The vehicles are all 2015 Lexus RX450h, according to the DMV.  Although it has never openly acknowledged it is looking into building an electric car, Apple has recruited dozens of auto experts in recent years, and the permit pulls the curtain back a bit on any possible plan.  "This does confirm what's long been rumoured: that Apple is at least toying with the idea of getting into the autonomous game in some capacity," said Chris Theodore, president of consultancy Theodore & Associates, and a former vice president at Ford Motor Co and Chrysler.  The permit does not mean Apple is definitely building a car. "This is not necessarily automobiles as initially rumoured, but software or possibly hardware associated with autonomous technology," Theodore said.  An Apple spokesman declined to comment directly on the filing, pointing back to a statement the company made in November when it wrote to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on the subject of regulating self-driving vehicles.  "The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation," Apple's director of product integrity, Steve Kenner, wrote in that five-page letter.  Apple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems.  Apple joins a growing list of traditional carmakers, technology companies, and small start ups to test drive cars in California – all vying to be the first to have commercially viable vehicles on the roads.  Companies that have been issued permits also include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co.  Many companies have said the first cars will launch in 2020 but some experts believe it may take much longer due to regulatory challenges.  Shares of Apple closed down 0.5% at US$141.05 (RM621.18) on April 13. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Technology , Auto Related Stories You May Be Interested Hacker documents show NSA tools for breaching global money transfer system The Chemical Brothers unveil VR experience Under Neon Lights Apple receives permit in California to test self-driving cars: DMV Advance online booking – the end of long waits in line?

(Photo: Rochelle Riley, Detroit Free Press)Buy Photo CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE It takes more than practice to get to New York’s famed Carnegie Hall. It takes money. That’s why a beautiful young ladies choir at the Detroit School of the Arts was working so hard through GoFundMe and private requests so its members could accept an invitation to spend time in the Big Apple and perform as part of a national choir. ► Riley: Husband, wife taking school musicians to New York​   They don’t have to ask anymore. Their trip is funded thanks to a 1941 will and the generous spirit of an Ann Arbor couple who said they wanted to give something to someone who didn’t have what they have — "white privilege.”   Connie Malabed’s fantastic month began with the news that she and the DSA Achievers Lady Ensemble were chosen to perform with members of other choirs across the nation at Carnegie Hall on Sunday.  Their performance is scheduled a week after the orchestra her husband, Ronald Malabed, directs at Renaissance High School, performed Saturday at Carnegie as part of a national band performance. Connie Malabed started the hard work of raising the $27,000 needed to go. By last Thursday, they had raised nearly $14,000 to the take 14 members to New York. The choir has 18 members, but two will be performing in solo competitions this coming weekend. The other two have been selected to tour eastern Europe this summer with an international choir; their rehearsal is this weekend. So Malabad needed to raise $13,000 more in less a week. That a husband and wife were taking their respective music students to perform at one of the world’s most celebrated venues seemed like a great story to me. So I wrote about them. And Nancy Quay, an Ann Arbor psychotherapist, read my column. Quay, 62, and her partner, Sherry Marcy, 74, had recently come into money and wanted to give back. “The stars could not have aligned better,” Quay said. “We looked at a couple of YouTube videos (of the choir), and it made my heart swell.” They caught up with Malabed by phone as she was driving home from school last Thursday. The moment Nancy Quay and Sherry Marcy handed Connie Malabed a check for $13,000.  (Photo: Rochelle Riley) Quay "asked her, 'How much money do you need?'" Marcy recalled. "And Connie said $13,000. And Nancy said, 'OK.' And Connie said, 'Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh, my God!'" When I checked on Malabed a short while later, she said, “I’m sitting here in the house with my coat on. I’m in shock.” The gift was something her grandmother would have wanted, Marcy said. That would be Eleanor Nichols Marcy, who was born in 1874, but lived like it was 1974, Marcy said. “Her intention was to leave a way for her grandchildren to retire, which is sort of special,” Marcy said. “She was a Boston Brahmin who didn’t like to be one. She was supposed to be a debutante, and she refused to do it, and she was a suffragette when it wasn’t popular, and she was a feminist when guys were turned off by that.” And she apparently invested the family money like a Wall Street banker. “She invested in IBM in the 1930s,” Marcy said. Eleanor Marcy’s will created a trust for her two children and a binding agreement that, 20 years after her children’s deaths, would bequeath her fortune to her grandchildren. Marcy's father died in 1997, so she and Quay just received that inheritance this year — 20 years later — and they spent some energy determining worthy causes to support. “We were looking for things that change lives,” Quay said. Marcy and Quay asked Malabed how to get her the money — a simple cashier’s check to guarantee the girls’ Carnegie debut. The choir director invited them to hear the girls Saturday afternoon when they performed at a high tea sponsored by The Society Inc., a national organization that supports youth in the arts. After the girls — clad in royal blue gowns and high tea hats — sang, Quay and Marcy casually walked over and handed Malabed the check First came the squeals, from the girls who didn’t know and from the Society members who didn’t know. Then came the tears. “Oh, my God, you ladies!” Malabed told them. “You are awesome! Thank you so much. I still can’t believe that you’re doing this for us.” The hugging continued for the rest of the afternoon. The girls cried. Malabed cried. The arts advocates in the Society cried. When he heard the story, even the on-duty manager at the Whitney got misty-eyed and hugged me. He later gave each of the choir members a $100 gift card to return to the Whitney for dinner. Marcy said before the event that she and Quay were deliberately looking for a way to help efforts in Detroit, particularly girls. Eleanor Nichols Marcy couldn’t know that the investment she made nearly 80 years ago would make a journey possible for 14 Detroit girls today. But her granddaughter isn’t surprised by the bravado of a woman who was ahead of her time. “She met my grandfather on a train,” Marcy said. “She had two kids in her 40s. She went to college, which was unusual. She was a very bright lady who traveled the world, endowed an orphanage in China. She was just someone who paid attention.” Eleanor Marcy died when Sherry Marcy was a year old. “But apparently, she liked me,” Marcy said. Marcy said she also was motivated after hearing lectures from Peter Hammer and Dorinda Carter Andrews. Hammer, a Wayne State University professor, is director of the Damon J. Keith Center for Civil Rights, and Andrews is assistant dean of the Department of Teacher Education at Michigan State University.  Both made the case that Detroit’s black communities — and its children — could use some support. “They were talking a lot about privilege, white privilege,” Marcy said. “Well, we’re drowning in white privilege, so it makes a lot of sense to hand it over the other way. If we hand it over to our kids, it perpetuates white privilege and that is not in line with what my grandmother would have wanted.” Marcy attended Andrews' lecture Thursday morning, the day the column ran about Malabed’s quest. “I hadn’t finished the paper when she left,” Quay said. “I had finished when she came home. She said ‘Let me tell you about this lecture.' And I told her about your column. The stars couldn’t have aligned better.” Marcy even had lunch with Andrews after the lecture and they talked about how young men have become the focus of “the powers that be” for encouragement and support, which made them worry about girls. That means girls like Destiny Sanders, a 16-year-old junior who plans to study psychology at Spelman College, but says she will always be a singer. Her tears on Saturday, she said, were tears of amazement. "This was heaven-sent," she said. "We knew that we had more money needed to go, and it was a blessing to have them come and say, 'We want to do this for you.' It touched my heart. "It amazed me. I didn't know that people still actually did things like that," Destiny said. "I didn't know people like that still existed." Giving the gift was easy for two women whose spirits have been undaunted for years. "It feels right. It just feels right," Marcy said. Marcy, who was born in Boston and grew up in Chicago, came to Michigan and worked for Pfizer designing computer tools for chemists to use in drug development. Quay, who was born in Coldwater,  was raised in Northville and Sparta. She is a social worker who runs a private psychotherapy practice. They’ve been together for 33 years and married four years ago — as soon as they were legally able. The pair said they wanted to make a “life-changing” donation, and thought the Carnegie visit fit the bill. The pair hope to leave a legacy that will bring pride to their two children. Son Ben, 28, is studying wildlife ecology at Cornell, and daughter Jesha, 27, is attending veterinary school at the University of Tennessee. “She spent all of her time at the barn with horses, and he spent all of his time in the woods,” Quay said. “They followed what they were interested in, and we encouraged them to do that. “We facilitated it,” Marcy added. So on Saturday, they facilitated for others. But she and Quay are living and giving with a sense of humor. On a recent ski vacation, they bumped into a couple from Australia who asked what they were doing. “We’re spending our kids’ inheritance,’” Quay told them. That — and changing lives.

About us Our staff Contacts Home Business Health Science Tech World Samsung Galaxy S8 won’t get Bixby Voice features from the day one April 16, 2017 Paul Smedley Leave a comment It was dubbed as one of the most exciting features on the Galaxy S8, giving competition to Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, Amazon’s Alexa, and Google Assistant. Were you Galaxy S8 pre-order customers planning to try Bixby Voice at launch? “Bixby Voice will be available in the U.S. on the Galaxy S8 later this spring“, This basically mean that the prospective new S8 owner will be able to use Bixby Vision among other features but will not be able to use the voice-activated features of the digital assistant, which were promised to be superior to Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. According to Samsung’s official statement, Bixby voice search functionality is not yet active on the handset and will not go live until “later this spring”. This shouldn’t be a surprise, considering that creating voice-based AI assistants isn’t easy, so a beta version of Bixby is definitely expected. “Bixby Voice will be available in the United States on the Galaxy S8 later this spring”, Samsung’s statement reads. The company did not give an explanation for the delay. However it seems that the second chance won’t be launched together with the handset. Samsung previously described Bixby as “a new way to interact with your phone”, and “fundamentally different from other voice agents or assistants in the market”. Some rumors also say that Samsung may launch its upcoming phablet at the same time. “There’s definitely a high bar to clear here, and Samsung’s track record with software and services isn’t all that promising”, Jan Dawson, analyst at Jackdaw Research, told Financial Times. Therefore, shipping the Galaxy S8 with a crippled Bixby makes the entire thing more confounding. Bixby is content aware meaning that, provided you are within a compatible app, users can refer directly to items on-screen. In the fourth quarter of past year, Apple accounted for 20.3 percent of global sales as Samsung’s share slipped to 18.5 percent due to the debacle of the Galaxy Note7 whose fire-prone battery defect led to its discontinuation.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 17 April 2017 | MYT 8:00 AM What to consider when buying a tablet by jochen wieloch Firstly, buyers must decide which operating system suits them best. — dpa Surfing the net, taking photos, watching films, playing games tablets are not only very portable, but also extremely versatile, allowing you to attach a keyboard to write texts.  But as new models flood the market, it's hard to know which one to buy. Firstly, buyers must decide which operating system suits them best. "Apple has designed the iPad, with its iOS operating system for touch operation, more thoroughly than any other maker," says Alexander Spier of c't magazine. "It also has the largest offering of apps that are optimally adapted to the screen size of tablets." Also, when it comes to updates and security, Apple is clearly ahead of its Android rivals. On the other hand, "Android tablets offer more possibilities for data exchange and customisation options than iOS," Spier says. In addition, the range of devices available is a lot bigger. Beginner Android tablets are available starting at US$40 (RM175). The third option when it comes to tablet operating systems is Windows. This offers almost all of the programmes found on desktop computers, but Spier points to the system's fiddly, hard-to-use menus as well as a restricted app selection. When selecting screen size, think about what you want to use the tablet for. A device with a diagonal screen length of up to 8in (around 20cm) can be held easily in one hand, leaving the other hand free to operate it. Tablets of this size can also be used as ebook readers. However, for anyone who wants to use their tablet as a television substitute, a bigger screen is a better choice. "Those who want to store a large volume of films, music and photos on their tablet should buy a device with the largest possible internal memory," advises Benjamin Barkmeyer from German consumer goods tester Stiftung Warentest. It’s also a good idea to check if there’s a slot for a Micro SD card – an option with most Android tablets, but not iPads. Battery life is another important factor. But that will only truly reveal itself after you have purchased the tablet – "The manufacturer's data should be treated with caution. In everyday life, the running times are often shorter," Barkmeyer warns. Of course, battery life also depends on how you use the device – for example, gaming will eat up power much more quickly than reading texts. If you want to use your tablet as a work tool, then a keyboard is a must. "Some tablets are now available as two-in-one devices with a matching pluggable keyboard," says Barkmeyer. Bluetooth keyboards and mice can also be wirelessly connected to tablets. Spier advises strongly against paying less than US$60 (RM265) for a tablet – cheaper models are slow, with low resolution screens and poor memory and battery life. Worthwhile tablets start at US$100 (RM440). The display should be at least 1,280 x 800 pixels and the memory should be a minimum of 8GB or 16GB. Devices with a better processor, good battery life and Full HD displays start at US$200 (RM880). "For a perfect device with a fast processor for multitasking and demanding jobs, you should expect to pay at least US$500 (RM2,205)," Spier says. —  dpa Related Stories You May Be Interested Hacker documents show NSA tools for breaching global money transfer system The Chemical Brothers unveil VR experience Under Neon Lights Apple receives permit in California to test self-driving cars: DMV Advance online booking – the end of long waits in line?

Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat Apple’s latest iPad delivers high value for a low price relative to its brethren, just like the iPhone SE. That’s kind of the whole point of the device. It lets Apple compete more effectively with Chromebooks, Windows tablets, and Android tablets. And it lets people use a full-sized iOS-flavored tablet without breaking the bank. Which is pretty cool. This thing doesn’t have the best performance, display, camera, or sound that you can get on an iPad. That doesn’t matter. You’re getting a solid iPad at $329. Cool. Accessible. For lots of people. It’s what Apple should have done maybe five years ago. But Apple decided to wait before checking if a lower price could make the iPad more popular. I suspect the strategy will work. It’s good enough, which, I think, is all Apple needs for lots of people to buy it. Maybe my favorite part of the 2017 iPad is the battery life. Using this thing for 16 hours, on and off, on one charge is really nice. (Apple claims you can use it for browsing, watching videos, or listening to music for up to 10 hours.) It’s enough for a tablet, considering that, at least today, a tablet is a secondary device, and you usually have a computer or a phone to fall back on when the battery dies. It just went on and on. The 32.4Wh battery will take a few hours to charge back up, but that’s in line with previous iPads. Above: The back of the 2017 9.7-inch iPad. Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat Thanks to the A9 chip first introduced in the 2015 iPhone 6S and 2GB of RAM, performance is quite good, but it’s not quite as good as what you find on the two iPad Pro devices, both of which carry the A9X chip. The 9.7-inch Retina display looks nice and precise, but there’s something strange about it; my fingers seem to stick on it with friction more than they do on an iPad Pro, and when I tap it, I hear a hollow sound. This is not a True Tone display, it’s not fully laminated, it doesn’t have an antireflective coating, and it’s not a wide-color display. In other words, it doesn’t look or feel as premium as the same-sized Pro version. Sound is good but not awesome. You have two speakers onboard here and not four like on the iPad Pro. The 8-megapixel rear camera works well enough but isn’t impressive if you’re familiar with the dual cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus. At least there’s no camera bump. At 7.5mm, it’s the thickest iPad available today, and with its heft it does hark back to its older predecessors. At just over a pound, it’s just a bit heavier than the smaller Pro model. Unlike the iPad Pro tablets, this one doesn’t have the three-dotted Smart Connector on the side, so you can’t use Apple’s custom-made Smart Keyboard case with it, or other compatible accessories. And unfortunately it won’t recognize the Apple Pencil. You can get around this; there are fine third-party keyboards and stylii to choose from. I like Logitech’s thin and long-lasting $69.99 Keys-To-Go Bluetooth keyboard and Adonit’s sleek $74.99 Pixel stylus, which works with many apps. Just be ready to hear that popping sound each time the stylus hits the screen. And darn it, Siri isn’t always going to respond to you if you say “Hey Siri.” It only works when the iPad is plugged in. But when you zoom out and focus less on comparisons, you have a respectable, well crafted piece of hardware — almost the biggest possible screen for running iOS apps — at an affordable price. The Split View multi-window mode introduced in iOS 9 works very well here, just like on the iPad Pro models, and the display is large enough that watching video in picture-in-picture mode won’t get in the way of whatever else you want to do. If you’ve always thought an iPad might be nice to have but just isn’t necessary due to its price, this is the product that should make you reconsider.

The Vintage Computer Festival Southeast is happening April 29th and 30th. The event is being held at the Computer Museum of America and is, by all accounts, a really cool show. Walk into any package sorting facility or Amazon fulfillment center and you’ll find a maze of conveyor belts, slides, and ramps that move boxes from one point to another. Conveyor belts are so last century, so here’s a fleet of robots. In 2017, the CITES treaty — an international treaty for the protection of endangered species — changed a lot. While the original treaty protected individual species, in 2017, enforcement of this treaty on tropical hardwoods changed to an entire genus. This is a problem when it comes to rosewood; previously only Dalbergia nigra was covered under CITES, now the entire Dalbergia genus is covered. This sucks for guitar makers, but a Dutch guy is making guitars out of newspaper. We’re probably looking at some sort of micarta thing here, but it sounds acceptable. Where did Apple’s Spinning Beach Ball of Death come from? 1984, or thereabouts. The ubiquitous Apple ‘wait’ cursor is from the first versions of the Macintosh Toolbox, and it has remained mostly unchanged all this time. This is Apple Wait, a demonstration of this first spinny ball of death. It’s a Raspberry Pi connected to an Apple monochrome monitor that just displays a spinny wait logo. Check out the video. How do you make strips of RGB LEDs turn a corner? Wire, usually. Here are some corner pieces for WS2812B LED strips. It looks very handy if you’re building a gigantic RGB LED matrix. SHA2017 is an outdoor hacker conference that’s happening this summer. They’re working on a badge, but they need some help. They’re looking for some funding for their ESP32-powered, touch controller, sunlight-readable ePaper badge. If you have a job that likes to sponsor stuff like this, it’s a worthy cause.

I didn’t look too closely, except to register the scruffy anorak, bedraggled hair, stubbled chin and intent, creepy gaze. The longer he stared, the more the conviction came into my mind — he’s going to follow me home. To thwart it, I jumped off the bus a stop early — I didn’t want this man knowing where I lived. Unfortunately, this stop was right in the middle of the vast, shadowy common that I needed to cross in order to reach my house. Even more unfortunately, the man got off, too.

I could hear him a few yards behind, his pace matching mine. When I sped up, so did he.

Then came the same question, a third time. Just a few yards ahead loomed a well-lit road. I decided as soon as I reached the pavement I would run, but before I could, the man sprang from behind, hands on my shoulders, throwing me to the ground. I fell to my knees, trapped beneath him. He was more powerful than me, and I might not have stood a chance, but for two things. First, in the instant of attack, the adrenaline that consumed me transformed my terror into a violent rage, so strong I felt momentarily fearless. Second, I was carrying a heavy bag. Swinging it up wildly, it connected hard on the side of his head. He recoiled and I seized my opportunity — abandoning the bag, I ran. Once I made it home, the police were called and the local streets scoured, but my attacker had disappeared into the night. Jane demonstrates how to get out of a chest hold My experience was all too real, but there’s no escaping the fact that in fiction, on TV and in film, we are surrounded by images of women under threat. Midlife women in danger are TV drama’s default. From Homeland and Line Of Duty to Broadchurch and Apple Tree Yard, the picture of a vulnerable woman in a hostile environment is intensely familiar. Whether raped, robbed, attacked or assaulted, the idea of a lone woman at risk seems to preoccupy our culture. It certainly preoccupies my thoughts. I realise now, years after my experience, that the indelible tension of that adrenaline-filled night has never been far from the surface, erupting in the writing of my novels, which feature a hyper-vigilant female spy. While the vast majority of women will never, thankfully, experience an assault, which of us has not felt nervous walking in unfamiliar places or after dark? With more women divorced or living alone, the fear of doorstep robberies or con artists, who force their way into the home, is unsettling. Midlife women in danger are TV drama’s default. From Homeland and Line Of Duty to Broadchurch and Apple Tree Yard (pictured), the picture of a vulnerable woman in a hostile environment is intensely familiar. Whether raped, robbed, attacked or assaulted, the idea of a lone woman at risk seems to preoccupy our culture Julie Hesmondhalgh in the ITV series Broadchurch in which she plays rape victim Trish Winterman Nor are the statistics reassuring. This month the Office for National Statistics revealed a 22 per cent rise in violent crime across England and Wales in 2016, with violence against women and girls reaching record levels. Knife-point rapes rose 26 per cent and there was a 36 per cent year-on-year increase in sex crimes. According to the charity Rape Crisis, one woman in five aged 16 to 59 has experienced some form of sexual violence. Yet whereas most girls now receive basic self-defence instruction at school, my generation of fiftysomethings got by with nothing more than a rape alarm that emitted a high-pitched shriek. So what can women do to maximise their safety and minimise the chances of attack? Step forward John Aldcroft, a 51-year-old Mancunian with a torso of rock and biceps of steel, who spent his youth serving with the army in Northern Ireland.  He has the quiet, controlled manner of an ex-military man, whose personal mantra is to keep out of fights in case he hurts someone. Yet his first experience of violence against women came very young and left a lasting impression. ‘I was four years old when I watched my mother badly beaten up,’ he says. ‘It’s appalling for a young child to see their mother being violently attacked. It had a devastating effect.’ It also made him want to teach women to protect themselves, so he became head instructor of the British Academy of Krav Maga. The name is Hebrew for close combat, and is a notoriously tough technique focusing on real-life situations developed for the Israeli Defence Forces. John’s celebrity clients include Thandie Newton, the tough lead actress in gripping BBC crime drama Line Of Duty. John’s celebrity clients include Thandie Newton (pictured), the tough lead actress in gripping BBC crime drama Line Of Duty ‘There are no age barriers for attackers,’ he says. You could be 18 or 80. But in the case of potential theft, middle-aged women simply have more nice jewellery and paraphernalia than younger women. ‘The good news is, even if you are not as strong as a man, if you know how to move, you can outwit an assailant.’ John is adamant you don’t have to be ‘a black belt’ to learn self-defence. You don’t need to be overly muscular. You even don’t have to be that fit. I go running every day. I stretch and do press-ups, so I’m confident I’m no pushover. But I’m in for a shock. My lesson involves a few essential moves. The first is designed to free yourself from a bear hug from behind by ducking down, turning to the left and then moving under the attacker’s right side, twisting round to free space for a knee to the groin. THE MOVES EVERY FEMALE NEEDS TO KNOW  NOSE STRIKE  Rather than throwing a punch, which could damage your knuckles or fingers, use the heel of your palm to strike your attacker in the nose or jaw. Use your stronger hand (shown here as the right one), and put the other hand up by your face to protect yourself. Nose Strike GROIN STRIKE  This move is designed to debilitate your attacker. Position both your hands on their shoulder for balance. If you’re right-legged, keep your left leg forward, with your weight on it. Lean backwards slightly as you drive your right knee upwards for maximum impact. Groin Strike GET OUT OF A CHEST HOLD  If you are grabbed from behind in a ‘bear hug’ position with your attacker’s arms above your elbows and across your chest, raise your hands to grab on to their arms. Then quickly turn your head and duck under their arms. Get out of a chest hold ESCAPE A WAIST HOLD STEP 1: When your arms are pinned to your sides, shuffle from side to side to make space and use your arms to hit their groin area. STEP 2: As soon as you have more room, turn your body around and escape. As you turn, use your elbow to strike your attacker’s chest, which should disable him while you make your escape. Escape a waist hold John pins down my arms. I almost faint. We try again and I flail like a landed fish. But after a few attempts, the concept of using the attacker’s strength against him becomes apparent, if not easy. Performed properly, the moves are surprisingly graceful. It’s like ballroom dancing with groin kicks. The knee strike — also known as a knee in the crotch — is the only one of the many moves he shows me that I already know. John explains that these physical techniques are only the tip of the iceberg — it’s psychology that underpins self-defence. ‘We learned the importance of awareness in Northern Ireland. Whenever we were on patrol they told us, if you think you’re being scoped out, change your behaviour patterns.’ John is a great believer in female intuition. ‘The frontal lobe of the brain is what we use for survival. ‘When your intuition kicks in, listen to it. If you have a hunch something’s not right, take preventative action. If you feel you’re being followed, cross the road. If he mirrors you, run.’ Tuning in to your intuition should also enable you to tell when a potential assailant is masking their threat. If someone pulls out a knife and wants your bag or phone, give it to them, don’t fight. Don’t approach them — place your bag on the ground and step away. If the situation escalates, that’s when you need to minimise the impact of the assault. ‘Sometimes people will cloak threatening behaviour in something benign, designed to break down the space between you, like asking directions or for the time.’  John recommends creating as much distance between yourself and an attacker as possible. Be wary of prolonged interaction and, in a street robbery, abandon the idea of bargaining. ‘If someone pulls out a knife and wants your bag or phone, give it to them, don’t fight. Don’t approach them — place your bag on the ground and step away. If the situation escalates, that’s when you need to minimise the impact of the assault.’ Actual conflict is always the last option, yet there are times when a woman should consider acting first. ‘Sometimes, if you realise what’s happening, you will need to make the first move. It gives you the upper hand if they have to react to you. ‘Awareness goes in stages from Code White, which is naïve, to Code Yellow, which is subconsciously aware, right through to Code Black, where you should take action,’ says John, delivering his advice in reassuringly practical military jargon. ‘The state we aim for is Code Yellow, where you’re aware of potential threats, but not over-stimulated by them.’ At the end of my session, my mood is distinctly Code Yellow, but my face is more Code Red. Grappling with John is a thorough work-out. It takes three to six months to gain proficiency in Krav Maga, but John says his one-day intensive course gives women the basic skills. I’m determined to keep it up — I’ve had a glimpse now of that woman who can handle anything the street can throw at her. On a late night out, I suspect John’s advice might just prove your most important accessory. 1. Use your natural defences Make sure all your senses are on alert. Don’t wear earphones; you won’t hear what’s around you. Similarly, if you’re staring at a screen rather than scanning your surroundings, you are an easier target. 2. Focus on body language Look confident and walk with your back straight. People with their head down look weaker. Confidence is dissuasive — an attacker is looking for someone who won’t put up a fight. 3. Dress to defend It’s easier to run in flats, but if you are wearing heels you can take them off and use them as a weapon. Expensive jewellery or accessories in uncertain terrain are a careless trigger, laying you open to opportunistic theft. 4. Avoid cross-body bags These act as a rope around your body, allowing an attacker to control you. If you are pulled, go with the movement, but turn and act explosively. 5. Bluff If you let someone into your house and they turn threatening, make out there is someone else at home. If you feel at risk when walking, bunch your hand in your pocket as though you are concealing a weapon. Letting people know you’re aware is a deterrent because predators want the element of surprise. 6. Run John says: ‘Every woman should practise self-defence, but my most important tip is to run.’ The British Academy of Krav Maga offers a one-day self-defence course for women (krav-maga.org.uk). Jane Thynne’s Clara Vine series is published by Simon & Schuster. Her latest book is Solitaire, priced at £8.99.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Martin Hajek Leaked schematics supposedly show Apple’s iPhone 8 design Chris Smith @chris_writes April 13th, 2017 at 11:32 AM Share Tweet A purported iPhone 8 schematic found its way online, and the leak seems to offer some of the same iPhone 8 design details we expect. However, there are some major differences compared to previous rumors, especially concerning the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and the rear camera. Don't Miss: Amazon just discounted the Echo Dot for the first time this year Posted online on Chinese microblogging site Weibo, the schematic below reportedly comes from Foxconn. As you can see, the schematic suggests the screen will take up most of the front side of the handset. But the home button complete with the Touch ID fingerprint sensor is located on the back, which isn’t in line with what most rumors have claimed so far. A research report from one analyst earlier this week did say that Apple is facing manufacturing issues with a Touch ID sensor embedded in the display, so one solution to fix that problem would be to move the sensor to the back of the handset. Image Source: Weibo The rear camera has two lenses, just as expected. But they’re positioned vertically along the left side of the phone, rather than horizontally like the iPhone 7 Plus. It looks… terrible. Measurements for the phone are also included in this hopefully-fake leak. The iPhone 8 will seemingly be 149mm tall, 72.5mm wide and 7.1mm thin. For comparison, the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 measures 138 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm. If the leak really does show an iPhone 8 design from Apple, it might not be the final choice for the company. 9to5Mac explains that we’re looking at an EVT 03 design, which is short for Engineering Validation Test third revision. EVT represents an early stage of a product’s design, and the device must still pass through a Device Validation Test and Production Validation Test before it’s finalized. This iPhone 8 prototype may be one of the many ideas Apple is toying with, and a version that will may help the company deal with a scenario in which it won’t be able to come up with a viable Touch ID sensor for the screen in time for the iPhone 8’s launch. What’s interesting about the schematic is that it tells the same story that a leak from a few weeks ago offered, when it comes to rear camera shape and Touch ID sensor location. At the time we questioned that rumor, as it seemed to contradict basically every iPhone 8 report coming from trustworthy sources with proven track records.

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website 8  −  three  =  Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Big Pharma has a new contender to worry about… Tech giant Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) has hired a small team of biomedical science engineers to develop revolutionary blood sugar sensors, according to an April 13 report by CNBC. In fact, the team has been quietly developing the devices since before the death of former Apple CEO Steve Jobs. If successful, the advance could help millions of diabetes patients and turn the Apple Watch – which the sensors are rumored to pair with – from a "nice to have" into a "must have." And now, at a time when Big Pharma has been put under the spotlight for exuberant drug costs, unfair pricing practices, and outrageous CEO behavior, Apple may be in the perfect position to snap up market share… The "Glucose Team" Is Taking Over Apple's efforts to jump into the health and science industry have been going on for at least five years. The initiative was set forth by then CEO Steve Jobs, who "envisioned wearable devices, like smartwatches, being used to monitor important vitals, such as oxygen levels, heart rate, and blood glucose," wrote CNBC. Under Jobs' watch, the company snatched up top talent from about a dozen biomedical research firms and placed them on "teams" – such as the "glucose team" or the Apple Watch team – with the intention of merging the two teams' ideas. Accurately detecting glucose levels is no easy feat. In fact, developing the technology is such a challenge that one of the top experts in the industry, John L. Smith, a recognized expert and pioneer in the field of noninvasive glucose monitoring, described it as "the most difficult challenge I have ever encountered" to CNBC. Must Read: Top 10 2017 IPOs to Watch To succeed would cost a company "several hundred millions or even a billion dollars," DexCom Executive Chairman Terrance Gregg told Reuters in 2014, when the speculation started swirling. But the challenge has not stopped Apple from stepping up to the plate. And if the sensors are included in a future edition of the Apple Watch – as suspected – Apple may have a significant advantage over traditional pharma companies. You see, Big Pharma's glucose monitoring systems cost anywhere from $400 to $800 for standard models, while the latest Apple watch retails for $369. Even more enticing, the Apple Watch includes other consumer health-related features, like a built-in heart rate sensor, waterproof capability, and deep-breathing exercises. What All This Means for Investors The line between pharmaceuticals and technology is blurring, and now is the best time to invest in "bioelectronics" – an emerging industry worth over $25 billion. In fact, Global Market Insights reported this industry is growing at more than 10% a year, over 10 times faster than the entire U.S. economy. "The greatest investments of this time are all related to technology," said Money Morning Capital Wave Strategist Shah Gilani. "Tech is taking over. Big data is consuming the market." In fact, Gilani predicts that software and tech companies like Apple and Facebook Inc. (Nasdaq: FB) will completely take over various industries in the future – especially healthcare. "I think this year is going to be great for Apple," said Gilani on "Varney & Co." April 13. "There are going to be some breakthroughs there." Additionally, "Facebook has all of this great data to work with," said Gilani. "If they're smart, they will merge with the healthcare industry in the near future. Think about it – people trust Facebook. People give all of their information to Facebook. Why not use all that Facebook data for your well-being?" And Facebook may already be creeping into the sector… According to CNBC, Apple's "glucose team" was previously led by Michael D. Hillman, who left Apple in late 2015. Curiously enough, Hillman joined Facebook's Oculus as head of hardware last month. Editor's Note: One of the fastest-growing tech investment segments is… cannabis? Yes, you read that right. A high-tech approach to cultivating this ancient plant – that's already legal to use in more than half of 50 states – is generating a multibillion-dollar investment opportunity for early investors.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley receives financial reporting awards Sunday Apr 16, 2017 at 12:51 PM Apr 16, 2017 at 12:51 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — The town has received two financial reporting awards from the Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA), according to Town Manager Frank Robinson. Presented to the town’s Finance Department were the GFOA’s Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting (CAFR) and the Distinguished Budget Presentation Award (DBPA), officials said in a statement. Conferred on the town’s Fiscal Year 2014-15 budget, the CAFR marks the 14th year in a row the town has earned that certificate. As for the DBPA, it acknowledged the FY 2016-17 budget through Dec. 31, 2016, according to the GFOA website. The GFOA established the CAFR and Budget Awards programs in 1945 and 1984, respectively. The goal of the program is “not to assess the financial health of participating governments, but rather to ensure that users of their financial statements have the information they need to do so themselves,” the website shows. Assistant Town Manager Marc Puckett, who leads the Finance Department, addressed the awards’ significance on Thursday. “Receipt of these awards again serves to underscore the town’s commitment to excellence in public service, complete transparency in our operations and accountability to the public,” Puckett said. Fewer than 5 percent of government agencies in the nation earn the CAFR, according to town officials, who called the award “the highest form of recognition in the area of governmental accounting and financial reporting.” Meanwhile, the DBPA is granted to organizations that satisfy nationally recognized guidelines for effective budget presentations that assess how well a budget serves as a policy document, a financial plan, an operations guide and a communications device, according to the town. Budget documents must be rated as proficient in all four of these categories, as well as 14 mandatory criteria within those categories, to receive the DBPA. Founded in 1906, the GFOA represents public finance officials throughout the U.S. and Canada, according to the association’s website, including more than 19,000 members that range from federal to local agencies.

Shari Feist-Albrecht, Pat Apple and Jay Emler discussed at a Kansas Corporation Commission meeting last week their stances on the investigation they opened in March 2015, the Topeka Capital-Journal reported. The investigation is meant to try and accelerate the replacement of obsolete materials in the state’s natural gas pipeline, which could soon become a public safety risk. Atmos Energy, which serves 107 Kansas communities, testified that it would take the company 187 years to get all the obsolete materials out of the ground at its current rate of replacement. Another commission testimony showed about 23 percent of the Kansas pipeline needs replacing. Feist-Albrecht wanted to move ahead with a proposal that sets up a five-year pilot program addressing the issue. But Emler and Apple disagreed with the draft. “My concern is twofold. One is public safety. And there appears to be one company that doesn’t appear to be all that concerned with public safety,” Emler said. “One hundred eighty-seven years means there wasn’t very good planning ... I am reluctant to reward a company that doesn’t plan because that’s what this is. This is rewarding their management team for not doing their job and taking it out on the ratepayers.” Atmos spokesman Jim Bartling said the deliberation between the commissioners was not what the company expected. “We’ve been disappointed multiple times with this,” he said. “But being the eternal optimists that we are, we still think that we can make something work.” Bartling stood by his company’s testimony and that of others participating in the investigation that Kansas pipelines are safe. “Every year, we do leak locating surveys,” he said. “We have constant people that patrol our lines to make sure we don’t have a leak on it. We like to say that safety is our No. 1 priority.” David Nickel, CURB consumer counsel, said the agency’s expert witness also testified the deteriorating pipes don’t raise immediate safety concerns.

Military Decorated Navy SEAL moonlighting as a porn star Decorated Navy SEAL moonlighting as a porn star Joseph John Schmidt has taken it all off in films since 2010. Wife says leadership knew about it. Joseph John Schmidt has taken it all off in films since 2010. Wife says leadership knew about it. Carl PrineContact Reporter Navy Chief Special Warfare Officer Joseph John Schmidt III has been living dual lives. As a member of the Navy SEALs, the 42-year-old boasts a chest of ribbons and medals during his 23 years in the military, including a valor citation for combat overseas. To his East County neighbors and Coronado shipmates, he’s been the married father who has given pep talks to special-needs children in Los Angeles and toured the country recruiting for the elite Naval Special Warfare teams, even serving as the face of the SEAL program on its website. Schmidt is also Jay Voom, the actor in at least 29 porn flicks during the past seven years, from “Apple Smashing Lap Dance” to “Strippers Come Home Horny From the Club.” He has spent most of his time in front of the camera engaging in sex with his wife — porn megastar Jewels Jade — for her website and film-distribution service. But he also has coupled with XXX actresses Mena Li and Ashden Wells, according to marketing materials found by The San Diego Union-Tribune and confirmed by Jade. Schmidt declined to comment for this story. The Coronado-based Naval Special Warfare Command has launched an investigation, and a commissioned officer has been assigned to handle the case. Major questions include whether Schmidt violated rules mandating that SEALs obtain advance approval from their commanders for outside work and whether the SEAL brass has been quietly condoning his film work. The investigation began only eight months before Schmidt had planned to retire, and disciplinary action could affect his rank and pension benefits. “We have initiated a formal investigation into these allegations. There are very clear regulations which govern outside employment by (Naval Special Warfare) personnel as well as prohibitions on behavior that is discrediting to the service,” said Capt. Jason Salata, a spokesman for the SEALs. In an interview this week, Schmidt’s wife of 15 years claimed that many high-ranking SEALs have long known about her husband’s movies and seemed to tolerate his moonlighting. For example, she said, she was invited to the commandos’ Coronado campus to sign autographs for troops after she was named a 2011 Penthouse Pet of the Month. Navy officials said Schmidt did not fill out mandatory paperwork to seek clearance from his chain of command for work as a porn actor. The command did grant formal permission for Schmidt to sell herbal supplements as a side business. The armed forces’ rules for secondary employment have the force of a “punitive instruction,” which means violators can be tried under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for lack of compliance. The military has a long history of punishing active-duty service members and even veterans who do everything from writing unauthorized memoirs, to taking side jobs without permission, to engaging in work seen as detrimental to the military’s reputation. Like other military branches, the Navy bans activities that prejudice “good order and discipline or that is service discrediting,” risk potential “press or public relations coverage” or “create an improper appearance.” For instance: After she posed nude in a 2007 Playboy magazine spread, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Michelle Manhart received a formal reprimand, was removed from her position as a training instructor and was demoted. During a 1980 probe of seven servicewomen who appeared naked in Playboy, investigators also discovered that a male Marine major had posed in Playgirl. The armed forces punished the women with involuntarily discharges and gave the major a formal reprimand, allowing him to remain in the service. SEALs also are barred from employment that discloses secret tactics and techniques, markets the SEAL’s active-duty status or involves a contractor doing business with the U.S. Department of Defense. Many high-profile SEAL misconduct cases have fallen into these categories. In 2012, for example, the Navy formally reprimanded members of SEAL Team Six for helping Electronic Arts design the video game “Medal of Honor: Warfighter.” Similar non-disclosure rules extend into a SEAL’s retired years. In 2014, former SEAL Matt Bissonnette was forced to repay the federal government $4.5 million for writing an unauthorized, first-hand account of the slaying of terrorism mastermind Osama bin Laden. Paying the bills Schmidt’s unlikely entry into the skin trade turns on a very different kind of moonlighting gig he took while serving as a SEAL in Virginia. He and his wife founded the Norfolk-based real estate company Schmidt and Wolf Associates in 2005, according to Virginia state documents. Within two years, losses at multiple rental properties created nearly $1.8 million in personal debt, according to the couple’s Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. Three properties had both first and second mortgages, and bankruptcy records show the pair had resorted to using credit cards to finance loan repayments. Schmidt’s Navy pay was less than $60,000 per year at the time, according to the federal filing. Jade appeared in dozens of porn films after her 2001 debut in “Escape to Sex Island,” but she had left the industry by 2003 to become a wife and mother, attend school for her nursing degree and run the real estate firm. As business losses deepened, she became a stripper to make ends meet, logging long weeks in Las Vegas and sending money home. Then she reluctantly returned to making sex films for the cash, she said. “It’s helped our family. It got us out of a lot of financial issues we were going through,” Jade said. “I could take care of the child. I could try to get us out of financial debt.” When the family rotated to Coronado in early 2009 for her husband’s military service, she stayed in the porn business. Jade said it wasn’t by choice. She discovered that once a woman becomes a name in the porn video and Internet trade, with millions of fans worldwide, she’s spotted nearly everywhere she goes. “Once you’re recognized and you build a brand and you’ve got your fans who know who you are, when you go to try to find a job, you can’t get another job,” she said. Jade said she tried to get a management job at a luxury hotel in San Diego last year. Before she finished her employment interview, a fan recognized her, the gossip quickly spread through that office and she realized she couldn’t work there. She’s currently ranked 79th globally for brand recognition by FreeOnes, a website often used by porn directors to book stars based on their popularity. To maintain that level of stardom in the industry, she said actresses need certain side ventures to lend credibility to their personal brand and to give fans a way to follow their careers. So she launched a website and a pair of online film-distribution lines she said are loss-leaders, driving Internet traffic but rarely turning a profit. To reduce the cost of running these side businesses, she and other porn actors rely on “content trade” — donating time to one another’s self-made films. To further cut expenses, Jade said she recruited her husband to help out as an unpaid performer. She alleges that many of his fellow SEALs watched the videos online. “They knew about it at work,” Jade said. “He got called in and they said, ‘Look, keep it on the low, don’t mention the SEAL name and blah, blah, blah.’ “He was always pretty open about it with the command. I mean, honestly, all of his buddies knew about it. Everybody knew about it,” she said. Military hypocrisy? Although some past and present SEALs have sought to turn their battlefield valor into profit, Jade insisted that she and her husband never asked anyone to alert the media about his porn moonlighting. Other retired SEALs have turned to politics or business to earn a buck or make a name tied to the elite service’s reputation, but she said that is impossible for her husband in the porn trade. “He’s too old,” Jade said. “I’m sorry, but no. You’re never going to be able to contract for a number of different reasons, but mostly because he’s too old. The older guys who are still barely running in the industry got in when they were 20, built a huge name and are still kind of filming grandpa porn.” While Jade has alluded to an unnamed husband who’s a SEAL in several interviews and on social media, the Union-Tribune has found no reason to suspect that she or Schmidt ever used his military career to market their films or herbal products. He has helped to promote her work, however. In a 2013 appearance with Jade on the “Dr. Susan Block TV” show, he spun on a stripper pole while wearing a Santa hat. The marketing for the Internet event played on current events, including the late 2012 massacre of schoolchildren at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut and America’s ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. “America treats sex, not violence, as the biggest threat to families and the nation,” the ad reads. “As long as we do that, we can expect more massacres, at home and abroad. As long as we sanction invasions, executions and drone strikes that kill children while humiliating a decorated general not for bombing innocents but for having an affair, why should we be surprised when one of our troubled young men picks up a few of his mom’s prized military-style guns and mass-murders a bunch of kids on his own?” Jade said she and her husband never saw the ad and were shocked when it was shown to them. She said they would never endorse any statement against the military or the nation’s war policies or inject her husband into political causes. To Jade, the newly announced investigation into her husband’s porn work exposes the hypocrisy of a military she believes is addicted to porn. She said military fans once sent her a photo of their armored vehicle in Iraq decorated with her name on it — misspelled — thanking her for helping them stay motivated through their combat deployment. Jade also claimed that when she was summoned to SEAL headquarters to sign autographs as a Penthouse Pet, she recognized local strippers there giving buzz cuts to recruits. And when her husband was a rookie SEAL, superiors tasked him with toting the unit’s porn cache on a deployment. “It’s very ironic,” she said. “Very hypocritical.” The Navy hasn’t set a deadline for when the investigation is expected to wrap up.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Rumor All Three iPhones Announcing in 2017 to Feature 3GB of RAM – iPhone 8 Will Need Better Exclusives to Warrant a Purchase By Omar Sohail Apr 12, 2017 19Shares Share Tweet Submit Last year’s iPhone 7 Plus came with an extra gigabyte of RAM compared to its smaller screen counterpart, giving future users some encouragement to spend more money to purchase the larger handset. However, that is not going to be the case with the upcoming iPhone 8 and Apple will have to think of other ways to highlight the exclusive upgrades on the phone because according to an analyst, all three models will feature 3GB of RAM. In Addition to 3GB of RAM, All iPhones Getting Announced in 2017 Will Also Provide Support for Fast-Charging There have been conflicting rumors surrounding the hardware specifications of all iPhones getting unveiled during the month of September. On one hand, you have TrendForce saying that the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 will feature 3GB of RAM while the remaining two models will get 2GB RAM. Now, according to Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri (via MacRumors), all three models will be upgraded to 3GB of RAM, according to the following research note: Related iPhone 8 to Feature Invisible Selfie Camera and Touch ID Sensor That’s Beneath the Screen for Maximum Bezel-Less Display “In terms of memory/storage configuration, all three models will likely adopt 3GB RAM; the 4.7”/5.5” will likely have the same storage options as the current iPhone 7/7+ in 32/128/256GB while the 5.8” model looks to be only offered in two memory configurations: 64GB and 256GB. Finally, the 5.8” model will likely have extended battery life with two packs of batteries.” Advertisement For the longest time, Apple has bundled chargers that deliver a low amount of amperage in contrast to the competition. Though you can always purchase high-amperage power bricks or multiple-port chargers down the road, there is nothing like the satisfaction of using bundled accessories because it shows that manufacturers are giving equal importance to the smartphone and its packaged accessories. Related New iPhone 8 Render Shows Vertical Dual-Camera and Rear-Mounted Touch ID Button – Apple Following Samsung’s Direction? All three variants are expected to ship with Lightning ports that will support Type-C USB power delivery, meaning that they will receive current at higher rates to substantially reduce the time those devices are plugged in via the wall charger. Are you excited that you will have much more to carry out on all three iPhones now that all of them might feature 3GB of RAM? Shout out your views in the comments below.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Apr 16th 2017 11:50AM (Adds Apple's comment, background, shares) April 12 (Reuters) - Apple Inc has hired a team of biomedical engineers as part of a secret initiative, initially envisioned by late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, to develop sensors to treat diabetes, CNBC reported citing three people familiar with the matter. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. The engineers are expected to work at a nondescript office in Palo Alto, California, close to the corporate headquarters, CNBC said. The news comes at the time when the line between pharmaceuticals and technology is blurring as companies are joining forces to tackle chronic diseases using high-tech devices that combine biology, software and hardware, thereby jump-starting a novel field of medicine called bioelectronics.

Unfortunately the machines suffered from numerous problems and sold poorly. An improved and lower-priced Apple III was launched in 1981, followed by a III+ in 1983, but the computers continued to be unpopular, and production ceased in 1985.

Pavel Alpeyev An investment by Apple would keep a majority of the semiconductor operations under US and Japanese control and satisfy the respective governments. Photo: Bloomberg Tokyo: Apple Inc. is considering an investment of several billion dollars in Toshiba Corp.’s semiconductor unit, Japan’s national broadcaster reported, raising the prospect that the struggling electronics conglomerate will get a much-needed cash infusion. Toshiba has put its memory chips business up for sale to make up for a writedown of ¥716.6 billion ($6.56 billion) in its US nuclear equipment operations. An investment by Apple would keep a majority of the semiconductor operations under US and Japanese control and satisfy the respective governments, NHK said. While Toshiba has been narrowing the field of interested buyers, there are also signs the process is being put on hold after joint-venture partner Western Digital Corp. warned a sale may violate a contract it has with Toshiba. An Apple bid would add another layer of complexity, given its large cash position and influence as the maker of iPhones. Toshiba’s memory chips are used in smartphones, personal computers and data centers, putting them at the heart of a shift away from hard disk drives.

(Photo : Photo by Brian Kersey/Getty Images) A number of retailers are currently offering the MacBook Air laptop at a massive markdown. Aside from the 13-inch MacBook Air laptop, iPad Air 2 is also available at a discounted price up to $200. The leading provider of technology products, Best Buy, recently posted on their official website a $200 discount on Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air. What is even more appealing to tech fans is that the consumer electronics company is also selling a brand new device with high-end specs. Best Buy is offering the 13-inch MacBook Air laptop for $799 only, which is a $200 lesser compared to its previous price. The popular retail store is reiterating that these 13-inch MacBook Air units are brand new and that they have never been refurbished. MacMall is also cutting off $5 on Apple's new 2017 32GB iPad in Silver. Also, refurbished iPhone 5s Android smartphones (GSM unlocked) are markdown to $99.99, Apple Insider reported. The huge price cut is not only good news for tech fans, but it could also indicate that Apple is going to roll out an entry-level MacBook Air 2017 this year. The Cupertino based tech titan just unleashed the new iPad 2017 to ditch the new iPad Air variant. There's a possibility that the tech giant will do the same for its MacBook lineup. Meanwhile, with the release of the highly anticipated MacBook Air 2017, the tech titan is expected to rectify the previous model's issue by adding features, specs worth the high price tag. The MacBook Air 2017 could probably roll out next month. On the other hand, the tech company changed up its naming scheme when it unveiled its latest iPad. The new iPad is not the iPad Air 3, but simply just iPad. The new Apple device is now commonly referred to as the iPad 2017, Investor Place reported.

That us two years younger than the iPad 4, so it is a nice substitute. Translation: Stock for the iPad 4, which came out in 2012, is running out, and the parts needed to fix broken iPad 4s are low as well. If you happen to have one of these older iPads that needs a fix and still has Applecare, you may get a nice upgrade – but if you’re paying for that replacement, you might just be better off picking up one of the new iPads Apple released last month. The Apple fix staff will ship this replacement whenever an iPad 4 unit is not available. And going from the iPad 4 to the iPad Air 2 should be considered an upgrade. Not only will they benefit from a newer generation product, they will probably get a boost in terms of internal storage also. While the iPad Air 2, introduced in October 2014 is also now discontinued, Apple will continue offering the device as a replacement as its supplies of the older, but still supported 4th gen iPad run out. The Cupertino giant is implementing a new policy under which it will start shipping newer and more capable iPad Air 2 as a substitute for their older devices. Of course, if the replacement doesn’t come for free, turning your iPad 4 in for an iPad Air 2 is not a great idea anymore. If you own a broke down iPad 4, things are looking up for you. Many people complained about the fact that it was too heavy and extremely sluggish. What’s more, the iPad Air 2 s available only in 32 and 128 GB variants.

The marketing blitz behind it probably helped but the question really is, is it worth the download? Apple already has a competent and easy-to-use video app in iMovie, which is also a free download so why the need for yet another video app? That’s because the app’s scope lies firmly in social media territory, as can be evidenced by it being only really usable in portrait mode. I did attempt using it in landscape mode, but was left with a photo and video that I couldn’t rotate. This is probably part of the design — social media videos are, for the most part, meant to be more spontaneous and the trend towards selfie videos requires apps that can be easily used one-handed. As you can export the video from Clips, you can rotate the footage in another app but to make your life easier, just use Clips in portrait mode. Filter fun My favourite part of the app is the filters. There are seven included, which you can choose to apply pre-or post-shooting. Which means you can import your own video, apply said filter or just choose the filter beforehand. The Comic Book filter is definitely going to be a hit: its convincing animated look brings to mind the film Through A Scanner Darkly and I can see budding storytellers using the app for short, fun experimental clips. As the app doesn’t set a limit as to how long a clip can be, being limited only by how much phone storage you possess, you can shoot fairly lengthy videos with this. Here’s a short video of a little fun I had with Clip’s filters:   Testing the new Apple Clips app. Fun with filters, yay #appleclipsapp #appleclips #lego A post shared by Erna Mahyuni (@ernamh) on Apr 15, 2017 at 9:23pm PDT Taking the pain out of subtitles Adding subtitles to video is a painful process, but Clips makes it as easy as narration. You can record your narration as you record, or add it later. The app does a good job transcribing speech and editing the text is as easy as pausing your clip and double-tapping the text you wish to edit. I’d say this would be particularly useful for shared videos for audiences who are either hard of hearing, or want to watch videos with the sound turned off. Clips also gives you quite a few text options — either via narration or through colourful speech bubbles of various designs. The great stop-motion experiment Using a few Legos and the Stop Motion app for comparison, I decided to see how Clips would do as a stop-motion app. While Clips doesn’t have as many bells and whistles, thanks to the ability to trim clips, it is possible to create simple stop-motion clips by stitching a series of photos together. I also appreciated the decently-sized library of background music included with Clips, which takes care of the problem with royalty issues — particularly handy if you’re uploading your video to YouTube. In the end, though, I decided to do a simple video of an unboxing of the latest iPhone 7 Product Red. I imported photos from my library, added captions via Clips, added a soundtrack and also edited the length of the clip as I saw fit. All that took me a little less than 10 minutes: I think setting up the photos took me a longer time and involved more work than using Clips did. Here’s the result of a quick morning’s work:   Unboxing the iPhone 7 Product Red edition. With the help of Lego, lol. Video done with the help of Clips #appleclipsapp #appleclips #iphone7 #iphone7red #iphone7productred #shotwithiphone #shotwithiphone7plus A post shared by Erna Mahyuni (@ernamh) on Apr 15, 2017 at 10:02pm PDT iMovie’s BFF While I don’t think this will replace iMovie or your other dedicated video editing apps, Clips occupies a particular, fun niche. Figuring out the filters and fooling with the voice narration is a fun part of the process and once you get over the initial learning curve, creating videos is really simple. If you’re more the animated GIFs sort, Clips also makes it easy to create GIFs out of your own clips and whatever your finished product, you can easily send the finished result to either social media or messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Messenger and iMessage. It’s actually a good thing that Apple is not going the way of Snapchat and making Clips available only to a closed network. It means more people making videos with Clips and proving an option to those who don’t get or just don’t like Snapchat. What would be cool in the next update? Selfie filters (you know we want them, Apple) and maybe, just maybe, landscape mode support.  You can download the Clips app now for free here on the App Store.                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Watch these awesome drone trick shots!

(Ariane Kunze/The Columbian) Construction is underway on the west wing of the Artillery Barracks at Fort Vancouver Historic Site. Silicon Valley company RealWear is expected to move into the 113-year-old building this spring. (Photos by Ariane Kunze/The Columbian) By Troy Brynelson, Columbian staff writer Published: April 16, 2017, 6:05 AM A   A Kaare Hyde grazed his shoe across the refinished maple floors in the Artillery Barracks and smiled. Hyde smiled at the quirks of craftsmanship in the wooden floor, which oddly switches from 2-inch-wide strips to 4-inch-wide planks seemingly without reason. The nearby stairs are built from ancient oak and fir. Historical touches remain throughout the 1904 building, even as its two floors plus an attic are readied for a high-tech future. Once home to homesick Doughboys, the barracks is now stuffed with modern amenities such as motion-sensitive lights and highly efficient heating and cool units. “The exciting part for me is that we finally have people in the building,” Hyde said. Hyde, the facilities manager for the Fort Vancouver National Trust, spent a recent morning looking over the rehabilitation work. Soon the building will be a home to RealWear, a maker of wearable computers, and dozens of its employees. Mayor Tim Leavitt announced the lease with the Silicon Valley company at his State of the City Address held in the building last month. The announcement marked the arrival of a promising technology company to downtown Vancouver and another anchor to Vancouver Barracks, an historic site in the care of multiple government agencies who want it to sustain itself. “Being able to bring online these commercial uses really allows us to attract more of these public tenants,” said Mike True, president and CEO of the trust. Real deal RealWear signed a letter of intent in late March, formalizing plans to occupy half of the 12,000-square-foot artillery barracks this spring. It expects to bring between 20 and 30 employees to start. There isn’t an official move-in date and the company isn’t yet sure if it will ultimately make the Vancouver offices its headquarters or stay rooted at Milpitas, Calif. RealWear executives had sought a new location somewhere cheaper than the San Francisco Bay area, CEO Andy Lowery said. They looked along Interstate 5 and, while considering Portland, glanced at Vancouver. When they started showing interest, he said a delegation of city officials and business leaders “rolled out the red carpet.” “I feel like we’re Apple Computer or something deciding to relocate our company to Vancouver,” said Lowery. “It’s been an unbelievably welcoming experience.” While not a household name like Apple, RealWear’s hardware has gained traction with its targeted customers — companies such as General Electric and Hewlett-Packard. Its products are designed to boost productivity for industrial workers with technology billed as “augmented reality.” Its flagship device, HMT-1, is a helmet-mounted display and microphone fixed in front of the user’s eye, linking field workers with faraway support staff who can illustrate procedures on a screen worn only millimeters from the user’s face. “It’s an extremely slick way to collaborate,” said Lowery, whose career included stints with another wearable technology startup, Daqri, as well as defense contractor Raytheon. At the Vancouver offices, RealWear will mostly employ people with backgrounds in engineering, Lowery said. Most manufacturing of HMT-1 and other RealWear products will occur in China. The relocation also adds to the professional, scientific and technical services job sector in Clark County. The sector added 600 jobs — 6.9 percent — in 2016, according to the state Employment Security Department. RealWear’s Vancouver offices could employ up to 100 more in the coming years, Lowery said. The 44-year-old military veteran seems more than happy with decision to locate here so far, saying Vancouver has a charm similar to Midwestern cities where he grew up. “I’m definitely a Vancouver Kool-Aid drinker,” he said. Silicon fort? RealWear’s lease is the latest development in the multipronged endeavor to preserve and grow the use of Vancouver Barracks. The site is currently managed by two agencies: its north and west portions are owned by the city of Vancouver and overseen by the nonprofit Fort Vancouver National Trust. The south and east portions are managed by the National Park Service, which took over from the U.S. Army in 2012. Both agencies have made inroads to refurbish the buildings, some of which are more than a century old, and turn them into space for businesses and agencies. The Gifford Pinchot National Forest recently moved its headquarters into a two-story building near Officer’s Row that is managed by the Park Service. With revenues from a recent sale of bonds, the trust has spent more than $8 million since February 2016 rehabilitating the Infantry Barracks, Quartermaster Storehouse, Dental Surgeon’s Office and the Artillery Barracks, where RealWear will be located. In RealWear, the trust may have an attractive lure for new tenants. True said he also hopes to recruit food service companies and arts organizations. “This is a huge milestone, having these buildings renovated and completed,” he said. “I think this will increase the amount of public use and activity.” Still, the buildings will have to compete with spaces in downtown Vancouver and the upcoming Vancouver Waterfront. Kristen Jontos, building manager of the east and south barracks revitalization for the National Park Service, said they believe the historic buildings will probably attract businesses with different cultures than a glassy high-rise might. “I’m probably a little biased because I think these buildings are amazing,” she said. “I do think it’s a bit of a self-selecting process. Different people are going to want different things.” Each of the pockets of growth within Vancouver and Clark County benefit each other, said Mike Bomar, executive director of the Columbia River Economic Development Council, a Vancouver-based organization tasked with recruiting businesses to the area. “I’m really encouraged by it; I think it’s great,” Bomar said. “I think the more we can connect the very short distance between downtown and a really cool, historic district — the better off we’re going to be. It’s a huge asset and we’re excited about it.”   Troy Brynelson Columbian  360-735-4547  @TroyWB  Send an Email Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Fstoppers Took a Look DSLR Cameras Is the iPhone 7 Really Better than a DSLR? Fstoppers Took a Look Tyler Lacoma October 31, 2016 Shares is the iPhone 7 Plus camera really comparable to a DSLR? Along with the big iPhone 7 announcement, Apple made an interesting statement on stage: That its new iPhone camera could compete with a real DSLR camera. At first glance these sounds ridiculous. The best DSLR cameras of 2016 use optical zoom lenses and manual adjustments – how can software compare with that? So Fstoppers decided to check out the claim by comparing the iPhone 7 Plus with the 7-year-old Nikon D300s Short version: It’s not a very scientific study. An iPhone camera and a full DSLR are not so much separate species as different planets. Comparing what they do is very hard. But overall the iPhone seems to fair better than we expected. Image quality, of course, went to the Nikon model, but camera speed was a tie as the iPhone’s software proved a match to the DSLR. For a better idea, here’s a look at the D300 competition. The iPhone 7 actually won the video quality round, but there’s a caveat here: The Nikon D300s’s video sucks – it can barely even make it to 720p. There are DSLRs out there that can do far better, so take this one with an extra-large grain of salt. Another interesting outcome was that the iPhone 7 beat out the DSLR when it came to ISO performance – in other words, it seems the iPhone works better in low light. They didn’t actually test for durability but guessed that the iPhone would win that round, and we have to agree on that point. For more information, you can check out the summary here. Essentially, if you stack the deck with a DSLR that’s seven years old, the iPhone 7 can win in a couple respects, even if you’re a photographer. Frankly, that’s better than we expected the iPhone to do.

Is Pushing Ahead With Testing Self-Driving Cars The California DMV grants Apple a permit to begin testing. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 15, 2017 at 7:49PM Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) autonomous-car plans have been seemingly up in the air for the past year. The New York Times reported in September that the company was rethinking its strategy, laying off "dozens of employees" in the process. A month later, in October, Bloomberg further detailed the shift, saying Apple had "drastically scaled back its automotive ambitions" and was instead focusing on developing autonomous-driving software; Apple was reportedly no longer interested in actually building a car -- even though focusing on software without integrating the hardware is decidedly very un-Apple-like. Apple then sent a letter to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration in December, confirming that it was making self-driving-car investments while offering some input on the proposed Federal Automated Vehicles Policy. The most recent development is that Apple has now secured a permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to test autonomous vehicles. Image source: Getty Images. Last but not least Last week, the California DMV updated its site for autonomous-vehicle testing. Manufacturers that hold permits to test autonomous vehicles are listed in chronological order, and "Apple Inc." is the latest addition. These are the same permits that Uber complained about in December, after the DMV told Uber it needed to obtain a permit to continue testing its self-driving cars. The episode was a bit absurd, since the permits cost just $150, and Uber moved its self-driving-vehicle pilot to Arizona instead, a transition that undoubtedly cost much more than $150. Uber has since relented and obtained its permit last month. (Uber is listed a few spots above Apple.) Bloomberg says Apple is nearly ready to begin testing its autonomous-driving software, and the California DMV permit includes three Lexus hybrid SUVs and six drivers; a driver must be present to disengage the autonomous-driving software if necessary. Manufacturers with permits must also submit annual disengagement reports that detail when a human driver had to take control during testing. Technology first; strategy later The hardest nut to crack when it comes to self-driving vehicles is the software. Most companies have gravitated toward the same set of hardware sensors, more or less. With one notable exception, most approaches include some type of LIDAR system combined with radar and cameras. It's not clear what hardware suite Apple is planning on using, but presumably it is exploring several potential configurations. It seems that Apple's overall strategy is still up in the air. Apple would probably prefer to build its own vehicle with integrated hardware and software, but manufacturing vehicles in volume is incredibly difficult and expensive. Yet autonomous driving as a technology has so much potential to save lives and deliver societal value in other ways -- such as convenience and vehicle utilization efficiency -- that Apple can't ignore it. Given the regulatory considerations, combined with the leaky nature of Silicon Valley, there's no way for Apple to keep its plans completely secret. For now, it looks as if Apple is pushing ahead with testing its self-driving-car software and will figure out the market strategy later.  Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

Ogg April 13, 2017 10:40 am EDT Print Email Tweet Wall Street loves to speculate about so-called dream mergers. This is where you marry two companies together into a powerhouse that becomes almost unstoppable in one industry or across multiple industries. A new report from RBC Capital Markets now suggests that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) could acquire Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS). According to RBC’s report, an Apple acquisition of Disney would merge strong brands together into a media and technology powerhouse that might strike fear in the hearts of Silicon Valley and Hollywood alike. They would also benefit from proposed tax changes coming under President Trump and repatriation of their overseas cash. Perhaps the very first thing that needs to be considered is that an Apple-Disney merger has been pondered about  years ago. After all, Steve Jobs reined over Pixar and Apple simultaneously — and he became the largest individual holder of Disney shares when Disney acquired Pixar in a stock-deal valued at close to $7.4 billion back in 2006. Another issue to consider here is that such a merger could create the first $1 trillion company by market cap. Apple’s market cap is $743 billion now, and it has over $200 billion in cash — most of it locked up overseas that would have to pay a 35% penalty if repatriated under the current tax laws. Disney’s market cap is about $180 billion, so the two companies combined could get to an immediate $923 billion in market cap, before considering whether a deal is made in cash or stock and before considering price changes of the two companies. A merger of this sort was even projected to be accretive to earnings in the RBC report, by roughly 15% to 20% at a 40% premium deal, even though it is hard to assign an absolute probability. The report presumes a 40% premium price, or about $157 per Disney share. That would put Disney at about $237 billion in market value, which gets an Apple-Disney to right at $1 trillion. RBC’s report said: We like Disney on its fundamentals, but a mega-cap M&A narrative is additive to the rerating story. An Apple-Disney combo would create a $1 trillion company with almost limitless opportunities in content and technology… Content is a major focus for Apple, target size is not an issue, and Disney offers an avenue to diversify away from hardware without diluting the strong Apple brand. RBC’s Steve Cahall, who covers Disney for RBC, said on CNBC that the likelihood is low — above zero — but his discussions with institutional investors indicate that a deal of this kind is getting more attention. Creating a dream merger is easier to put on paper than it would be to accomplish. Still, there are actually very few overlaps that would create a blockage effort by regulators. Disney has no serious efforts in electronics, tablets, computers and smartphones. Apple is not a serious feature film maker, sells no toys (outside of its smartwatch anyway), has no theme parks and doesn’t have major networks like ESPN and ABC. Theoretically there would be no reason for regulators to block this merger. RBC further said: There are plenty of factors to consider, but such a deal would create a tech and media juggernaut like no other and instantly scale Apple’s services, content and media portfolio, which would make the case for  a higher valuation. While the report goes on and on about the benefits of a merger, tie-ups of this sort have a very mixed reception and outcome. Perhaps a walk through history would have suggested that Jobs might have been more interested in acquiring Disney than Tim Cook would be. Despite the report signaling that investors more recently have warmed to a deal of this sort, this seems like a report full of more hope and direction rather than a report based on what is actually coming down the pipe. As for a caveat, we can all admit by now that anything remains possible in this day and age of megacap stocks. Disney remains one of the 24/7 Wall St. 10 stocks to own for the decade. Disney shares were last seen trading up 0.8% at $113.96, in a 52-week range of $90.32 to $114.10 and with a consensus analyst target price of $118.04. Apple shares were trading up 0.2% at $142.13 on Thursday. The 52-week trading range is $89.47 to $145.46, and the consensus target price is $147.61. While investors have this speculative cap on: imagine which companies might get speculated to become the new Dow Jones Industrial Average stock if these two Dow components became one.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Computers Image Source: Aaron Yoo The new MacBook Pro has a shiny new problem Chris Smith @chris_writes April 13th, 2017 at 6:49 PM Share Tweet Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro has had to endure plenty of criticism since its introduction. Some people complained about the lack of ports, others wanted more RAM and better graphics. Then there was the battery life controversy, and some users experienced some screen issues — both of those were fixed. Now, new reports from MacBook Pro buyers say there’s one other issue to deal with: A popping sound coming from the computer. Don't Miss: How to get two Joy-Con steering wheels for Mario Kart 8 on the Nintendo Switch for $1 Users have said that, the sound is comparable to “slowly squeezing a plastic bottle,” 9to5Mac reports. Some users say they’ve heard it during peak performance processes including gaming or video streaming. As soon as the fans start to kick in to dissipate some of that heat, the popping sound also arrives. Others believe it’s related to the MacBook’s hinges, as the sound may be caused by the plastic mount or hinges, which may be affected by the extra heat. It appears the issue seems to be affecting mostly 15-inch MacBook Pro users. These laptops have bigger screens, which are heavier. If there’s a problem with the hinges, the extra weight may explain why the sound is heard predominantly on the bigger notebook. One user was able to replicate the sound by pressing below the Apple logo on the back of the screen, towards the hinge. Others have confirmed these findings. A different theory that’s yet to be verified by more users says that the popping stops when using dongles with the MacBook. One other user took the device in for service and was told that a $130 repair fee is in order. “I took my laptop in to the genius bar for this popping noise,” user ACA25 explained. “They said it is caused by this small dent on the bottom casing hitting the fan. They told me I had to replace the entire bottom casing for $130. Not covered under warranty because it’s user inflicted damage / a wearable part.” After paying the fee and having the bottom case and fans services, ACA25 still experienced the same popping noise. A different user had the entire top case replaced by Apple, and the popping sound is still there. Read more about it on Apple’s forums.

Networking | 10 Apr 2017 | Print  | Comment (17) Verizon to Drop Email Service by Josh Centers If Verizon is your ISP, and you use a verizon.net email address, we have some bad news: Verizon has announced that it’s shutting down its email business. This move may affect more than 1100 TidBITS and Take Control readers. (Joe Kissell addressed a number of the issues raised by Verizon’s move in “FlippedBITS: Misconceptions about Changing Email Addresses,” 4 March 2014.) Verizon hasn’t specified exactly when the shutdown will happen, but the good news is that you will be able to keep your verizon.net email address. Now for some potentially bad news: if you decide to keep your Verizon email address, you’ll have to use it with the free AOL Mail service. Verizon purchased AOL in 2015 in what was thought to be strictly a content play, but now it looks as though Verizon had some other ideas in mind as well (see “Verizon to Buy AOL,” 12 May 2015). The upside if this approach is that Verizon will transfer your email messages, contacts, and calendars automatically. If you decide to switch to another email host, you’ll have until the shutdown date to migrate your email and other data to your new address. Verizon says that when you log into webmail.verizon.com, you should see an “Email service notice” with further information and instructions. Verizon also says that it will post the shutdown date there. I recommend transferring your existing verizon.net email address to AOL Mail, even if you don’t plan to use it. That way, even if you switch providers, you can still have AOL Mail forward any stray messages to your new address. There are a couple of ways to do this: Techwalla explains how to set up forwarding from AOL, while the Houston Chronicle describes a method that takes advantage of Gmail’s POP3 import to download mail directly from AOL. This latter method should also work with most other email providers. If you’re shopping for a new email service, we can offer a few suggestions. Google’s Gmail is an obvious choice, and it’s TidBITS publisher Adam Engst’s preference. Gmail is free and offers innovative features, but it’s designed to be used via its Web interface or native iOS apps. Or, you can be like Adam and use Mailplane, which wraps the Gmail Web interface in a native Mac app (see “Zen and the Art of Gmail, Part 4: Mailplane,” 16 March 2011). If you want to access Gmail via Apple Mail or another standard IMAP client, you may run into usage quirks, since Google bolted on Gmail’s IMAP support afterward. Apple’s iCloud email is another obvious choice, though it’s not as feature-rich as Gmail. Plus, if storing your mail in iCloud pushes you over the 5 GB of storage space that you get for free, you’ll need to pay Apple for more. However, iCloud email is second to none in terms of integration with Apple devices and can be used on other platforms. Our own Michael Cohen has been using it as his primary email account since the days of iTools. Several other TidBITS contributors and I use FastMail, which is a paid service, but it works well with Apple Mail, offers excellent customer support, and lets you use your own domain name. FastMail is the only non-Apple email provider I’m aware of that offers IMAP push email on iOS. FastMail’s spam filtering isn’t as good as Gmail’s, but I’ve found that C-Command Software’s SpamSieve does a fantastic job. (TidBITS members receive a 20 percent discount on SpamSieve.) The painful part of any email migration is moving existing messages from your old account to the new one. Gmail and FastMail both offer instructions on how to do this. You can also use Apple Mail to transfer mail between accounts manually by copying messages from a mailbox in one IMAP account to another mailbox in a different IMAP account. We’ve found that such transfers usually work fine for a relatively small number of messages, but trying to do a complete migration that way may require a lot of babysitting, restarting, and verification work. Email is a complex topic, so if you have questions that you’d like us to cover more in-depth in future articles, let us know in the comments!   Create a Squarespace website to launch your next idea.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Jeff Hecht  2017-04-10 16:03 One important note, and one additional option to consider. Verizon is handling this oddly, and their FAQs say they will notify you when it's time to move. So you will not find any notice in your Verizon Webmail (or wherever you get your Verizon email) until they're ready. Also, you can use Apple Mail to download GMail with POP3, if that works for you. Be aware that with POP3 GMail keeps spam in a folder that you can only see in webmail. Reply Lindsley Williams   2017-04-10 16:54 In another list community, I read that Google Docs is not HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) compliant. Is there a way to establish if the various email providers are or can be set to be so? Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-10 17:16 Google is your friend: http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q=hippa+compliant+email+providers Sounds like the free version of Gmail is not HIPPA-compliant, but the paid version is. Reply gastropod  2017-04-10 19:12 Well, it's HIPAA compliant IF you have a signed contract for your circumstances. E.g. paid Google Docs has HIPAA on a feature checklist, which means that they're willing to enter into such a contract. At my university, Google Docs (logged into the correct way) is HIPAA (and FERPA) compliant because lawyers made it so, but if I just got a paid Google Docs account for myself, it wouldn't be. Reply Linda Hackling  2017-04-13 14:14 So many get this wrong. It's NOT "HIPPA." It's HIPAA." Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act." Reply Scott Hoenig  2017-04-10 16:58 It seems like if you use the Mac Mail program for your mail client, or any other mail client, the SMTP/POP settings will continue to work. You have to tell them you want to keep your Verizon.net address, but that's it. The only change would be if you want web mail access. So Verizon is keeping its mail servers--they're just dropping support for their web mail application. That's what I can figure out from the FAQs they have. Reply Scott Hoenig  2017-04-10 21:58 I forgot to mention that you also need to make sure you set your "new" AOL webmail password to match your existing Verizon mail password, or you have to change that in the Apple Mail settings, as well. Reply Peter Flint  2017-04-10 21:19 Just an aside that in addition to Mailplane, Postbox works pretty well with Gmail as an alternative to Apple Mail, and looks and feels very similar to Mail, in a good way. I made the switch a few years ago when Mail got wiggy with Gmail. No regrets. Reply linda  2017-04-11 01:01 Another very good paid email service is Hushmail. They do support imap for the iPhone. They have personal and business plans with varied data storage. Works with Mail/Thunderbird/Postbox, etc. or their web interface. They even have free web only accounts. You can send encrypted emails, have aliases, security features, HIPPA-compliant, and they are pretty reliable. Reply rwwilson147  2017-04-11 02:19 Yup, Email is a complex topic. I left ATT as an ISP a few months ago and my swbell.net att.yahoo email account seems to have lost its outbound mail function. I've been using Thunderbird for many years but it looks like I'm going to need a new client. I'm having to use the online Yahoo mail site for swbell.net email Send function now, which I don't like much. Rather better to have the whole database including Sent, etc., on one's hard drive. Do you have suggestions for me? Thanks for you work and any suggestions you may have to ease my transition. Richard Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-11 10:15 This article should help! http://tidbits.com/article/14554 Reply Carol Sierzega  2017-04-11 10:42 I found that the Email migration from Verizon to AOL to be smooth and simple. You should, however, check your AOL webmail settings on the AOL site. AOL mail is very serious about marking emails as spam, even from some email senders that were not spammers in the Verizon email. I found several in my AOL Spam folder that I actually wanted to receive in my Apple Mail inbox. It's easy to change the AOL Mail setting for emails that are not spam so the emails that you want will land in your Apple Mail Inbox on your Mac. Reply David Laffitte  2017-04-11 16:46 No info from Verizon regarding the change. Nothing from them. Nothing when I go to webmail site. Dead silence from VZ. Reply Anonymous  2017-04-13 11:17 My transition went smoothly, but I'm still mystified about the whole IMAP/POP thing. And yes, I've looked at the Take Control book. I use Apple Mail because I want my messages to live in folders on my hard drive, but I also want to avoid downloading the read messages I don't want to keep on both my phone and laptop. My somewhat kludgy workaround is to look at them first in the web interface and delete anything I don't want to keep, check the Spam box for errant good stuff, then download into Mail on my devices. There's got to be a better way. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-13 14:27 There is, and it's IMAP. :-) This article from 2013 (which appears in an updated form in our "Are Your Bits Flipped?" book), should eliminate your confusion. http://tidbits.com/article/13692 The full book is here: http://www.takecontrolbooks.com/flippedbits Reply Scott Randell  2017-04-13 18:36 I actually have not received anything from Verizon notifying me of this. I just logged on, and not a message about that in sight. Where is this coming from?

For example, the former Debenhams building in Derby is now up for sale along with six other nearby properties, which may be bought for retail use. In recent years, several units have been snapped up by food and drink outlets as cafe culture grows but, ultimately, our city centre need shops - and good ones to keep drawing us in and reminding us that buying online is not always the best solution. So, if you could have your dream scenario, what stores would you really like to see come to our city? NOSTALGIA: 18 shops we have loved and lost in Derby Many of us travel to larger cities, such as Nottingham, Birmingham or even Manchester or London, to get our fill of a broader range of shops - but what would keep us in Derby? Here, we look at what stores people would like to see in the city. Feel free to add to the wishlist! Ikea Yes, we know it's a BIG dream but wouldn't it be great if we had an Ikea on the outskirts of Derby? Loads of us get in our cars to head over to the Ikea at Giltbrook Retail Park, Nottingham, and some even drive to the one at Wednesbury, near Birmingham, such is the lure of the Scandanavian homewares store. After all, it's worth a trip for the hotdogs alone, or the meatballs. Would Derby people like their very own Ikea? You bet. MORE ON IKEA: The nine types of Derby people you always see in IKEA Ted Baker We'd love a bit of Ted Baker in Derby, wouldn't we? The clothing and accessories brand is a touch of class and it's a tad annoying to have to head to the likes of Nottingham to find a Ted Baker store. After all, Derby is home to the luxury brand's European distribution centre! Talking of which, couldn't it find a quiet corner there to house a Ted Baker Outlet store? Nottingham folk would be driving over to Derby in their droves to come to that. MORE ON TED BAKER: Clothing brand brings distribution centre to Derby House of Fraser Major department stores are always a winner and many people say they travel to neighbouring cities to shop at places like House of Fraser. We love the beauty counters, the smell of fine perfume, the array of high-end goods, the formidable choice - even if we can't afford much! Apple Shop Apple products dominate our lives these days and yet Derby hasn't got an Apple Shop, like the one at the Meadowhall shopping centre at Sheffield, or the Apple Store at Birmingham. Both cities are a bit of a trek if you want to get some Apple advice or gaze in wonderment at the latest products from the Apple geniuses. It goes without saying that we would like an Apple Shop. Hotel Chocolat It's a no brainer - who wouldn't want a really high-class chocolate shop? Hotel Chocolat is jam-packed with luxurious sweet treats, like the Extra Thick Rocky Road Caramel Easter egg, below. It's £27 but, hey, how could you fail to impress? Better still, how about a Hotel Chocolat gift shop AND cafe in Derby? That would do nicely, thank you. Ralph Lauren Outlet Store Ok, so you can buy Ralph Lauren clothing from various outlets but wouldn't it be great to have a huge Ralph Lauren outlet store in the city? You often see locals sporting the famous polo player logo on their shirts and sweaters, which don't come cheap but are renowned for their quality. We know of people from Derby who drive to the York Designer Outlet to have a splurge at its Ralph Lauren Outlet store. Let's have one in Derby please. SHOPPING INFO: Easter 2017 opening times at Asda, Aldi, Lidl, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Farmfoods, Tesco, Intu Derby Mango Mango is another brand Derbeians love and a straw poll of the office brought this to the fore. Mango specialises in clothing for men, women and children and does plus size too. You'll often find Mango housed within major department stores such as the aforementioned House of Fraser or John Lewis - did I mention we could do with a John Lewis, too? This is by no means a definitive list. If you have a shop you would like to see in the city, do share your ideas by commenting below.

The permit allows it to conduct test drives in three vehicles with six drivers, the state Department of Motor Vehicles said on Friday. The vehicles are all 2015 Lexus RX450h, according to the DMV. Although it has never openly acknowledged it is looking into building an electric car, Apple has recruited dozens of auto experts in recent years, and the permit pulls the curtain back a bit on any possible plan. “This does confirm what’s long been rumored: that Apple is at least toying with the idea of getting into the autonomous game in some capacity,” said Chris Theodore, president of consultancy Theodore & Associates, and a former vice president at Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Chrysler. Toshiba’s Chip Business: Apple to support bidder financially The permit does not mean Apple is definitely building a car. “This is not necessarily automobiles as initially rumored, but software or possibly hardware associated with autonomous technology,” Theodore said. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment directly on the filing, pointing back to a statement the company made in November when it wrote to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on the subject of regulating self-driving vehicles. “The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” Apple’s director of product integrity, Steve Kenner, wrote in that five-page letter. Tesla to launch semi-truck in September Apple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. Apple joins a growing list of traditional carmakers, technology companies, and small start ups to test drive cars in California – all vying to be the first to have commercially viable vehicles on the roads. Companies that have been issued permits also include Alphabet Inc’s Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co Many companies have said the first cars will launch in 2020 but some experts believe it may take much longer due to regulatory challenges.     Read more: Apple Inc , DMV , Tech Read full story Recommended Stories Toshiba’s Chip Business: Apple to support bidder financially The US firm plans to financially support Taiwan’s Hon Hai Apple eyes backing Hon Hai bid for Toshiba chip unit: report Apple hopes to secure stable supplies of the key parts by supporting Hon Hai's bid Tesla to launch semi-truck in September Tesla last year sold 84,000 cars, generating $7 billion in revenue Facebook Conversations Leave Your Reply Below Click here to cancel reply.

Actually, they’re even better than Apple’s AirPods if you run or work out at the gym, because they offer the same great sound but the rubber tips actually stay in your ears. $150 is a fair price for Apple’s latest Beats buds, but you won’t have to pay that much if you act fast. Amazon just put the new BeatsX Wireless In-Ear Headphones on sale for the first time ever, dropping the price to $129.99 in all four available colors. Here are some highlights from the product page: Connect via Class 1 Bluetooth with your device for wireless listening Up to 8 hours of battery life for when you’re on the go With Fast Fuel, a 5-minute charge gives you 2 hours of playback when battery is low Take calls, control your music and activate Siri with RemoteTalk What’s in the Box: Beatsx earphones, eartips with four (4) size options, removable secure-fit wingtips, pocket-sized carrying case, lightning to USB-A charging cable, Quick Start Guide, warranty card BeatsX Wireless In-Ear Headphones - Black Too low to display Available from Amazon BGR may receive a commission Buy Now Follow @BGRDeals on Twitter to keep up with the latest and greatest deals we find around the web.

Whether you are an enterprising app developer building the essential software to bring a virtual Taylor Swift into your Slack chats, or just lonely and in need of a dumb, annoying virtual friend to message you on Facebook, we seem to be clear on one thing: many experiences, apps, sites, and products are breathlessly going to be replaced with bots. (Unless they are being replaced with VR. Or AR. Or a typewriter keyboard for your iPhone.) It’s official: “bot for X” is the new “Uber for X”. And sure, bots are cool. Ever since ELIZA struggled to pass the Turing Test and HAL 9000 murdered his crew (later reincarnated in a hardly-remembered Apple Super Bowl commercial) we’ve been infatuated with the idea of computers as our inevitable sidekicks. Bots center around one specific niche aspect of artificial intelligence: conversational understanding. Human factors experts have long been enthralled by the idea that a more natural way to communicate with computers would be through speech, and we’ve spent the better part of a century building to a point where natural conversations may soon be a reality. While this is indeed an important step forward in human-computer interaction, it is truly just one small part of what AI is about—and not the part that will matter the most for the enterprise companies who actually buy almost $4 trillion in software and services each year. Bots are the new command line Today, most bots just provide a wrapper around existing functionality. Much as in the early days of graphical user interface (GUI), the point-and-click interface provided different ways of achieving the same tasks you could do on the command line, most bots provide an additional channel with which to do tasks you likely often do another way. Instead of speaking a specific sentence, you can open the Weather app on your iPhone. You can open your task list and type “Pay the power bill.” You could search Google for a viola joke. Many of today’s bots are kind of a hipster façade around the same basic command line interfaces consumers abandoned in the 1980s. They require specific syntaxes and understand only a limited vocabulary—but they sure have personality! format /q /fs:fat /v:mydisk wasn’t nearly this funny back in the day. While the added convenience of language recognition is a benefit, until bots are capable of performing very complex and novel tasks that richly combine actions and context across the boundaries of apps and sites in unique ways the first time they are asked, we will be limited to trying to remember the 489 commands Siri recognizes. (Yes that link is a man page for Siri. ~sigh~) The rise of headless AI But I’m not down on bots. I’m just a lot more excited by the less-flashy flavor of AI that is changing the nature of work itself: headless AI. Headless AI is the application of artificial intelligence to vastly improve internal business processes. It is fully transforming the crucial machinery of business—processes like hiring, lead generation, financial modeling, and information security. Legacy software has become commodity in all of these areas, and purpose-built AI solutions will get a larger and larger wallet share of these huge enterprise cost centers. Headless AI combines machine intelligence and learning loops to constantly evolve. Because these solutions plug into the data lifeblood of a company, they become incredibly valuable as the algorithms adapt to the patterns that work. I call this form of AI “headless” because, unlike bots, the value is mostly not about the personality. Headless AI works with humans and augments their strengths; it doesn’t try to replace them. It gives people superpowers. While being able to talk to your CRM is cool, having a sales platform that accurately predicts the 100 opportunities you can close this quarter is worth breaking the bank for. Having a cute avatar answer your customer support chats seems nice enough, but predicting ahead of time what areas of your product will get support requests so that you can fix them before customers suffer is pure gold. It’s happening! (already) Though bots get all the glamour, headless AI is quietly happening everywhere already. These new platforms are generally purpose-built solutions optimized around specific domains and outcomes data. They learn not from people talking to them, but by voraciously chomping up all of the relevant proprietary data fed into them. The best systems employ learning loops and massive streams of incoming data to constantly improve. This creates a multiplier effect: the earlier and more pervasively an organization rolls out headless AI solutions, the more quickly the positive results compound. If you wait a year to deploy, you don’t just lose the year of improved productivity — you lose the year of learning and adaptation of the software to your company’s patterns. This puts you doubly behind. Companies like Apple, Expedia, and Johnson & Johnson use Textio’s augmented writing platform to chop weeks off the time it takes them to fill open jobs. DeepMind helped Google reduce power consumption in their data centers by 15 percent. A former NSA analyst created Area 1 Security to predict cyberattacks before they happen. These new headless AI companies, and dozens of others, are helping enterprises make radical productivity leaps today that they haven’t seen from software in decades. Headless AI is where the money is I’m not sure if there’s a revenue model that works for bots. I guess we will see. People are trying to figure that out. I’m thankful I don’t have to! What I do know is that there is a lot of money to be made in transforming the efficiency of core enterprise functions. This is what headless AI is all about. If you can improve a crucial business process in a decisive way by a clear and measurable amount, that is incredibly valuable. What is most game changing about this kind of software is that it is purely quantitative. Unlike a bot, where the potential return on investment is fairly qualitative (“customers liked interacting with the bot”), most headless AI is fully in the realm of predicting the future and then helping you change that future. Something where the return on investment is measurable and evident. Improving, in real life, the quantity, quality, and demographics of the people who walk through your front door with resumes in hand… how much is it worth to more quickly hire better people than your competition? If you can predict exactly who will buy what, when… how much could you improve your customer experience? Because this kind of software proves itself through the numbers, it is inherently valuable and easy to budget for. Headless is where the real AI money is. Headless AI everywhere In the near future, every core business function will have been transformed by AI—hiring, sales, security, marketing, finance, manufacturing… everything. Purpose-built headless AI platforms will provide the new infrastructure which will drive every business. The enterprises who are already on this train are getting an outsized advantage until everyone else catches up. Legacy software will get squeezed down into a smaller portion of the IT wallet as the most valuable services become the native AI platforms—just as form-based desktop software got squeezed out by the cloud in the last generation. Bots are here to stay. They’ll keep getting headlines. “OK Google, search for tacobot.” But the real enterprise revolution is happening in the companies who are using headless AI to transform their core businesses.

Customers who need to replace their fourth generation iPad will now get a newer and more capable iPad Air 2 as a substitute from Apple Stores and authorised service providers, a media report said. Apple is doing this because the company has no stock left of the aging and now discontinued fourth generation iPad, 9to5Mac website reported on Saturday. Apple has also asked its staff to inform customers of the replacement unit’s colour and capacity. The iPad Air 2 introduced a new gold colour option, and has 32GB and 128GB storage options while 16GB and 64GB models were discontinued. For that reason, the users may receive a slight upgrade in storage when getting a replacement in addition to the device’s newer and more powerful internals overall.

Donklephant Primary Navigation Please select a menu in this location Home Mobile OnePlus 5 vs. Nokia 9 – Best Display, Software and Hardware Comparison By Elena Anderson. Published on April 16, 2017. 0 Generally we are used to seeing battles carried on by tech giants such as Samsung and Apple. However, every once in a while we see that a smartphone manufacturer comes out of the shadow and brings some competition to the giants. This is the case with Nokia and OnePlus, who have created quite a niche for their products. Display According to the rumors, Nokia 9 might come together with a 5.5 inches QHD OLED display, which presents an 1440×2560 pixels. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 5 should sport a 5.5 inches display too, except that it will be a QHD AMOLED one. Design For now we don’t know anything about what type of design Nokia will employ for their product, but we know that the OnePlus 5 will include a ceramic build, similar to the one found on the Xiaomi Mi Mix. Moreover, there are rumors that the OnePlus device might choose to go for an entirely glass design, in order to offer their product a premium look and feel. Software and Hardware Both OnePlus 5 and Nokia 9 are said to run on the latest Snapdragon 835 CPU, paired with 6 GB RAM. Also, both of them might offer two storage options: 64 or 128 GB. Due to these hardware aspects, most likely both of them will run Android Nougat. Camera Nokia 9 should come with an impressive 22 MP camera which uses dual lens and Carl Zeiss optics. On the front, it would have a 12 MP snapper. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 5 device will have a 23 MP back camera and a 16 MP front one, so better than the Nokia device.

Apple is doing this because the company has no stock left of the aging and now discontinued fourth generation iPad, 9to5Mac website reported on Saturday. Apple has also asked its staff to inform customers of the replacement unit's colour and capacity. The iPad Air 2 introduced a new gold colour option, and has 32GB and 128GB storage options while 16GB and 64GB models were discontinued. For that reason, the users may receive a slight upgrade in storage when getting a replacement in addition to the device's newer and more powerful internals overall. --IANS sku/sm/vt SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features No bars on highways Rare April snow, heavy rains cut off Kashmir Dalai Lama's Arunachal visit rattles China, jubilates exiled Buddhists Cartoon: Aadhar everywhere!

(NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill today is news of more iPhone 8 delay problems. Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Wednesday. iPhone 8 Delay: Another report claims that Apple is having trouble with its iPhone 8 production, reports 9to5Mac. A recent analyst report says that the tech company is having trouble with production of its new TouchID sensors. Rumors claim the sensors will be below the smartphone’s display. AAPL reportedly wants the iPhone 8 to have no front bezel. The problem means that only a small amount of the new sensors are being made. If the issue continues, then the company may drastically redesign the iPhone 8 before its release later this year. iOS 10.3.2 Public Beta: The second iOS 10.3.2 public beta is now available, MacRumors notes. The beta came out about two weeks after the first public beta of iOS 10.3.2. The developer version of this beta came out a couple of days ago. The beta doesn’t include any major new features. The iOS 10.3.2 update is a small one that will most likely just focus on fixing bugs and increasing stability. Clips App: Apple’s new Clips app is taking off, reports AppleInsider. The tech company’s app for sharing videos now has at least 1 million downloads. The app was only released a few days ago. It allows users to easily edit videos and share them with friends or post them to social media. At its peak, the app achieved a rank of 28 on the App Store.

According to a memo obtained by 9to5Mac, Apple has basically run out of that old iPad and is now replacing it with the iPad Air 2, which was released in October of 2014. Apple recently discontinued that device as well, but it was manufactured for a good two and a half years, so the company should have plenty of stock left to offer customers for a while. Apple has told its employees to inform customers of the iPad Air 2's various colors (it was the first iPad available in gold) and capacity options. If you had a 16GB or 64GB iPad that you're getting replaced, you might end up with a storage bump, as well -- the iPad Air 2 that Apple is offering as replacements comes in 32GB and 128GB capacities. If you happen to have one of these older iPads that needs a repair and still has Applecare, you may get a nice upgrade -- but if you're paying for that replacement, you might just be better off picking up one of the new iPads Apple released last month. 9to5Mac Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Right now (2:45am ET) shoppers in Forth Worth can order a Nintendo Switch on Amazon Prime Now. The reseller prices of the Nintendo Switch are around $385 on the Easter Sunday. Prices rise again slightly despite the influx of new inventory. The reseller prices for the NES Classic exploded on the news that Nintendo is stopping production. Prices are almost reaching the reseller prices of the Switch. Please avoid the fake low priced reseller deals on the Nintendo Switch. These offers are a scam. Right now the offers appear all legit.

The Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con still fetches over $410 on the marketplace. Shoppers in New York have a solid option to find a Switch in stock this afternoon.

Find below the best options and best practices to find a Nintendo Switch in stock over the Easter weekend. We will keep updating the Nintendo Switch Shopping guide throughout the Easter weekend. How to Find a Nintendo Switch in Stock Nintendo announced that more Nintendo Switch consoles are on the way. A recent report out of Japan tries explains why Nintendo struggles to produce enough Switch consoles to satisfy the demand. Find a Switch on Amazon Prime Now The quickest way to find and buy a Nintendo Switch is through Amazon Prime Now. If you live in an Amazon Prime Now area, watching availability each day is the way to go. To use Amazon Prime Now, you need a Prime membership (free 30-day trial available). The check if the Switch console is in stock on Amazon Prime Now check the following pages: Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con Amazon is not offering notifications when a product is in stock on Amazon Prime Now. The iStockNow service is providing alerts when the Nintendo Switch is in stock for an city on Amazon Prime Now here. Nintendo Switch Reseller Offers Another fast way get a Nintendo Switch is to pay a $100 premium and buy the hard to find Switch console from a reseller. Amazon is besides eBay the busiest place for Nintendo Switch offers from reseller. The reseller prices of the Nintendo Switch start at $400, despite the recent wave of restocking. The prices for the Switch with Neon Joy-Con are about $30 higher than for the version with gray Joy-Con. Check the following links for the current offers. Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con Offers on Amazon Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con Offers on Amazon Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con Offers on eBay Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con Offers on  eBay Please avoid the fake low priced reseller deals on the Nintendo Switch. These offers are a scam. Nobody is selling a Switch under the list price of $299.99. Read our report on the Nintendo Switch Amazon scam for details. How to Buy the Nintendo Switch Online The experience of shoppers trying to grab a Nintendo Switch online is harder than scoring a doorbuster deal on Black Friday. The high demand brings in scalpers and their shopping bots. As soon as a store puts a Switch on sale online, these bots swoop in and automatically purchase the console. Regular consumers have a very hard time to beat bots and shopping scripts. The first task is to find out when a store has the Switch in stock online. To track online inventory and get alerts, shoppers can use zoolert and NowInStock and iStockNow. Below is the list of shops that offer the Nintendo Switch online in case they have inventory. Amazon Walmart Best Buy  GameStop  Target  ToysRUs Other stores have also listed the Switch including: Dell NewEgg Fry's BHPPhotoVideo Jet.com  Shopko Kohls and Nintendo's own store. Another route to buy a Nintendo Switch leads abroad. Buying a Switch on Amazon in Spain has worked in the past. Some people also used Amazon in Japan to order a Switch. The additional shipping costs and custom fees add up, but the final cost is still lower than buying on the reseller market. The Switch is though also as hard to find in Europe and Japan.   Ordering abroad has some disadvantages. In case the console is damaged, returning it is more hassle. The packed power adapter is not compatible. You have to get either the official US Switch power adapter or a USB power adapter. How to find the Nintendo Switch in Stores Finding a Nintendo Switch in stores requires some time. The available tracking tools are not that accurate. You need to watch the inventory of your local stores over time to learn to spot when a store just got new Switch inventory. Best is to combine the tracking data from iStockNow and BrickSeek. Some stores like Walmart and Target also show if a product is in stock at a select local store online on their sites. If all three report stock than the chances are very high that the Switch is indeed in stock. Now you just need to be first in the door. The iStockNow live map provides the details where the Switch is in stock. Through filters, you can setup notifications for your local stores. BrickSeek offers inventory checkers for Walmart and other stores. Walmart Stores Enter your zip code and select the Walmart store near you on this walmart.com page.  The Walmart SKU number for the Nintendo Switch with grey Joy-Con is 52901821. The Walmart SKU for the Nintendo Switch with neon blue and new red Joy-Con is 52901822. To check if a Walmart store near you has the Switch in stock you can also use this BrickSeek page. To check for the more rare Switch with neon Joy-con visit this link. The iStockNow live map provides the details where the Switch is in stock for Walmart stores.  Target Stores  While there are three methods to check for Switch inventory, it is more difficult for Target. BrickSeek does not work for checking for Switch stock at Target stores for some reason. Searching with DCPI 207-29-1001 results in: "Sorry, this item is not available to search at this time." Target shows store inventory also online on target.com for the Nintendo Switch. The Target DPCI for the Nintendo Switch console with neon blue and neon red Joy-Con is 207-29-1001. The DPCI for the Nintendo Switch with grey Joy-Con is 207-29-1000. The search for the Switch at Target on BrickSeek is not returning results yet. Target.com also shows the stock levels of the Alternatively shoppers can use iStockNow to find Target stores with Switch in stock.  Nintendo Flagship Store in New York The Nintendo flagship store has published a schedule of upcoming Switch sales. The next series of Switch sales begin on Easter Monday, April 17 at 10am. The store will sell the Switch each day next week. On Tuesday the sale begins at 3pm, Wednesday at 10am, Thursday at 3pm and on Friday at 10am.  Best Buy You can use iStockNow to find Best Buy stores with Switch in stock.  GameStop The iStockNow service also works for GameStop store locations. A pro tip for iStockNow is to look for inventory changes of your local stores you track. Only if there is a fresh change, the likelihood that the information is correct is high. Another tip is to compare iStockNow and BrickSeek results. The new Nintendo Switch launched on March 3 and as expected, it sold out on launch day. Nintendo's comments that there would be enough Switch consoles in March to satisfy demand turned out to be untrue. Nintendo now plans to double the production of the Nintendo Switch. The company plans to make 16 million Switch consoles starting April 1 until March 2018. The original plan was to produce 8 million Switch consoles. Nintendo announced to have sold over 900,000 Switch consoles in March. The Switch is the fastest selling console in Nintendo's history. The $59.99 NES Classic continues to be also in extreme short supply and Nintendo is unable to ship a significant resupply to resellers in weeks. Nintendo sold through 1.5 million NES Classic consoles and the demand is by far not satisfied. It might take Nintendo until Fall to make enough Switch consoles to satisfy demand. The Switch will be one of the most popular Holiday gifts for the Holiday shopping season 2017.  The Nintendo Switch is a completely new video game concept. It's a mobile console first with removable small controllers. The mobile unit with display rest in a Nintendo Switch console connected to your TV. The mobile unit slides inside the Switch docking station, where it also gets charged. The small controllers that are detachable from the mobile unit also slide onto a home controller. A new Zelda game will be amongst the launch titles for the new Nintendo Switch, formerly known as Nintendo NX. The Nintendo Switch games sell for $59.99 like the games for the PS4 and Xbox One. The announced Nintendo Switch game line-up includes Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Nintendo killed region locking on the Nintendo Switch. Any game sold in any region will be playable on the Nintendo Switch. The system will include the main console, Joy-Con (L) and Joy-Con (R) controllers, a Joy-Con grip (to which two Joy-Con are attached and used as one controller), a set of Joy-Con wrist straps, a Nintendo Switch dock (which holds the main console and connects it to a TV), an HDMI cable and an AC adapter. Two stylish versions of the system will be released: a version with a set of gray Joy-Con, and a version with one neon blue and one neon red Joy-Con. Both versions will be the same price.

Or scanning sandwiches during a lunch break at a self-service checkout instead of lining up so you have more time to enjoy your food. These or similar payment methods are predicted to spread across the UAE as more stores reduce reliance upon traditional checkouts, introducing mobile point of sale devices (MPOS) or even encouraging customers to download a smartphone app linked to a stored credit card to complete their purchases. Such systems are imminent or already trialling elsewhere, says Mark Thomson, the director of retail and hospitality solutions for Emea at Zebra Technologies. The British firm helps retailers implement smarter trading solutions and predicts the UAE will increasingly embrace advanced payment methods. In the case of Apple stores, they have for a while; cashiers made way for roaming MPOS-equipped employees who process customer payments, e-mailing the receipt. Mr Thomson, who discussed retail technology at the World Retail Congress in Dubai, believes this and other methods could be enhancing the wider UAE shopping experience soon. "A lot of retailers should look at their stores and think ‘how could we achieve the way Apple does it?’ where you in effect have a one-to-one appointment with a member of staff’," he says. "There are some companies looking at putting the solution into all types of retail, where I take my phone, use an app to scan bar codes and simply pay." Mr Thomson says some retailers outside the UAE are either completely digital or card-based. "They don’t have cash handling," he adds. "It costs them less to do that and staff can interact in a different way. You might design your whole checkout in a different way or not have one, just staff with mobile devices around the store or payment points anywhere." Another development beginning to infiltrate the UAE is self-scanning checkouts, which are already prevalent in many UK supermarket chains. Abu Dhabi’s Souq Planet, meanwhile, describes itself as the first "digital supermarket" in the Middle East. It is pioneering a self-scanning system where registered customers use a smartphone or store device to scan bar codes as they shop. "A software application allows you to scan using your phone," explains Mr Thomson. "Once you get through scanning all your products, whether that’s through a device the store provides or your own, you don’t have to put it onto a counter for somebody else to scan and re-pack." At the checkout, you tap a button on the device that signals "end of shop" and produces a bar code. "You scan that at the checkout as a representation of your total spend and go through the payment process," says Mr Thomson. "That might be at a standard checkout where you hand over the scanning device and they take payment." The Virgin Megastore Mena president Nisreen Shocair advocates replacing checkouts with advanced payment methods. The brand operates both MPOS and fixed cashiers. "This idea you would have a cash till … I’m surprised we have them still. They take up so much space," she says. "We piloted a year ago, maybe two, the idea that you could pay anywhere in store. The customer still wants to go to the cashier, but we’re going to get to the point where customers checkout on the spot. Some do contactless payment. Everybody is starved for time; they just want to get what they want." The UAE chain Home Centre recently rolled out MPOS at its remodelled flagship Mall of the Emirates outlet, where staff bring a device to a customer to fulfil payment. Its chief executive Médéric Payne cites two clear advantages for shoppers and stock logistics. "MPOS has enabled customers to look around the store and complete their purchase in an instant," he says. "Our staff can process the order through card payments right by the product, rather than taking the customer to a till in the corner." Mr Payne says MPOS also gives the retailer real-time stock visibility in the warehouse and stores, allowing it to book delivery dates for the customer by linking with its delivery management system. "It also has the ‘single swipe’ feature for taking card payments and loyalty cards in the same device," he adds. "This way the staff remains with the customer throughout their shopping journey, giving them the opportunity to cross-sell through linking other products." That is music to the ears of Mr Thomson, who sees more brands enlisting such technology as physical retailing competes with online. "We’re not going to stop shopping. We may change the methodology, but convenience and price is key," he says. "We talk about experience and digital transformation, but at the end of the day what do retailers want? To sell more and to do it at a lower cost.

Normangee Star Finance Market Industry Companies People Contacts About Our staff Contacts Terms of use Privacy Samsung’s Galaxy S8 phone aims to dispel the Note 7 debacle 16.04.2017 Madeline Patrick 0 Comment This year marks an excellent year for mobile device technology. There will also be a Microsoft-edition Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus with added Microsoft apps. In addition to the preferred solution that combines Citrix innovation with Samsung DeX, Citrix said it also offers support and integration for Samsung devices that include XenMobile enterprise mobility management, security features and secure virtual access to apps and desktops through XenApp and XenDesktop. Samsung Electronics’ new Galaxy S8 is reportedly facing manufacturing issues with its camera modules, as its supplier Patron is struggling to boost the yield rate, The Bell reported on March 31. Samsung and Citrix announced March 30 at a press event in NY that they are connecting the new Samsung DeX dock to Citrix’s Receiver software. “I think it does put a lot of pressure on Apple to show that they can still innovate”. The iPhone 7 Plus launched with 5.5-inch liquid crystal display panel touchscreen that has been the common component for Apple smartphone products for some time now. While several smartphones launched before the iPhone 7 Plus was released with the dual-lens rear camera setup, it is still safe to say that Apple was the one to really convince the world they need this feature once they introduced it on the iPhone 7 Plus. The new iPhone could also have wireless charging and a slew of high-end camera features. That’s a blessing for Samsung, which is still reeling from its disastrous Galaxy Note 7 launch a year ago. While it’s first to the large screen, it’s last to the virtual assistant. It’s a pretty big commitment Samsung is placing on their laps (especially since there’s a dedicated hardware button on the S8 to activate Bixby), so it’ll be interesting to see how the bot grows over time. However, the early indications are that Bixby will not deliver the same level of functionality as Siri. Or just replace that, too: the S8 comes with Google Assistant, as part of Android Nougat. The iPhone won’t be the first to have an edge-to-edge screen, but you can bet the company will describe it as revolutionary. The chin and forehead of the device have been radically foreshortened, yes, but the really eye-catching aspect of the device remains its wraparound screen, which curves over the left and right edges to provide a completely bezel-free effect. ← Wisconsin gun theft suspect who allegedly wrote manifesto to Trump captured United Airlines alters policy on booking flight crew → Recent Posts Woman With ‘Biggest Boobs In Europe’ Wants To Have ‘Crispy Brown’ Skin Power gradually being restored in BOP and Hawke’s Bay Under half of Labour voters back Jeremy Corbyn as leader, poll finds Paul George upset he did not get final shot for Pacers Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott dating; Tyga ‘jealous’ Copyright © 2017 Normangee Star.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Guest The sudden rise of the headless AI Jensen Harris, Textio@jensenharris April 15, 2017 10:14 PM Tags: ai, Alexa, Amazon, Assistant, bots, chatbots, Google Home, machine learning, voicebots Image Credit: Shutterstock.com/Zapp2Photo “Hey Siri, how’s the weather today?” “OK Google, remind me to pay the power bill.” “Alexa, tell me a joke!” Bots are eating the world. Whether you are an enterprising app developer building the essential software to bring a virtual Taylor Swift into your Slack chats, or just lonely and in need of a dumb, annoying virtual friend to message you on Facebook, we seem to be clear on one thing: Many experiences, apps, sites, and products are going to be replaced with bots. (Unless they are being replaced with VR. Or AR. Or a typewriter keyboard for your iPhone.) It’s official: “Bot for X” is the new “Uber for X.” And sure, bots are cool. Ever since ELIZA struggled to pass the Turing Test and HAL 9000 murdered his crew (later reincarnated in a hardly remembered Apple Super Bowl commercial), we’ve been infatuated with the idea of computers as our inevitable sidekicks. Bots center around one specific niche aspect of artificial intelligence: conversational understanding. Human factors experts have long been enthralled by the idea that a more natural way to communicate with computers would be through speech, and we’ve spent the better part of a century building to a point where natural conversations may soon be a reality. While this is indeed an important step forward in human-computer interaction, it is truly just one small part of what AI is about — and not the part that will matter the most for the enterprise companies that actually buy almost $4 trillion in software and services each year. Bots are the new command line Today, most bots just provide a wrapper around existing functionality. In the early days of graphical user interface (GUI), the point-and-click interface provided different ways of achieving the same tasks you could do on the command line; now most bots provide an additional channel with which to do tasks you likely often do another way. Instead of speaking a specific sentence, you can open the Weather app on your iPhone. You can open your task list and type “Pay the power bill.” You could search Google for a viola joke. Many of today’s bots are kind of a hipster façade around the same basic command line interfaces consumers abandoned in the 1980s. They require specific syntaxes and understand only a limited vocabulary — but they sure have personality! format /q /fs:fat /v:mydisk wasn’t nearly this funny back in the day. Yes, Taco Bell really did this. While the added convenience of language recognition is a benefit, until bots are capable of performing very complex and novel tasks that richly combine actions and context across the boundaries of apps and sites in unique ways the first time they are asked, we will be limited to trying to remember the 489 commands Siri recognizes. (Yes that link is a man page for Siri.) The rise of headless AI But I’m not down on bots. I’m just a lot more excited by the less-flashy flavor of AI that is changing the nature of work itself: headless AI. Headless AI is the application of artificial intelligence to vastly improve internal business processes. It is fully transforming the crucial machinery of business — processes like hiring, lead generation, financial modeling, and information security. Legacy software has become a commodity in all of these areas, and purpose-built AI solutions will get a larger and larger wallet share of these huge enterprise cost centers. Headless AI combines machine intelligence and learning loops to constantly evolve. Because these solutions plug into the data lifeblood of a company, they become incredibly valuable as the algorithms adapt to the patterns that work. I call this form of AI “headless” because, unlike bots, the value is mostly not about the personality. Headless AI works with humans and augments their strengths. It doesn’t try to replace people; it gives them superpowers. While being able to talk to your CRM is cool, having a sales platform that accurately predicts the 100 opportunities you can close this quarter is worth breaking the bank for. Having a cute avatar answer your customer support chats seems nice enough, but predicting ahead of time what areas of your product will get support requests so that you can fix them before customers suffer is pure gold. It’s happening! (already) Though bots get all the glamour, headless AI is quietly happening everywhere already. These new platforms are generally purpose-built solutions optimized around specific domains and outcomes data. They learn not from people talking to them, but by voraciously chomping up all of the relevant proprietary data fed into them. The best systems employ learning loops and massive streams of incoming data to constantly improve. This creates a multiplier effect: The earlier and more pervasively an organization rolls out headless AI solutions, the more quickly the positive results compound. If you wait a year to deploy, you don’t just lose the year of improved productivity — you lose the year of learning and adaptation of the software to your company’s patterns. This puts you doubly behind. Companies like Apple, Expedia, and Johnson & Johnson use Textio’s augmented writing platform to chop weeks off the time it takes them to fill open jobs. DeepMind helped Google reduce power consumption in its data centers by 15 percent. A former NSA analyst created Area 1 Security to predict cyberattacks before they happen. These new headless AI companies, and dozens of others, are helping enterprises make the kind of radical productivity leaps that they haven’t seen from software in decades. Headless AI is where the money is I’m not sure if there’s a revenue model that works for bots. I guess we will see. People are trying to figure that out. I’m thankful I don’t have to! What I do know is that there is a lot of money to be made in transforming the efficiency of core enterprise functions. This is what headless AI is all about. If you can improve a crucial business process in a decisive way and by a clear and measurable amount, that is incredibly valuable. What is most game-changing about this kind of software is that it is purely quantitative. Unlike a bot, where the potential return on investment is fairly qualitative (“customers liked interacting with the bot”), most headless AI is fully in the realm of predicting the future and then helping you change that future. It’s focused where the return on investment is measurable and evident. Improving — in real life — the quantity, quality, and demographics of the people who walk through your front door with resumes in hand… how much is it worth to be able to hire better people more quickly than your competition? If you can predict exactly who will buy what, and when… how much could you improve your customer experience? Because this kind of software proves itself through the numbers, it is inherently valuable and easy to budget for. Headless is where the real AI money is. Headless AI everywhere In the near future, every core business function will have been transformed by AI — hiring, sales, security, marketing, finance, manufacturing… everything. Purpose-built headless AI platforms will provide the new infrastructure that will drive every business. The enterprises that are already on this train will continue getting an outsized advantage until everyone else catches up. Legacy software will get squeezed down into a smaller portion of the IT wallet as the most valuable services become the native AI platforms — just as form-based desktop software got squeezed out by the cloud in the last generation. Bots are here to stay. They’ll keep getting headlines. “OK Google, search for tacobot.” But the real enterprise revolution is happening in the companies that are using headless AI to transform their core businesses.

It’s official. According to the California DMV’s website, updated Friday (April 14), Apple is the latest among 30 companies who already have permits to test autonomous vehicles on the state’s highways and byways. Since the DMV requires any manufacturer to apply for a permit before testing a vehicle in autonomous mode on California’s roads, this is the strongest confirmation yet of Apple’s intent to develop self-driving car technology. The DMV website turns out to be a treasure trove of information on all the facets of  highly automated vehicles currently in development.  Who's who For starters, for anyone who wants to know which car and tech outfits are currently entertaining California dreams about their robo-cars, here’s a list of test-drive permits, in the order they were granted: ·   •    Volkswagen Group of America     •   Mercedes Benz     •    Google     •    Delphi Automotive     •    Tesla Motors     •    Bosch     •    Nissan     •    GM Cruise LLC     •    BMW     •    Honda     •    Ford     •    Zoox, Inc.     •    Drive.ai, Inc.     •    Faraday & Future Inc.     •    Baidu USA LLC     •    Wheego Electric Cars Inc.     •    Valeo North America, Inc.     •    NextEV USA, Inc.     •    Telenav, Inc.     •    NVIDIA Corporation     •    AutoX Technologies Inc     •    Subaru     •    Udacity, Inc     •    Navya Inc.     •    Renovo Motors Inc     •    UATC LLC (Uber)     •    PlusAi Inc     •    Nuro, Inc     •    CarOne LLC     •    Apple Inc. Accidents in autonomous mode The DMV can also reveal which self-driving cars in autonomous mode actually had accidents. This link reports traffic accidents involving an autonomous vehicle in Calif. over the last two years. Of the 28 reported, 24 were filed by Google (no surprises there, given its early start), three by GM Cruise (including Cruise Automation) and one by Delphi. What about disengagements? The most interesting click on this site, in the view of Egil Juliussen, research director for infotainment and ADAS at IHS Automotive, is where each carmaker reports on autonomous vehicle disengagement.  Here’s the link to the 2016 disengagement report. According to the DMV, California Autonomous Vehicle Testing Regulations require every manufacturer authorized to test robo-cars on public roads to submit an annual report summarizing disengagements from the technology during testing.  Consider Google (now Waymo), which scored well compared to the year before. In 2015, Google had 0.80 disengagements every 1,000 miles (autonomous miles on public roads in Calif.). In 2016, the Waymo number dropped to 0.20. “You can see that they are making a pretty good progress,” said Juliussen.

The US firm plans to financially support Taiwan’s Hon Hai, which has reportedly bid some 3 trillion yen ($27.6 billion) in the initial tendering round for the memory chip business, the Mainichi Shimbun said. Apple, which uses Toshiba’s memory chips for its iPhone, hopes to secure stable supplies of the key parts by supporting Hon Hai’s bid, the daily said. Hon Hai, which acquired Japanese electronics maker Sharp last year, is separately asking SoftBank to join the team, the daily said. The Japanese telecom company may help Hon Hai negotiate with local banks currently supporting Toshiba, it said. Immediate confirmation of the report was not available. Among other bidders are Google and Amazon as well as US private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners, quoting unnamed sources. Published in The Express Tribune, April 16th, 2017.

The Apple Store will be spread over 1,322 square meters on the ground floor and the first basement level of the mall in Taiwan's tallest skyscraper, the source said. Meanwhile, in view of the expected opening of the country's first Apple Store in the Taipei 101mall, Apple premium reseller Studio A will close its shop there on April 17, Studio A president Cheng Ying-lung (程應龍) said. Cheng said the Studio A store in Taipei 101 has seen a year-on-year decline in business over the past three months, due mainly to a drop in tourist arrivals from China. Studio A will work on expanding its membership base and improving its maintenance and repair services in an effort to handle the expected competition from the Apple Store, Cheng said. Last July, Apple posted its first job listings for Taiwan, which were followed by a confirmation of its plans to set up a store in the country. However, Apple did not say when the shop would be opened or where in Taiwan it would be located.

Get access California runs out of trees after Apple HQ spree Danny Fortson in San Francisco April 16 2017, 12:01am, The Sunday Times How the Apple campus will ultimately look, replete with trees Apple has caused an acute shortage of trees for sale on America’s West Coast as it rushes to finish its new “spaceship” campus in Cupertino, California. The company began moving staff into the $5bn (£4bn) development this month but parts of the 175-acre site are still brown dirt. Apple has purchased at least 3,000 mature trees from nurseries up and down the Pacific coast — sparking complaints that there are none left for other schemes. The landscapers of the rooftop park at San Francisco’s new Transbay Transit Centre have taken to fitting lockable tree tags when they find suitable specimens in nurseries, to stop them being snapped up by the iPhone maker.

There is Levi’s stadium, the lavish, $1.3bn (£1bn) home of the San Francisco 49ers. And then there is the “spaceship”, Apple’s new headquarters. From the air the size of the latter is clear. The 69,000-seat Levi’s stadium is big — but it would fit comfortably within the tech giant’s gigantic doughnut-shaped campus, which opened its doors this month to the first of the 12,000 people who will work there. One of the largest office buildings in the world, it will be encased in curved glass and covered with enough solar panels to be almost entirely off grid. Want to read more?

Watchlist | 27 Mar 2017 | Print  | Comment (5) Safari 10.1 by Agen G. N. Schmitz Apple has released Safari 10.1 for OS X 10.10.5 Yosemite and 10.11.6 El Capitan (macOS 10.12.4 Sierra also includes it; see “Apple Releases macOS 10.12.4, watchOS 3.2, and tvOS 10.2,” 27 March 2017). The update adds the capability to drag the Show Downloads list into a standalone window, brings Paste and Go to the Safari Smart Search field’s contextual menu, and resolves a bug that caused background tabs to suddenly appear in the foreground. It also deals with numerous security vulnerabilities, including multiple memory corruption and validation issues related to WebKit, a spoofing and denial-of-service issue that existed in the handling of HTTP authentication, and address bar spoofing. Safari 10.1 is available only via Software Update. (Free, 10.10+)   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Reply HeikO  2017-03-29 02:11 On 10.11 since the update I cannot drag 'n drop images or textsnippings from Safari to the desktop anymore. Window/Tab crashes and reloads the content. Very annoying. Resetting Safari, trashing prefs, etc. didn't help. Reply Bernard Frangoulis  2017-04-04 03:43 Yes, same here. Let's hope for a bug fix soon. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-04 09:58 Sorry to hear it! If it's any consolation, these tasks seem fine in macOS 10.12 Sierra. Reply Vickie  2017-04-12 15:46 Also can no longer drag 'n drop images from Safari to the desktop. Very FRUSTRATING!
