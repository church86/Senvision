Prior to this, and since variable pricing was introduced close to 2009, the labels, not the artists, would tell Apple at which price tier they preferred to sell recorded product – either at 69¢, 99¢, or $1.29. Prior to 2009, all downloads at iTunes sold for 99¢, a policy that Apple chief Steve Jobs enforced to drive purchases of the iPod. Variable pricing maximized label revenue because iTunes was the port of call for most purchases and megastar releases could be priced higher than lower selling recordings. A price elasticity of demand analysis shows that moving a song to the higher price tier of $1.29 would work for the labels, earning them more revenue, as long as the purchases of that download, because of the higher price, did not fall below 23%. Conversely, a song discounted to 69¢ from 99¢ would have to increase the number of downloads by over 44% to justify the discount.1 That is why, prior to this policy, there were so few takers of the 69¢ option. Labels, in short, chose to price most of their music at 99¢ or $1.29. Apple’s new policy creates a “Great 69¢ Song” list, where the recording stays, typically, for two weeks. Once a single is taken off the list it returns to its original price. As shown above, in most instances the surge in demand that is required to justify a 69¢ discount is unlikely to materialize, so the reason for Apple granting the discount may not be obvious –- either for the independent artists that exercise this choice or for Apple, which makes approximately 30 cents to the dollar on every download. In the end, whether deliberately intended or not, we argue that what may be at stake is a pay-for play offer for better chart positioning. Charts are effective as indicators of consumer tastes as long as the only differentiating factor between two pieces of recorded music is the music itself. If a song sells at a much lower value than another, it is difficult to say if the chart is indicating a preference for a good song or a bargain. A good example is Shawn Mendes’ single “Treat You Better”, released on June 3rd, 2016. For weeks it languished, reaching No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100. Then it became part of the “Great 69¢ Song” list, which meant it went straight to the iTunes home page for promotion and exposure. The song then peaked at No. 8 on the Hot 100, and, apparently, well justified its discount.2 This, of course, may not be the case with every song, and “Treat You Better” had some traction behind it before the discount. Moreover, promotion in the “Great 69¢ Song” does not come cheap. Billboard itself reports that “the promotion can cost between $2,000-$10,000 a week.”3 Obviously, this is a sum that is not easily tendered by smaller artists, who could in any case lose money with the discount. Therefore, the inference must be that buying into the 69¢ play is a transaction meant to influence the music charts. The 69¢ discount is not new and in its latest iteration reflects the increasing role of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in the fortunes of music. Apple, for instance, has decided on selling price points for music for a long time, first objecting to the labels’ request for variable pricing when iTunes was born in 2002, and then agreeing at the end of the decade to three price points for downloads The recording industry has always wished for more flexible pricing, and it is not clear that the three-tier system completely satisfied it. Before iTunes the trappings of the music marketplace were such that megastar releases were sold in every record store and perfect competition at retail prevented hits from selling more expensively. This was contrary to demand theory that suggested that sellers maximized revenue by raising prices in products that had a firm demand. Moreover, deeper catalog that didn’t sell as well took retail space and was sold more expensively in the 1990s than hits, again contradicting a long-standing economic principle that suggested that sellers who sold product with a soft demand should lower prices to maximize earnings. The labels, in short, had little power to control the price of the product they sold in the 1990s even without the ISPs. When Apple took over the distribution of recorded music, the potential for variable pricing became very real again because Apple iTunes became the single point of sale, and record stores were no longer in competition for the ubiquitous hits.4 Therefore, the best pricing system for the industry, in an era that has largely superseded the challenges of free file sharing music, is the most flexible. In fact, it could be argued that the current 69¢ discount really does not add much to the marketplace. It has been tried before, and in its latest version, as was suggested above, seems to discourage independent music makers from applying to Apple. A smaller discount would have been in everyone’s best interest. Further, for many that are preoccupied with the devaluation of music, including top-level artists, this latest policy by Apple appears to do little good. If there is an element of artist discovery and exposure in the new measure, it does not seem to come free and the medium for this new pay-for-play is really not where listeners are flocking.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Mobile The iPhone 8 and Galaxy S8 will share one critical feature Chris Smith @chris_writes January 13th, 2017 at 10:27 AM Share Tweet The iPhone 8 and Galaxy S8 will turn out to be pretty similar devices if current rumors are to be believed. Naturally, the same can be said about previous iPhone and Galaxy S generations, as Samsung has often borrowed features from Apple when it comes to phone design and Apple borrows from Android all the time. However, this year, the phones are expected to sport similar designs and features, and a new report sheds light on yet another key element they’ll have in common. Don't Miss: Everything you could possibly need to know about the Nintendo Switch Sources said to be familiar with the upcoming phones told The Investor that both the iPhone 8 and Galaxy S8 will come with IP68 water and dust resistance. The iPhone 8 is the one that’s getting an upgrade here, compared to the iPhone 7’s IP67 rating. The Galaxy S8, meanwhile, will match the Galaxy S7’s IP68 rating. IP67 means a device can stay under 1 meter of water for half an hour and come away undamaged. IP68 gives you protection in up to 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes. “Apple’s iPhone 8 will feature the IP68 rating protection as part of drastic upgrades marking the 10th anniversary of the iPhone this year,” an industry source told the site. Samsung is looking to add water resistance to a broad range of handsets, not just the Galaxy S8. “Samsung is considering water protection even for the cheapest J series phones as they are the best-selling Galaxy phones,” a different source said. The report goes on to note that both Samsung and Apple will use waterproof tapes to protect their devices, rather than adhesives, as tape makes repair work easier. 3M and NDFOS are the dominant players in the waterproof tape market. LG’s upcoming G6 is also expected to feature water and dust protection, and some Chinese companies will also have waterproof handsets out this year as well.

Andy Rubin has recruited over 40 people to his new firm, to be called Essential, according to Bloomberg. It aims to build an entire technology ecosystem using AI - from phones and smart home gadgets to app stores. Scroll down for video   Andy Rubin has recruited over 40 people to his new firm, to be called Essential, according to Bloomberg. It aims to build an entire technology ecosystem from phones to app stores and smart home gadgets.  ANDY RUBIN'S CAREER  Born in 1963, New Yorker Any Rubin worked on the first generation of wireless digital assistants, known as PDA. In December 1999 he launched Danger, creator of the Hiptop, a proto-smartphone, which was later bought by Microsoft.  Rubin cofounded Android in 2003 and sold it to Google in 2005, moving to the firm. In December 2013, Rubin started management of the robotics division of Google, before leaving on 30 October 2014 to start an incubator for hardware startups. Rubin and his wife, Rie, also own and operate Voyageur du Temps, a bakery in Los Altos, CA.   'Armed with about a 40-person team, filled with recruits from Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Rubin is preparing to announce a new company called Essential and serve as its Chief Executive Officer, according to people familiar with the matter,' Bloomberg said. A search in LinkedIn reveals several of the employees, including Niccolo De Masi, the ex-CEO of Glu Mobuile, who is listed as the firm's President & COO.  Rubin also recently hired Andy Fouché from Magic Leap, a Google backed firm developing AR glasses.  Bloomberg claims Essential will produce an range of both home and mobile products, and Rubin discussed his handset plans with Sprint executives at the recent CES show. Rubin registered Essential Products Inc. with California regulators in November 2015, and in late 2016, the company registered 'Essential' with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. There, it listed smartphones, tablets, accessories and 'computer operating software for mobile phones' among its goods and services.  According to Bloomberg, the handset will be aimed at the luxury end of the market, and could be expanded using plug in modules.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next The biggest storm in the universe: Stunning new NASA image...

Share this article Share 34 shares Bloomberg claims Essential will produce an range of both home and mobile products, and Rubin (pictured) discussed his handset plans with Sprint executives at the recent CES show. Rubin is aiming to put the phone on sale around the middle of this year for a price close to that of an iPhone 7 ($649), a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg, although they admitted 'all of the plans are still in flux'. Rubin is convinced AI is the next big change to ripple through the technology industry.  'New computing platforms happen every 10 to 12 years,' he said at the Bloomberg Technology Conference in June.  RUBIN'S DOG TAKES ON A ROBOT   While at Google's Rubin's dog hit the headlines after taking on a robot. A feisty terrier has taken on Boston Dynamics' 'Spot' dog by barking at it and even giving chase, showing that in the event of a robot uprising, dogs will still be man's best friend.The dog, named Cosmo, is said to belong to Andy Rubin, the co-founder of Android, who has previously managed the robotics program at Google. Google acquired Boston Dymamics, which makes numerous sized robotic animals in differing sizes, including Spot, which can run, climb stairs, jog next to its owner and even cope with being kicked. He believes that AI in the future will go one step further - being so powerful that it underpins every connected device. Mr Rubin said a combination of quantum computing and AI advancements could yield a conscious intelligence that would control every internet-enabled gadget.  'If you have computing that is as powerful as this could be, you might only need one. 'It might not be something you carry around; it just has to be conscious.' While Mr Rubin's claims are currently theoretical, his investment fund, Playground Global, is investing $300 million in companies trying to make this future of AI a reality. One of the companies his fund is investing in, is a quantum computing firm. Its name has not been disclosed. The company is made up of researchers who may one day be able to commercialise quantum devises using standard manufacturing processes, which could massively boost processing power.  Mr Rubin said: 'In order for AI to blossom and fulfill consumer needs, it has to be about data. 'That's where robotics come in - robots are walking mobile sensors, who can sense their environment and interact and learn from those interactions.'  Foxconn is in talks to manufacture Rubin's new smartphone, according to people familiar with the matter. At least one prototype of Rubin's phone boasts a screen larger than the iPhone 7 Plus's (5.5-inches) but has a smaller overall footprint because of the lack of bezels, one of the people said.   Share or comment on this article e-mail 34 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany She's falling for him?

This lets you see if you can beat a friend in closing all three Activity rings, permit your trainer to keep an eye on your daily progress and so forth. This how-to lays out all there’s to know about sharing Activity data, including getting progress update from friends, engaging in smack talk, viewing shared Activity rings, removing a friend from shared Activity or muting their notifications for the day and more. About Activity sharing Keeping your fitness routine on track is easier with Activity sharing. The ability to share your Activity rings with others is built right into Apple’s stock Activity app for iPhone and Apple Watch. Apple says that motivation through social engagement is an important factor in changing fitness and health behavior. With this feature enabled, you can share, compare and compete with friends and family or even let your personal trainer or coach keep an eye on your daily progress. You will get notifications about your friends’ progress, see their completed Activity rings, finished workouts and earned achievements and communicate with them with Smart Replies that provide specially customized canned responses in Activity for encouragement. System requirements for Activity sharing Activity Sharing requires the following: Apple Watch with watchOS 3.0 or later iPhone with iOS 10.0 or later iCloud and Apple ID account You’ll also need to add friends who are willing to share their Activity data with you. What kind of data is shared? The following data is visible to whomever you choose to invite to Activity sharing: Data about your workouts like the type and duration of the workout Your Move, Exercise and Stand rings for the day Your personal goals for each Activity ring Earned achievements Minutes exercised Hours stood Steps taken Distance traveled Calories burned Your timezone If you’re wondering why your timezone information is shared, too, that’s because the system needs this information to let friends know when you started your day. Activity sharing and privacy Aside from the aforementioned data, the email address associated with your iCloud account will be visible to anyone you invite or accept an invite from. If you’ve been keeping email addresses on file with iCloud secret, and you want to keep it that way, simply refrain from using Activity sharing. When you use this feature, your encrypted Activity data gets sent to Apple so it can securely share it with others. Apple will retain everyone’s Activity data for a short period of time so that’s another thing to consider. Your heart beat and other Health data is never shared with friends in Activity sharing. What happens when you share Activity rings with others? This is what happens when you enable Activity sharing: Friends with whom you’re sharing can see your Activity rings, and vice versa. You see alerts when friends meet goals, finish workouts and earn achievements. You can message friends for motivation. It’s worth mentioning that adding a friend to Activity sharing will let you see all their Activity data from that day forward, and vice versa, rather than give you full access to their complete Activity history. How to share your Activity rings with friends and family To start sharing your Activity data with other folks, do the following: 1) Open the Activity app on your paired iPhone. 2) Tap the Sharing tab, then tap Get Started. 3) Tap the plus button to invite people to share Activity with you. Type your friend’s contact information to send them an invite or select some friends from the list of people iOS thinks you might want to shared this data with underneath the Suggestions heading. Again, you and your friends both need an Apple Watch and watchOS 3 to share Activity data. 4) Tap Send to finish inviting people to Activity sharing. Each person will receive a message to an email address associated with their iCloud account, asking them to confirm that they wish to share their Activity data with you. They will also receive a push notification on their device. To check pending invitations, launch the Activity app on your paired iPhone, hit the Sharing tab, then tap Sharing. It’s cool that the Activity sharing friend list is transferred to any other iOS device you sign in to using the same Apple ID because it’s associated with your iCloud account. You cannot begin sharing your Activity data with others directly from Apple Watch. Viewing shared Activity rings After a friend accepts your invite, they appear in the Activity app’s Sharing section on iPhone and Apple Watch. This lets you quickly glance at their stats, but you’ll also get wrist notifications about their progress every time they meet all three of their Activity goals, finish workouts or earn achievements. To view your friend’s progress, do the following: On Apple Watch 1) Launch Activity on your Apple Watch. 2) Swipe left to view shared Activity data. 3) Tap a friend’s name in the list, then scroll to see their progress and stats for the day. To scroll your friends list, turn the Digital Crown. On iPhone 1) Launch the Activity app. 2) Swipe left to get to the shared activity screen. 3) Tap a friend’s name to see their detailed Activity stats for the day. You can scroll downward to see more stats for that person, including any achievements won and workouts they completed during the day. Messaging your friends To encourage a friend to meet their goals, send him or her a motivational message. When you get a notification about your friend’s activity, you can reply with preset replies for encouragement. Because Activity sharing is directly connected to the Messages app, you’re not limited to canned responses and can message friends with things like voice recordings, your own racing heartbeat, Digital Touch items and more. I like to use canned replies because Apple has specifically customized them for the Activity and Workout apps. You can also message all your friends en masse with a quippy joke or some smack talk to challenge them to beat your completed goals, for example. To message a specific friend: On Apple Watch 1) Open Activity on Apple Watch, then swipe left to reveal the Activity sharing screen. 2) Tap a desired friend in the list. 3) Scroll to the bottom, then tap Send Message. 4) Compose your message, then tap Send. On iPhone 1) Launch Activity on iPhone and tap the Sharing tab. 2) Tap a friend in the list. 3) Tap the chat bubble icon at the top. 4) Compose your message, then tap Send. To send a message to all your friends in Activity sharing: On Apple Watch 1) Open Activity on Apple Watch, then swipe left to reveal the Activity sharing screen. 2) Turn the Digital Crown to scroll to the bottom. 3) Tap the option Send Message to All. 4) Compose your message, then tap Send. On iPhone 1) Launch Activity on iPhone and tap the Sharing tab. 2) Tap the chat bubble icon at the screen top. 3) Compose your message, then tap Send. Unfortunately, there’s no way to create Activity groups as of yet. Sorting your friends list Want to sort your friends list? Launch Activity on Apple Watch, swipe left, firmly press the screen, then tap Sort List and choose an option: Name—Sort your friends by alphabetical name. Move—Sort your friends by their Move goal. Exercise—Sort your friends by their Exercise goal. Steps—Sort your friends by their Steps goal. Workouts—Sort your friends by the number of workouts. To sort your friends list on iPhone, launch the Activity app and hit the Sharing tab, then tap Sort in the upper-left corner and choose one of the aforesaid sorting option. Muting shared Activity notifications from certain people You must use Activity for iPhone in order to mute notifications for a friend: 1) Launch the Activity app on your paired iPhone. 2) Tap the Sharing tab, then tap Sharing. 3) Tap a friend’s name, scroll downward and select Mute Notifications. Tip: Tap Unmute Notifications to receive Activity alerts from that person again. See our more detailed tutorial about muting shared Activity notifications from friends. If a friend is inundating you with notifications, but you don’t want to remove them from Activity sharing, you can mute notifications from them for the rest of the day To do so, you must change Activity alert settings via your Apple Watch or iPhone. When an Activity notification from a friend hits your wrist, turn the Digital Crown to reveal the option Mute for Today, then tap it. On iPhone, launch the Watch app, tap My Watch → Activity, then toggle the switch Mute Reminders for Today. Note that muting Activity reminders will also silence other Activity alerts for the day, including your own progress updates, stand reminders, goal completions and achievements. Hiding your Activity rings from certain people To hide your own data in Activity sharing, follow the steps below: 1) Launch Activity on your paired iPhone. 2) Tap the Sharing tab. 3) Tap a friend hide from whom you wish to hide your own activity data. 4) Scroll downward and tap the option labeled Hide My Activity to go in stealth mode. Hiding your activity from the selected contact will result in a grey remark in Activity for iPhone noting when you hid your shared data from them. You can still see your friend’s activity, but they won’t see your activity. This is a temporary ban that you can lift by tapping Show My Activity to give that person full access to your Activity data again. Removing people from shared Activity rings To remove a friend from Activity sharing, do the following: 1) Launch Activity on your paired iPhone. 2) Tap the Sharing tab. 3) Tap a friend hide from whom you wish to hide your own activity data. 4) Scroll downward and tap Remove Friend. When you remove a friend from Activity sharing, they can’t see your activity and you cannot see their activity. To start sharing again, you must send your friend a new invite to Activity sharing. Activity Sharing not working? Try this. If you have experienced issues with Activity sharing, this might be helpful. Sharing tab not appearing in Activity? This happens if you own multiple watches, some of which don’t run watchOS 3.0 or later. If you paired more than one Apple Watch to your iPhone, update them all to watchOS 3 and the Sharing tab will appear in the Activity app. Can’t add friends If you can’t invite a person to Activity sharing, check if they own an Apple Watch because this feature does not work on iPhone alone. Also check that you haven’t added the maximum number of friends because this feature works with up to 25 friends. No daily updates about your friends’ activity? The first order of business is checking if your iPhone can establish an Internet connection. Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to enable Wi-Fi in Control Center or enable cellular data in Settings. Then try loading your favorite websites in Safari. If Safari and other apps cannot retrieve data from the Internet, there’s something wrong with your connection. You must also be signed in to iCloud in order to receive daily notifications about your friends’ Activity progress. Activity app unavailable on iPhone? Restart your iPhone and check again. The Activity app appears on your Home screen only after your iPhone and Apple Watch have been successfully paired. Missing days in Activity sharing? You might see missing days if your iPhone can’t connect to the Internet for multiple days. This may also happen if you sign out of iCloud or some of the iCloud features have been offline for an extended period of time. To verify that iCloud services are operational, visit Apple’s services dashboard. It’s a wrap-up, folks! Now that you know all this, go ahead and share your Activity rings with your friends and let the competition begin.

A patent case between the two tech rivals was reopened late Thursday evening, Law 360 reports. The major outstanding question is how much Samsung will have to pay Apple for infringing on the iPhone's design.  SEE ALSO: Apple might depend on a rival for the next iPhone's display This case has a long and complicated history stretching back to 2011. You could spend hours exploring this rabbit hole, but the most relevant bit to Thursday's news came last month, when the Supreme Court reversed a ruling that would have forced Samsung to pay Apple $399 million for copying aspects of the iPhone's design. Samsung had argued that the jury focused too much on the overall design of the phones instead of a few specific elements. Now, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has reopened the case in a one-paragraph order, and it will decide how much Samsung finally owes.  Federal Circuit Reopens Case by mashablescribd on Scribd The case largely revolves around a 129-year-old law regarding design patents and how much customers associate product designs with company brands.  In a brief filed on Thursday, Samsung urged the court to "reject Apple's suggestion" that any judgement should be made without further argumentation.

The case alleges Apple's famed App Store constitutes a monopoly, and thus the class should be refunded the commission fees Apple charges. Where Apple gets into trouble, in the eyes of the plaintiffs, is in the tight reigns it holds when it comes to app installation and App Store submission guidelines. While Apple's famously tight grip on its store has been a boon to the success of the iPhone and iOS in general, the plaintiffs argue its restrictions prohibit users from circumventing the App Store to side-load apps, or utilizing third-party app stores. This makes the App Store the only game in town, and effectively forces developers to pay them a 30% fee, lest they be locked out of the App Store's lucrative user base. The suit, originally filed in 2013, initially demanded damages in the form of refunds of Apple's commission fees for apps purchased between 2007 and 2013, a total that could cross well into the hundreds of millions of dollars. However, Apple's lawyers were able to successfully get it thrown out by arguing that apps are not purchased from Apple, rather they are purchased directly from the app developer with Apple effectively serving as a middle man. The plaintiffs persisted, arguing that apps were indeed purchased directly from Apple, with it handling the entirety of the purchase and passing along the developers cut after it took its fees, and yesterday the three-judge panel agreed. With the reopening of the case, the plaintiffs are also looking to expand the size of the class by lengthening the timeframe to include years up to and including 2016. The success of Apple's App Store marked the success of the iPhone, and lead to the spawning of numerous other stores for PCs and Android devices, so it will be interesting to see what will come of this case. Regardless of the outcome, it's safe to say the massive success of the App Store will greatly overshadow any penalties they may have to pay out.

Posted By: Nithya Nair Updated: Friday, January 13, 2017, 12:07 [IST] Subscribe to GoodReturns Apple, Google, and Tesla retained their positions as the world's most innovative companies on an annual top-50 list, even as Tatas have moved out after being the only Indian entity there for two years. The latest list for 2016, released today by the Boston Consulting Group, has Apple, Google, Tesla, Microsoft and Amazon in the top five positions. Among these, the top-four have retained their positions while Amazon has replaced Samsung in the fifth slot. No Indian companies There is no Indian entity on the latest list, though the ranking for 2015 had Tata Motors at 26th place. Before that, another Tata group firm TCS was ranked 43rd in 2014 list. The 2016 list has 34 companies from the US, 10 from Europe, and 6 from Asia. Which Are 7 Indian Companies Who Made It To Fortune 500 List? Facebook, Netflix gained The South Korean multinational company Samsung is at 7th position. The top 10 most innovative companies for 2016 include Netflix at the 6th place, Samsung Group (7th), Toyota (8th), Facebook (9th) and IBM (10th). Facebook jumped 19 places to number nine, was among the biggest gainers in the list.  Streaming services provider Netflix, was another big mover, jumping up 15 places to end the year at number six. 9 Famous Financial Scams in India General Electric ranked 15th place "Long-standing tech giants hold down the top places once again, new digital disruptors such as Uber and Airbnb have joined the list, and the expanding role of digital innovation is readily apparent in the presence of some traditional manufacturers and process driven companies such as General Electric and Diamler," the report noted. General Electric was ranked in the 15th place followed by Diamler (16th), Uber 17th and Airbnb was placed at the 21st rank. Taylor's comment The coveted list revealed the 50 companies that global innovation executives ranked as the most innovative and explores the increasing imperative for companies to bring in innovations from outside. "Given faster-changing markets -- and the fact that even in more traditional sectors technology is becoming a key differentiator -- a not-invented-here mindset can be fatal," said BCG partner and report coauthor Andrew Taylor. Taylor further said that "today's most successful innovators strike a strategic balance between internal and external innovation. They are smart and efficient at scanning for external ideas -- and deft at bringing them inside.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Rumored to be Advancing the Anniversary iPhone's Water Resistance Feature to a Higher Level | Main | A Next-Gen Smartphone Designed by Ex-Apple and Google Engineers will Launch Later this Year » January 13, 2017 An Apple Pencil Patent describes a 3D Antenna and Magnet for Attaching to External Objects   When Apple launched their iPad Pro in the fall of 2015 with its softcover Smart Keyboard and Pencil, they blatantly forgot to provide a mechanism that would allow users to attach their Pencil to the iPad in any way. Apple was granted a patent for "Smart Covers with Magnetic Attachment Unit" back in November 2016 that was originally filed back in 2014 – well ahead of the iPad Pro's debut. Last September Apple filed for a patent relating to a magnetic array system that would allow the Apple Pencil to attach to an iPad's metal body. It's tricky because magnets don't naturally connect to aluminum.   On Thursday one of Apple's Pencil patents surfaced that generally relates to wireless communications circuitry and, more particularly, to wireless communications circuitry for elongated wireless devices such as computer styluses. Yet buried in Apple's patent filing is the reference to a portion of a future Apple Pencil being magnetized so as to allow it to be attached to the exterior of an object or a magnetic attachment structure.   Additionally, a future Apple Pencil could come with a non-techie solution as simple as a cheap "clip" so that users could clip it to a shirt or jacket pocket like a standard pen.   Hopefully Apple will finally introduce a solution for attaching the Apple Pencil to the iPad Pro or other accessory device later this spring when their updates launch.   Apple's patent FIG. 19 noted below is a perspective view of an illustrative three-dimensional antenna of the type that may be mounted at the end of the stylus; FIG. 24 is an exploded perspective view of an illustrative stylus with a removable cap and an antenna that is formed at a location that is offset from the end of the stylus.       Apple notes that "the rear of antenna #40 may be formed from a metal trace that is sufficiently large to receive a component such as magnet 202 (e.g., when magnet 202 is installed on the rear of antenna 40 in direction 204.   Apple's patent application 20170010697 was filed back in July 2015. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

By: Prajith Sabbani Published: Friday, January 13, 2017, 15:00 [IST] Just a few days after seeding the 3rd iOS 10.2.1 beta, Apple yesterday seeded the 4th beta of iOS 10.2.1 for both developers and public testers.  The OTA update is already available, and registered developers and public testers can install the update either via over-the-air or from Apple Developer Center.  Also Read: Nintendo brings Mario to the “real world” with Super Mario Odyssey Regarding the changes with the update, no specific addition of features or changes were mentioned by Apple. Since it is a minor 10.2.X update, we believe that the update brings along a few bug fixes and performance improvements rather than any new additions such as the inclusion of new emojis or message screen effects as with the case with iOS 10.2.

Sikoryak. Never before has a graphic novel had stranger source material. There have been graphic novels about superheroes. There have been graphic novels taken from Bible stories. There have been graphic novels based on real-life tales of the Holocaust. Until now, never had an obscure legal text inspired one. Sikoryak’s Terms and Conditions is exactly that — it’s the terms and conditions everyone clicks on when they use Apple iTunes. One typical word balloon has a character declaring, “Apple reserves the right to take steps Apple believes are reasonably necessary or appropriate to enforce and/or verify compliance with any part of this Agreement.” When Sikoryak says “complete and unbridged,” he means he’s included more than 100 pages of the legal jargon. To break up his story, he’s used a different style of cartooning for each full page. So, sometimes Steve Jobs — the ostensible hero of the book — appears to have been rendered by Frank Miller in the manner of the Dark Knight. At another point, he’s trapped in the same cubicle farm as Dilbert. Jobs even gets made over as Homer Simpson. I especially liked the section on copyright that looks like a page from the Tintin adventure Cigars of the Pharaoh. For fans of Canadian creators, there’s a page that features the Apple logo on a billboard above the skyline of Seth’s Dominion, as well as another that’s a riff on Kate Beaton’s Hark! A Vagrant. I can say with certainty that this is the finest graphic novel ever to be based on endless pages of mumbo-jumbo written by a team of corporate lawyers. danbrown@postmedia.com Twitter @DanatLFPress  Featured Businesses Contact us to Advertise » New Homes Sifton Properties Limited Travel & Lodging Elgin Travel and Cruises Travelplus Finance Kemp Family Wealth Management Group Go to the Marketplace » Contribute Send Your Scoop!

Announcing the results for the fourth quarter of 2016 on Tuesday night, Apple said it sold 45.5 million iPhones, 9.3 million iPads and 4.9 million Macs in the fourth quarter - a year-over-year decline of 5.2 per cent for iPhones, 6 per cent for iPads and a massive 14 per cent for the Mac, Engadget reported. International sales accounted for 62 per cent of the quarter's revenue. "Our strong September quarter results cap a very successful fiscal 2016 for Apple," said Apple's CEO Tim Cook. In after-hour trading, Apple shares were down 2.8 per cent to $114.99. "We're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and Apple Watch Series 2, as well as the incredible momentum of our Services business, where revenue grew 24 per cent to set another all-time record," Cook added in a statement. For its fiscal 2017 first quarter, Apple forecast revenue between $76 billion and $78 billion and operating expenses between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. "We are pleased to have generated $16.1 billion in operating cash flow, a new record for the September quarter," said Luca Maestri, Apple's CFO. "We also returned $9.3 billion to investors through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter and have now completed over $186 billion of our capital return programme," Maestri added. The fall in sales was mostly down to declining sales of the iPhone but the newly launched iPhone 7 and 7 Plus may tilt the figures in favour of Apple in the near future. The iPhone 7 went on sale from September 16. The current quarter's sales are likely to benefit from Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 fiasco. Apple is set to unveil new Mac computers on October 27.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Monica Hesse January 13 Follow @MonicaHesse Students from Walker Grant Middle School in Fredericksburg, Va., check out a portrait of Donald Trump newly on display at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) On Friday morning, the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery did what it’s always done before the inauguration of a new president and revealed a portrait of the man in question. So the public did what it’s always done, and came to see it. “Why is he tossing an apple?” asked a woman strolling through with two friends. “Because it’s the Big Apple,” one friend replied. The first woman said that she liked the inclusion of the apple. “I’m a dietitian, so that’s good.” This artwork in question: not, alas, a surprise reappearance of the six-foot-tall painting that Donald Trump bought with his charity’s money and which then went AWOL (Have you seen it? Send tips!), but rather a 1989 studio photograph by the photographer Michael O’Brien. Trump, in a suit and tie, stands against a blue sky backdrop, an apple tossed from his hand hanging in midair. The portrait is temporary. It will hang in its spot on the first floor until the end of February. It’s not an official presidential depiction — those aren’t commissioned until the end of a presidential term, and they join the official gallery upstairs only after the pol has left the White House. “It’s very witty, and we think a good representation,” said David Ward, the museum’s chief historian who was on hand to answer questions about the artwork. “It’s simultaneously a respectful portrait, but it also references Rene Magritte.” (You have seen the Belgian surrealist’s most famous painting: man in suit and tie, blue-sky backdrop, apple covering his face). The portrait was already a part of the gallery’s collection before the election. “We know Trump liked it, because he used it as the cover of his second book.” “Well, there he is,” a young woman said, pausing in front of the portrait and considering it with the discernment one gives to portraits of future leaders of the free world hanging in world-class art museums. “There he is,” she said again. “The future A-hole-in-chief.” “What are we all looking at?” a man asked as he strolled past the portrait with his wife. “Oh heavens, no, starting in a week, I’ll already be stuck with him for four years.” Starting in a week, Trump’s photograph will be displayed in federal buildings all over the country, as is customary. This portrait was an early chance for Washington to grow accustomed to seeing a new, literal face of power. One middle-aged man in a knit cap paused in front to take a photo: himself, in front of Trump, hand extended in a “thumbs-down” gesture. The man introduced himself as a refu­gee who left the former Soviet Union more than 20 years ago. He feared for America. He feared for America, because he thought he saw patterns he’d seen in his own totalitarian regime, and that his adopted country’s citizens weren’t ready for it. “You’ll learn to be subversive,” he said. “You’ll learn to speak in code.” But in the end, he said, everything would turn out all right. “It’s like a fire that will burn through and leave only diamonds.” The former Soviet refu­gee hurried past the portrait and was replaced by a young, heavyset man in glasses, who stood quietly in front of the photograph for several seconds while shaking his head back and forth. “Betcha he didn’t even catch that apple,” the man said finally, and walked away.

The previous $399 million damages award was overturned [opinion, PDF] by the Supreme Court last month. Apple's damages were initially calculated on Samsung's total profits from the sale of phones that infringed on the iPhone's patented design but the Supreme Court partially rejected this approach stating that profits could also be associated with the individual components of a product. It will now be a matter for the appeals court to decide. This is the most recent installment of the ongoing patent dispute [JURIST op-ed] between the two electronics giants. In October the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reinstated the $399 million award [JURIST report] after originally overturning it. In July Apple filed a brief [JURIST report] asking the Supreme Court to rule against Samsung in its patent infringement lawsuit. Last January the US District Court for the Northern District of California [official website] granted [JURIST report] Apple's motion for a permanent injunction against Samsung for infringing upon three software patents. In August 2014 the US District Court for the Northern District of California denied [JURIST report] Apple's request to ban Samsung from selling any of its products that infringed on Apple's patented technology. Earlier in August 2014 Apple and Samsung agreed to drop [JURIST report] all patent infringement lawsuits in courts outside of the US.

Andy Rubin has recruited over 40 people to his new firm, to be called Essential, according to Bloomberg. It aims to build an entire technology ecosystem using AI - from phones and smart home gadgets to app stores. Scroll down for video   Andy Rubin has recruited over 40 people to his new firm, to be called Essential, according to Bloomberg. It aims to build an entire technology ecosystem from phones to app stores and smart home gadgets.  ANDY RUBIN'S CAREER  Born in 1963, New Yorker Any Rubin worked on the first generation of wireless digital assistants, known as PDA. In December 1999 he launched Danger, creator of the Hiptop, a proto-smartphone, which was later bought by Microsoft.  Rubin cofounded Android in 2003 and sold it to Google in 2005, moving to the firm. In December 2013, Rubin started management of the robotics division of Google, before leaving on 30 October 2014 to start an incubator for hardware startups. Rubin and his wife, Rie, also own and operate Voyageur du Temps, a bakery in Los Altos, CA.   'Armed with about a 40-person team, filled with recruits from Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Rubin is preparing to announce a new company called Essential and serve as its Chief Executive Officer, according to people familiar with the matter,' Bloomberg said. A search in LinkedIn reveals several of the employees, including Niccolo De Masi, the ex-CEO of Glu Mobuile, who is listed as the firm's President & COO.  Rubin also recently hired Andy Fouché from Magic Leap, a Google backed firm developing AR glasses.  Bloomberg claims Essential will produce an range of both home and mobile products, and Rubin discussed his handset plans with Sprint executives at the recent CES show. Rubin registered Essential Products Inc. with California regulators in November 2015, and in late 2016, the company registered 'Essential' with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. There, it listed smartphones, tablets, accessories and 'computer operating software for mobile phones' among its goods and services.  According to Bloomberg, the handset will be aimed at the luxury end of the market, and could be expanded using plug in modules.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next The biggest storm in the universe: Stunning new NASA image...

Share this article Share 34 shares Bloomberg claims Essential will produce an range of both home and mobile products, and Rubin (pictured) discussed his handset plans with Sprint executives at the recent CES show. Rubin is aiming to put the phone on sale around the middle of this year for a price close to that of an iPhone 7 ($649), a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg, although they admitted 'all of the plans are still in flux'. Rubin is convinced AI is the next big change to ripple through the technology industry.  'New computing platforms happen every 10 to 12 years,' he said at the Bloomberg Technology Conference in June.  RUBIN'S DOG TAKES ON A ROBOT   While at Google's Rubin's dog hit the headlines after taking on a robot. A feisty terrier has taken on Boston Dynamics' 'Spot' dog by barking at it and even giving chase, showing that in the event of a robot uprising, dogs will still be man's best friend.The dog, named Cosmo, is said to belong to Andy Rubin, the co-founder of Android, who has previously managed the robotics program at Google. Google acquired Boston Dymamics, which makes numerous sized robotic animals in differing sizes, including Spot, which can run, climb stairs, jog next to its owner and even cope with being kicked. He believes that AI in the future will go one step further - being so powerful that it underpins every connected device. Mr Rubin said a combination of quantum computing and AI advancements could yield a conscious intelligence that would control every internet-enabled gadget.  'If you have computing that is as powerful as this could be, you might only need one. 'It might not be something you carry around; it just has to be conscious.' While Mr Rubin's claims are currently theoretical, his investment fund, Playground Global, is investing $300 million in companies trying to make this future of AI a reality. One of the companies his fund is investing in, is a quantum computing firm. Its name has not been disclosed. The company is made up of researchers who may one day be able to commercialise quantum devises using standard manufacturing processes, which could massively boost processing power.  Mr Rubin said: 'In order for AI to blossom and fulfill consumer needs, it has to be about data. 'That's where robotics come in - robots are walking mobile sensors, who can sense their environment and interact and learn from those interactions.'  Foxconn is in talks to manufacture Rubin's new smartphone, according to people familiar with the matter. At least one prototype of Rubin's phone boasts a screen larger than the iPhone 7 Plus's (5.5-inches) but has a smaller overall footprint because of the lack of bezels, one of the people said.   Share or comment on this article e-mail 34 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany She's falling for him?

Though they flew off shelves when released in November, Apple’s new laptops (especially the 15-inch version) received a lot of battery life complaints. On December 22, Consumer Reports unleashed an anti-Christmas gift for Apple. “Apple launched a new series of MacBook Pro laptops this fall, and Consumer Reports‘ labs have just finished evaluating them. The laptops did very well in measures of display quality and performance, but in terms of battery life, we found that the models varied dramatically from one trial to another.” Consumer reports condemned the battery life on 2016 MacBook Pro devices. [Image by Daryl Deino] The article added that tests revealed as little as 3.5 hours of battery life and, as a result, the new MacBook Pro series is the first not to receive recommended ratings from Consumer Reports. However, some called foul play on Consumer Reports‘ “test.” Rene Ritchie from iMore is just one of them. “Those results make very little sense and I’d take apart my chain, link by link, until I found out what was going on. I’d check and re-check my tests, I’d watch the systems like a hawk, and I’d do everything possible to find what was causing the variance. I’d even — gasp — try testing different machines and something other than web pages to see if that revealed more information,” Ritchie pointed out when referring to the strangely varied results Consumer Reports claimed to test. An opinion piece on the Inquisitr also questioned Consumer Report‘s test, even referring to it as “fake news.” Fake or not, the magazine has now reversed its “ruling” and can now recommend the new MacBook Pros after Apple released a software fix. “Consumer Reports has now finished retesting the battery life on Apple’s new MacBook Pro laptops, and our results show that a software update released by Apple on January 9 fixed problems we’d encountered in earlier testing.” Apple has issued a software update for the alleged battery life problem. [Image by Daryl Deino] As the article notes, with the updated software, the three MacBook Pros that were tested all ran well. One model even ran 18.75 hours on a charge. Still, some of the commenters after the article think it was Consumer Reports who had it wrong in the first place, not Apple. “Really? You claim this was a bug fix from Apple. And indeed there is a slight, obscure bug that caused this to happen. But, you had the Developer settings wrong to begin with. If you had the settings right, the results would have been correct, rather than really wrong to begin with,” says Eric Welch. “I think it is irresponsible of you not to mention anywhere in this article that the ‘problem’ you encountered would not have impacted the average user, but was only apparent in a highly specific configuration. In fact you make it sound like the average consumer needs the fix and that because of your testing you helped uncover something necessary for the average consumer,” claims Shawn Livingston. Indeed, most users of the new MacBook Pro have indicated that although the battery life isn’t as great as Apple made it out to be, it’s not a deal breaker either. Both the 13-inch and 15-inch versions of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar have received excellent reviews. In particular, Laptop Mag gave Apple’s 15-inch Pro four-and-a-half stars, claiming that if one is willing to pay a premium for it, the Touch Bar-enabled MacBook Pro is the best version of Apple’s high-end notebook yet.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Features Reviews Search Subscribe Laptops Samsung Notebook 9 vs. Apple MacBook Pro (13-inch) Will Shanklin 23 pictures New Atlas compares the features and specs of the 2017 Samsung Notebook 9 (13-in) and 2016 Apple MacBook Pro (13-in)View gallery - 23 images Apple's 13-inch MacBook Pro is set to have another Windows-based rival this year, in Samsung's updated Notebook 9. Read on, as we compare the features and specs of the two 13-in variants. Size Sizes are similar, though the Notebook 9 is a hair shorter and wider. Samsung's laptop also comes in at 7-percent thinner. Weight Weight is a different story, as the Notebook 9 is 40-percent lighter. Build The lightness is partially helped by Samsung's almost plasticky-feeling magnesium build. Apple sticks with its trademark aluminum. Colors We also handled a blue variant of the Notebook 9 at CES, but a Samsung representative tells us that only the titan (white-ish) model will launch in the U.S. Display size Despite having identical diagonal measurements, the MacBook Pro's screen is 5-percent bigger. That's due to using different aspect ratios (16:9 for the Notebook 9, 16:10 for the MacBook). Display resolution While the overall display quality of the Notebook 9 looked very good in our hands-on, its resolution is significantly lower than the MacBook's. Touchscreen Unlike many Windows laptops, the Notebook 9 doesn't have a touchscreen. Touch Bar In place of a touchscreen, Apple added a multitouch, contextual strip to the more expensive (US$1,800 and up) tiers of the 2016 MacBook Pro. Trackpad Samsung uses a physically-hinged ("diving board") trackpad, where clicking it is much easier on the bottom than top. Apple uses pressure sensitivity and haptic feedback to make its trackpad feel like it's moving when it isn't. Processor Samsung is using newer Kaby Lake processors in the upcoming laptops, while Apple's latest are 6th-gen Skylake. Another differentiator is Samsung offering a faster Core i7 option for the 13-inch model (though you can also get a Core i7 MacBook if you order a special configuration from Apple's online store). RAM Samsung adds an "up to" in its RAM specifications for the new notebooks, suggesting there's at least a possibility the entry-level models will have less. Storage Ditto for storage, where "up to" leaves the door open to a mere 128 GB SSD in the cheapest Notebook 9. MicroSD Samsung added a microSD slot to complement its internal storage. SD If you have a DSLR or mirrorless camera and don't use Wi-Fi, then prepare for adapters: Neither machine has a built-in, full-sized SD reader. Ports Samsung offers a balance of new and old: two legacy USB 3.0 ports, one USB-C and an HDMI for video out. Apple's ports are all Thunderbolt/USB-C. Standalone charging port The Notebook 9 has a standalone charging port, so you don't have to take up its USB-C slot (as you need to do with the MacBook). You do, however, also have the option of charging via USB-C on Samsung's. Fast charging Samsung also added a fast-charging feature, which Samsung representatives at CES told us works through both the proprietary charging port and USB-C. Battery Battery specs come out favorably for the MacBook (likely a big reason for the Notebook 9's weight advantage), but Samsung's laptop also has a lower-res display to drive. We can't draw firm conclusions, though, until we review the Notebook 9. Fingerprint sensor The Notebook 9 has a built-in fingerprint sensor. Apple only put its Touch ID sensors in the more-expensive models that also have the Touch Bar. Software Samsung's machine runs Windows 10 Home, while the MacBook is on macOS El Capitan. Release Samsung hasn't narrowed down a ship date for the new machine, apart from H1 of 2017. Starting price We also don't yet have pricing info for the Notebook 9. Given its lower-res screen, we'd hope it would come in significantly lower than the (arguably overpriced) MacBook.

Name: Subject: Message: Android founder Andy Rubin may be working on an iPhone-Pixel killer phone Newsby John Callaham2 days ago 49 3198 49 The Next Web Andy Rubin, one of the co-creators of the Android operating system, may be about to announce his next big project following his departure from Google two years ago. A new report claims he plans to reveal his new company, Essential, in the very near future. Essential is rumored to be launching a high-end bezel-less smartphone to compete with Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus and Google’s own Pixel XL. How Android evolved: 2014 to 2016 edition The story comes from Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources. It says that Rubin will serve as CEO of Essential, which will at first have a 40-person team that is made up of former Apple and Google team members. The story claims that the company is actually working on a number of different hardware devices, for both mobile and smart home markets, with the idea of linking them all together in a single platform. The story claims the flagship product of Essential will be a high-end smartphone with an edge-to-edge display, similar to the Xiaomi Mi MIX concept phone. The report also claims it will be able to gain new hardware features over time. The story says this support will come from the phone’s magnetic proprietary connector that will serve both as a battery charging port as well as a way for first and third-party hardware accessories to connect to this phone. This sounds similar to the Moto Mods made for the the Moto Z family of smartphones. The report claims this phone might launch some time in the middle of 2017 and it will be priced around the same as the iPhone 7. Ironically, the report did not state if Rubin’s phone will use Android. Rubin co-founded Android in 2003 and Google acquired the company in 2005 before officially launching the first version of the OS in 2008. Rubin remained with Google in its Android division until 2013, when he moved over to its robotics unit.

Apple was (it insists) courageous enough to completely remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7. It has compensated for that by releasing the AirPods, completely wireless earbuds that will cost you $159. Oh, and that’ll be $69 when you inevitably lose one. If you have a time machine and $3.99, you can maybe skip the $69 charge. The time machine is necessary because Apple pulled the Finder for AirPods app from the App Store. Why? Because Apple. According to a review of the app from MacRumors, Finder for AirPods worked as advertised. It used the Bluetooth connection between your phone and the AirPod to figure out roughly where it was hiding. There is no way to ascertain a direction simply from the Bluetooth signal strength, but the app had a signal strength graph and text descriptions of your proximity to the missing AirPod. It was like playing a game of hotter or colder. That’s not ideal, but it was a $4 app could potentially save you from a $69 bill. The app was sent to Apple for review on December 22nd, and published two weeks later. When people started talking about the app, Apple allegedly decided it should not have approved the app. The app was removed from the App Store, and the developer Deucks took to Reddit (where he had been promoting the app) to explain the situation. Deucks says that Apple contacted him to because it didn’t like the “concept” of the app. Even though it didn’t violate any rules, Apple decided to pull the app. Apple has regularly removed apps from the App Store that it doesn’t like, which it reserves the right to do. There certainly isn’t any technical issue with the app. Deucks has several similar Finder apps for other products, including Fitbit, Misfit, and Jawbone. Users in the announcement thread have speculated Apple is trying to save face by pretending AirPods aren’t so easy lose. Others suspect they want to make sure people replace lost AirPods for $69. Anyone who bought the app can request a refund from Apple via the support site. If you have it on your iPhone already, it should continue working for now. We’ve reached out to Apple to ask about its reasoning for removing the app, but we don’t expect a reply.

The House voted 227-198 to instruct committees to draft legislation by a target date of January 27 that would repeal the 2010 Affordable Health Care Act, often called Obamacare. The Senate approved the same measure early Thursday.

No Democrats supported the initiative. With this vote, Republicans began delivering on their promise to end Obamacare, which also was a campaign promise of President-elect Donald Trump. Related Content Obama's legacy could be sunk by Donald Trump The moment Trump's press conference degenerated into chaos The program, which expanded health coverage to some 20 million people, has been plagued by increases in insurance premiums and deductibles and by some large insurers leaving the system. The resolution passed by the House and Senate does not need presidential approval, since it is part of an internal congressional budget process. But once the Obamacare repeal legislation is drafted, both chambers will need to approve it, and a presidential signature will be required. Advertisement By that time, Trump will have been sworn in as president and he has urged Congress to act quickly to repeal and replace the Democratic program. Obamacare was enacted nearly seven years ago - over Republican objections - in an effort to expand coverage and give new protections for people with pre-existing health conditions and other barriers that left them without insurance. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link US President-elect Donald Trump their vote. Photo: AP In the past few years, the House has voted more than 60 times to repeal or alter Obamacare but Republicans had no hope a repeal would become law as long as Obama was president. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, said Obamacare was collapsing and action was urgent. For people who have health insurance through the Obamacare system, he said, "The deductibles are so high it doesn't feel like you've got insurance in the first place. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California helped pass Obamacare. Photo: AP "We have to step in before things get worse. This is nothing short of a rescue mission," Ryan said. Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi rebutted Republicans' claims that the law was a failure. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Congress has a stop start to the year. Photo: Bloomberg "The rate of growth in healthcare costs in our country has been greatly diminished by the Affordable Care Act," she said. "In the more than 50 years that they have been measuring the rate of growth, it has never been slower than now." The choice before lawmakers, she said, is "affordable care versus chaos." Trump applauded Congress' efforts with a Friday morning tweet saying, "The 'Unaffordable' Care Act will soon be history!" The president-elect, who takes office on January 20, pressed lawmakers this week to repeal and replace it "essentially simultaneously." Republican leaders would like to finish the repeal process within weeks but some lawmakers think it could take far longer. Some Republicans have expressed concern about starting a repeal before agreeing on how to replace provisions of the complicated and far-reaching law. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated repealing Obama's signature health insurance law entirely would cost roughly $350 billion over 10 years. Republicans say a good replacement would give states more control of a healthcare program and provide more stability on health insurance premiums.  Reuters Related Content Congress will start demolishing Obama-era regulations this month Advertisement Most Popular If you thought you'd deciphered Trump's master tweeting plan, you're probably wrong 'Pence could be the most powerful VP ever, or he could be kicked to the curb really fast' Trump dumps top officials in purge without precedent CIA director tells Donald Trump to watch his words Pendant identical to Anne Frank's found at notorious Nazi camp Follow Fairfax Foreign Share on FacebookFacebook Share on TwitterTwitter Follow SMH Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on EmailNewsletters Advertisement Most Viewed Today Previous slide Next slide World Trump dumps top officials in purge without precedent CIA director tells Donald Trump to watch his words Video shows police tackling and beating a black man suspected of stealing a car.

Here Are 3 to Start With Here's what you need to know about buying stocks and why these three stocks are great buys to start with. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Jan 13, 2017 at 4:31PM In both bull and bear markets, it's never too late to buy stocks. Picking the right stocks to buy, of course, is the biggest challenge. For investors looking to buy stocks today, here are three that look enticing. Image source: Getty Images. Buying stocks Why buy stocks in the first place? By buying stocks, investors position themselves to not only save money but to potentially watch their money grow, whether it's through share price appreciation, dividends, or both. Yes, buying stocks is a risk. But it is also an opportunity. It gives investors a chance to earn excellent returns. Finally, investors should keep in mind that there is never a "right" time to buy stocks. Since attempting to time when the market will rise or fall has proved to be impossible for anyone to do consistently, the best thing investors can do is maximize their time in the market, giving themselves the greatest opportunity to watch their portfolios' value rise over time. Ready to buy stocks? Start here Image source: Getty Images. 1. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL): It's no secret that stock valuations are currently a bit exorbitant. Indeed, the average price-to-earnings ratio of stocks in the S&P 500 today is 25, up from about 22 one year ago. This makes conservatively priced stocks that also happen to be excellent businesses rarer than usual. Nevertheless, they're still hanging around -- and Apple is one of them. With a P/E ratio of just 14, Apple gives investors an opportunity to buy a stock with a leading position in its key markets without paying a premium price. In addition, Apple stock shareholders get a nice dividend yield (annual dividend payments per share as a percentage of the stock price) of 1.9%. 2. Costco (NASDAQ:COST): With Costco stock, investors will have to pay a greater premium for the company's earnings than they'll have to pay for Apple. Costco stock has a P/E ratio of about 30. But there's good reason for Costco's steep valuation: Not only has the company carved out a strong, enduring competitive advantage for itself by gaining a cost advantage through economies of scale and wildly efficient operations, but management has also consistently improved operations. This is particularly evident by Costco's swelling net profit margin, which has increased from 1.7% to 2% between 2012 and 2016 -- a big and important gain for a warehouse bulk retailer. 3. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B): Last, it would be a shame to overlook the conglomerate built by the world's greatest investor himself, Warren Buffett. Under the Berkshire Hathaway name, Buffett has built up a portfolio of enduring subsidiaries and stock holdings poised to stand the test of time. Under Berkshire's ownership are built-to-last subsidiaries like Geico, Duracell, and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway. And some of Berkshire's largest stock holdings include iconic businesses like Coca-Cola, American Express, and Wells Fargo. Image source: Getty Images. Of course, when it comes to buying stocks, there's no guarantee. Historically, however, stocks have proved to be well worth the risk, compounding at approximately 10% annually over the last 100 years when dividends are reinvested. While it's impossible to know whether these three stocks could yield a similar 10% average annualized return in the coming years, buying these stocks will likely give investors a good chance of seeing an outcome like this.

The Big Apple Circus is putting all of its assets up for auction after declaring bankruptcy in federal court in November.  Interested buyers can place their bids on everything from the circus' vehicles to equipment to intellectual property, including its trademark, before a 5 p.m. deadline on Feb. 3. Bidders should be looking to acquire all or the majority of the circus' assets as one bulk lot, rather than individual parcels. A court-ordered auction is scheduled to take place on Feb. 7 at the offices of the Midtown law firm serving as the circus' legal counsel in its bankruptcy case.  "The priority goal is to sell everything, including the intellectual property, with the hopes that someone will have the circus in Lincoln Center this fall, reopened with the same name," said Stampler Auctions president Harry Stampler, whose company was formally appointed as the circus' auctioneer in bankruptcy court Wednesday. Founded in 1977, the Big Apple Circus has performed 38 seasons of its annual ring show on tour around the country and from its home base in Lincoln Center's Damrosch Park. At its height in 2008, the circus mounted more than 350 shows in eight cities and towns and generated more than $18 million in ticket and concession sales a year. It stood out among its corporate-owned peers as a nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing the circus arts to the masses. Over four decades, the group developed programming for blind, deaf and autistic children and offered free and discounted tickets to low-income families, among other community-oriented initiatives. But the financial crisis of 2008 hit the circus hard, executive director Will Maitland Weiss wrote in court documents filed to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. A drop-off in demand from companies for private shows and in attendance at venues outside New York City cut into the organization's earned revenues. Contributions from individual donors, government agencies and private foundations have remained relatively static while programming costs continue to rise, Weiss said.  In fiscal year 2016, the circus' expenses exceeded its income by $1 million and it owed its creditors $3.2 million. An emergency fundraising campaign failed to meet its $2 million goal by July 2016, so the organization canceled its 2016-2017 season and laid off its artists and production crew. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November, with hopes of "preserving the opportunity to restart the annual ring show with new financial support or through a sale of the circus to an interested buyer," according to Weiss' document. Stampler Auctions listed the assets with a starting bid on Jan. 5, but the company did request interested buyers submit deposits equal to ten percent of their bid and no less than $50,000. The auction will only take place if the circus receives two or more bids that meet its standards, according to court documents. A judge with the U.S. Bankruptcy must then approve the winning bid. Any property that isn't liquidated at that time will put up for public auction online, Stampler's president said. "We have extreme interest from people from New York all the way to California," and even a buyer from Eastern Europe, Stampler told DNAinfo New York. Three potential buyers have expressed interest in the circus as a bulk lot, six others are considering the entire package, and a dozen plan to wait for the online auction. But the auctioneer declined to comment on the range of initial bids, saying the circus and its lawyers hadn't authorized him to disclose that information, even to the bidders themselves.  "This can be from A to Z as far as prices go," Stampler said. "There are going to be people who value the intellectual property for what it truly is —  a great brand. There are going to be other people who say, 'I want the equipment.'" If you're rubbing your hands over the prospect of the remaining pickings, let us warn you — you won't be swooping in for the Big Apple Circus' URL. To our surprise, it doesn't own that.  Twitter Facebook Email More Next in This Is New York10 Ways to Remember Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Legacy in NYC Next in This Is New YorkCity Sees Lowest Amount of Office Space Rented in 7 Years, Study Shows Next in This Is New YorkHas Riverdale Officially Made It as a Hot Real Estate Market?

The Yedioth Ahronoth story, written by the investigative journalist Ronen Bergman, claimed to have details about a recent meeting between American and Israeli intelligence officials. Advertisement "Israeli officials who attended that meeting said that their American counterparts spoke despairingly about the election of Trump, who has repeatedly lashed out at the American intelligence community," Mr Bergman wrote. He continued: "The American officials went on to say that they believed that Putin has 'levers of pressure' over Trump - but refrained from going into any detail."

The dossier was known to US intelligence for months before it became public this week. Mr Trump has strongly denied that Russia has any leverage over him. On Friday, he tweeted that the "phony allegations against me were put together by my political opponents and a failed spy afraid of being sued".

The two sides collaborated on Operation Olympic Games, a covert campaign of cyber warfare designed to sabotage Iran's nuclear programme. Israel is alleged to have also assassinated four Iranian nuclear scientists as part of its effort to disrupt Iranian nuclear development. While Israel has cordial relations with Russia, Israeli intelligence would be afraid that any secrets which reached Moscow might be passed on to Tehran. Russia and Iran are known to share some intelligence. "The Israelis who attended the meeting said that the Americans advised them not to expose any sensitive sources to members of the Trump administration, lest that information reach Iranian hands, until it becomes clear that Trump does not have a compromised relationship with Russia and is not vulnerable to extortion," the Yedioth Ahronoth story said.

 FX boss: I 'worry' about what Silicon Valley will do to TV Jethro Nededog Jan. 12, 2017, 10:34 PM 4,840 facebook linkedin twitter email print John Landgraf at the Winter 2017 Television Critics Association press tour. Getty Images PASADENA, California — FX Networks President John Landgraf addressed Apple's announcement that it will be producing original television shows during the Television Critics Association press tour on Thursday. Earlier on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is taking meetings with Hollywood studios with the intention of producing original TV shows, including scripted programming, and movies by the end of 2017. Its first original series is "Carpool Karaoke," a half-hour interview series for Apple Music based on James Corden's hit segment from CBS's "The Late Late Show." Landgraf, who has been raising red flags about the continually growing amount of TV shows, aka "peak TV," was surprisingly accepting of Apple's announcement. In the past, he's objected to the influx of programming from the tech industry, specifically Netflix. FX research shows that there were 454 scripted TV shows in 2016, a new record. "There’s extraordinary amounts of resource and capital in Silicon Valley and they’re beginning to flow through Netflix and Amazon, and now others in the programming business, and that is creating an acceleration of this increased programming," Landgraf said of Apple's announcement. "We welcome those competitors," he continued. "Ultimately, what we’ve tried to do is identify it, label it, but we haven’t tried to use it as an excuse for a lack of performance. You can’t deny it’s happening. How good does a show have to be to be good enough for you to care about, to be relevant in this environment? The bar gets higher every year." But Landgraf said that he continues to worry about the new wave of TV shows and companies creating them. He compared that to the problem of "fake news" in which facts are treated as subjective. Landgraf refers to the growing amount of companies producing TV as "fragmentation." "There’s a lot of good that comes from fragmentation," he explained. "We see new and diverse voices. And young, talented people who have never had an opportunity are getting an opportunity and great television is coming from that. We’re trying to be a part of that as much as possible. I think my worry of where we’re going as a culture is that I don’t like the fact that everyone has their own news and I hope that we don’t get to the point where everyone has their own individual television show. "We want to make good commercial shows," he continued. "We want to be able to be a part of the conversation in America. I worry when you have 500 shows, 600 shows, 700 scripted shows. By the way, if you take all the shows, I still worry about where we’re going through the democratization of the internet. I can see the fragmentation created by the web." Landgraf also said he's "going out on a limb" and sticking to his prediction that 2018 will be the final year of peak TV and the number of scripted shows will decrease after that.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill today is news of original TV shows. Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Thursday. TV Shows: Apple is reportedly working on its own original TV shows and movies, reports The Wall Street Journal. This information comes from unnamed sources with inside information on the matter. The sources claim that the tech company is working to create new content to compete against other streaming services. The report claims that the content would be included in the company’s Apple Music streaming service, which costs $10 per month. Department of Transportation: Apple is now part of a new team made by the Department of Transportation, 9to5Mac notes. This new team created by the Department of Transportation will manage policies concerning self-driving vehicles. The group is made up of 25 people and one of them is AAPL’s Lisa Jackson. Jackson serves as the Vice President of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives for the tech company. The new team managing self-driving car policies will meet for the first time on Jan. 16. iPad Image Editing: Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE) is looking at new ways to edit images on the iPad, reports AppleInsider. Adobe has released a new proof of concept video that shows users editing images on an iPad with their voices. There is a virtual assistant in the video that is helping with the editing. It includes cropping the image, flipping it and making other small changes. The user then uses their voice to have the image posted to Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB). However, ADBE says that the software to edit images on an iPad with just verbal commands is still a ways off.

Dead Apple iOS monopoly lawsuit is reanimated Appeals court breathes life into App Store legal challenge 13 Jan 2017 at 20:23, Shaun Nichols A US Court of Appeals has resurrected a class-action lawsuit accusing Apple of monopoly behavior with its iOS App Store. The case, Pepper et al v Apple, was sparked by Cupertino customers Robert Pepper, Stephen Schwartz, Edward Hayter and Eric Terrell, who were upset at Apple's stranglehold on software for their iThings. However, their lawsuit was thrown out by the California Northern District Court in December 2013 after a judge refused to allow the plaintiffs to challenge Apple's price structure and lock-in of devices to its App Store service. More than three years after that verdict, an appeals court panel has reversed the decision [PDF] and ordered Apple to face the anti-trust allegations. The three-judge appeals court panel found the district court had erred in its decision that the plaintiff class – customers of Apple who used the App Store – would not have standing to sue for breach of antitrust laws. The customers have alleged that Apple's handling of the App Store violated a pair of US antitrust laws with the decision to lock out unauthorized applications. They also alleged the pricing policy of taking 30 per cent of revenues discourages developers from writing software that competes with Apple's own, effectively fixing higher prices for customers on the software that does make it into the App Store. Apple had countered that the plaintiffs had no standing to sue for antitrust violation because they were not direct customers, reasoning that they had bought the developers' apps, not an Apple product, when they made their App Store purchases. That argument had been upheld in 2013, triggering the appeal that brought Thursday's ruling to reverse the dismissal and revive the suit. "We conclude that any error, if indeed there was error, in the district court's consideration of the merits of Apple's Rule motion to dismiss for lack of statutory standing was harmless," the panel wrote. "We conclude further that Plaintiffs are direct purchasers of iPhone apps from Apple ... and that they therefore have standing to sue." With the appeal upheld, the case will now be remanded back to the District Court and will proceed later this year. ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections 27 Comments More from The Register Microsoft splashes Virtual Reality-slinging 'Scorpio' Xbox Console set to land in time for Christmas ... next year 41 Comments Virtual reality will take over the world by 2020, reckons analyst haus Psst.

Technology giant Apple is reportedly planning a foray into making original television programmes and movies, amid a decline in iPad and iPhone sales. The move could see the tech giant become a major player in Hollywood, with the goal being to offset revenue decline. Apple’s original content will be made available to subscribers of its $10-a-month streaming-music service, according to sources cited by The Wall Street Journal. Apple Music already has a limited number of documentary-style segments on musicians, but lacks the premium programming the company is considering to enter. To purchase rights to scripted television programs, the company has been in discussions with veteran producers in recent months. Apple has also held talks with experienced marketing executives at studios and networks, with the company reportedly looking to hire individuals experienced in content promotion. Apple could look to take on the likes of Netflix. The Wall Street Journal also reported that Apple had dropped hints to executives that it is contemplating offering original movies, besides TV. The company’s executives have told people in Hollywood that they expect to begin providing original scripted content by the end of 2017. Apple’s entry into original television and films could mark a major change in strategy, with the firm emerging more as a media company. In January last year, Financial Times reported that Apple Music has hit the 10 million subscriber milestone for its music streaming service within six months, a number which took its rival Spotify almost six years to reach. After launching in more than 100 countries in June, the service quickly became popular. Spotify hit the 10 million subscription milestone in 2014, with the company having 40 million active users in 56 markets.

ILLUSTRATION - Die Notfall-Apps "NINA" und "KATWARN", aufgenommen am 26.07.2016 auf einem iPhone 6 in Köln (Nordrhein-Westfalen). Photo by: Rolf Vennenbernd/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images Image: Rolf Vennenbernd/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images By Lance Ulanoff2017-01-13 19:56:38 UTC Is Apple's App Store a mall or the equivalent of a sole proprietor shop selling unique wares? That question appears to be at the heart of a now revived lawsuit against Apple, Pepper et al v. Apple Inc. In it, a group of plaintiffs claim that Apple's insistence on selling all iPhone apps through the App Store and not allowing developers to sell iOS apps through other channels, like third-party app stores or directly from the developers themselves, is anti-competitive and artificially inflating prices. SEE ALSO: 9 fun iPhone text message tips and tricks The lawsuit is almost five years old and, according to sources, was dismissed so early on in the legal process that the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals, which agrees with the plaintiffs, is still a procedural one. It only leaves the door open for the lawsuit to again move forward, without positioning it for a court battle, at least not yet. If the lawsuit ever gets that far and Apple loses, though, iPhone (and iPad) owners could download iOS apps outside the app store or be able to sue Apple for allegedly inflating the prices on apps with its 30% service fee. These are both remote possibilities. Currently, app developers go through a rigorous vetting process before Apple allows them to list the app in the store. Once they do that and start selling the app, Apple takes a 30% cut of the proceeds. That act alone might be forcing some app developers to charge more than they might on a platform that doesn't demand a revenue share cut. (Google Play takes a similar cut.) Looked at another way, though, Apple, which declined to comment for this article, doesn't develop the apps, set the prices or even upload the apps in its system. App developers upload their candidates, which Apple reviews and then places in the App store. Looked at this way, developers are simply renting space in the App store, much as a retailer might rent space in a mall. Apple's 30% is like rent. However, if your app is free and there are no in-app purchases, Apple doesn't charge you "rent" or that 30% fee, since it would be 30% of nothing. Apple's iOS app distribution strategy stands in contrast to Google's Android. Google Play applies a similar vetting process, but Android users can get apps from other platforms (though the process of "side-loading" isn't that common in many regions, including the U.S.). Amazon, for instance, has its own app store for its Fire Tablets (Fire OS runs on top of Android). Real concern Even without this lawsuit, frustration with the App Store, the consumer review system and discovery are prompting some to take action. Jake Frey, a former product lead at Fancy.com and someone who was involved with that company's mobile apps, agrees with the lawsuit's contention that the App Store is anti-competitive. "I don’t think there’s any developer that would argue with the fact that Apple has a monopoly here," said Frey. Frey's frustration with the App Store, which stems from "emotionally charged and highly inaccurate reviews" and that "many, many...great apps often go undiscovered," led him to develop Neue Store, an online app review hub. It will be a sort of Rotten Tomatoes for apps on which aggregated experts' reviews stand in place of user ratings.  Frey thinks it will help with the discovery of everything from iOS and Android apps to, eventually, VR apps and more. The app reviews will still link back to the App Store. There's no question, Frey admitted, that with Apple's App Store and its strict review process, you know what you're getting: a real app and not a malware-filled fake (an issue Google Android struggled with before and even after the launch of Google Play). However, he still finds major issues with the store. "There are so many holes and problems with the current App Store," said Frey, adding, "Even if an app developer does jump all the hurdles and is lucky enough to be featured and have great reviews, you still have this 30% cut. It's really debilitating." So while this lawsuit has months or even years before it crystallizes into legal action or simply dies, Neue Store will launch in a few weeks as a kind of challenge to the Apple Store's status quo.

Follow TechnoBuffalo The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus didn’t change too much in design compare to its predecessors, instead opting for a few iterative improvements. One of the additions was an IP67 rating that protected against dust and water. That was nice and all, but Apple is ready to improve on that figure already. According to a report from The Korea Herald, Apple is bumping up the waterproof design in its next iPhone to IP68. This new level of waterproofing matches Samsung’s effort in its Galaxy S7. The “6” in IP68 means the phone is dustproof; nothing will change with this. The “8” means it’ll withstand more time under water—up to 1.5 meters in depth and 30 minutes of submersion. The iPhone 7’s IP67 design is only able to be submerged between 15 centimeters and 1 meters under water. The improvement is not life changing, but it is a welcomed one in case your iPhones takes a dive off the deep. A nice addition, but it’s still not covered under warranty Apple is upselling the iPhone 7’s water-resistant design with their latest round of ads, but it’s not all magic. Apple Care doesn’t cover water damage for the iPhone 7 and probably won’t with the next iPhone. It’d be nice to have the extra layer of warranty protection, but alas we don’t get it. One of our video editors had his own mishap while testing out his new iPhone 7 Plus that resulted in water damage that ended up costing him $300.

Even though all of the devices that were at issue in the original case are completely outdated, the two companies are still engaged in a bitter dispute regarding damages. Following a recent Supreme Court ruling that wiped $399 million in damages from Samsung’s original bill to Apple, MacRumors reports that the two companies will now head down to the U.S. Court of Appeals where a more precise determination will be made as to how much money Samsung owes Apple for infringing upon the look and feel of the iPhone. Don't Miss: It looks like Samsung just leaked the Galaxy S8 in two promo videos Before diving in, it’s worth noting what is and what isn’t in dispute here: That Samsung released a handful of devices that infringed upon a swath Apple patents is not open for debate, but what remains unresolved is how the damages for said infringement should be calculated. Whereas Samsung believes that Apple should only be entitled to damages based on the portions of its accused devices that actually infringe, Apple maintains that it’s entitled to all of the profits Samsung enjoyed from its infringing devices. Previously, Apple quoted Congress while arguing that “it is the design that sells the article” and that it’s practically impossible to attribute profits to a specific portion of a device.     As it stands now, Samsung is on the hook to Apple for $149 million and it will be interesting to see the extent to which that figure increases once both sides plead their case before the U.S. Court of Appeals. And so, the epic legal saga between Apple and Samsung continues.

This case has now dragged onto its sixth year. The case was originally started because Samsung was accused of infringing on the iPhone’s design. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit officially reopened the case yesterday after the U.S. Supreme Court recommended it stay opened to figure out how much Samsung would owe Apple in patent infringements (via Law360.com). A month ago the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Samsung wouldn’t have to pay $399 million in damages to Apple. That number was based on the total sales revenue Samsung made from its Galaxy line at the time. This new decision means the court must once again decide a new number for Samsung to pay Apple in patent infringements based on total device, rather than individual components that went into the Galaxy phones. Apple says the decision will once “again send a powerful signal that stealing isn’t right.” Whatever the case may be, it’s now been opened once again and we’ll continue to report on the suit as it progresses forward.

The battle over the MacBook Pro battery life is over… guess who won? by Chris Smith 13 January 2017 0 shares Read Comments The new Apple MacBook Pro has finally joined its brethren in the realm of recommended laptops, following a protracted debate over its battery life. The influential Consumer Reports website has now awarded the 2016 model a ‘Recommended’ tag; after initially deciding against it due to what it deemed ‘wildly unpredictable’ battery expectancy. Apple fought back earlier this week claiming Consumer Reports' test methodology, which involved turning off the cache in the Safari browser, had uncovered an easily fixable bug. After retesting the MacBook Pro with the updated software, CR declared all three models performed well, with up to 18.75 hours of charge. CR explains: “The process we followed with Apple is the same process we follow with any manufacturer when we discover a significant problem. We shared our test results with the company so it could better understand our findings and deliver a fix to consumers. Since Apple made a fix, we retested the laptops. “Now that we’ve factored in the new battery-life measurements, the laptops’ overall scores have risen, and all three machines now fall well within the recommended range in Consumer Reports ratings.” In our own tests of the MacBook Pro, we experienced no such issues with the battery life, and few other sites reported it either. Certainly not the 3.5 - 19 hour variances experienced by CR, anyway. Now we know why. MacBook Pro 13-inch 2016 - Touch Bar Tips & Tricks Is the MacBook Pro on your shopping list in 2016?

While a few arrived (Crossy Road, Minecraft, Alto's Adventure, etc.), it has hardly been a stampede towards the tvOS platform from the top mobile developers. One of the reasons? Apple has been limiting the app size to a paltry 200MB compared to the 4GB installs it allows on iOS. Related: Best Apple TV games Now, the company has seen the error of its ways and done what it should have all along ditched the low install limit. This will mean less additional loading of content while playing games. In a post on its developer site Apple explained (via Engadget): “The size limit of a tvOS app bundle has increased from 200 MB to 4 GB, so you can include more media in your submission and provide a complete, rich user experience upon installation. Also, tvOS apps can use On-Demand Resources to host up to 20 GB of additional content on the App Store.” Developer Steve Troughton Smith called this a ‘huge step’ towards making tvOS a legitimate gaming platform. The developer also speculated a revamped Apple TV with an A10 processor and more storage might even make the company’s hockey pack more powerful than the new Nintendo Switch.

ILLUSTRATION - Die Notfall-Apps "NINA" und "KATWARN", aufgenommen am 26.07.2016 auf einem iPhone 6 in Köln (Nordrhein-Westfalen). Photo by: Rolf Vennenbernd/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images Image: Rolf Vennenbernd/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images By Lance Ulanoff2017-01-13 19:56:38 UTC Is Apple's App Store a mall or the equivalent of a sole proprietor shop selling unique wares? That question appears to be at the heart of a now revived lawsuit against Apple, Pepper et al v. Apple Inc. In it, a group of plaintiffs claim that Apple's insistence on selling all iPhone apps through the App Store and not allowing developers to sell iOS apps through other channels, like third-party app stores or directly from the developers themselves, is anti-competitive and artificially inflating prices. SEE ALSO: 9 fun iPhone text message tips and tricks The lawsuit is almost five years old and, according to sources, was dismissed so early on in the legal process that the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals, which agrees with the plaintiffs, is still a procedural one. It only leaves the door open for the lawsuit to again move forward, without positioning it for a court battle, at least not yet. If the lawsuit ever gets that far and Apple loses, though, iPhone (and iPad) owners could download iOS apps outside the app store or be able to sue Apple for allegedly inflating the prices on apps with its 30% service fee. These are both remote possibilities. Currently, app developers go through a rigorous vetting process before Apple allows them to list the app in the store. Once they do that and start selling the app, Apple takes a 30% cut of the proceeds. That act alone might be forcing some app developers to charge more than they might on a platform that doesn't demand a revenue share cut. (Google Play takes a similar cut.) Looked at another way, though, Apple, which declined to comment for this article, doesn't develop the apps, set the prices or even upload the apps in its system. App developers upload their candidates, which Apple reviews and then places in the App store. Looked at this way, developers are simply renting space in the App store, much as a retailer might rent space in a mall. Apple's 30% is like rent. However, if your app is free and there are no in-app purchases, Apple doesn't charge you "rent" or that 30% fee, since it would be 30% of nothing. Apple's iOS app distribution strategy stands in contrast to Google's Android. Google Play applies a similar vetting process, but Android users can get apps from other platforms (though the process of "side-loading" isn't that common in many regions, including the U.S.). Amazon, for instance, has its own app store for its Fire Tablets (Fire OS runs on top of Android). Real concern Even without this lawsuit, frustration with the App Store, the consumer review system and discovery are prompting some to take action. Jake Frey, a former product lead at Fancy.com and someone who was involved with that company's mobile apps, agrees with the lawsuit's contention that the App Store is anti-competitive. "I don’t think there’s any developer that would argue with the fact that Apple has a monopoly here," said Frey. Frey's frustration with the App Store, which stems from "emotionally charged and highly inaccurate reviews" and that "many, many...great apps often go undiscovered," led him to develop Neue Store, an online app review hub. It will be a sort of Rotten Tomatoes for apps on which aggregated experts' reviews stand in place of user ratings.  Frey thinks it will help with the discovery of everything from iOS and Android apps to, eventually, VR apps and more. The app reviews will still link back to the App Store. There's no question, Frey admitted, that with Apple's App Store and its strict review process, you know what you're getting: a real app and not a malware-filled fake (an issue Google Android struggled with before and even after the launch of Google Play). However, he still finds major issues with the store. "There are so many holes and problems with the current App Store," said Frey, adding, "Even if an app developer does jump all the hurdles and is lucky enough to be featured and have great reviews, you still have this 30% cut. It's really debilitating." So while this lawsuit has months or even years before it crystallizes into legal action or simply dies, Neue Store will launch in a few weeks as a kind of challenge to the Apple Store's status quo.

SAN FRANCISCO: iPhone app purchasers may sue Apple over allegations that the company monopolised the market for iPhone apps by not allowing users to purchase them outside the App Store, leading to higher prices, a US appeals court ruled on Thursday. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruling revives a long simmering legal challenge originally filed in 2012 taking aim at Apple’s practice of only allowing iPhones to run apps purchased from its own App Store. A group of iPhone users sued saying the company’s practice was anticompetitive. Apple had argued that users did not have standing to sue it because they purchased apps from developers, with Apple simply renting out space to those developers . Developers pay a cut of their revenues to Apple in exchange for the right to sell in the App Store. A lower court sided with Apple, but Judge William A Fletcher ruled that iPhone users purchase apps directly from Apple, which gives iPhone users the right to bring a legal challenge against Apple. If the challenge ultimately succeeds, “the obvious solution is to compel Apple to let people shop for applications wherever they want, which would open the market and help lower prices,” said Mark C Rifkin, an attorney with Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz representing the group of iPhone users. “The other alternative is for Apple to pay people damages for the higher-than-competitive prices they’ve had to pay historically because Apple has utilised its monopoly.” Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 13, 2017 2:20pm   Comments Share: Related AAPL Apple's AirPod Success: Headphone Users Show They're Willing To Cut The Cord Gene Munster Shares His Expectations For Apple's iPhone 10 Apple, Google, Netflix Are In Buy Range; Amazon, Facebook Near Breakouts (Investor's Business Daily) Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, was a guest on CNBC's "Fast Money: Halftime Report" segment on Friday and shared his take on why Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)'s best days are behind it. According to Sacconaghi, while it is clear that Apple won't be able to show investors the massive growth rate it has in the past, it is unclear what exactly investors can come to expect over the next five years. Sacconaghi stated that Apple held the title of being "one of the most spectacular companies in history" over the past 10 years given its ability to boost revenue 10-fold and earnings 30-fold. 'Mature' iPhone Today, Apple's core product, the iPhone, has become a mature product. Unfortunately, this is what represents the majority of the company's revenues and profits. "For Apple to really grow meaningfully again, it's going to have to find new things beyond the phone, and that's a big question mark," the analyst added. As such, he has "no doubt" that Apple's best days are behind it. Nevertheless, the analyst feels very comfortable in recommending Apple's stock at this point in time and believes the highly anticipated iPhone 8 will help boost Apple's earnings and generate returns for investors given the large number of consumers who are willing to pay for upgrades on a consistent basis. Beyond the iPhone 8 it remains "unclear" if investors can hold on to Apple's stock for the next five years. "There's a leap of faith that Apple is in an innovative company," he concluded.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Jan 13, 2017 at 1:58PM Just don't lose them. Image source: Apple. What's old is new again. A decade ago, Bluetooth headsets were all the rage. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched its initial foray into Bluetooth headsets in 2007 alongside the original iPhone, priced at $129. The company subsequently reduced the price to $99 before quietly discontinuing the device in 2009. Remember this old thing? Image source: Apple. With last month's launch of the (delayed) AirPods, Apple hopes to usher in a sort of renaissance in wireless headphones, not unlike the tablet renaissance that it kicked off in 2010 with the iPad. So far, it's working. Survey says E-commerce analytics specialist Slice Intelligence released a report earlier this week, suggesting that Apple's AirPods are sprinting out of the gate following the launch in December. While that's a couple months late relative to the original target launch of October, the AirPods are making up for lost time. Slice notes that an overwhelming 75% of all headphones sold online in December were of the wireless flavor, and there was a noticeable spike in sales on the day the AirPods went on sale. Image source: Slice Intelligence. Following the launch, AirPods now comprise 26% of all online revenue for wireless headphones. Apple's other headphones brand, Beats, also grabs another big chunk of the market, with 15% revenue share following the AirPods launch. That means that Apple represents over 40% of the market in terms of revenue. Considering Apple's premium pricing with both AirPods and Beats, the company is likely grabbing a disproportionate share of revenue relative to unit share. Image source: Slice Intelligence. Even before the AirPods launch, Beats was the dominant brand by far, with 24% of revenue share. Beats' strong position in the premium headphone space, which was mostly a function of marketing instead of product quality, was always one of the key motivators for the 2014 acquisition. There's more where that came from Slice's data is even more impressive when you consider how severely supply constrained AirPods have been and continue to be. If AirPods have been able to grab that much of the market immediately, even though Apple is still unable to sufficiently fulfill demand, that's a good sign for Apple's wireless audio ambitions. New orders placed on Apple's online store are quoted shipping times of six weeks. It's unfortunate that AirPods mostly sat on the sidelines during the bulk of the holiday shopping season due to severely limited availability, but in all likelihood, those are simply delayed sales instead of lost sales. Apple users are particularly loyal and willing to endure waiting instead of defecting to another brand. That's especially true since AirPods include a number of integrated software features that are designed specifically for Apple devices -- features that differentiate AirPods from other headphones. Maybe Bluetooth headphones are here to stay this time around. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

However, the company won’t be arguing over patents for a change, instead Apple will need to fight off allegations of price-fixing in the iOS App Store as part of a new anti-trust lawsuit. This isn’t the first time Apple has been brought up on anti-trust charges either, the company was previously found to have been complicit in eBook price fixing, which ended with the company being fined £315 million. This App Store price fixing lawsuit has come up once before back in 2011, at which time the company defended itself by claiming it isn’t directly selling software to consumers, so it can’t be fixing prices. However, the US Appeals Court wasn’t particularly happy with that explanation at the time and now, an attorney is taking on the case, according to Bloomberg. Image Credit: BGR Attorney Mark Rifkin is heading up the lawsuit and while it isn’t a class-action just yet, it may end up going that way due to the sheer amount of people who have purchased apps on iOS between 2007 and 2013. The goal here is obviously to get Apple to pay out and in this case, the suit will be pressing for “hundreds of millions” of US dollars. However, if the court sides with the customers in this case, then Apple may also be forced to start allowing third-party app stores to sell on iOS, which would be a problem for Apple’s walled garden approach. It could also end up making plenty of iPhone and iPad users more susceptible to viruses. KitGuru Says: Apple has been found guilty of price-fixing before, so this lawsuit isn’t entirely doomed to fail. However, I do think allowing third-party app stores on to iOS would be a mistake in the long run as quality control would be much harder to maintain.

(Reuters/Beck Diefenbach) Share Written by Mike Murphy Obsession Batteries January 13, 2017 Nothing to see here. Just before Christmas, Consumer Reports, the US’ preeminent product-testing organization, announced that it would not be recommending Apple’s new MacBook Pros, a first for the tech giant’s laptops. Although it characterized them as generally good, inconsistencies in the Pros’ battery life proved too serious for Consumer Reports to overlook. Apple looked into the issue over the holidays, and provided Consumer Reports with updated software on Jan. 9. Three days later, the organization said it had retested the laptops and changed its mind; it now recommends the new MacBooks to American buyers. According to Apple, the issue came down to the specific way Consumer Reports tests laptops, which the average user would apparently never experience. As an Apple spokesperson put it to Quartz: We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing websites, which turns off the browser cache. This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage. Their use of this developer setting also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons, which created inconsistent results in their lab. After we asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings, they told us their MacBook Pro systems consistently delivered the expected battery life. We have also fixed the bug uncovered in this test. That bug has been fixed in a new version of Apple’s macOS operating system, now available to Mac owners through Apple’s beta-testing program. It’s unclear when the software will be rolled out in an official update. During its original testing, Consumer Reports experienced MacBook Pro battery life ranging from 4.5 hours to 20 hours on some models (the laptops are supposed to get around 10 hours of use on a single charge). On Jan. 12, it said new tests had yielded average battery-life results of 15.75 hours, 18.75 hours, and 17.25 hours. So after a brief hiccup, Apple’s streak of Consumer Reports laptop recommendations continues unbroken. Whether the switch-up will actually convince consumers remains to be seen. Early indications of the new Pro’s performance are expected at Apple’s quarterly earnings call on Jan. 31, but it’ll likely take another quarter still to get a sense of the laptops’ staying power.

LIKE   TWEET   SHARE   PIN   SHARE   POST MAIL MORE Posted January 13, 2017 at 6:17pm by iClarified · 7209 views · Translate Apple's next generation iPhone will reportedly feature IP68 water resistance, an improvement on the IP67 rating of the iPhone 7, according to the Korea Herald. “Apple’s iPhone 8 will feature the IP68 rating protection as part of drastic upgrades marking the 10th anniversary of the iPhone this year,” an industry source told The Investor on condition of anonymity. Currently, the Galaxy S7 has an IP68 rating which means it can handle submersion for 30 minutes in 1.5 meters of water. The iPhone 7's IP67 rating means it can handle being under 1 meter of water for half an hour. Both are protected from total dust ingress. We've been hearing reports for some time that the 10th anniversary iPhone will be a major update. It will purportedly have a front glass cover and chassis, joined by a metal bezel and an edge-to-edge display that has no bezels on the top and bottom. Additionally, the front camera, Touch ID, speaker, and other sensors will apparently be embedded into the display. Another report claims that the device would be a clear piece of glass with a next-generation OLED screen. More recently, Apple is said to have be equipping the phone with wireless charging and a 3D camera. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

Bernstein, told CNBC's "Fast Money: Halftime Report." Sacconaghi reiterated his position on Friday that "Apple's best days are behind it," which he first told CNBC in 2015. "There's no doubt about it," Sacconaghi said. "It was was one of the most spectacular companies in history over the last ten years, revenue went up ten-fold, earnings went up thirty-fold. That's not happening again. And the smartphone is an increasingly mature product, and that's the preponderance of Apple's revenues and profits. For Apple to really grow meaningfully again, it's going to have to find new things beyond the phone, and that's a big question mark." Getty Images A person walks by an Apple Store. But Sacconaghi said he doesn't totally agree with PayPal co-founder CEO Peter Thiel, who confirmed to the New York Times this week that "the age of Apple is over." "We know what a smartphone looks like and does," Thiel told the Times. "It's not the fault of [Apple CEO] Tim Cook, but it's not an area where there will be any more innovation." Sacconaghi said he feels "very comfortable" saying investors can, and will, make money on Apple stock in the next year. The iPhone 8 cycle this year should propel Apple's earnings, Sacconaghi said. "The iPhone, at least now, is not dead, and there's a lot of pent-up upgraders," Sacconaghi said. CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment. While the era of double-digit growth is "clearly" over, upgrades like brighter screens, 5G, wireless charging and even foldable smartphones could create big up-sell opportunities for the company's phones, Angelo Zino, CFRA research senior industry analyst, told "Squawk Alley" on Friday. Brian White, analyst at Drexel Hamilton, said he also disagrees with Thiel — he still thinks the biggest innovations are ahead for Apple. "It's a very myopic view to look at the smartphone as the only play on Apple," White told "Squawk Alley" on Friday. "Today, it is the bulk of what they do...but if when we look out into the horizon, and we were just at CES last week, I think a self-driving car fits very well with what Apple does. VR/AR, television markets and also personal robots, that was a big theme at CES. So I think there a lot of opportunities for Apple." Still, investors are right to question whether Apple's bets will pay off when it comes to smartwatches and television, Sacconaghi said. "Beyond that, can you invest in this stock for five years? I understand where Peter Thiel is coming from: It's unclear that you can," Sacconaghi said. "There's a leap of faith that Apple is an innovative company."

Apple made a huge leap forward on this front with the iPhone 7 that launched last year. According to industry sources in South Korea, Samsung Electronics' Galaxy S8 and Apple's iPhone 8 -- the most anticipated smartphone launches of the year -- will feature the highest level of dust and water resistance. One source stated that Apple's iPhone 8 will catch up with Samsung on waterproofing by featuring IP68 rating protection as part of the drastic upgrades that will distinguish Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone launching this fall.     Samsung, the world's largest smartphone maker, is extending the adoption not just for the upcoming Galaxy S8 but also for the lower-end models, including the A3, A5 and A7 that were recently unveiled. "Samsung is considering water protection even for the cheapest J series phones as they are the best-selling Galaxy phones," another source said.   Whether Apple will be moving in the same direction by adding water resistance to the iPhone SE or older models is unknown at this time, but probably not. Water resistance began with the iPhone 7 and will likely be a part of all future iPhones.   Although Apple was granted yet another water resistant patent in September, their biggest contribution on this front thus far was eliminating the headphone jack on the iPhone 7. Technically speaking, Apple has a patent whereby a future OLED display could act as a speaker which would eliminate speaker grills and add another major water resistant dimension.   Acoustic displays were a big hit at this year's CES trade show as the next big thing in HDTV's. The public's excitement over this feature proved that this is ready for prime time. Though like all patents, the timing of Apple actually executing on this breakthrough feature will remain a mystery until it's launched.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Read all about it below: Related articles The Dream of ‘Channel Esperanto' Does VAR Mean ‘Value at Risk'? Apple's iPhone monopoly lawsuit A class action lawsuit by consumers claiming that Apple monopolized the iPhone's third-party app market from 2008 to 2013 will now proceed, a federal appeals court in San Francisco has ruled, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. The plaintiffs claim that Apple controlled the market by requiring all sales be made through its App Store, where the vendor collects a 30 percent commission, the report said. Those commissions have cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars, the complaint alleges, according to the Chronicle's report. A U.S. District judge had dismissed the lawsuit in 2013, ruling that customers bought the apps from developers, which in turn, passed along the commissions to Apple. Meanwhile, Consumer Reports reversed its earlier non-recommendation of Apple's latest MacBook Pro laptops, after having retesting the battery life and found it satisfactory.  A software update released by Apple on 9 January fixed the problems, the watchdog said. Intermedia's sales reorganization Cloud business application vendor Intermedia has revamped its sales organization to offer increased support to its channel ecosystem and has hired new leadership for the unit, the company has announced. The firm said it is increasing investments across nearly every sales function, from customer and partner account management to sales enablement and engineering. The upgrades directed at channel partners include more enablement and support and stepped-up engagement from account managers. Intermedia did not offer details on its new sales leaders. Tech Data's DataXoom Distributor Tech Data has announced it will market DataXoom's mobile data services to its network of solution providers in the U.S. DataXoom's serves aim to help mid-market and enterprise businesses connect a fleet of data-only mobile devices, including tablets, mobile WiFi hotspots and 2-in-1 laptop, to one or more of the 4G and LTE networks from AT&T, Verizon, or Sprint, the distributor said. AppDynamics' IPO AppDynamics, which makes application performance monitoring software, said in an updated S-1 regulatory filing dated 12 January that it will price its initial public offering (IPO) between $10 and $12 a share. The company filed for an IPO in December. At $12 a share the IPO will value AppDynamics at around $1.5 billion, less than the startup's last private valuation of $1.9 billion, which isn't good news for its existing investors, as Business Insider reports. In the nine months ended 31 October, AppDynamics posted a $95 million net loss on $158.4 million in revenue versus a $92.3 million loss on $102.7 million in sales for the same period last year. Dell EMC's job cuts Dell EMC has begun cutting jobs in its Hopkinton, MA location, according to a post on Thelayoff.com. Insiders are expecting total cuts of up to 25 percent of Dell EMC staff, with a 15 percent reduction in the enterprise and mid-range storage division affecting a wider range of teams than normal in engineering, one employee wrote. CCC's new channel chief Cloud Computing Concepts, a Delray Beach, FL-based provider of communications services to small, medium and enterprise businesses, has named Dino Morra as its VP of sales. Morra, a 26-year industry veteran, will oversee C3's existing channel team and will be responsible for continuing the development of the company's channel program. SoftBank's investment fund SoftBank's Vision Fund intends to invest heavily in startups, but the majority of the capital, as much as 75 percent, will be directed toward large investments in private and public markets, the New York Times reports. The fund might take a position in an undervalued publicly held technology company or engage in a large private equity deal, while targeting smaller investments in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and robotics, the report said. Officials recently pledged to invest $50 billion in the U.S. and to create 50,000 jobs.

It comes after the company investigated issues that led to the laptop failing Consumer Reports' tests. Apple's had a tough time with its new MacBook Pro. Although sales have been very strong, many customers have reported being unable to reach Apple's battery life claims. Last month, the company removed the "estimated time remaining" meter from macOS as a result, without explaining what's going on. The company is now working on a software update that should improve things for some users. After the Pro became the first MacBook not to receive a Consumer Reports recommendation, Apple worked with the testing team over the holidays to figure out what went wrong. In its labs, Consumer Reports experienced wild battery life swings, varying between tests by up to 5x. It turns out the test scores were down to two problems. First, Consumer Reports disabled a hidden Safari setting to prevent the browser caching webpages. This feature downloads parts of webpages so they can be retrieved faster in the future and is standard in all modern browsers. Consumer Reports said it disables caching on every laptop it tests, even though users will have it turned on. Caching improves battery life because the computer doesn't need to make so many network requests. After working with Consumer Reports, Apple ascertained what caused the inaccurate battery life readings the labs observed. It found that disabling Safari's caching triggered a rare bug in the browser that led to the unpredictable battery behaviour. The company reported its discovery to Consumer Reports which agreed to run the tests again with a patch for the problem installed. It evaluated the models on test again and confirmed they "all performed well," enabling it to make a recommendation. "The process we followed with Apple is the same process we follow with any manufacturer when we discover a significant problem," said Consumer Reports. "We shared our test results with the company so it could better understand our findings and deliver a fix to consumers. Since Apple made a fix, we retested the laptops. Now that we’ve factored in the new battery-life measurements, the laptops’ overall scores have risen, and all three machines now fall well within the recommended range in Consumer Reports ratings." Considering that Consumer Reports saw battery durations run anywhere from 3.75 hours up to 19.5 hours, the impact of the Safari bug was quite severe. Once fixed by Apple, the MacBook settled down to an 18.75 hour runtime under test conditions. The software update that led to the improvements should reach all MacBook Pro owners in the next few months. It is in testing under Apple's Beta Software program now and will improve the power consumption of Safari. The current release is macOS Sierra 10.12.3 Beta.

Consumer Reports has walked back its initial criticisms of Apple's MacBook. The product-testing publication retested the new MacBook Pro laptops and found that an early January update fixed issues with the computer's battery life. Now all three versions have higher scores and fall within Consumer Reports' "recommended" range. Before the revision, the three new MacBook Pros were the first MacBooks not to receive "recommended" rating from Consumer reports. show chapters New MacBook Pros miss Consumer Reports recommendation for 1st time    Friday, 23 Dec 2016 | 4:45 PM ET | 05:36 In December, tests of the new laptops showed battery life that was "highly inconsistent from one test to the next," Consumer Reports said. That issue, caused by a bug in the Safari browser, has since been fixed, Consumer Reports said. "When we get results that are that wildly inconsistent, the only thing we can suggest to users that they can reliably expect is the lowest possible battery life," Glenn Derene, content director at Consumer Reports, told CNBC's "Power Lunch" this week. "We couldn't recommend them given that. We had communicated to Apple what our findings were and to their credit, they worked really closely with us. They wanted to get more data, they wanted to get more information. And we cooperated with them." Apple told CNBC that during the tests, Consumer Reports had used a hidden Safari setting for developing websites which turns off browser cache. "This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage," Apple said of the original "not recommended" rating. "Their use of this developer setting also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab." While the spat with Consumer Reports is resolved, Apple's new MacBooks have faced other criticisms, especially from professionals that do use more advanced settings. Creative professionals, once considered Apple's core audience, complained the update came too late, had too few USB and SD ports, and failed to make up for its lack of function keys. "Apple has long since expanded beyond that base, especially if you look at the full set of devices including iPhones," Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research, wrote when the laptop was released in the fall. "Apple clearly isn't selling hundreds of millions of iPhones solely to people that use Photoshop for a living." Still, CEO Tim Cook has said, "The world's creative forces use the Mac to push the world forward."

Samsung Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | January 13, 2017 72 shares 46 23 0 2 0 0 0 0 1               Last year was apparently the death knell for the 3.5mm headphone jack. Even before Apple could get around to axing the port, Motorola launched flagships without it on board, and ever since it's been a guessing game whether or not a company will have it or not. Some have kept it around, like Google and its Pixel lineup of phones, which is certainly good news for anyone who's not ready to give up the headphone jack. A lot of folks call ditching the 3.5mm headphone jack a user-hostile move, and I tend to agree with them, because I understand the sentiment. The jack has been around for so long, and it's compatible with so many things -- not just headphones. When Apple dropped it, a friend of mine pointed out that he wouldn't be able to plug his phone into the auxiliary port in his car. It's safe to say that he wasn't very happy. What's interesting about it, is that he's not an Apple fan, and he didn't even intend on buying an iPhone 7. He was waiting to see what Google was going to unveil with the Pixel and Pixel XL, and he was genuinely concerned that if Apple did get rid of the headphone jack, even more companies --including Google-- would be getting rid of it, too. Apple wasn't the first to do it, but Apple picked up the most flak for doing it anyway. But that's understandable, too, because other companies do have a tendency to follow Apple in these situations. In fact, many could argue that Motorola only got rid of the 3.5mm headphone jack because Apple was going to. (While it was rumors for the rest of us, there's a good chance Motorola knew it was happening for sure.) But how loudly did that death knell ring? It's 2017, and we've already seen HTC unveil its newest flagship, the U Ultra. And it doesn't have a 3.5mm headphone jack. Almost immediately after the iPhone 7 was unveiled, rumors cropped up that Samsung's Galaxy S8, planned to launch in early 2017, would drop the headphone jack, too. While we don't have long to wait to find out, I can't help but wonder what kind of impact that decision will have on a potential buyer. So, I want to ask: If the Samsung Galaxy S8 doesn't have a 3.5mm headphone jack on board, will you buy it? Or will you go with another handset that does still have the port? Let me know!

Apple told developers the change lets them give users a better overall experience. For end users, that means more immersive apps and potentially a step towards a 4K Apple TV. In a note on the Developer’s Portal Apple said, The size limit of a tvOS app bundle has increased from 200 MB to 4 GB, so you can include more media in your submission and provide a complete, rich user experience upon installation. Also, tvOS apps can use On-Demand Resources to host up to 20 GB of additional content on the App Store. Apple’s fourth generation Apple TV—the model that supports third-party apps—is available in 32 GB and 64 GB versions, and until now there didn’t seem to be much of a reason to buy one over the other. With substantially larger apps about to come out, however, the 64 GB model now sounds like a better choice for Apple TV owners who like adding apps to their set top box. Get ready for bigger apps and new titles on Apple TV Apple may have enforced the smaller app size as a way to conservatively estimate how much app space Apple TV owners would need while maintaining enough overhead to handle video stream buffering. With more than a year of data to work with now, Apple likely discovered customers aren’t downloading more than a handful of apps, so they can afford to let developers make their products larger. Apple TV May Finally Go 4K The change could also be a precursor to a fifth generation Apple TV with a more powerful processor and 4K video support. The 4K UHD standard has been set for a year and more television manufacturers are supporting it, it’s more likely Apple is willing to support it. Apple is also the only real holdout on 4K in the mainstream set top home entertainment market. What we’ll get one developers start taking advantage of the new 4 GB app size cap are titles that need to download fewer resources every time they launch, more immersive games, and potentially better graphics, too. We may also see apps developers previously kept off Apple TV because they didn’t want to rewrite them to accommodate the 200 MB size restriction. Developers can learn more about the less restrictive app sizes at Apple’s website.

This won’t make AppleTV apps any more or less compelling. The 200MB limit was only a restriction on the initial download size. AppleTV apps have always been able to use Apple’s on-demand resource system to host and download much, much more data (up to 20GB can be hosted now). The idea is that the initial download only has the resources the app will always need, and then the app downloads more data (levels, images, etc.) as needed, with the system purging the on-demand data when it’s no longer used. So now everyone’s AppleTVs will just fill up faster, as some developers will opt to just put their entire game/app in the 4GB initial download instead of using on-demand resources (which tvOS is free to automatically delete when no longer used, such as when you’ve beaten a level).

Courts initially sided with Apple’s view that there are no bases for a lawsuit because people are technically buying apps from developers, with Apple doing the equivalent of renting them space to sell their goods. Now, a U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that people do indeed have the right to sue Apple over limiting iOS devices to apps from the App Store. "Apple's analogy is unconvincing," the ruling says. "In the case before us, third-party developers of iPhone apps do not have their own stores." Apple requires iPhone software developers to turn over 30 percent of what they charge for an app, increasing prices and excluding competitors from the iPhone “aftermarket” of apps according to the plaintiffs. The courts have yet to address the substance of these allegations and merely have determine their right to file a lawsuit over anticompetitive practices. If the challenge ultimately succeeds the expected outcome is to have Apple allow people shop for applications wherever they want and this would presumably lower prices. It’s also been suggested that a damages payment for “the higher than competitive prices” customers had to pay will be a part of the case. Apple has defended its walled garden approach for iOS by touting app quality, convenience and security —  and having used both platforms I have to agree there are merits to this approach. Apple doesn’t have a majority share of the smartphone market but it does rake in most of the revenue for app downloads.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive SCE construction continues: Portion of work impacting traffic at intersection of Yucca Loma, Apple Valley roads complete Friday Jan 13, 2017 at 9:07 AM Jan 13, 2017 at 9:07 AM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — Southern California Edison contractors continue construction that’s part of the larger Yucca Loma Road Widening Project, but town officials say the section of work that impacted traffic is complete. The installation of underground conduits through the intersection of Apple Valley and Yucca Loma roads finished Wednesday, according to Town spokeswoman Kathie Martin, a little over a week after work began on Jan. 3. Martin told the Daily Press lane restrictions at the intersection have been lifted, and Riverside Construction crews have set up K-rails for work that will continue away from the two roads “with very little traffic interference, other than a single-lane closure southbound on occasion.” As for the installation itself, which will continue for several more weeks, officials for SCE said the widening of Yucca Loma Road presented the company with an opportunity to upgrade its facilities in the area. “(This will) allow better circuit reliability, using eight circuit ties between several substations, including the Apple Valley, Rancho, Savage and Victorville substations,” officials said. “Tying all of these circuits and substations together will mean a more flexible and reliable system. It allows us to keep modernizing the grid.” Meanwhile, Martin said work would have impacted traffic for an extra week, but the decision was made to move permanent repair of the pavement closer to the end of the project. “There will be a time later when they will come back and make permanent repairs to the pavement,” Martin said, “but that date is unknown at this time. Deferring the permanent fixes is one of the reasons for the shortened time frame on the project.” Martin added that there will be alternating lane closures to allow the new pavement to cure once the permanent fixes take place. Completion of the widening work along Yucca Loma Road is slated to coincide with the opening of the newly finished Yucca Loma Bridge. Town officials have scheduled the bridge to open May 22, following a ribbon-cutting ceremony and community bike ride on May 19 and May 20. Currently, all dates remain open to change, according to Martin. Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254. Follow him on Twitter @DP_MatthewCabe.

The iPhone hasn’t received a  major design change in three years. And 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of Apple’s iconic product. Because of these reasons, consumers believe that the new iPhone would have an entirely new design and exciting new features. If rumors coming out of the supply chain in Asia are to be believed, Apple is not going to disappoint them. Image Credit: Energous Corporation / YouTube video (screenshot) iPhone 8 to get IP68 waterproofing Supply chain sources told South Korean publication The Investor that the iPhone 8 would have an IP68 waterproof rating, the highest level of water resistance. Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S8 is also said to be IP68-certified. An IP68 certification means the new iPhone could be submerged in up to five feet of water for about 30 minutes. Sources told The Investor that Apple is likely to use waterproof tapes to protect the phone. Using tapes instead of adhesives makes it easier to repair the handsets. The current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus come with IP67 rating, which means they can be submerged in up to three feet of water. That’s sufficient to protect the phone in most of the practical scenarios such as rain, shower, or dropping it in a bathtub. The other two phones – the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus – that Apple would launch alongside the iPhone 8 are said to have IP68 rating. Apple switching to a glass sandwich design for wireless charging With the iPhone 8, Apple is switching from LED to curved OLED display panels. The device is said to have a glass sandwich design, where an all-glass front and rear would be supported by a stainless steel frame. Apple has placed orders with Foxconn and Jabil for the supply of forged stainless steel frames. Forged steel is 30% to 50% cheaper to manufacture than the CNC milling process Apple currently employs. Apple had used stainless steel frame on the iPhone 4. The switch from an aluminum unibody chassis to a glass sandwich design would not only give the iPhone 8 a stylish look, but also enable wireless charging. To add true wireless charging, the back of the smartphone needs to be ceramic, plastic or glass. These materials can transmit signals more effectively than metal. Foxconn testing wireless charging modules Apple’s manufacturing partner Energous recently indicated that its wireless charging technology could debut with the iPhone 8 later this year. Energous’ technology allows a compatible device to be charged automatically over the air when it is within 15 feet of a transmitter. Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn, which has an agreement with Energous, has been testing wireless charging modules for the upcoming iPhones. The iPhone 8 is also expected to focus on, or at least lay the groundwork for, Augmented Reality (AR). Apple CEO Tim Cook has suggested on several occasions that the company was exploring opportunities in AR. Cook believes AR would eventually become bigger than virtual reality.

Give it up -- it's never going to happen. By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | January 13, 2017 -- 16:30 GMT (08:30 PST) | Topic: Smartphones I've seen a lot of mobile platforms come and go, and it's now pretty clear that nothing can touch the duopoly created by iOS and Android.

Does the iPhone still matter? Huawei, not Apple, now drives the mobile conversation Cyanogen's recent hasty exit from the market, along with the failure of Microsoft to make any headway in the arena despite throwing billions of dollars at the problem show just how well Apple and Google (you could also throw Samsung, the only really profitable Android hardware maker, into that list too) have it all stitched up. The thing about the mobile marketspace is that it seems deceptively big. With smartphone unit sales close to 1.5 billion in 2016, you'd think that a third player would only need to carve off a small slice of that to get a good foothold in the market. Plenty have tried -- from Cyanogen to Tizen to Firefox OS to Windows Mobile -- and yet all failed, and failed miserably. Just as Windows and macOS have desktop computing stitched up, and the browser market is a three-horse race between Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Firefox, the maturity of the mobile market, along with the long list of those who tried and failed to shake things up, should act as a warning sign to any company wading into this arena. Billions of dollars have been burned trying to shatter this duopoly, and they would have been better spent on carving out new markets and niches (such as AR/VR, voice assistants, or AI). While iOS and Android may have between them won the mobile war, the real winner is Apple with iOS. Apple has less than 20 percent of the mobile hardware market, but pulls in in excess of 80 percent of the revenues and profits. In the Android camp, besides Google, the only player making any real money is Samsung, with most losing money by choosing to make Android smartphones. And yet Android is key to Apple's success, because its dominance, especially at the low-end of the market, makes it impossible for new players to get a foothold. It's a symbiotic relationship, and it wouldn't be in Apple's interest for Android as a whole to fail. Also, while the hardware players are frantically trying to make a few bucks from Android, they're not interested in investing much time in new platforms because they're far more likely to fail. So stop getting all excited when a new player enters the market. It's all over. Instead focus on what new areas are opening up outside of smartphones.

Ten years ago this week, Apple released a compact, rounded rectangle that changed how billions around the world interact and share information. Before the iPhone, and for a while afterwards, smartphones were generally clunky, complicated devices that tried to mimic the experience of using a computer in a far smaller form factor. But Apple set out to make a simple device that “just worked” and over the next decade, went on to sell one billion smartphones, and spur on an entire new sector of devices. Apple was not the first smartphone manufacturer, and not even the first to sell one with a touchscreen. But its product resonated with the largest number of people, at first, which helped it to scale and work out favorable deals with suppliers to help it ship more smartphones over the years. After Apple’s initial dominance, the rest of the market essentially became commoditized, with the majority of manufacturers building hardware on top of Google’s Android operating system. There are now smartphones that can do pretty much whatever you want them to, at whatever price fits, and then there are Apple phones. (The company still holds a 44% of the US smartphone market.) Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 119.04 -0.21 -0.18% The nascent commercial drone industry is starting to look similar. Unlike other mobile technologies launched in the last few decades, it’s not Apple, or any other Western company that’s leading the charge—it’s DJI (or Dà-Jiāng Innovations Science and Technology Company, if you’re being formal), a Chinese company based in Shenzhen. Apple features DJI’s drones prominently in its stores, and it’s easy to see why: They’re consistently viewed as some of the easiest to operate, and with each passing generation, offer some new level of functionality that makes them easier or safer to fly. (Its two most recent drones, the Phantom 4, and the Mavic Pro, both have sensors and cameras onboard that help them avoid people and objects while flying, along with all sorts of commands for flying autonomously.) During 2016, there were signs of the issues facing the industry. 3D Robotics, an American drone firm set up by former Wired editor Chris Anderson, announced that it was pivoting away from high-end consumer drones into commercial drone software after tepid sales and an inability to keep up with the pace of DJI. Similarly, GoPro, the company best known for its portable action cameras, announced in late 2015 that it release a drone in the spring of 2016. It eventually showed off its drone in September, then had issues supplying them to customers, and finally quietly recalled the drone on the night of the US election in November. It said that it would start selling the drones again in February. Then, yesterday, French electronics manufacturer Parrot, one of the earliest producers of consumer drones, announced that it would lay off one-third of its drone division—roughly 290 people—after missing sales estimates over the holiday season. As Recode’s April Glaser put the news: “It’s not easy to compete with DJI.” Rather like Apple, DJI’s drones are not inexpensive. Most of its newest consumer drones cost between $900 and $2,000, and its competitors at those prices seem to be dropping like stalled drones. (GoPro’s Karma costs about $800, Parrot’s between $700 and $1,300.) Walking the halls of the CES consumer electronics show in Las Vegas last week, I saw a plethora of drone makers with booths next to DJI, Yuneec, Ehang, and other bigger players—the industry isn’t necessarily contracting, it’s just commoditizing like the early touchscreen smartphone market did. One player is staking its claim to the high-end market. With each passing year, as the technology it and others spearhead gets cheaper, that trickles down to cheaper brands. So while DJI’s drones are still about the same price they’ve always been, drones overall are getting cheaper. There remains the issue of utility. You really can’t do much with a drone. Unless you’re an avid photographer, a big fan of remote-controlled helicopters, or racing things, these thousand-dollar flying machines aren’t of much use. All of these companies are trying to address this problem: they’re all working on development kits that will allow engineers and tinkerers to build programs and apps on top of their hardware to bring them new functionality. This was also the case with early smartphones: When Apple opened up its App Store, the possibilities for a mobile, internet-connected device seemed endless, and sales really started to take off. Whether drones will ever become a hit in the consumer market or simply become more useful commercially will depend on their ability to provide something new to consumers. Drones are, in many ways, flying smartphones—they have sensors and computer systems inspired by those found in smartphones. Do we need an always-connected, always-hovering-nearby device? Unclear.

Advertisement In October, Apple confirmed an iPhone 6 iOS 10.2 update with a release into its beta program for developers and the general public. In December, Apple pulled the iPhone 6 iOS 10.2 update out of beta and released it for iPhone 6 variants around the world. As expected, the final version of the iOS 10.2 update is loaded with features, bug fixes and security patches for potential exploits. It’s a substantial update for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. If you’re coming to iOS 10.2 from iOS 10.1.1, expect a sizable download. If you’re coming from something older like iOS 10.1 or iOS 9, your iPhone 6’s update will be much bigger. You’ll get everything from the previous iOS updates baked in. Advertisement With the smoke from the release settled we want to take a close look at the iPhone 6 iOS 10.2 update. This roundup includes our updated impressions of the software, some tips to help you get the most out of iOS 10.2, and a look at iPhone 6 iOS 10.2 problems. We’ll continue to update this page as we push away from the release date so check back for regular changes. iPhone 6 iOS 10.2 Update Review   1 / 9 Before we get into performance, a quick note about the iOS 10.2 download and installation.  The iPhone 6 iOS 10.2 update is a big one and it'll take you several minutes to download over a fast Wi-Fi connection. From start to finish the download too about six minutes to complete. We didn't run into any installation issues though the process progressed slowly on our device. It took about 10 minutes to install. Mileage will vary but we suggest putting aside 20 minutes to monitor the download and installation.  Advertisement We've been using the iPhone 6 iOS 10.2 update for just about a month now and we've been taking a close look at the areas we always look at after a new iOS update arrives: Battery life, Connectivity, and UI speed. So far, so good. We still haven't noticed any abnormal battery drain. Our iPhone 6 (AT&T model) is holding a solid charge at the month mark. If you recently installed iOS 10.2 and you are noticing issues with your battery life, give it a couple of days. It can sometimes take a few days for the battery to settle down.  We've tested the iPhone 6's new update with several ISPs, routers, and Bluetooth devices. We haven't run into any issues yet but that could change down the road. AT&T's LTE and 4G networks are working properly as well.  Thus far, we haven't noticed any random reboots and the UI appears to be fast. Animations and transitions are fluid and we haven't encountered any weird lag or sluggishness when opening folders, apps or Control Center.  The iPhone 6 iOS 10.2 update's performance is holding up as we push through the month of January. And given what's on board (emojis, fixes, etc) the update, it's certainly worth a look if your iPhone 6 is already on iOS 10.  If you're on an older version of iOS, say iOS 9, you might want to wait a few days so you can gather a little more feedback about performance.  If you need help to one side of the iOS 10.2 fence or the other, please take a look at our list of reasons. It'll help you make a decision today.    1 / 9 One Response 12/22/2016 Leon Reply This article is useless. Nothing that I didn’t know or think. Total waste of time.

Skim for your weekly fix of social news, tips, and tricks! 1. Russia removed LinkedIn from its app stores, and Apple and Google complied Users in Russia can no longer download LinkedIn on their smartphones, following a demand by the Russian government that Apple and Google remove the app from their app stores. LinkedIn has been accused of violating the nation's data storage law, which requires any company collecting data on Russian citizens store that data within the country's borders. LinkedIn says its 6 million registered Russian users are the real losers, now left unable to grow their businesses using the platform. The data storage law has been in place since 2014, but LinkedIn is the first major social network to be blocked in Russia. Critics say the move is an attack on social networks by a government that's grown increasingly hostile to Internet freedoms. 2. Twitter looks for light, redefines itself once again Twitter is now the number one "news" app in the world. Ever since the ex-social network recategorized itself in app stores across all platforms, it's shot up in rankings as the company continues to reposition not as a place for people to stalk photos of friends but as one to see what's happening. At CES 2017, Twitter's CMO said people were confused about what to do on the platform, and always felt pressure to tweet and constantly update. Now, the company says, those preoccupations of the past are not necessary. But the app's reinvention and neutral stance has come at a price: stories of rampant cyberbullying and the platform's significant role in communication from the now President-Elect shaped opinions about it. For better or for worse, Twitter will be there for all the news that fits into 140-characters in 2017. 3. How and why your brand should create a Facebook bot Thought about putting the tools of Facebook Messenger to better use for your brand in this new year? Chatbots can be a great way to help answer your customers' frequently asked questions and free up more time to for your team to identify higher quality leads. The social network now lets brands install chatbots on their business pages, which means it's easier than ever for a company to save time and respond to frivolous requests by constructing a set of menus or keywords that guide users. The Social Media Examiner brings real-life examples to get your brand on the right path to building a bot, with a step-by-step guide covering conception to launch. 4. Snapchat boosts mobile ads with outbound capabilities Snap Ads that are inserted between Stories or on Snapchat's Discover content just got a whole lot smarter. And they are starting to make the platform's ad business look a lot like Facebook's. By deep-linking, the new ad types allow advertisers to link users out of the Snapchat and straight into their own apps if users also have the advertiser's app downloaded. A new auto-fill feature also lets advertisers easily collect information from users who choose to provide it; for example, a food delivery company can prompt users to sign up for its service by letting Snapchat give the company the contact information the user had previously opted to share. The new ad tests could prove that engagement on Snapchat can move beyond the app itself, and that would be a good sign for both the platform and advertisers. 5. Facebook Live videos might not be so truthful, and that's a problem TechCrunch argues that it's time for the social giant to crack down on Facebook Live abuse, noting several alarming examples of both social-only pages and big-name publishing partners using the platform for non-live events. They're doing so to take advantage of automatic notifications for users and Facebook's algorithm, which prioritizes Live over regular video posts. Five of the top ten Live videos in 2016 were things like countdown clocks, and big-name publishers like Unilad received more than 19 million views for an ostensible live stream... that was recorded in 2013. Though Facebook encourages only live content to be broadcast, its rules leave the door open to previously recorded material, and that should be concerning to publishers and users alike. 6. The ultimate LinkedIn cheat sheet to maximize your views Only 51% of LinkedIn members have completed profiles, even though it's the primary factor the social network's algorithm uses to rank its search results. But optimizing your LinkedIn profiles goes well behind cropping a profile photo and getting recommendations from colleagues and clients. Luckily, LeisureJobs has an infographic to ease all your greatest fears, and get you on the right track to maximizing views of your page, which could lead to more sales leads for you B2B marketers. Check out the full infographic on MarketingProfs. https://www.marketingprofs.com/chirp/2017/31281/the-ultimate-linkedin-cheat-sheet-infographic 7. Music star Ed Sheeran hides his new single in a Snapchat lens Out with the iTunes exclusives, and in with the Snapchat lenses. At least that's Ed Sheeran's approach at teasing his new single, "Shape of You." The Grammy-award winning British singer has partnered with Snapchat to create an augmented reality lens for users, who with the click of a button can turn themselves into sunglass-wearing clubgoers with a 30-second clip of Sheeran's latest single playing in the background. The artist is using primarily social media to tease his new album across platforms, from publishing cryptic images on Twitter to sharing lyrics on Facebook. It also marks a new trend for Snapchat. Its foray into music shouldn't be ignored. ED SHEERAN'S SNAPCHAT FILTER JUST CHANGED THE GAME. pic.twitter.com/DNAumGAll0 — Alex Goldschmidt (@alexandergold) January 5, 2017 8. Snapchat or Instagram: Which is better for your business? After Instagram's launch of Stories, it became apparent that Facebook plans to use Instagram as its Snapchat-killer, copying all the most popular features that differentiated Snapchat from the rest. But that doesn't mean that your business should call it quits on Snapchat. Sure, Instagram boasts twice as many daily active users, but there are other, more important differences between the platforms that could determine which is the right fit for your business. From ease of use and the age breakdown of their users, to the pros and cons of specific features and how they can boost your business, dive in to see which is right for you. 9. Are your YouTube ads worthwhile? If you're using pre-roll ads on YouTube to spread your message, a recent survey from UBS Evidence Lab has some positive, or potentially saddening, insights, depending on how you view Millennials. The survey indicates that most (59%) of 18- 34-year-olds watch ads until they're able to skip them via YouTube's skip button, but a good portion (29%) still watch the ads all the way through. Moreover, only 11% of American Millennials report using ad blockers to browse YouTube ad-free. Depending on what you've heard about the rise of ad blockers, those are potentially uplifting numbers that prove pre-roll isn't dead, but that also prove that producing more engaging content might be the only way to rise above the ad-blocking trend. Oh, and in case you forgot, YouTube is still the third most popular social network among Millennials. 10. Facebook to begin testing mid-roll ads, and why that's good for users Facebook is ready to test something publishers have been hoping for a while, and something the social network has, until now, opted to avoid: mid-roll video ads that insert an advertiser's video in the middle of video rather than at the beginning or end. The new revenue stream will be split 55% to 45%, in the video producers' favor, and the ads will only display after at least 20 seconds of a minimum 90-second video has been watched. Since monetization requires longer watch times, the test of the ad format should encourage publishers to create longer, more engaging videos. What do you think? Will Facebook's mid-roll ad unit be too distracting for users? 11. Social media to play a big role in 2017 hottest trends for B2Bs [infographic] The top marketing tactic employed by B2B content marketers in 2017 will be social media as brands take a bold step to try to mimic the B2C industry's success in what's been a primary content marketing outlet for them. And in terms of content distribution, LinkedIn will act as the second most popular channel for B2B content marketers after email, followed by Twitter and Facebook. Free up space on your content calendars, people. 12. Could Mark Zuckerberg dive into politics? Speculation is growing that Facebook's founder and CEO is gearing up for a political career, particularly with the declaration of his 2017 personal challenge to meet and listen to people in all 50 states. Zuckerberg has already met with countless world leaders, from Barack Obama and the Presidents of Brazil and Mexico to the Prime Minister of India; and his big battle to maintain voting control of the company if he resigns or takes a leave of absence to work in government could be a strong indication of the CEO's plans. Sure, he might have to deal with people's disappointment with Facebook's fake news controversy, but that could be small fish for a grand political career. What government post do you think Zuckerberg might eye? 13. We'll wrap with the social media influencers redefining norms with Maybelline For its latest campaign, Maybelline approached digital beauty influencers for the first time, and also happened to break the mold and select the first male ambassador in the company's history. Manny Gutierrez, known to followers as Manny MUA, is an openly gay beauty influencer with massive followings across his social channels, and Maybelline stole the headlines this week when it announced he would be the face of their new campaign alongside fellow social media influencer Shayla Mitchell.

During that time, Samsung was found guilty of infringing upon Apple’s patented smartphone design, including iPhone’s rectangular front face with rounded metal edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reopened that lawsuit yesterday after a recommendation from the U.S. Supreme Court to determine how much Samsung should pay the Cupertino firm over copying iPhone’s look and feel, according to court documents uncovered by Law360.com. A month ago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Samsung won’t be held liable for the $399 million awarded to Apple in a previous lower court ruling because the damages were calculated based on Samsung’s entire profit from the sale of Galaxy smartphones. This new decision means that the court must now decide on the amount of damages Samsung must pay based on either the total device, or rather individual components such as the front bezel or the screen. The iPhone maker has commented that the decision will “again send a powerful signal that stealing isn’t right.” Should Samsung be held liable for blatantly copying iPhone’s design with its Galaxy S handset? That’s the question on many people’s minds and the topic of heated debate between intellectual property advocates and those who think that a rectangular with a metal frame should not be patentable. For what it’s worth, a 1949 study found that more than 99 percent of Americans were able to identify a bottle of Coca-Cola by its shape alone, signifying the importance of memorable brand and product designs. In August 2016, 100+ renowned designers, including Calvin Klein and Dieter Rams, filed an amicus brief in support of Apple, arguing the firm should be entitled to all the profits Samsung has earned from infringing upon iPhone’s patented designs.

It’s basically a copy. Iskren Donev I suppose that the fairest approach would be if Apple had some sort of exclusivity period for its design during which time other companies would have to pay royalties to Apple if they want to use their design. But at the end of the day I do think that the rounded rectangle design needs to be accepted as a given at some point. Just like prior to 2007 no-one was found to be infringing on the classic mobile phone keypad design, after 2020 (for example), no-one should be forced to pay Apple royalties for a design that is clearly the way to go.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Wallpapers of the week: geometry pack Jailbreak tweaks of the week: OnceMore, Photicon, & more… The top stories of the week on iDB Photicon replaces your Photos app icon with a preview of your most recent picture AdaptiveColorAlerts colorizes all your alert messages to match anything behind them   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: OnceMore, Photicon, & more… Photicon replaces your Photos app icon with a preview of your most recent picture AdaptiveColorAlerts colorizes all your alert messages to match anything behind them Why to avoid third-party Cydia Substrate “patches” for the iOS 10 beta jailbreak OnceMore lets you repeat iPhone timers right from the Lock screen iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2017.

(Retuers/Beck Diefenbach) Share Written by Mike Murphy January 13, 2017 Here is a short list of products that Apple has released in the past few years: A stylus that only charges when sticking straight out of an iPad A mouse that doesn’t work when you need to charge it A $350 smartwatch that’s as useful as a $150 one A tablet the size of Jupiter A laptop with almost no ports A phone with no headphone jack that can’t connect to the port-less laptop Apple was once lauded for the design, durability, and simplicity of its products. But in recent years, the company has lost its way. Many of its newer devices feel derivative of older ones—rather than incrementally better—or seem just plain odd. Consumers appear to agree: In 2016, Apple posted year-over-year declines in both profit and revenue for the first time in 15 years. But amid at all this lackluster gadgetry, Apple did release—in a tiny container shaped like a Tic-Tac box—one of the simplest and best products it’s put out in years: the AirPods. These wireless headphones do something that few Apple products have in the Tim Cook era—they just work. What’s good Really, they just work. Apple loves to describe its products as “magical.” Few have felt that way recently, but the AirPods sort of do. If you’re pairing them with an iPhone, the second you take them out of their packaging and open their container, you get a pop-up on your phone asking you to connect “[your name]’s AirPods.” There’s no messing with Bluetooth settings, no connecting to local wi-fi networks, and none of the setup typical of internet-of-things devices. Open the box; start playing music. No other wireless headphones I’ve tried out, or really many other products at all, have been so easy to start using. AirPods can also connect to other non-Apple devices like regular regular Bluetooth headphones (there’s a button on the back of the case that allows them to be discovered by other devices). Theoretically, AirPods will also automatically connect to any Apple device associated with your iPhone’s iCloud account, but in practice I found that only happened sometimes. Sometimes I had to manually select my AirPods from the Bluetooth menu to get them to connect to other Apple devices. They’re self-charging. Gadget cases are starting to do something useful: charge their gadgets. As Snap did with its Snapchat Spectacles, the AirPods’ case can (Apple says) provide 24 hours of charge to the headphones, which themselves hold about 5 hours of charge. I’ve had inconsistent experiences with AirPods holding a charge for 24 hours—I’m not sure if it’s me, or a battery discrepancy like the one affecting Apple’s newest MacBook Pro. They’re self-pausing. If you pull one AirPod out, whatever you’re listening to will pause. If you take both out, it stops. You can also use one AirPod at a time to listen to music or make calls, if you’re feeling nostalgic for that mid-2000s Bluetooth headset look. They’re so tiny. AirPods are far smaller than the average wireless headphone setup. The carrying case is easy to slip into even the smallest pocket, meaning they can go with you pretty much anywhere. They also charge off the same cable as a modern iPhone, so you only need to carry one cable with you. Siri is in your ear. If you’ve ever wanted to feel like you have a personal digital assistant, the AirPods are perfect. Double-tap the side of one of the earbuds and you’ll activate Siri, allowing you to look and feel just a little bit like Joaquin Phoenix in the movie Her (minus, hopefully, the giant mustache). They’re decently priced. Apple products tend to be on the expensive end of the market, but wireless headphones are rarely cheap. At $150, Bose’s wireless earbuds cost only $10 less than Apple’s, and (Apple subsidiary) Beats Audio’s newer wireless buds are about $40 more. Unlike both of those, the AirPods don’t have an aggressive “I’m working out” look to them. They just look like the wires fell off your regular Apple EarPods. What’s not good They look pretty silly. EarPods, which have shipped with iPhones and iPods since 2012, didn’t have the prettiest design to begin with. The AirPods’ stems also hang quite far out, making it look from a distance like you’ve gotten some very odd piercings. They won’t fit everyone’s ears. Much like Apple’s wired headphones, the AirPods seem to be too big (or small) to fit snugly in some people’s ears. There were also concerns that they would fall out with enough shaking, but I haven’t encountered that issue. Other reviewers have had no issue running with them. Siri is still useless. It would be great to have Siri so readily available… if she were of any use. Apple’s digital assistant rarely understands my requests, and frequently tries to throw me to a Safari search-results page, which kind of defeats the purpose. In your iPhone’s Bluetooth settings, you can switch the AirPods’ double-tap function from activating Siri to playing/pausing whatever you’re listening to, which I’ve found more useful. No skip-song or volume button. It’s odd that Apple made Siri a double-tap on the AirPods, but included no other tap actions. If there was a way to tap the earbuds to skip songs or change the volume, without having to ask Siri in the middle of a crowded subway car, AirPods would be pretty much perfect. Should you get them? Yes. If you have an iPhone and listen to music on your commute, or take a lot of phone calls on the go, AirPods work perfectly. They’re not going to replace noise-canceling headphones for long flights, or high-end headphones for listening to physical audio, or aggressive “I’m working out” headphones for people who are into that sort of thing. But if you’re a casual listener, AirPods are a great pickup. For the first time in what feels like a long time, Apple has created a product that doesn’t try to do too much, and does what it’s supposed to do very well.

(Joan Marcus) By Peter Marks January 14 Follow @petermarksdrama Because the actors sometimes sit with their backs to us, or speak in muffled tones, you can’t uniformly make out what they’re saying in “The Gabriels.” And that’s just fine by playwright-director Richard Nelson. Although amplifying devices hang from the ceiling of the Kennedy Center’s Theatre Lab, where Nelson’s trilogy of plays is in residence, “The mics are not there to boost the voices, but to create an acoustic feeling,” he says. “It means that the actors can talk in their normal voices. “Some people turn off. I’m sorry that happens,” he adds, explaining that he’s asking an audience to adjust its auditory expectations just a bit, for the sake of an overarching vision. “I’m trying to create a world that is true and truthful. I wanted it to be conversational. Not naturalism, not realism, but a kind of verisimilitude: not real, but truth.” If you’ve seen any of Nelson’s “Apple Family Plays,” a previous quartet of dramas set in the dining room of a home in Rhinebeck, N.Y., you’d know precisely what he is referring to. Like the “Apple” plays, which unspooled a family’s personal travails and political views as its members sat around a dinner table, the three plays of “The Gabriels,” about another family, take place in Rhinebeck and are framed by specific current events: In the case of “The Gabriels,” these are days in the 2016 presidential campaign, culminating in a final piece, occurring election night. That all seven of the works adhere to a nearly identical format — a gathering of relatives, and the eating or preparing of a meal during which they share their pains and worries and frustrations — the project has the feel of something deeply rooted, even profound, in its unvarnished authenticity. When the plays about the Apple family, produced over several years at off-Broadway’s Public Theater, were performed with the original cast in Europe in 2015, audiences were taken aback by the lack of cant or vituperation in the dialogue. “This is not how America is seen,” Nelson was told by a German producer, describing the plays’ Berlin audiences. “They don’t know people are having conversations like this.” Nelson, 66, has had a distinguished and varied career as a dramatist that included serving as chairman of the Yale School of Drama’s playwriting department and a long association with the Royal Shakespeare Company, which produced several of his plays, among them some of his best: “Two Shakespearean Actors,” “Some Americans Abroad” and “Goodnight Children Everywhere.” In 2000, his book for the musical “James Joyce’s The Dead” brought him a Tony Award, although the Pulitzer Prize, an accolade that one could easily imagine for an American playwright of his caliber, so far has eluded him. American playwright and librettist Richard Nelson. (Jesse Dittmar/For The Washington Post) “The Apple Family Plays,” whose first installment, “That Hopey Changey Thing,” had its premiere at the Public on the night of the national midterm elections in 2010, grew out of an offer from the Public’s artistic director, Oskar Eustis. He was impressed by a collection of plays about the war in Afghanistan, “The Great Game: Afghanistan,” commissioned by London’s Tricycle Theater, which toured the Public and Washington’s Shakespeare Theatre Company. Eustis wondered why American theaters had done nothing of similar scope. “We should have a large-scale play about Iraq,” Eustis said to Nelson over breakfast one day, “and we feel it should be by you.” Nelson came back with a proposal for a more personal approach: placing the story in a household in Rhinebeck, where he lives, and designating that the play’s fictional action occurs on the same date as the play’s opening night. The critical and popular success of the “Apple” plays left Nelson feeling he had more to say, so he went back to Eustis, with the notion of three “Gabriel” plays, to be composed and performed during the election year. “When I said I wanted to do this, he gave me a commission and an opening day,” the dramatist recalls, sitting in a Manhattan apartment the Public had rented for him. “I had the designer and rehearsal dates before I had a word written.” The Gabriel family, which in the first play, “Hungry,” gathers on March 4, 2016, four months after the death of its most famous member, Thomas, a playwright, has in Nelson’s imagination a history reaching further back in Rhinebeck than the Apples. This gave him a hook for one of the story’s central themes: Facing financial pressures compounded by the cost of caring for an elderly parent and sending kids off to college, the middle-class Gabriels are gripped by the fear of losing what they’ve worked so hard to get. The dilemma resonates keenly with a terror that seemed to galvanize the electorate last year. And because it isn’t Donald Trump in whom the left-leaning Gabriels invest their hopes, Nelson’s plays suggest that economic insecurity is an undercurrent that transcends ideology and party. It took Nelson several months to write the three plays; he felt a special pressure to get them in shape quickly because he was asking the six actors who appeared in them in New York — and now continue in them in Washington — to commit to a full year of participation. (After the Kennedy Center, the production is to travel to Perth, Australia, and Hong Kong.) Once the pieces were finished, he made it a goal not to revise them after the dust around the real events they track had settled. “It doesn’t allow you to second-guess yourself,” he says of working in this way. “So there’s something freeing about that. That was healthy and good. But it was also scary.” The Gabriels: Election Year in the Life of One Family, written and directed by Richard Nelson. Tickets: $49 for individual plays; $120 for the three-play marathon. Through Jan. 22 at the Kennedy Center.

The work on the gadget, which revolutionized the industry, was carried out in complete secrecy. Even now, many details of the smartphone development remain unclear. The veil of secrecy over the history of Apple's first smartphone was lifted by the famous insider Sonny Dickson. In a video published on his YouTube channel, he demonstrated two iPhone prototypes, the P1 and P2, showing different approaches to the iOS interface. Two different teams at Apple Inc. worked on these projects: one was led by Tony Fadell, the former Senior Vice President of the iPod Division, while Scott Forstall, the then-leader of Mac development within the company, headed the other one. Fadell's version was based around controlling the new device via a click wheel like in the iPod. The interface looked pretty much like the player's firmware, too. "The iPhone P2 is what came to be known as the original selling model of the iPhone, paving the foundation of where we are today, 10 years in the future," Sonny Dickson wrote in the description to the video. Forstall's prototype was closer to the Mac OS X graphical operating system. © REUTERS/ Benoit Tessier iPhone Fever: 7 Crazy Things Apple Fans Did to Get iPhonesSecrecy was unbelievably strict. Jobs promised to fire anyone who revealed Apple's plans. Developers reported to him twice a month in a tiny room with no windows. Sometimes paranoia was clearly evident. Fadell almost incurred the wrath of Jobs, forgetting the iPhone prototype in a plane. Luckily, a special search team managed to find the secret gadget in two hours, but it seemed like an eternity to those Apple employees who knew about the incident, Fadell told the BBC. According to Fadell, Jobs had the idea of turning the iPod into the iPhone, and drove the team hard towards this end. The touch-sensitive wheel was going to become a virtual one, and it would disappear when viewing full screen videos and pictures. Jobs did not stand for failure, and when the team had difficulties implementing the dial in this prototype, he sent them away until they could come back to him with a solution. Altogether, there were some 17 different concepts, Fadell revealed in an interview to The Verge. In one of them, Jobs offered to put a set of buttons on the dial, like in the Nokia 3650. Fadell knew it was a waste of time, but Jobs insisted on trying everything. © Flickr/ Andrew Currie Nokia 3650 Meanwhile, Forstall, whose concept turned into what would be the company's actual iPhone, worked on a Mac computer with a touchscreen. However, the most contentious issue was the implementation of the keyboard. Jobs dreamed of a touch input, although the physical keys, such as the BlackBerry had, were considered a benchmark. This was argued over for four months. © REUTERS/ Kim Hong-Ji/File Gadgets on Fire: Most Scandalous Recalls of IT-Products in History"Sometimes stupid things only seem stupid at first, but if you break through, it actually becomes smart. Like, ‘Oh, everyone would want to type on a hardware keyboard, no one wants to type on glass.' Those kinds of things. You had to keep pushing people so that their first knee-jerk reaction isn't the answer," Fadell said. As for the characteristics of the first iPhone, the project adopted the iPod's hardware, although Intel had a chance to get an order for processors. According to the former president and CEO of Intel Paul Otellini, the chip maker refused Apple's offer. © Photo: Pixabay Forced to Sell 'Penis'? Apple’s iPhone 7 Faces Tricky Marketing in Hong Kong"There was a chip that they were interested in that they wanted to pay a certain price for and not a nickel more and that price was below our forecasted cost. I couldn't see it. It wasn't one of these things you can make up on volume. And in hindsight, the forecasted cost was wrong and the volume was 100x what anyone thought," Otellini said, as quoted by The Atlantic. The iPhone was underestimated by many — only few believed that it would change the world. The media predicted the project would fail. However, in the third quarter of 2016, Apple set a record: its share of profits in the global smartphone market reached 91 %, which amounted to $8.5 billion. And the total revenue from the iOS ecosystem will exceed a trillion dollars, according to the company's website. ...

Apple suppliers have plans to shift manufacturing to U.S., following President Trump’s new call for Make in America. Sharp Considering LCD Plant Hon Hai Precision Industry and its Japanese subsidiary Sharp are considering building a liquid crystal display plant in the America. A Sharp executive told Asia Nikkei, that a plan is “on the table” and they “will make a decision carefully.” Foxconn, as the Taiwanese contract manufacturer is commonly known, made the decision. Their alliance partner Soft Bank Group’s chairman Masayoshi Son met President-elect Donald Trump. Son proposed Trump a joint investment plan to create new jobs in the U.S Foxconn is considering to benefit from the huge U.S. market for TVs and other home appliances. Details of the new US plant, including the amount of investment and date of launch of operations, are scarce at this point. Sources, however, say the investment will be similar to that of new plant upcoming in Guangzhou, China. Touted as one of the largest LCD panel plants, the plant in China will built at cost of $8.69 billion. TSMC Considers Moving Also, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) known for supplying Apple with their iPhone and iPad chipsets, is also planning on a plant in United States. The company hasn’t ruled building a fabrication lab in US. However, the company chairman Morris Chang said production in US “may not necessarily be a good thing.” Chang, who was present at January 12 Investors conference, said TSMC is already creating jobs in US. However, with Trump pushing for Apple and suppliers to shift production to America, they will likely agree. In addition, Apple itself is planning to build computers in the U.S., but they won’t be Macs. The company is aiming to use its existing facility in Mesa Arizona, reported Business Insider. Apple will produce servers and data centers to be used in other US facilities. The company’s plans were made public after city of Mesa published the files in the Federal Register on Monday.

This latest ruling resurrects a legal challenge that was originally filed back in 2012, which accused Apple of engaging in anticompetitive behavior by restricting iPhones to only run apps purchased from Apple’s own App Store, thereby artificially inflating the prices of apps by stifling market competition. In response, Apple argued that users did not have any standing to sue Apple because apps are sold by individual developers, and that Apple simply provides the storefront for developers, in return for a cut of app sales. A lower court originally sided with Apple on the matter, however, Judge William A. Fletcher of the appellate court ruled this week that since iPhone users purchase apps directly from Apple, iPhone users have a right to bring a legal challenge against Apple. Notably, the courts have not addressed the substance of the allegations in any way — the cases up to this point are merely over whether users have the right to bring a suit against Apple at all. Apple declined to comment, but Mark C. Rifkin, the lawyer representing the group of iPhone users behind the suit, told Reuters in an interview that the objective of the suit would be to either “compel Apple to let people shop for applications wherever they want, which would open the market and help lower prices” or to have Apple “pay people damages for the higher than competitive prices they’ve had to pay historically because Apple has utilized its monopoly.” The case is Pepper et al v. Apple Inc., case number 4:11-cv-06714 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

This change will allow developers to include more media content bundled in their app package so that it installs at the same time the user installs the app on their Apple TV, which should minimize the number of games and other apps that need to download additional content when first opened. tvOS apps can also now host up to 20GB of additional content on the App Store using On-Demand Resources. This is likely to have an impact on users’ Apple TV storage capacities, meaning users with a lot of larger apps and the lower capacity 32GB Apple TV model may find themselves constrained for space as their apps are updated to include media content within the app bundles. The prior 200MB limit kept the apps small and allowed storage on the Apple TV to be optimized by discarding on-demand data from apps when the Apple TV ran low on space; this will not be an option for an app that stores a large amount of media content within the app bundle itself. This could also be a sign that Apple is preparing to release higher-capacity Apple TV models in the near future.

However, the consumer watchdog recently cautioned its readers against purchasing Apple's newest MacBook Pro due to discrepancies between Cupertino's published battery life specifications and the figures CR derived in its lab. Apple and CR were eventually able to pin down and correct a bug related specifically to CR's testing methods, and the nonprofit agreed to rerun its tests. The results of the second round of tests are right in line with Apple's claims. One of CR's test machines even turned a battery life of over 18 hours with the corrections. With the new results in hand, CR now recommends the latest MacBook Pros to consumers. For the unfamiliar, the issue arose from the fact that Consumer Reports disables browser caching on all machines it tests for battery life. That scenario inadvertently triggered a bug in Safari, which Apple has now fixed. Apple still doesn't believe that CR's testing methods are representative of real-world use, but it seems the sparring partners can at least expect mutually agreeable results from the testing firm's methods for now. Having had to issue a mea culpa regarding test results ourselves last year, we'd hope this experience leads CR to exercise more caution about presenting wildly variable test numbers as conclusive evidence. Though the initial controversy may have led to a large upswell of interest, it ultimately seems harmful to CR's reputation for rigorous and data-driven testing. Perhaps this fiasco will result in a more conservative approach for the consumer watchdog in the future.   Tags: Systems Mobile computing Mac User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Apple is hoping to bring original TV shows and movies to Apple Music by the end of 2017, The Wall Street Journal reports, in a move that would broaden the technology giant's ambitions as a media company and turn it into a more fearsome competitor in Hollywood and the music and video streaming industry.  Apple has been in talks with industry heavyweights in recent months about buying original scripted content. Discussions have been held with experienced TV producers about buying rights to shows, and with marketing executives at studios and networks about promoting this content. Apple has told these counterparties that it hopes to start offering original scripted content by the end of 2017. Here’s a preliminary glimpse at what Apple may be planning. First, Apple hasn’t fully figured out its strategy yet, which is part of the reason why it hasn’t closed a deal to buy content. But it looks like the company wants to acquire a small number of high-quality original scripted TV shows — something akin to HBO’s “Westworld” and Netflix’s “Stranger Things.” Original films are also on table, but less of a priority for now.  Apple’s plan is being framed as a play against Spotify rather than Netflix et al. The Wall Street Journal suggests that Apple isn’t looking to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to buy content, which means its ambitions are much more modest than the likes of Netflix, Amazon, and premium cable networks that invest billions in it annually. Instead, Apple is planning to use original TV shows as a way to distinguish itself from Spotify, its main music-streaming rival.  But Apple has the cash to go toe-to-toe with Netflix and Amazon should it want to. The company is sitting on well over $200 billion in cash. Allocating just 1-3% of this hoard toward original content would bring it into direct competition with Netflix and Amazon, which are each estimated to spend upward of $6 billion this year. This initial foray into original content could set the stage for Apple to move more boldly in the space in the future.  And expanded video offerings advances Apple’s aim as a services company. Venturing into original TV and films would help Apple diversify its revenue streams amid flattering iPhone sales. In the past year, Apple has emphasized its services businesses — which includes Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud — in the wake of decelerating sales across the rest of the company. Revenue from services was up 24% in Q4 2016, as total revenue dropped 9%.  Growth of subscription-video-on-demand (SVOD) services in the US has slowed considerably over the last year as competition in the online video streaming space intensifies. Heavy hitters like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime are increasingly squeezed by new competitors with exclusive content and niche video offerings.   International markets, and specifically, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region will be paramount for both established SVOD players and new entrants looking to establish themselves in the successful video space. The SVOD market in the APAC region is poised for explosive growth over the next five years due to increased mobile adoption, amplified broadband expansion, and enhanced purchasing power. Dylan Mortensen, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on subscription video on-demand that explores how slowing SVOD growth in the US will lead to a surge in the APAC region. Here are some of the key takeaways from the report: While SVOD services are increasingly rooted among US households, growth is beginning slow. Growth in North American SVOD subscriptions is set to fall from 30% in 2014 to 4% by 2018. The best opportunity for continued growth lies in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. The region had nearly 42 million SVOD subscribers in 2015, but could have up to 158 million by 2021. The increasing adoption of smartphones and mobile data is propelling growth in mobile video viewing across APAC, which is poised to outpace the rest of the world. Rising purchasing power in APAC underlines the opportunity for online video services. China and emerging Asian economies represent nearly two-thirds (63%) of global economic growth. Content creators and marketers stand to gain from SVOD’s push into the APAC region. Content creators can benefit from the surge in short-form video, while marketers can capitalize on advanced product placements. In full, the report:  Forecasts SVOD subscribers in the APAC region.

Naturally, the same can be said about previous iPhone and Galaxy S generations, as Samsung has often borrowed features from Apple when it comes to phone design and Apple borrows from Android all the time. However, this year, the phones are expected to sport similar designs and features, and a new report sheds light on yet another key element they’ll have in common. Don't Miss: Everything you could possibly need to know about the Nintendo Switch Sources said to be familiar with the upcoming phones told The Investor that both the iPhone 8 and Galaxy S8 will come with IP68 water and dust resistance. The iPhone 8 is the one that’s getting an upgrade here, compared to the iPhone 7’s IP67 rating. The Galaxy S8, meanwhile, will match the Galaxy S7’s IP68 rating. IP67 means a device can stay under 1 meter of water for half an hour and come away undamaged. IP68 gives you protection in up to 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes. “Apple’s iPhone 8 will feature the IP68 rating protection as part of drastic upgrades marking the 10th anniversary of the iPhone this year,” an industry source told the site. Samsung is looking to add water resistance to a broad range of handsets, not just the Galaxy S8. “Samsung is considering water protection even for the cheapest J series phones as they are the best-selling Galaxy phones,” a different source said. The report goes on to note that both Samsung and Apple will use waterproof tapes to protect their devices, rather than adhesives, as tape makes repair work easier. 3M and NDFOS are the dominant players in the waterproof tape market. LG’s upcoming G6 is also expected to feature water and dust protection, and some Chinese companies will also have waterproof handsets out this year as well.

All 3 major labels, Pandora, Rhapsody/Napster, HD Trax and the RIAA announced their support for the high-quality format through the Digital Entertainment Group (DEG), an industry association dedicated to hi-res releases. Interestingly, Apple Music and Spotify were absent from the announcement. While the DEG didn’t specify exactly what “hi-res” meant, Apple has been collecting high-resolution masters for its Mastered For iTunes program for the last 4 years. Although Apple would prefer masters at a 96kHz/24 bit resolution, it considers any master that’s 24 bit to be hi-res, regardless of the sample rate. Since Apple has been at the forefront in collecting high quality masters, it would stand to reason that Apple Music would have no problem implementing a new hi-res tier. There’s been no hint of that, however, although the company is notoriously tight-lipped about new developments. Spotify doesn’t seem to want to go that route yet, having enough trouble getting people to buy up to the $9.99 per month paid subscription tier, although it does have 41 million current subscribers, about twice that of its nearest competitor Apple Music. Tidal and Deezer both have hi-res tiers, but neither has made much of a impact on music consumers. That said, there are numerous online services like HD Trax that specialize in 96/24 and higher products available for download at a premium price. These are more for the audiophile sector, however, and don’t get much traction from mainstream consumers. That said, the natural progression is to high-resolution streaming, and all services will eventually go that way (you’ve heard it here first). I predict that what we’ll eventually see is the standard subscription tier at $4.99-5.99, and the hi-res premium tier at $9.99 per month. That’s not going to happen soon though, but 5 years from now there’s a good chance that it will be the norm when it comes to streaming.

And so trouble piles up for Donald Trump in the wake of his Wednesday charge, seemingly unfounded, that the agencies were responsible for leaking a damaging – and unverified – intelligence dossier which claims that he frolicked with prostitutes in Moscow in 2013; and that his campaign might have been a party to Russian efforts last year to derail Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.

More videos Trump compares intelligence report to 'Nazi Germany' Donald Trump slams the release of an unsubstantiated intelligence report as "something that Nazi Germany would have done" and calls Buzzfeed a "failing pile of garbage." A point of acute anxiety for Trump is that any suggestion, unfounded or not, that he had a leg-up in winning the election risks diminishing what he likes to bill as one of the most remarkable election wins ever – never mind that Clinton won almost three million more votes than Trump in the national popular vote. But news on Thursday that Department of Justice inspector general Michael Horowitz has launched a review of the FBI's handling of its investigation of Clinton's controversial private email server risks further tarnishing Trump's "greatest" victory – because if the FBI's conduct is faulted in any way, it could lend credence to Democrat claims that Clinton was robbed of victory by the bizarre pre-election behaviour of FBI director James Comey. Related Content FBI's actions before US election to be probed Recall that in July, Comey went against Department of Justice protocols by holding a sensational press conference at which, on the one hand, he handed defensive ammunition to Clinton, by clearing her of criminal wrongdoing; but on the other, he provided attack ammunition to Trump, by savaging Clinton for her "extremely careless" handling of her email. And that in the days before the November 8 election, front-runner Clinton's polling took a dive when Comey strode back into the public spotlight, releasing a letter he wrote to congressional leaders effectively saying, "can you believe it – we're re-opening the Clinton inquiry because we've found another laptop with hundreds of thousands more emails that could be relevant to the earlier investigation ". Advertisement And then three days before the vote, another letter – and this time Comey was saying, "ah shucks, you're not going to believe it, none of the new emails are relevant". It's not clear what Comey had for lunch on Thursday. But given reports that colleagues had warned him not to release the election-eve letters; and given informed speculation, by the likes of The Washington Post's Chris Cillizza, that "it's virtually impossible to defend his decision to make such a show of a discovery that, ultimately, amounted to nothing," a statement released by Comey read as if it had been written after a fun lunch. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Trump says Hillary Clinton was 'guilty as hell' over the email claims. Photo: AP "I'm grateful to the Department of Justice's IG for taking on this review. He is professional and independent and the FBI will co-operate fully with him and his office," the statement reads. "I hope very much he's able to share his conclusions and observations with the public because everyone will benefit from thoughtful evaluation and transparency regarding this matter." But the weird selectivity in Comey's thinking was on display again this week. With so much swirling about Trump and his campaign, it was perfectly logical for members of congress to ask if the FBI was investigating any of it. "I don't, especially in a public forum…we never confirm or deny a pending investigation," he said. And he might as well have added: "Unless the suspect's name begins with the letter C." Horowitz said he would not be attempting to second-guess the decision not to charge Clinton. Instead, according to various reports, he will examine Comey's press conference and letters to congress; leaks from the FBI, possibly including Trump surrogate Rudi Giuliani's access to inside information; an internal FBI conflict over management's rejection of a push by field agents to investigate the Clinton family foundation; and the propriety of the FBI's congressional liaison officer passing information to the Clinton campaign. Intelligence officials have explained that the nature of the content of the 35-page dossier on alleged Russian efforts to compromise Trump meant they were duty-bound to attach a two-page summary of its contents to last week's intelligence briefing to Trump…and outgoing president Barack Obama [who must have had a great laugh] and eight Congressional leaders. At the same time, there'll also be suspicion that the attachment was payback for Trump's juvenile mocking of the services on which, ordinarily, he would rely for intelligence as president. For now, it's unclear how the various agencies will proceed in investigating the contents of the Russia dossier – according to the BBC, an interagency task force was established last year because of it's overlapping domestic and foreign aspects. And though many US reporters have possessed copies of the dossier since last year, it had stayed out of the news for want of verification. However, some editors can be relied on to resume seeking to verify elements of the dossier, in the belief that this week's sensational publicity about its existence might loosen lips that previously had been shut tight. With just a week to Trump's inauguration, Vicki Divoll, formerly an attorney for both the CIA and the Senate intelligence panel, didn't see how Trump and the agencies could bury the hatchet. "After disparaging and demeaning the hardworking officers of the intelligence community, then grudgingly accepting their conclusions about Russian election hacking, Mr Trump is now hurling the worst epithet out there – comparisons to Nazi Germany – against them, without basis and on the eve of taking office," Divoll told The Guardian. "We are at our peril to be entering an era in which there is such open, irrational and hysterical hostility by a president against a community of 17 agencies whose mandate is to keep us safe."

Mobile by Erin Carson January 13, 2017 6:55 AM PST @erincarson Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS A group of iPhone users wants to bring an antitrust lawsuit against Apple.Photo by Chesnot, Getty Images If you've ever grumbled about the App Store being your only way to buy apps for your iPhone, you're not the only one. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals decided Thursday that iPhone app purchasers can sue Apple on the claim that the App Store monopolizes the iPhone apps market, leading to higher prices for apps. The App Store, launched nine years ago in the wake of the original iPhone, has been a driving force for Apple's sales of both devices and the commission-generating programs and services made for them. It still going gangbusters: Apple said that New Year's Day 2017 was the online store's biggest single day ever, racking up nearly $240 million in sales. In 2016, the App Store offered 2.2 million apps, an increase of more than 20 percent from the year before. The circuit court's decision brings new life to a challenge that was filed in 2012. Apple did not immediately respond to our request for comment, but has argued in the past that it basically rents out space to developers in the App Store. Apple gets a percentage of the revenues and developers get to sell their apps on the platform. In an interview with Reuters, Mark C. Rifkin, an attorney representing the iPhone users involved, said that possible outcomes, if the suit is successful, could include Apple allowing users to get apps where they please or paying damages to users.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Jan 13, 2017 at 9:36AM Image source: Apple In its famous 1984 commercial, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) portrayed International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) as Big Brother. Once the fiercest of rivals, the two companies are far more similar than different today. Beyond their size and maturity, Apple and IBM shares have also been on a tear over the past 12 months. AAPL data by YCharts Considering their many similarities, it's appropriate for investors to wonder whose shares are the more attractive potential buy today. To better answer this question, we'll put Apple and IBM stocks through a three-part analysis to gain a clearer sense of which one is the better buy now. 1. Financial fortitude Let's cut to the chase here: Apple wins the contest of financial fortitude by a landslide. It deserves noting, though, that this is more due to Apple's historic profitability rather than any financial imprudence on IBM's part. Company Cash and Investments Debt Cash From Operations Current Ratio Apple $237.5 billion $87.0 billion $65.8 billion 1.3 IBM $15.0 billion $42.4 billion $18.5 billion 1.2 Data sources: Apple investor relations, IBM investor relations, Yahoo! Finance. Apple generates the bulk of its sales overseas, and its practice of keeping its cash offshore has triggered several not-so-small controversies in recent years. Apple held $216 billion of its cash overseas as of its most recent earnings report. That means Apple can't directly tap into the majority of its cash holdings without paying steep repatriation taxes. Rather, Apple borrows against its overseas cash to fund its capital return program. Turning to IBM, Big Blue similarly has its financial house in order. Though it has leveraged its balance sheet to a certain extent, IBM generates plenty of cash flow to both service its debts and reinvest in its business. However, Apple's overall profitability simply can't be beat, making it the easy winner in this portion of our analysis. Winner: Apple. 2. Durable competitive advantages Turning to their competitive moats, Apple and IBM each enjoy some type of competitive advantage over their rivals. However, for both companies, their competitive advantages might not be as pronounced as they might initially seem. Apple's platinum-grade brand, closed-loop operating system, consistent device leadership, and immense financial resources certainly all contribute to its ability to consistently generate above-average returns on capital. Some of these items should prove fairly straightforward. Apple's Fort Knox-esque cash reserves allow it to buy its way into virtually any industry that interests it. However, Apple's closed-loop software architecture receives far less attention but is arguably more important in terms of supporting Apple's competitive position. In contrast to Alphabet's Android or Microsoft's Windows operating systems, Apple makes its software and app ecosystem available on its devices. That means users who migrate away from Apple's computers or mobile devices might not be able to bring their content with them, although third-party services such as Spotify have helped erode this situation in recent years. It also bears noting that Apple's product-driven sales model also presents something of a dormant risk. Should Apple somehow badly misstep with one of its annual device designs, its sales could suffer dramatically. Thanks to Apple's consistent device leadership, though, this situation has never come to fruition. At IBM, the company's longtime relationships with customers and the large percentage of its sales that come from its legacy three-pronged business model provide it with something of a competitive moat as well. However, with the rise of the cloud-computing era and IBM's evolving place in that space, the company's competitive stance has perhaps weakened slightly. To cite one popular -- and important -- metric, IBM's sales have now declined for 18 consecutive quarters. IBM's backlog of prearranged service bookings also fell 0.7% in constant currency terms in its most recent quarter, although IBM still carries roughly 1.5 years' worth of revenue as bookings. Winner: tie. 3. Valuation On the surface, Apple and IBM appear to be comparably valued. In terms of their current P/E, forward P/E, and EV/EBITDA ratios, there appears to be little difference between the two at first glance. Company P/E Ratio Forward P/E Ratio EV/EBITDA Apple 14.3 11.8 9.2 IBM 13.7 12.1 11.1 Data sources: Apple investor relations, IBM investor relations, Yahoo! Finance. Pay extra attention to the EV/EBITDA ratio. It's arguably the most useful valuation metric, because it takes into account each company's equity, debt, and cash positions. This is particularly important to consider when analyzing a cash-rich company like Apple, which currently carries $12.73 in cash per share on its balance sheet. Subtracting that cash amount out gives investors a clearer sense of the value the market places on Apple's core operations. Apple and IBM are both cheap compared with the market as a whole. In fact, after its recent rally, the S&P 500 benchmark trades at a valuation of 26, nearly double that of either Apple or IBM. This steep discount to the market reflects the view that Apple and IBM will probably exhibit little to no growth in the near term, which may not actually be the case. Though their revenue growth outlook isn't particularly rosy -- Apple and IBM sales are expected to rise 6%  and fall 2%, respectively, this year -- both companies are among the most effective users of dividends and stock buybacks to drive shareholder returns. In terms of the overall attractiveness of their valuations, though, Apple wins this category as well. Winner: Apple. And the winner is... Apple Apple's edge in two of the three categories examined here make the iPhone maker the more attractive option today. However, that isn't to say that IBM, especially in light of its own cheap valuation, is not a buy. In fact, I like both Apple and IBM shares as interesting potential buys at a time when cheap shares of high-quality companies are becoming increasingly scarce. So while Apple is the technical winner of this exercise, investors looking for blue-chip technology stocks to buy would do well to further investigate both Apple and IBM shares today.

Scheller Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. The New Year brings excitement and anticipation of changes for the best. Some of the pending patent cases provide us with ample opportunity to expect something new and, if not always very desirable to everybody, at least different. In this post, we highlight several cases that present interesting issues and that we anticipate may provide for new and important developments in the patent law this year. Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc. This highly-publicized case, now on remand from the Supreme Court, concerns damages for design patent infringement. Apple sued Samsung in 2011 for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. D618,677 (claiming an electronic device having black rectangular front face with rounded corners), D593,087 (claiming an electronic device having a rectangular front face with rounded corners and a raised rim) and D604,305 (claiming a grid of 16 colorful icons on a black screen of an electronic device). As we reported earlier, a jury found that several Samsung smartphones resembling the iPhone infringe those patents and awarded $399 million in damages to Apple, the entirety of Samsung's profit from sale of the infringing smartphones. The Federal Circuit upheld the award. The decision centered on 35 U.S.C. � 289, which provides that an accused infringer manufacturing or using a patented "article of manufacture" is liable to the patent owner "to the extent of his total profit." The Federal Circuit rejected Samsung's argument that damages should not be determined based on the entire smartphone but rather should be limited to individual components covered by the patents, such as a front face or a screen. The smartphone as a whole was deemed to be an "article of manufacture" in the context of Section 289. The Supreme Court, in an unanimous (but short) decision, however agreed with Samsung and remanded, stating that an "article of manufacture" is "simply a thing made by hand or machine," and is broad enough to include both a multicomponent product sold to a consumer and individual components of that product, "whether sold separately or not." No test however was provided on how to identify an "article of manufacture" relevant to damages. On remand, the Federal Circuit will determine whether "the relevant article of manufacture for each design patent ... is the smartphone or a particular smartphone component." A test for determining what exactly constitutes an "article of manufacture" for the purpose of determining damages in design patent cases is highly anticipated. TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC This case concerns a choice of venue in patent cases, and a decision by the Supreme Court is expected around June, 2017. Kraft Foods sued TC Heartland in the District of Delaware, alleging that Heartland's liquid water enhancer products infringed three of Kraft Foods' patents. Heartland moved to either dismiss the action or transfer venue to the Southern District of Indiana, where it is headquartered and incorporated. In support, Heartland stated that it is not registered to do business and has no presence in Delaware. After the district court denied its motion, Heartland appealed. The Federal Circuit affirmed and stated that patent suits may be filed in any judicial district in which the defendant sells an allegedly infringing product (Heartland ships accused products to Delaware, which amounts though to only about 2% of its total sales). The Federal Circuit has consistently applied this interpretation of the patent venue statute since its 1990 decision in VE Holding, which has since allowed patent holders to file suits in favorable courts that are perceived to be more plaintiff-friendly, such as the Eastern District of Texas. Opponents of this doctrine refer to it as a "forum shopping." As we reported before, on December 14, 2016, the Supreme Court agreed to review the Federal Circuit's decision. A decision in favor of Heartland would fundamentally change where patent cases can be litigated. In particular, many patent holders may effectively be barred from bringing suits in the Eastern District of Texas. Lexmark International v. Impression Products On December 2, 2016, the Supreme Court granted Impression Products' petition to hear a case concerning whether patent exhaustion arises from foreign sales. Lexmark, a manufacturer of printers and cartridges for those printers, sold the cartridges covered by Lexmark's U.S. patents in the U.S. and abroad. Some of the cartridges were sold at a reduced price and, according to a "Return program," were subject to a single-use/no-resale restriction set forth in the user agreement. With the goal of protecting quality and reputation of its products, and for other reasons, Lexmark required that customers who bought Return program cartridges return the empty cartridges only to Lexmark for remanufacturing or recycling. Impression, among others, acquired and re-purposed (which included modifying the original chip) both the foreign- and domestically-sold cartridges, and sold the modified cartridges in the U.S. When Lexmark took legal actions and other defendants agreed to settlements, Impression however argued that the first sale of the cartridges, either in the U.S. or abroad, exhausted Lexmark's U.S. rights to exclude. The district court partially sided with Impression, ruling that Lexmark's sale in the U.S. exhausted its patent rights, despite the express single-use/no-resale restrictions under the Return Program, but concluded that foreign sales did not exhaust Lexmark's patent rights. As we said earlier, on February 12, 2016, the en banc Federal Circuit agreed with Lexmark and confirmed two important aspects of the patent exhaustion doctrine, namely that (1) a patentee can "sell[] a patented article subject to a single-use/no-resale restriction that is lawful and clearly communicated to the purchaser" without exhausting the patentee's rights to that item; and (2) because foreign sales do not permit "the buyer to import the article and sell and use it in the United States," an authorized foreign sale of a product does not exhaust a patentee's U.S. patent rights to exclude associated with that product. In re Aqua Products This is a pending en banc case before the Federal Circuit regarding whether it is the patent owner who bears the burden of proving patentability of its amended claims in inter partes reviews before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. Aqua Products, Inc., as a patent owner, faced a claim amendment issue. In particular, after an inter partes review (IPR) of Aqua's patent on a robotic swimming pool cleaners was initiated, Aqua moved to substitute several of the challenged claims with limitations from the claims that were not challenged, effectively amending the claims. The America Invents Act (AIA) permits patent owners to move to amend claims of a patent, and 35 U.S.C. � 316(d) states that "the patent owner may file one motion to amend the patent," with additional motions to amend allowed in limited circumstances. Applying its rule making authority, the PTO ruled that Aqua failed to demonstrate that its amendments would make the claims-at-issue patentable over the known prior art. On August 12, 2016, the Federal Circuit granted Aqua's motion for an en banc hearing and asked Aqua and the USPTO to brief whether the USPTO may require that a patent owner bear the burden of persuasion regarding patentability of the amended claims, even though the AIA assigns the burden of proving unpatentability of the proposed claim amendments to an IPR petitioner. See 35 U.S.C. � 316(e)). Argument was heard on December 9, 2016, and a blog post on the upcoming decision will appear in due course.

 A US factory for Apple's top manufacturing partner is 'on the table' Kif Leswing Jan. 13, 2017, 10:11 AM 2,576 facebook linkedin twitter email print AP As President-elect Donald Trump threatens a new, more restrictive trade policy and tries to cajole companies like Apple to build their products in the US, many of Asia's top manufacturers are now seriously considering US manufacturing. Sharp, a Japanese company recently purchased by Foxconn, Apple's top manufacturing partner, is considering building a screen factory in the US, Nikkei reported on Friday. One executive told Nikkei the plan was "on the table" and the company would "make a decision carefully." The factory would most likely be used to manufacture LCD screens for TVs and other home appliances, not the tiny, high-density screens that Apple uses or the next-gen OLED screens that Apple is eyeing for its next iPhone. The potential scale of the facility is huge — it could be as big as a recent plant constructed in Guangzhou, China, that cost $8.7 billion. Foxconn is an investor in Softbank's $100 billion Vision Fund. Softbank's CEO told Trump that investments in the fund could create US jobs, but on Thursday it was reported that most of the money would most likely be used to "grab a piece of an undervalued technology company trading on the stock exchange" or to do a private-equity deal. Apple reportedly asked Foxconn to explore making iPhones in the US. But the plan would be likely to significantly increase manufacturing costs, partially because many of the parts suppliers are based in Asia. US-based factories would also most likely use more automation than factories in Asia because of the higher cost of labor. Apple manufactures nearly all of its products in Asia, with the exception of the low-volume Mac Pro, which is assembled in Texas, and some iMacs that are built in Ireland. Apple also owns a former manufacturing facility in Arizona currently being used as a data center that recently applied for special import-export manufacturing status.

I can only guess that these claims were made by people who just skimmed the patent before writing hyperbolic headlines. I actually took the time to read the patent, and I'm here to say with 100 percent confidence that the next iPhone won't be transparent. Must read: iPhone: What will the next 10 years bring? More on iPhone The enterprise iPhone: Improvements in Apple's iOS Gallery tour: iPhone's evolution What will the next 10 years bring? Apple's transition from Jobs to Cook Tracking changes in storage, battery, camera and more iOS 10.2: Tips and hidden secrets Best iPhone or iPad apps for 2017 Made in China: Four horsemen of the iPhone apocalypse Does an iPhone production cut suggest a sales slump? Does the iPhone still matter? Huawei, not Apple, now drives the mobile conversation As with most patents, number 9,543,364 -- "Electronic devices having displays with openings" -- is pretty long winded, but a few key excerpts should give you the gist of it. The abstract is a good place to start: "An electronic device may have a display. The display may have an active region in which display pixels are used to display images. The display may have one or more openings and may be mounted in a housing associated with the electronic device. An electronic component may be mounted in alignment with the openings in the display. The electronic component may include a camera, a light sensor, a light-based proximity sensor, status indicator lights, a light-based touch sensor array, a secondary display that has display pixels that may be viewed through the openings, antenna structures, a speaker, a microphone, or other acoustic, electromagnetic, or light-based component. One or more openings in the display may form a window through which a user of the device may view an external object. Display pixels in the window region may be used in forming a heads-up display." What we have described here is a display, but unlike a regular display, this one features an array of tiny holes. Underneath those holes would be fitted an array of components, such as a camera or a speaker, or even tiny LEDs that themselves would combine with the other holes to form a secondary display of sorts. Why might you want to hide components under the display? Apple clarifies this: "In many device configurations such as those in which displays occupy large portions of a device, it can be challenging to accommodate device components within the device. For example, a display may present an obstacle to the installation and operation of device components. Unless care is taken, a designer may be forced to make aesthetically unappealing design choices or may need to install device components using awkward or bulky arrangements." So it comes down to aesthetics and the ability to remove the screen bezel by embedding the components that are currently in the bezel -- specifically light sensors, the front-facing camera, and the earpiece speaker -- directly into the display. The same technology might also allow the Touch ID sensor to be hidden under the display, freeing up the need for the iPhone to have a top and bottom bezel altogether, and allowing for a larger display. And yes, the patent does say that these holes could allow users to look through the display via a window on the back of the device. But to extrapolate this into a "transparent iPhone" is wildly inaccurate. Apple patent 9,543,364 USPTO/Apple In fact, what we have here is not a see-through iPhone, but the technology that might allow Apple to equip the smartphone with augmented reality (AR) technology (although in the patent Apple doesn't say this, instead only going as far as suggesting it might be used for a heads-up display). But if you take the patent, skim it, combine that with other nonsense that's have been doing the rounds lately, and add a sensational headline, you end up with all those "transparent iPhone" fake news pieces. It's also important to realize that big companies such as Apple patent -- or at least file patent applications for -- a lot of stuff, most of which never makes it into a product. Just because it's in a patent doesn't mean that the technology is anywhere close to being ready for primetime, or even possible given current technology. So no, the next iPhone won't be transparent.

The tech giant is planning to bundle original video content with its $10-a-month Apple Music subscription service by the end of 2017, according to a report from the WSJ. Apple has reportedly already held talks with “veteran producers” about both original TV shows and movies. Apple acquired the Carpool Karaoke TV series fronted by James Corden in July, but this would be a significant enhancement of these ambitions.

INNOVATE This One Simple Shift In Perspective Will Free You From The Past Breaking free of the past is one of the hardest things to do, but this change in perspective is the key to unlocking the opportunity of the future. By Thomas Koulopoulos Tom Koulopoulos is the author of 10 books and founder of the Delphi Group, a 25-year-old Boston-based think tank and a past Inc. 500 company that focuses on innovation and the future of business. @tkspeaks Founder, Delphi Group@tkspeaks WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The Patterns That Hold Us Hostage We build so much of our view of what's possible around the past. While we all want to believe we have an open mind to the possibilities and opportunities of the future, our behaviors are slaves to the past. That's why real breakthroughs are so rare. It's the reason you can drive down any street and identify the decade when each house was built. You can do the same with nearly any photo--polyester leisure suits; must be 1975. The patterns of the past define us, our lives, the way we work, our behaviors, and ultimately our expectations. In short, we like known patterns and we are drawn to them! That's why we cling for dear life to the past, long after it's outlived its usefulness. "if there is one thing that I've learned, that's essential to moving forward, it is to see opportunities to grow rather than problems to be solved." But patterns are also our nemesis. They narrow our field of view and limit our options; they establish boundaries of what's possible and rational. In short, patterns stifle our ability to innovate--our companies and ourselves. What's truly amazing is how quickly we develop rigid assumptions of what the right way to approach a problem is based on the way we've always gone about solving it, and how soon we abandon the creativity needed to view the opportunity as opposed to the problem. And if there is one thing that I've learned, that's essential to moving forward, it is to see opportunities to grow rather than problems to be solved. Better Isn't Good Enough For example, When Apple first introduced the iPod it was considered ridiculous to use a hard drive as opposed to flash (solid state) memory. Hard drives where considered larger more prone to malfunctions and more expensive than flash memory. In addition storage capacities were measured in terms of hours and megabytes. If your MP3 player could hold few CDs worth of music you were doing pretty good. After all, the MP3 player wasn't going to replace you entire CD collection! Every MP3 players was trying to solve the problems of the past. Apple stepped in and saw the opportunity of the future. Jobs didn't ask "What can Apple do to make MP3s better?" That would have been solving the problem of the past and that wasn't good enough. He asked "Why not?" or, more specifically; Why not store more than a few hours of music? Why not use the MP3 player for all of your music? Why not use hard drives which had so much more capacity? Why not build a new business model for the music industry that served the consumer? You can imagine that every one of these was questions was greeted with stares of indignant disbelief followed by the answer, "Because that's not what people are buying. In other words, that's just the way it is!" Here's a hint, whenever you hear "that's just the way it is and always has been!" think opportunity. Nothing is more likely to create pent up opportunity than a well worn pattern which has outlived its usefulness. That's why Tony Fadell, who had shopped the idea of an iPod like device to nearly every MP3 player company was turned down over and over until Jobs brought him on board to architect Apples iPod in 2001. Whether it's the radio, the telephone, the light bulb, the iPod, or even our own behaviors, we are absolutely oblivious to the impact that innovation can have and the extent to which we can change the way we look at and experience the world. That's why when familiar patterns are disrupted, it seems that the disruption always comes from the most unlikely candidates for change. Remember, Apple was the consumate outsider when it came to the music industry. It's as though only a virgin set of eyes, untainted by the knowledge of the past, are the only ones foolish enough to see the opportunity that the future can bring. While we are surrounded by these kinds of unlikely successes, we never cease to be amazed by them. Amazon redefines the way books are bought and sold; Google redefines the way we learn; Apple redefines the way we experience music, Uber upturns the taxicab industry. In each case an outsider that stood no rational chance against the incumbents, overtakes them by light years. Like an amnesiac with no long-term memory, we awe at the phenomenon, no matter how many times we experience it. The Key To Breaking Free So, the question is, "How do you break free of the patterns of the past?" The answer is amazingly simple. You start with a fundamental change in perspective; turn problems into opportunities. This applies to nearly every challenge, personal and professional. Once you label something as a problem you become reactive rather than proactive. That means you start to limit your ability to be creative because you are responding within the confines of the existing problem. Apple didn't try to make MP3 players better, they decided to exploit an opportunity MP3 players couldn't touch. Which is exactly why every MP3 player company had to label Apple's approach absurdly expensive, impractical, and unsustainable. Oh, and because they did that they painted themselves into a corner (called the past) and were stuck addressing the problem and never transitioned to the new opportunity. Cab companies, are you listening? Of course not! Yes, we all want to believe that we can see the opportunities of the future; the key is not to believe it but to behave it. Like this column?

This means a legal challenge originally filed in 2012, but chucked out by a lower court, can be reinstated. The original class-action suit was filed on behalf of consumers, who claimed the 30% of the cost of an iOS app they pay direct to Apple was unfair and excessive, enabled by the fact that Apple doesn’t allow apps purchased anywhere else to run on its devices. Apple’s initially successful defence was that it doesn’t sell the apps to consumers itself, it just provides the platform for developers to do so and effectively derives a rent from said developers. The appeals court has decided users do purchase apps directly from Apple, thus overturning the original decision. The broader precedent being explored here is how much power the owners of operating systems should have over the activities conducted on them. Microsoft has spent decades being punished for pushing its luck with Windows and if this reinstated law-suit concludes against Apple it could be the first of many challenges to the commercial domination of not just the iOS ecosystem by Apple, but the Android one by Google. In 2012 Acer attempted to launch a smartphone running a modified version of Android before Google made it clear this would result in the loss of its rights to use the Play Store and other Google services. Acer cancelled the device. Apple likes to regularly crow about how much money developers earn from iOS. At the start of this year it issued a press release saying developers earned $20 billion in 2016, 40% up from the 2015 figure. This does also mean, however, that Apple will have trousered around $8.5 billion from all that App Store action. Aymco reckons iOS has generated around a trillion dollars for Apple since the first iPhone. The issue here isn’t the App Store itself but whether, by compelling developers to conduct all their commercial activity through it, Apple has created a monopoly which it used to grab a bigger piece of the action than it could have in a competitive environment. This is ultimately about control and the implications for mobile commerce could be far-reaching.

We take a look at the rumours surrounding Apple's iPhone 8 and the Galaxy S8 Samsung and Apple are, of course, two of the biggest players in the space. They command sales, profit margins and headlines. When they drop a new flagship you and everybody you know is talking about it. This is just par for the course, but next year’s releases – the iPhone 8 and Samsung Galaxy S8 – are looking likely to be even more of a big deal. Samsung has some rather impressive plans for its Galaxy S8 releases. Just as it did this year and last, Samsung will release two models. The big difference in 2017, however, will be the introduction of a new Galaxy S8 PLUS model which will reportedly feature a 4K display, dual-lens camera and full S-Pen support. The idea here appears to be to pick up any disgruntled Galaxy Note 7 users. Samsung needs the Galaxy S8 to be a raging success, after the Galaxy Note 7 disaster wiped around 95% of its revenues off the table for the most recent quarter. The 4K display is included, no doubt, for the purposes of VR, where 4K is needed for improved visual performance when using the handset inside a headset - there will also likely be compatibility with Google's Daydream View headset, as well as Samsung's own Gear VR. However, don't be thinking the regular Galaxy S8 will miss out on 4K resolution goodness - that's been rumoured long before the idea of a PLUS model. The larger, perhaps better-specced model of the Galaxy S8 could retail for a lot more than the standard model. Both handsets, however, will feature EDGE displays, as these have proven very popular with punters in the past 18 months. You can read a full account of what Samsung has in store for us with its Galaxy S8 Plus in our detailed break-down of all the Galaxy S8 PLUS rumours.  Word on the street suggests Samsung is bringing a new Galaxy S8 model into the mix next year. That handset is called the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus. But it isn’t just Samsung that will introduce a new model in its flagship series; no, Apple will too. And the new iPhone model is apparently called the iPhone 8 Pro. So what’s the craic with Apple’s new iPhone? Well, it’ll be the most expensive, feature an 5.8in AMOLED display and likely the finest camera we’ve ever seen the company put inside a phone. If the rumours are true about the iPhone 8 Pro, this phone will be extremely expensive and extremely powerful, adding in an extra level of performance on top of Apple’s already-established Plus model. KGI Securities, off the back of this news, reckons Apple will shift anywhere from 120 to 150 million iPhone 8 handsets before the close of 2017, besting its previous record with the iPhone 6 of around 110 million. Make no mistake, next year’s high-end phone space is going to be a very interesting – and expensive – place. Next year is also the iPhone’s 10th birthday and Apple is believed to be introducing a TON of new features, specs and a brand new design language. Right. Let’s delve into what’s currently known about these two, very special handsets. iPhone 8 vs Samsung Galaxy S8: Major Specs Rumored iPhone 8 Display: 4.7, 5.5 and 5.8in 1920 x 1310 Curved OLED  Storage: 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB CPU and RAM: A11 processor, 3-4GB RAM Front Camera: 8MP Rear Camera: 12MP dual-lens, dual-OIS, 4K video recording Extras: Iris scanner, wireless charging Rumored Galaxy S8 Display: 5.1 and 5.5in 2160 x 3840 Curved 4K Super AMOLED Display Storage: 64GB internal, 256GB expandable CPU and RAM: Qualcomm Snapdragon 830 or Samsung Exynos 8995 Processor, 4-6GB RAM Front Camera: 12MP with wide angle lens Rear Camera: Dual-lens 16MP, 4K video recording, optical image stabilization. Extras: Iris scanner As far as specs go you can expect the iPhone 8 to see a new A11 processor and M11 motion-coprocessor. But until those actually ship, there’s no way to tell how they compare against the rumored Qualcomm Snapdragon 830 or Samsung Exynos 8995 processor expected to be found in the Galaxy S8. As for RAM, expect the Galaxy S8 to blow the iPhone 8 out of the water. Entry level iPhone 8’s might have 3GB or RAM with the Plus maxing out at 4GB. But the S8 could start at 4GB and max out at 6GB of RAM! As for storage options, the iPhone 8 will likely max out at 256GB. It’s the breadth of internal storage that really beats the S8 here. Although, the S8 could actually end up with more storage. Even if it only offers 64GB internal, it would max out to over 300GB if it supports 256GB SD cards. iPhone 8 vs Samsung Galaxy S8: Display At present it's thought there will be three size variants of the iPhone 8 at 4.7in, 5.5in, and 5.8in. However, Apple is rumoured to be adopting curved OLED displays to incorporate a wrap-around, bezeless display in a unique new, slightly iPhone 4S-insipired curved glass bodyshell, but it is strongly claimed that this will only apply to one model which will be priced at a premium, as Apple is unable to source enough of the curved OLED panels for every variant. The model with the curved display is also believed to be the one which will have other high-spec bells and whistles, such as a dual-OIS dual-lens camera. The resolution for the iPhone 8's display will allegedly be 1920 x 1310 pixels and it is said that the Home key and fingerprint scanner will be embedded under the display glass. It's not clear whether 3D Touch will make a return, but our guess is that it likely will. As for the Galaxy S8 phones, it has been established for quite a while that Samsung is doing away with flat displays and it's expected both Galaxy S8 variants will have curved EDGE Super AMOLED screens. Both have also been rumoured with a 4K resolution. iPhone 8 vs Samsung Galaxy S8: Camera Expect at least one version of each phone to offer dual-lens rear cameras. But also expect Samsung to offer more megapixels for both the front and rear camera. The front S8 camera will probably be at least 12MP while the front iPhone 8 camera will be 8MP. Of the back lenses the S8 will probably max out at 16MP while the iPhone 8 has a 12MP dual-lens, according to reports. Some very recent reports have said that the model with a dual-lens and curved OLED display will also feature new dual-OIS, an upgrade from the iPhone 7 Plus which had a dual-sensor but only OIS in one of the two lenses. It’s likely Apple could also have improved software that makes it pictures more colorful and richer. However the S8 is likely to take better night shots. iPhone 8 vs Samsung Galaxy S8: Extras Besides new designs for each, what could the “killer feature” of both phones be? Rumors say both will sport iris scanners, taking biometrics to the next level. However, the iPhone 8 is also said to support wireless charging. There are no firm rumors that the S8 will have wireless charging yet–but it’s still early and given the spread of Android phones with wireless charging already in operation it stands to reason that Samsung might just include this feature on the Galaxy S8.  Display technology is another area where Samsung will attempt to out-do Apple. “The screen will be a next-generation OLED panel that is supposed to be more efficient than current designs,” says BGR. “The Galaxy S8’s screen will also incorporate the home button with its fingerprint sensor, and other buttons. Furthermore, the handset should have no less than four cameras on board. Finally, there’s going to be a new 3-coil wireless charging inside the device.” Samsung VIV Confirmed For Galaxy S8 Samsung’s having another stab at doing a digital assistant, and this one is called Viv and it WILL debut inside the Samsung Galaxy S8. Viv was developed by the original creators of Siri, who are now working under Samsung. Samsung will bring Viv to ALL of its products as well; so it won’t just feature inside the Galaxy S8. Expect to see Viv inside HDTVs, watches, tablets and more. Viv is basically Samsung’s answer to Siri, Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa. “The acquisition of Viv Labs would also allow Samsung to reduce its dependence on Google services,” reports The Express. “Samsung has already launched its own contactless payment options – Samsung Pay – which directly competes with Google's Android Pay solution.” Viv Labs CEO Dag Kittlaus said: "Samsung is setting its sights on becoming a major player in software and services, and specifically AI. “Samsung Pay has already proven to be one of the most successful mobile payment platforms in the market and SmartThings is another software acquisition signalling their conviction. And they have installed a new cadre of senior SW-savvy management stretching all the way to the top with a mission.” iPhone 8 vs Samsung Galaxy S8: Verdict You want us to give a verdict on two phones that haven’t even been announced yet? Please. What we will say, however, is that 2017 should see major upgrades for both phones. After all, 2017 is the tenth anniversary of the iPhone and next year's phone will need to wow after this year’s iPhone retained the relatively same design as the iPhone 6s. Samsung will also need to wow considering the PR nightmare they’ve had with the Note 7. Expect big things, basically. 2017 could well be the best year for innovation we've seen in quite some time.  Read More About: Mobile Phones Apple Apple iPhone 8 Sponsored Links Related content All The VERY BEST iPhone Apps For 2017 OnePlus 5 Coming 2017 With Ceramic Body Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Blue Coral Arrives In UK Via Vodafone Android N Release Date & Update Schedule Predictions Nokia 8 Android Flagship LEAKS View the discussion thread.

They were so strong that Consumer Reports ran tests and didnt give the MacBook Pro its blessing for the first time in the history of the lineup. After that Apple started working together with the organization to fix the problem. Consumer Reports said the battery life was inconsistent in all three devices - The 13 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the non-Touch Bar 13 notebook and the flagship with 15 display. 13" MacBook Pro without Touch Bar  13" MacBook Pro with Touch Bar  15" MacBook Pro Apparently Apple found some inconsistency with how the tests were run - the company said Consumer Reports used a script that was deleting cache and this was not a typical consumer behavior. Apple asked CR to redo the test and apparently it went as expected from all sides - battery life was consistent. During the collaboration Apple found a bug that was triggered during these tests with reloading icons. The Cupertino-based company says the fix is already up and you should download it so everything works properly. Consumer Reports also acknowledged the fix and released a statement saying it now recommends the MacBook Pro. If you are a MacBook Pro used and want to download the new software you have to sign up for the companys Beta program. The working version is listed as macOS Sierra Version 10.12.3 Beta (16D25a).

Advertisement Trump also commented on the Justice Department's internal probe into the FBI's handling of Hillary Clinton's use of a private e-mail server on Friday, denouncing the reaction by Clinton aides who said again on Thursday that Comey cost her the election. Trump said investigators had been "nice'' to Clinton and that the former secretary of state's loss in the presidential race could not be attributed to actions by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the final days of the campaign. "What are Hillary Clinton's people complaining about with respect to the FBI,'' Trump said on Twitter. "Based on the information they had she should never have been allowed to run – guilty as hell. They were VERY nice to her. She lost because she campaigned in the wrong states – no enthusiasm!''

The Elago W3 is made of "scratch-free silicone" and supports both Apple Watch and Apple Watch Series 2.

Apple Mesa, Arizona – Apple’s ‘Made In America’ Credentials Get A Boost Apple Mesa, Arizona boosts 'Made in America' credentials but Apple denies any plan to start manufacturing activity at this facility. by Luke Joye • January 13, 2017 January 13, 2017 in Apple Apple denies manufacturing plans Playing its ‘Trump’ card, Apple has drawn up plans to set up manufacturing facilities for new computers in the U.S. However, the planned facility would not be making the Macs. Instead the company’s existing facility in Apple Mesa, Arizona will be producing data centers and servers for use in other US facilities owned by the company, according to a report by Business Insider. A filing by Mesa city to the US government and published on Monday in the Federal Register references Apple’s plans. The filing evidences Mesa seeking approval from the FTS (Foreign Trade Zone) Board USA for “finished products” to be created by Apple which would include “finished server assembly cabinets”. ADVERTISEMENT New approval may save customs duty for Apple Apple has already obtained the authority to make consumer electronics components within the special zone in Mesa. But, the new approval when granted would allow Apple to import parts necessary for data centers without the incidence of customs duty. Part of Apple Mesa, Arizona was earlier leased to GT Advanced Technologies Previously Apple had leased to GT Advanced Technologies some 1.2 m sq.ft from its Mesa facility. This company supplied Sapphire screens to Apple before going bankrupt in 2014. Apple has used this space since then as its data center to provide servers and backups for services such as iCloud and iTunes. Simultaneously, Apple has also been ramping up its workforce at the facility and emphasizing plans to bring the iCloud infrastructure into the Mesa facility. Domestic manufacturing gaining in popularity Right now expansion of domestic manufacturing is gaining popularity with Donald Trump, the President-elect preparing to assume office in about 10 days.  Some of the other domestic companies have also caved into political pressure, altering their investment plans to focus on their U.S. facilities in some instances. Apple too has been dragged into this for the better or worse.  Be that as it may, the Mac maker is preparing to expand operations Mesa, and start its “high-tech” manufacturing according to government documents. Currently, Apple assembles data center components at the respective sites, but the present move will consolidate the operation in Mesa. Finished equipment would then be shipped to Apple’s global facilities including those in the U.S. Update In an interesting update provided by Apple and published by techcrunch Apple has stated that the notice concerning its activity at Mesa, Arizona pertains to an application made for renewal of the FTZ status which was already available at that location when the site was acquired by Apple from GT Advanced Technologies, who were Apple’s former supplier. No manufacturing plans at Apple Mesa, Arizona Apple, while confirming its application for renewal of FTZ status which also triggered the Notice concerning proposed manufacturing plans, emphasized that it has no intention to manufacture any product at that site. Apple stated further that its intention rather, is for the Mesa facility to act as a global command hub for the company’s data center functions which in turns means that the site would function as a central location for receiving and configuring servers, assemble them into racks, before being distributed for deployment in the different data centers of the company. Renewal application for retaining distribution and logistical benefits The renewal application for FTZ status at the Mesa facility appears to be for the purpose of retaining some of the logistical and distribution benefits that flow from a site with the particular designation, rather than being a route that would enable it to expand manufacturing operations in America. Presently, the Mesa facility is not operational and according to Apple once it starts functioning production at the facility will be that of assembling servers to make them into racks. Apple stated further that its global manufacturing supply chain does use several US based suppliers. 69 manufacturing facilities are listed in Apple’s annual supplier report,  with companies based in US supplying components like glass for all iOS, iOS devices, Mac Chips and Processors,  RF components used in iPhones and other display materials that go into iPad, iPhone, and MacBook. Apple also added that 33 of the 50 US states contribute to the range of its products and it works with as many as 8,000 domestic suppliers as shared earlier too and that the company’s supply chain generates over 360,000 US jobs Tagged in: Apple Mesa / Arizona / Domestic manufacturing / Donald Trump Share Tweet Luke Joye All Luke's Posts Comments Be The First to Comment Related Reads Android, Mobile ‘Sony Xperia C6’ Release Date, Specs, Price and Features: New Bezel-Less C6 Images Leaked Sid Suvarna • February 1, 2016 Apple, Gadgets ‘Apple Watch 2 Release Date’ and Rumours Update: New Apple Watch Already in Works Sid Suvarna • December 19, 2015 Apple, Apps & Software Periscope for iOS Update Lets You Mute Users JT Teran • July 27, 2015 Mobile Samsung Galaxy S7 Consumer Reports Ratings: Best Smartphone Ever Sid Suvarna • March 27, 2016 BlackBerry, Business, Mobile, Tech BlackBerry Enterprise Services Banned in Pakistan Because It’s Too Secure JT Teran • July 26, 2015 Connect With Us Get the latest news from N4BB direct to your inbox daily..

IBM, Apple, bring Watson into the iOS enterprise Apple’s Tim Cook speaks on Apple’s A.I. plans Video Mingis on Tech: The iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 -- and the gadget guy! Imagine if you could use Siri to request a detailed breakdown of your bank accounts, or find and pay for financial products using Apple Pay. It’s possible A solution that does this was demonstrated at the Digital Money Forum at CES this year, when University of Michigan professor and Clinc CEO, Jason Mars discussed Finie. The software is a voice-activated financial assistant based on Clinc’s own proprietary AI. The cloud-based technology that can be integrated into existing apps – Citi, Visa and Intuit are already working to put it inside their banking apps, which suggests the security of the service is ready for active use. What it does Finie lets users ask questions about their accounts using their voice: “What did I spend in restaurants last month?” “Can I afford to spend $289 on Nintendo’s new console?” “How much did I spend in Lisbon last week?” “How much am I earning?” You can also engage in banking transactions, such as transferring money between accounts, or requesting spending advice. Neural networking Finie uses deep learning algorithms. They learn from what you do, and can answer complex questions like, “How much did I spend on Uber in Paris last month?” The AI deployed in Finie is specialized. It was built to be really good at handling financial transactions but nothing else. "If you look at Apple's Siri or Google's Google Now, I think they try to give you one assistant that can do everything," co-founder, Lingjia Tang told Secondwave media. Et tu, Siri? Siri, Cortana, Google Now, Alexa and most other voice assistant technologies aren’t really specialized AI, instead they try to handle whatever questions are thrown at them. In practice this means they are machine intelligence solutions that depend on users making specific, pre-programmed, requests. Finie is different in that it teaches itself what it needs to learn in order to help you best. This move toward neural networking is an inevitable evolution for voice assistant technologies. They need to evolve beyond being dumb bots. Smart finance If Apple were to deploy technology like this within Siri it would be able to introduce a host of new features within Apple Pay, features that could help it in its unstated mission of transforming the financial industry, but you don’t need to wait for that to happen (or not). As established and new, challenger banks deploy Finie support within their apps you will be able to access such tools. Beat the bank The app is proof that the digital transformation of the financial sector is happening and that traditional banks are feeling it. This automation of the financial services sector will eventually be recognized as an example of the impact of AI automation on employment, even though such solutions meet some genuinely felt banking customer needs they also erode the number of employment opportunities in the sector. It won’t stop there, you can easily imagine using Finie in some form to enable you to ask your iPhone to file your tax return for you – bad news for accountants, but a welcome relief to many of us. Apple Pay The existence of Apple Pay proves Apple’s interest in mobile payments. With the fintech sector undergoing such root and branch transformation, there seems little reason for the company not to push a little further into traditional services from that sector. People would welcome it -- 84 percent of the UK public agree that bankers are greedy and get paid too much. Apple could do worse than to explore some of the business models emerging from the digital “challenger bank” sector, and may perhaps want to add a little Finie intelligence to its platform if it wants to continue its attempt to force banks to support Siri – and to extend into other service-related sectors.

Primary sources. Global perspective. advertisement Federal appeals court rules Apple antitrust suit may proceed Friday 13 January 2017 at 8:40 AM ET by Miracle Jones ©  WikiMedia (Blake Patterson) [JURIST] The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit [official website] ruled [opinion, PDF] Thursday that plaintiffs may sue Apple [corporate website] for violating antitrust regulations by forcing users to purchase apps exclusively through their app store. The court held that plaintiffs have standing to sue Apple because the communications company only permits developers to sell applications for Apple devices exclusively through the Apple app store, which may cause higher pricing for Apple users. The plaintiffs allege this exclusivity created a monopoly on apps for Apple users, which then created a profit for Apple. According to the appeals court: In Apple's view, because it sells distribution services to app developers, it cannot simultaneously be a distributor of apps to app purchasers. Apple analogizes its role to the role of an owner of a shopping mall that "leases physical space to various stores." Apple's analogy is unconvincing. In the case before us, third-party developers of iPhone apps do not have their own "stores." Indeed, part of the anti-competitive behavior alleged by Plaintiffs is that, far from allowing iPhone app developers to sell through their own "stores," Apple specifically forbids them to do so, instead requiring them to sell iPhone apps only through Apple's App Store.The case will now proceed to trial. This latest ruling is the latest event in a series of legal challenges for Apple. In December Apple launched [JURIST report] a legal challenge to a $14 billion tax penalty that the EU has levied against the company. The US Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor [JURIST report] of Samsung over Apple in December in an infringement suit between the two smartphone giants.

Unfortunately for Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard, this held true for their adaptation of “Assassin’s Creed.” Based on Ubisoft’s video game franchise of the same name, “Assassin’s Creed” had potential with an all star cast but ultimately left much to be desired. “Assassin’s Creed” is the story of two men, Aguilar de Nerha and Callum Lynch, both portrayed by Fassbender. The movie opens on Aguilar being accepted into the Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood as they fight to protect the prince of Granada from the Knights Templar. The year is now 1986 where a young Cal discovers his mother has been murdered by his father and he is forced to flee. Thirty years later Cal is seen being sentenced to death for murdering a man who tried to mug him. After going under from the injection Cal wakes up in a strange place and is told he has been brought to the Abstergo Foundation in Madrid, Spain because he is the last living relative of Aguilar, the last man known to posses the Apple of Eden, and they need Cal to discover where Aguilar hid it. The person feeding him this information is Dr. Sophia Rikkin (Marion Cotillard) who also informs him that the apple contains the genetic code for free will and could end violence in the human race. With help from Abstergo’s machine known only as the Animus Project, Cal is able to relive the memories of Aguilar as Aguilar defends the Apple of Eden from the knights. After an initial resistance, Cal sees the positives in ending human violence. However, the more he uses the Animus, the more he understands why the assassins did what they did and believes that Abstergo may not be telling him the entire truth. This movie was at its best during Aguilar’s sequences. The action was exciting, fast paced and served as the main source of tension building in the film. The environments created felt authentic and the scenes were well shot. The thrill of watching a group of assassins creep through a crowd will keep you on the edge of your seat. Free running was also heavily focused on in the trailers as it is a staple of the original video game franchise, and the chase sequence lived up to the rest of Aguilar’s moments. Unfortunately every beautiful scene of action across the Spanish countryside was surrounded and drowned out by dull and underdeveloped plot development. The present day story did not seem to carry any weight to it. As futuristic as it may have looked on paper cement walls of the movie set, the white uniforms just stood as a visual representation for the lackluster story. Whether the decision was made by director Justin Kurzel or was based purely on budget, shying away from the historical scenes hurt this film significantly. “Assassin’s Creed” had another much more complicated problem, which was a complete lack of identity. When it was an action movie it excelled, but as previously mentioned any scene in Abstergo played as a lifeless drama. What’s worse about this is that the plot focuses on a device that could control the entire population, but at no point does the movie convey any sense of danger or importance. The movie struggled most when it focused on its current day story and its current day protagonist Cal. Presumably this was done to avoid the issue of a meaningless present day story, which many of the games have been scolded for. However, the character created in Cal is dull and unlikable, his motives are muddled and at no point does he become relatable to the audience. Focusing so heavily on Cal created dry spells throughout the movie — maybe it would have been best if he stayed dead. “Assassin’s Creed” had all of the pieces to create an enjoyable action experience but it tried to take itself too seriously and ended up missing the mark. Maybe Justin Kurzel feared making the movie too fantastical would make it feel campy, but unfortunately his inability to take a leap of faith left him with a dull end result. If you are bored I would recommend seeing something else with your time, and maybe it’ll be worth the watch as an at home rental.

Apple's iOS and related services could generate a total profit of $1 trillion in 2017.   ( Jack taylor | Getty Images ) Advertisement Apple's iOS hardware and related services are on track to generate a cumulative profit of $1trillion sometime in 2017, which will be a major landmark for a consumer product. The iPhone is estimated to sell around 1.2 billion units by mid-2017, making it one of the most successful products of all time. This forecast comes courtesy analyst Horace Dediu who predicts a promising future for the company. "As we look toward the second decade of the iPhone, the expectation isn't one of another 'big bang' but a process of continuous improvement," says Dediu. The iPhone's success could enable the iOS ecosystem and its related services, which is inclusive of the iPod touch, the iPads, the Apple Watch and Apple TV, to reach a combined total sales of 1.75 billion units in 2017. Forecasts By mid-2017, the revenue generated from sales of iOS products will apparently touch $980 billion. The analyst also notes that apart from hardware, Apple also generates revenue via iOS services - which include content - and this accounts for over $100 billion presently. Based on this statistic, the iOS ecosystem would have managed to generate more than a whopping $1 trillion in revenue for the Cupertino-based company in 2017. The analyst, however, is unable, to give a time window by when this milestone would be notched up. The analyst is also of the belief that users are likely to bypass Android in favor of iOS instead of vice-versa as was the scenario in the past. "Chances are higher that users will switch from Android to iPhone and not the other way. Again, the reasons have more to do with the ecosystem and quality of users (which are hard to measure) than with the hardware (which is easy to measure.)," he noted. To illustrate, in July 2016 Apple experienced the highest number of iPhone switchers in its history. Dediu also mentioned that the market was close to saturating and, therefore, Apple should have the goal of capturing more people who are switching from the Android platform devices to the iOS ecosystem. Apple has been able to achieve this goal with its Macs. The analyst further shared that products from Apple such as the AirPods, Apple Watch, Pencil and some wearables were representative of a future where the company's smartphone was the hub for a string of personal devices.  What sets Apple apart from the competition per Dediu is that it is able to seamlessly integrate its devices.

A Korean report at that time claimed that the Galaxy S8 would be the first Samsung smartphone to introduce a dual lens camera like Apple's iPhone 7 Plus. While Samsung may still introduce such a camera for the S8, a new report has surfaced stating that Samsung will pass on this feature until the Note8 or next year's S9 model. The reason for the delay may be due to Samsung recently investing in Israeli firm Core Photonics.   The Korean business report notes that "Samsung's interest in dual lens cameras is growing day by day. Samsung Venture Investment Corp. has invested in Core Photonics, an Israeli dual-camera manufacturer, while Samsung Electronics has applied for patents on dual camera technologies in succession. The next Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphone, which is scheduled to go on sale in the first half of this year, will allegedly not come with a dual lens camera setup. However, models after that are expected to be equipped with a dual camera.   According to industry sources on January 12, Samsung Venture Investment, Foxconn, the biggest assembler of Apple, and Taiwanese chip designer MediaTek have invested a total of US$15 million (17.69 billion won) in Core Photonics.   Core Photonics is the leading vendor of smartphone dual camera imaging technologies and has collaborated with Qualcomm. To date, the company has raised about US$50 million (58.98 billion won) since its foundation in 2012. Core Photonics plans to use the latest investment as a stepping stone to develop dual cameras for next-generation smartphones and tap into the action camera market.   As a dual lens camera has been embedded in the Apple iPhone 7 Plus and the LG V20, it is becoming standard equipment of premium smartphones. A dual camera phone refers to a smartphone which has dual cameras on the rear. It is a type of camera with two or more lenses with a separate image sensor or film frame for each lens. It makes the picture more vivid and detailed and the color more accurate, compared to a single lens camera.   Such cameras could also allow the camera to simulate human binocular vision, and therefore gives it the ability to capture three-dimensional images. This is why a dual camera is considered essential equipment to introduce augmented reality (AR).   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro laptops with Touch Bar. Image: Lili Sams/Mashable By Stan Schroeder2017-01-13 12:53:00 UTC After Apple released a fix for the battery issue that caused Consumer Reports' MacBook battery tests to go crazy, the organization now recommends Apple's 2016 MacBook Pros — just like all MacBooks that came before them.  The issue originally caused CR not to recommend Apple's new MacBook Pros after it tested them in December. Known for rigorous testing standards, CR found the battery life on all new MacBook Pros wildly erratic, ranging from 3.75 to 16 hours on one model.  SEE ALSO: Apple responds to damning MacBook Pro battery test As it turned out, the problem was a combination of two factors: an icon-reloading bug in Safari, which Apple has now fixed, and the fact that CR turns off browser cache for its battery test, which — according to Apple — is unconventional and does not reflect actual real-life usage.  After re-doing the battery tests, CR concluded that the issue no longer exists.  The average battery life in CR's testing are now actually quite spectacular — 15.75 hours for the 13-inch Pro with a Touch Bar; 18.75 hours for the 13-inch pro without a Touch Bar,  and 17.25 hours for the 15-inch Pro with a Touch Bar.  "With the updated software, the three MacBook Pros in our labs all performed well, with one model running 18.75 hours on a charge," the organization wrote in a blog post Thursday. With the battery life issue all fixed now, CR says, all three of Apple's new MacBook Pros fall "well within the recommended range in Consumer Reports ratings." CR's original findings caused a lot of interest as they followed a number of user reports that the battery life on the new MacBook Pros is far below Apple's promised 10 hours. These prompted Apple to remove the "time remaining" estimate from the battery drop down menu in the menu bar.  In Mashable's testing, the new MacBook Pros performed well, with battery life being just as good or better than Apple promises.  BONUS: This device fixes the worst thing about the new MacBook Pro Topics: Apple, consumer reports, Gadgets, Macbook Pro, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple has significantly increased its maximum file size for Apple TV apps and games. The company previously capped tvOS developers at just 200MB, but it is now accepting submissions up to 4GB in size — a massive 20x increase. Apple says it is making this change so that developers “can include more media in your submission and provide a complete, rich user experience upon installation.” It should benefit games in particular, allowing better visuals, bigger worlds, and more content. But that’s not all it could lead to. As some developers have noted, one thing that requires bigger assets and more space is 4K content. This could be a step Apple is taking to pave the way for a new Apple TV that will finally support super-sharp 4K TVs. It might not mean that; Apple could be increasing its limits for tvOS apps just because it can. But with 4K TVs getting cheaper and more popular, and rival boxes like the Amazon Fire TV and Chromecast Ultra offering 4K, it seems plausible Apple is looking to catch up. Apple TV developers have been able to create apps and games that require more than 200MB of content, but until now, additional assets had to be stored in Apple’s cloud using a feature called “On-Demand Resources,” which allows for up to 20GB. Developers can still take advantage of that, but with the option to add more content into the app package itself, they can improve loading times and reduce the reliance on speedy internet connections — which not every Apple TV owner has.

More like this Here's how the MacBook Pro stacks up against the PC Surface Book i7 vs. MacBook Pro: Fight! Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro: Is it worth buying? Video Reality check: Apple Watch vs. Pebble Time (vs. no smartwatch at all) Apple is used to criticism from PC partisans, but with its first major redesign to the MacBook Pro line in years, it found itself unexpectedly taking fire from its own fan base. The new laptop was underpowered, Mac users complained, lacked ports that people actually use, had low-to-zero serviceability, and that “improved” butterfly keyboard still wasn’t that great.  The point that seems to uniformly burn pro users is the maximum amount of RAM: just 16GB of LPDD3/2133. The reason for the limit? Apple said it saves power, which lets them make the MacBook Pro thinner. I won’t pass judgment on that decision (though I think PC makers are also too concerned with thin sometimes), but I will say there’s a pretty easy way Apple could satisfy its unhappy performance-minded customers: Bring back the MacBook Pro 17. Yes, Apple once sold a giant 17-inch MacBook Pro, which it discontinued in 2012. Five years on, it's even easier to build a powerful laptop than it was back then. Bringing back an unapologetically big, beefy MacBook Pro 17 could be just what Apple needs to make its laptops great again. Here's what we'd put in it. AMD Could a Ryzen make its way into a future MacBook Pro? Quad-core or more The Macbook Pro 17 should have a high-end Intel or AMD-Ryzen-based quad-core at a minimum. People say CPU performance doesn’t matter, but it does. The crowd that would actually buy and use a portable workstation needs to get work done. This means a quad-core or more. While it wouldn’t be a first—PCs have sporadically been available with six-core CPUs for years—Apple could cause much jealousy if it scored access to a low-power version of a next-gen Intel or AMD CPU with more than four cores. Big, fat GPU I think people looking at the MacBook Pro 15 should pony up for the higher-end Radeon Pro 460, because the entry-level GPU is a bit underwhelming on pure horsepower. Yes, it’s great on power consumption, but more performance on a primarily performance-minded laptop is generally better. For the MacBook Pro 17, Apple should look into a higher-wattage GPU that gets it into the GTX 1070 class. That doesn’t mean Nvidia-only, as AMD is expected to launch its next-gen Vega GPUs this year. The point is to go for the gusto with a hotter, more powerful chip. A fat GPU isn’t just about gaming: GPUs today handle video encoding and a spate of compute-based tasks. Giving up some thinness or battery life to accommodate a faster GPU would pay real dividends. Crucial Using standard DDR4 SO-DIMM modules would cost battery life, but at least allow a MacBook Pro to hit 32GB or more. Load up on RAM Apple’s decision to use LPDDR3 rather than DDR4 was driven by the company’s decision to make it thin. The company says it did it to save power, because LPDDR3 uses less than plain old DDR4. Apple could have used DDR4 like everyone else, however, and just put in a larger battery to accommodate it. An added bonus: more RAM. The largest LPDDR3 RAM modules that work with Skylake CPUs (such as in the MacBook Pro) accommodate just 8GB of RAM, while those for DDR4 can take up to 16GB. Had Apple gone with DDR4, its two RAM modules could have given users a nice 32GB of memory. To be fair to Apple, no previous MacBook Pro has hit the 32GB mark either, but clearly the backlash says customers want more. The cost, on paper anyway, doesn’t look that bad: While LPDDR3 has a sizable advantage in standby power consumption, active use shouldn’t cost more than 5 percent to 10 percent, according to Intel. Either way, it’s clear that Apple’s customers want a laptop that offers at least 32GB. Storage is great, but... One area you can’t kick Apple for is storage performance. The company makes its own SSD controllers and they cook, with OS X-based storage benchmarks posting 3GBps reads and 2GBps write range. If we were to be downers, though, we’d say NVMe PCIe M.2 drives offer similar performance, and they work on an industry standard. The one improvement we’d ask from Apple is to follow industry standards on the MacBook Pro 17. Oh, and because the chassis will be larger—offer the option of two M.2 drives, and maybe even a 2.5-inch drive for bulk magnetic storage. IDG iFixit says you can fix the trackpad, but the rest of the MacBook Pro 15 is a lost cause. Repairability is green computing I’m not sure, but I think iFixit gave the new MacBook Pro 15 a negative-1 in serviceability. OK, I’m kidding, but iFixit did give it a 1, which might as well be a negative-1. Not only is the RAM soldered to the motherboard (which has been the norm for superthin Ultrabooks for some time), but Apple has now chosen to weld the SSD’s chips to the motherboard too. While some don’t think that’s a big deal, consider that the GPU, CPU, RAM, and NAND are all mounted to the same board. If any of those items failed, you’d be looking at replacing all four. In warranty, that’s not a big deal. Out of warranty, you might as well throw it away. The most green policy Apple could adopt is to offer upgrade- and repair-friendly designs rather than pursue thin, disposable designs. That means following industry standards as much as possible. Adam Miller More ports would be great on any future MacBook Pro. Many ports in a storm One weakness of the MacBook Pro 15 is clearly the number of ports, and further, the lack of port diversity. The laptop gives you four USB Type C / Thunderbolt 3. Period. With the AC adapter in one port and an external monitor in another, you have two ports left. Plug in your Logitech adapter for a mouse and keyboard, and you now have one port left. Plug in a gigabit ethernet adapter, and you’re done. You now have to constantly pull devices to plug in a card reader or USB thumb drive. And you’ll need dongles for sure. USB Type C is great, but it ain’t that great yet. Apple may be showing more of that courage by dropping USB Type A, but it’s an overreach. So please, Apple: On the MacBook Pro 17, give everyone a couple more ports, and the diversity of port selection that the MacBook Pro line has always been known for. A big battery In its pursuit of thin, Apple actually reduced the size of the battery in the MacBook Pro 15 from the previous model’s by almost 25 percent. The good news—and something Apple doesn’t really get enough credit for—is the company managed to keep battery life rather good for a quad-core, 15-inch laptop, with 9 hours of video run time. But here’s the thing: A bigger battery means more run time. Would a quarter of a pound really have killed MacBook Pro 15 users? Who knows—but on the MacBook Pro 17, it’s about performance and battery life, so go all the way and drop in the maximum 99.5 watt-hour gas tank. IDG Apple’s Butterfly key design isn’t as good as the design of previous keyboards. A real Apple keyboard The last feature Apple should put in the MacBook Pro 17 is a real Apple keyboard. You know, the kind of keyboard that let every MacBook user say with an air of superiority why Macs are so much better than PCs. With the newest MacBook Pros, PC laptop users don’t hear that bragging anymore. Instead you hear, “well, you get used to it,” or “I know it’s hard to believe, but I actually like it. No seriously, I do.” That’s quite a turnaround. For the MacBook Pro 17 to make Mac laptops great again, the company needs to return to the real Apple keyboard.

DailyCaller The DC Home Politics US World Entertainment Sports Business Opinion Guns and Gear Deals Issues Blogs Send a Tip Columnists Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash Matt Lewis The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas           DailyCaller   Search:     Home Politics US World Entertainment Sports Business Opinion Guns and Gear Deals Issues Defense Education Energy Blogs The Mirror Matt Lewis DC Trawler Send a Tip Tech ‘First Billionaire In Hip Hop’ Dr. Dre Celebrates Beats Headphones Sale To Apple [VIDEO] Giuseppe Macri Tech Editor Giuseppe Macri12:20 PM 05/09/2014      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 4183535 After news broke late Thursday that Apple is working on a $3.2 billion deal to buy Beats Electronics, the developer behind the popular headphones of the same name, company co-founder and hip hop producer Dr. Dre, appeared in a video online and declared himself “the first billionaire in hip hop.” Actor Tyrese Gibson was apparently celebrating with Dre in the producer’s studio following the reports, and posted the video to his Facebook page. “They need to update the Forbes list,” Gibson said in the video referencing the magazine’s list of the world’s richest people, and described Dre as having joined the “billionaire boys club.” “In a big way — understand that,” Dre followed up. “The first billionaire in hip hop.” Though the expletive-rich video appears to show Dre celebrating the deal, he doesn’t explicitly reference or confirm the news. The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Why then have these solutions been overlooked and not received the traction they deserve? Well, mobile wallet has a branding problem. I mention mobile wallet here, and so feel compelled to explain just what I mean by "mobile wallet" -- which is the first problem. When the average person thinks of a mobile wallet, the image of the tradition leather-bound billfold comes to mind. Most people envision mobile wallet as their phone replacing the functionality their physical wallet provides, primarily with payments. With so many mobile payment solutions and initiatives driven by massive tech and retail giants, it is hard to not focus on payments. However, the mobile wallet we're talking about is the one that launched when Apple introduced Passbook in 2012. This mobile wallet is the loyalty/gift card, tickets and coupon solution that allow a brand to create a living, breathing relationship with a consumer after they add a "pass" to their wallet. With a pass installed, brands can push updates to consumers and trigger messages based on any data in their profile, most importantly real-time location. Brands and consumers can eliminate those plastic loyalty or gift cards in their physical wallet or key rings, and clipped paper/email coupons. All of these will be carefully organized and filed in your wallet app, natively. Let me be clear, this is one native app on your phone where you, the consumer, decides what brand content you want to capture. Once you tell the brand you want their content, they've earned the right to send you updates where or when applicable. If the brand abuses that right, the consumer simply deletes the pass with the touch of a button. Google slowly but surely caught up to Apple, and others like WeChat and AliPay have joined the mobile wallet fray. Unfortunately, that pesky word "pay" crept into the conversation when Apple re-branded their passbook "Apple Pay" and Android quickly followed suit with its Android Pay. The growing acceptance and popularity of mobile payments is, however, creating a unique opportunity for marketers to link transaction and engagement. Marketers can alert customers of sales, provide information, and accept payments without users ever having to download an app. Creating a seamless path for brands to engage and transact over this channel is critical to success. It seems like a no-brainer that with the maturity of the mobile payments market this solution would take off, but hesitation remains in the U.S. market, and here's why. First, the average consumer probably doesn't know the difference between mobile wallet and mobile payments, as they are being lumped together by vendors promoting the solutions. What's worse, buyers at brands are looking for two very different solutions. One is a marketing sell; the other is an operational/IT sell. So 75% of the marketing on either side is being lost in translation, since no one knows which vendor pitch to pay attention to. Second, brands are still app crazy! The C-suite is, and has been, demanding marketers build apps without a real plan. Before they know it, they've spent $500,000 or $1 million and are nowhere near the number of downloads or transactions to justify that investment. A gloomy cloud now exists over mobile investments, with brands knowing they need to invest but terrified about where to allocate those funds. How can we overcome these challenges? A good place to start would be an open discussion between mobile marketing wallet providers and marketers. Thought leaders in the mobile space must come together to specifically define what a marketing mobile wallet is, and then rebrand or reposition their messaging to reflect that. Everyone seems comfortable with calling the content a "Pass," so what if we on the marketing side simply ditched the term "Wallet"? If wallet providers can't agree on exactly what the platform is for, how will consumers ever understand? A well-defined stance on mobile wallet will also help marketers and brands understand why they should, or shouldn't, create an app or wallet card, and prevent a lot of misplaced investment. Let's start by admitting we have created confusion, and then shine a light on wallet marketing's functionality, which is getting lost in the noise.

By Sarmistha Acharya January 13, 2017 12:51 GMT Close iPhone 7 review: Return of the king or time to hand over the crown? IBTimes UK A US appeals court has ruled that buyers of iPhone apps may sue Apple over allegations of monopolising the market by not allowing them to buy apps outside its App Store. The ruling from the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals revives the case that was originally filed in 2012 targeting Apple's practice of allowing iPhones to run apps from its App Store only. Back then a group of iPhone users sued Apple pointing to its alleged anticompetitive practice, according to a Reuters report. Apple argued that users purchased apps from developers who pay a cut of their revenue to the company for their right to sell apps in the App Store. Judge William A Flethcher ruled users purchase apps from Apple, which gives them the right to file lawsuits against the company. "The obvious solution is to compel Apple to let people shop for applications wherever they want, which would open the market and help lower prices," Mark C Rifkin, an attorney with Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz representing the group of iPhone users, told Reuters. iPhone users may sue Apple for its alleged anticompetitive practices in apps market Apple "The other alternative is for Apple to pay people damages for the higher than competitive prices they've had to pay historically because Apple has utilised its monopoly," added Rifkin. The App Store is a major source of revenue for Apple, which reported record-breaking sales during the 2015 Christmas season, with users spending $1.1bn (£752m) in the two weeks that ended on 3 January, 2016. The company said New Year's Day was the biggest day for the App Store with customers spending more than $144m (£99m).

Lattner, who was Apple’s head of developer tools and widely respected as the voice of developers within the company, left the company after more than a decade to lead Tesla’s Autopilot software efforts … Business Insider reports that Lattner had found Apple’s extreme approach to secrecy wearing, especially as his role was to create open-source developer tools, including Swift. “He always felt constrained at Apple in terms of what he could discuss publicly — resorting to off-the-record chats, surprise presentations, and the like,” [a friend] told us. “Similarly, I know he was constrained in recruiting and other areas. Eventually I know that can really wear people down.” The conflict between Apple’s tight-lipped approach to secrecy and the desire of developers and researchers to be open with their peers outside the company has caused issues before. Academics said back in October that Apple’s ‘off the scale’ approach to secrecy was one of the reasons behind the high-profile problems with Apple Maps, as the company’s researchers were cut off from other work being done in the field. Fear of being isolated from the wider scientific community was also said to be hampering Apple’s hiring efforts within the AI field, a claim the company seemingly acknowledged a couple of months later when it announced that it’s AI researchers would, after all, be allowed to publish papers on their work. The first such published paper appeared shortly after the announcement. BI also pointed to an incident in 2015 when Apple’s entire networking team quit over Apple’s refusal to allow them to participate in an industry-wide network security forum known as the Open Compute Product. The resignations led to Apple changing its mind and joining the OCP. Keeping even very general roadmaps secret from customers can also cause frustration when trying to plan ahead. Swift 4 is currently in development under the leadership of Ted Kremenek, with details expected to be announced at next year’s WWDC. Swift 3.1 will be released ahead of this, sometime in Spring.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on Thursday reversed a decision by a lower court and ruled that the app buyers filing the lawsuit are direct purchasers of iPhone apps from Apple, rather than from app developers, and hence have standing to sue. Apple was a distributor of iPhone apps, selling them directly to buyers through its App Store, according to the court. The proposed class-action lawsuit started in 2011 with the complaint changing several times. The purchasers object to the 30 percent "surcharge" that they pay to Apple. The company collects 30 percent of the revenue of third-party apps on its store, with the balance going to the developer, in a closed system in which Apple controls which apps can run on an iPhone, according to court records. Apple had argued that it does not sell apps but “software distribution services to developers,” and hence cannot simultaneously be a distributor of apps to app purchasers, Circuit Judge William Fletcher wrote for the unanimous panel. Apple’s description of its role as that similar to the owner of a shopping mall that leases physical space to stores was “unconvincing,” as third-party developers of iPhone apps do not have their own stores, he added. The courts have yet to address the complaints of the app purchasers, who allege that Apple prohibits app developers from selling iPhone apps through channels other than the App Store, threatening to cut off sales by any developer who violates this rule, according to court records. Apple is also said to discourage iPhone owners from downloading unapproved apps, threatening to make iPhone warranties void if they do so. Apple did not immediately comment on the decision. The suit covers purchases of apps from 2007 to 2013 but the Bloomberg news service quoted Mark Rifkin, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, as saying that he may try to extend the proposed class-action suit to include purchasers who have bought apps for the iPhone up to the present. Apple is being sued for damages and the court is being asked to order the company to change its app store rules.

Even if you saw it, it may not have made much sense. Chris Lattner is leaving Apple for Tesla? Chris who? Lattner doesn’t enjoy the name recognition of a Tim Cook or a Jony Ive. But he’s a rock star among software engineers. As the guy who built Swift, Apple’s iPhone-centric programming language, he’s one of those coders that other coders put on a pedestal. He personifies Silicon Valley’s relentless push toward technology capable of changing the world. Tesla is not just building a car. It’s building an entirely new kind of computer. Now, he’s moving on, becoming the head of software engineering for Autopilot, the technology that’s transforming Tesla’s electric vehicles into autonomous vehicles. Apple’s innovation machine is losing another key cog to a company that has lured so many others away from the House That Jobs Built. And that provides an obvious storyline for the tech press and so many other Silicon Valley watchers: Tesla is the new Apple. In many ways, the story is true. Apple vice president of Mac engineering Doug Field, director of alloy engineering Rich Heley, and MacBook Air engineer Matt Casebolt are among those who’ve left Cupertino for Tesla. But the truth goes deeper than that. Sure, Tesla is snagging some of Apple’s mojo, becoming a defining symbol of Silicon Valley innovation. “Apple is stuck in the world of phones and watches,” the argument goes, “while Tesla is well down the path to self-driving cars, for Jobs’ sake!” Look beyond the A-list talent and sexy public image, though, and you’ll see that Tesla is mimicking Apple (and Google and Amazon and Facebook) in a more meaningful way. Lattner’s arrival is just the latest evidence of this. Like those other tech giants, Tesla is not just building new products. It’s building them from entirely new parts, remaking them from top to bottom. Apple did this with phones. Now, Tesla is doing it with cars—and with computers, too. Extreme Engineering Google didn’t just build a new search engine. It built a new kind of global computer capable of running that search engine at unprecedented scale, fashioning everything from the software to the servers to the network switches to the data centers. That’s what made Google so successful: It could serve far more people, far more quickly than anyone else. Facebook and Amazon soon followed suit. In similar fashion, Apple didn’t just build the iPhone. It built so many of the individual parts inside the iPhone, including the microprocessor at the heart of this iconic device. That allowed the company to not only build a phone no one else could, but do it with unprecedented speed and efficiency. Tesla knows that autonomous vehicles require the same kind of extreme engineering. Tesla is not just building a car, it’s building an entirely new kind of computer. Today, computers are designed to send data into the world. Autonomous vehicles require computers that can draw data from the world and use it to understand what’s happening around it. That is a very different kind of computer, and it hasn’t yet been built—not to the degree that anyone can be sure it will work with unerring accuracy and safety. Chris Lattner DANILO AGUTOLI Fundamentals Tesla hired Lattner because he has a history of building enormously complex, enormously successful software projects. As his PhD advisor, Vikram Adve, points out, Swift is just one example of this. Before that, Lattner built two other software projects on a similar scale: LLVM and Clang. Never heard of those? Then you’re not a software engineer. These are foundational tools at both Apple and Google, underpinning everything that happens on the iPhone and on every Google online service. “Chris is really good at managing and running a large software project, with very high quality, attracting really good programmers, and getting results,” says Adve, a computer science professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Lattner did not respond to my request for an interview. But his previous work is telling not just because it was so successful, but because it was foundational. LLVM and Clang are software tools that engineers use to build other software—and build it at the most fundamental level, the level where it talks to the hardware. Tesla needs people like Lattner in part because it has split with Mobileye, the Israeli company that makes the image recognition system currently underpinning Autopilot. It must build a whole new system, apparently around GPU chips from nVidia, the graphics processing chips that now do double-duty at the heart of many artificially intelligent systems, And Lattner is the kind of engineer who can lead the development of this system. Not to mention: the foundational software that drives nVidia GPUs is based on LLVM. Related Video Elon Musk Says Every New Tesla Will Drive Itself But it’s not just the Lattner hire that shows how deep Tesla could go in building its own technology. While Lattner will run the software side, the head of hardware engineering for Autopilot is Jim Keller, the former Apple chip designer who helped build many of the microprocessors that went into the world’s iPhones. (Several of Keller’s old colleagues are now also working for Tesla.) Tesla has the key talent needed to build its own AI technology from top to bottom. And it may have to. Mobileye is off the table, and it’s still unclear whether GPUs are the future of autonomous vehicles. Mobileye apparently dumped Tesla for moving too fast down the road to self-driving cars, but Tesla has no intention of slowing down. No one outside of Tesla knows whether Tesla is building an AI chip. But hiring Keller suggests that it will. And if it does, it will need people like Lattner to build the low-level software that can drive those chips. Fundamentally, LLVM is a tool for building software that could run on any piece of hardware. It lets you readily target the chips you want to target, says Todd Mostak, the CEO of MapD, a company that uses LLVM to build database software for multiple processors.

Now It’s Slowing Apple Down The world is already headed toward a new kind of AI chip. Last year, Google revealed that it built one called the Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU, and commercial chip makers like nVidia and Intel are building dedicate AI chips as well. Such chips are needed to serve the demands of the neural networks and other techniques behind so many of the AI-driven services moving into the market, from image and speech recognition to the nerve centers that drive autonomous cars. Tesla could get this technology elsewhere, but its ambition is often far more extreme. After all, it’s already building its own batteries in its own factory. Building your own stuff lets you do things no one else can do, at a scale and cost no one else can achieve. That’s where the real advantage comes. So, yes, Tesla hired Chris Lattner because it wants to be more like Apple. But it also hired him because it wants to be something very different. Go Back to Top.

Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations TechEye Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations Menu Apple faces another antitrust case Posted on January 13, 2017 by Nick Farrell - News A US appeals court has allowed phone app purchasers to sue the fruity-cargo cult Apple over allegations that the company monopolised the market for iPhone apps by not allowing users to purchase them outside the App Store. Apple has form for playing monopoly but it had thought that this case would have gone away. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling dug up a long-simmering legal challenge originally filed in 2012 taking aim at Apple’s practice of only allowing iPhones to run apps purchased from its own App Store. A group of iPhone users sued saying Jobs’ Mob’s practice was anti competitive and meant prices were too high Apple’s mighty briefs claimed that users did not have standing to sue it because they purchased apps from developers, with Apple simply renting out space to those developers. Developers pay a cut of their revenues to Apple in exchange for the right to sell in the App Store. A lower court agreed with Apple, but Judge William Fletcher ruled that iPhone users purchase apps directly from Apple, which gives iPhone users the right to bring a legal challenge against Apple. The Tame Apple Press insists that Apple is safe because the case has not really got to court yet as the wrangling has been over whether they have the right to sue Apple in the first place. However if the challenge does succeed Apple will be forced to let people shop for applications wherever they want, which would open the market and help lower prices.

For the uninitiated, IP stands for ingress protection. An IP68 protection basically means that device can be submerged in 1.5 metres of water for 30 minutes. Smartphone makers such as Samsung use a special nanocoating on their devices that does not let water get in, even through open ports such as the 3.5mm jack on the Galaxy S7. IP68 is currently the highest certification given to smartphones. While Samsung was expected make its next-gen flagship waterproof, the iPhone 8 would be the first Apple flagship smartphone to have this feature. Although even the iPhone 7 was water-resistant, not waterproof. “Apple’s iPhone 8 will feature the IP68 rating protection as part of drastic upgrades marking the 10th anniversary of the iPhone this year,” the Investor cited an anonymous industry source as saying. Apple’s certification might be a special feature limited to just the iPhone and not other Apple models, but Samsung is expected to extend IP68 certification across its range of devices and not just keep it limited to its flagship device. Related Stories Samsung Galaxy S8 vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 Apple iPhone 8 vs. Samsung Galaxy S8 Samsung recently unveiled the new A-series devices — the 2017 edition A3, A5 and A7 smartphones, which were all IP68 certified. “Samsung is considering water protection even for the cheapest J series phones as they are the best-selling Galaxy phones,” the Investor report cited another source as saying. Besides Apple and Samsung, other smartphone manufacturers are also trying their hands at IP68 certification. The LG G6, expected to release at MWC 2017 is expected to waterproof. Waterproofing materials for smartphones are currently manufactured by two major companies — the U.S.-based 3M and the South Korean NDFOS.

Earlier we heard that the Galaxy S8 is expected to come with a pressure sensitive display - similar to Apple's 3D Touch - and now a fresh leak hints that the Galaxy S8 will come in two variants. The new Samsung Galaxy S8 series smartphones will reportedly come in two display sizes - 5.7-inch and 6.2-inch - and the larger one will be called the Galaxy S8 Plus. Furthermore, the Samsung flagship will let go of the Home Button, another feature that is heavily rumoured for the iPhone 8. A report from Korea (first spotted by Android Soul) claims that the prototypes of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus have been made, and the units have been sent to the CEO and Vice Chairman for approval. The Galaxy S8 has a single camera setup at the back because the tech was too costly to feature in the base model, but the larger Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus model dons the dual camera setup at the back - a first in the Samsung smartphone range, but similar to what we say with iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. There's a lot of pressure on Samsung to get the Galaxy S8 flagship right, given its last year's misjudgment. In its rush to beat Apple, Samsung released Galaxy Note 7 sooner than its usual release cycle and paid heavily for it in the form of exploding battery problems. The company has reportedly set a goal to ship 60 million Galaxy S8 units this year, much higher than the shipments of the last three years. Apart from the abovementioned features, Samsung is expected to remove the headphone jack from the Galaxy S8, once again, similar to the latest iPhone models. The Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus will reportedly not debut at MWC, and will instead be launched sometime in mid-April.

This would make it 0.05secs faster than Faraday Future's claimed acceleration figures for its FF 91 SUV, which debuted at last week's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.  Promising early results from the Ludricrous Easter egg. Looks like 0 to 60 mph in 2.34 sec (Motor Trend spec) might be achievable... — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 12, 2017 The new update, dubbed "Ludicrous Plus", is expected to add an "extra 33bhp" to P100D's variants, says AutoExpress, although owners are warned the extra performance "accelerates wear on the motor, gearbox and battery".  The news comes following personnel changes at the all-electric car company, with Musk bolstering his line-up at the top with the appointment of several former Apple executives, most notably Chris Lattner, the Swift programming language to bolster its lineup.  Lattner, the new vice president of Tesla's Autopilot driverless division, is expected to assist with the monthly software updates that bring new autonomous features to the Model S and X range.  Tesla hires second Apple executive in two days 12 January Tesla has enticed another Apple executive to join its workforce, with designer Matt Casebolt jumping ship a day after former Swift project leader Chris Lattner was named vice president of the firm's Autopilot software. According to 9to5Mac, Casebolt is Elon Musk's new senior "director of engineering, closures and mechanisms".  During his time with the tech giant, he has been involved with the design and development of some of the firm's "most iconic models over the past decade" - the Mac Pro, the original MacBook Air and the controversial new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the site reports.  Tesla has acquired several new high-ranking members of staff over the last few months. As well as Casebolt and Lattner, the company last month appointed Anders Bell, former head of interiors at Volvo, to improve its "terrible" cabin quality, says ArsTechnica. This could lead to Tesla morphing into a new version of Apple, says Business Insider UK. Its strategy of "bringing in top-end talent" and "controlling both the design and manufacture of its products" are all methods used by the Cupertino-based company in the past.  Tesla's next car, the entry-level Model 3, is expected to hit the roads towards the end of the year and while the new workers may not be directly involved with the launch, it is expected they will contribute towards future software updates and design facelifts.  Tesla recurits Apple senior director Chris Lattner 11 January Tesla has announced the appointment of Chris Lattner, Apple's director of developer tools, as vice president of its Autopilot software division. Lattner, who was with the Cupertino-based tech giant for 11 years, is noted for creating Apple's Swift open-source programming language, which allows users to build apps on both iOS and macOS platforms.                                He takes over from Jinnah Hosein, vice president of software at SpaceX, who had been serving a dual role at Elon Musk's company and will now return to Tesla's space programme.  Musk has previously claimed Apple is the "Tesla graveyard", where its ex-employees go when they "don't make it" at the firm, reports Ars Technica.  Tesla's first Autopilot update goes live this week, introducing new driverless modes to Model S and X vehicles, including auto lane change and auto steer, with more features added on a monthly basis. The company aims to make its vehicles fully autonomous "as early as this year", says Ars Technica. Announcing his move, Lattner revealed Apple developer Ted Kremenek will now take over as Swift project leader, something the new Tesla man says will neither see a "change to the structure" nor "impact day-to-day operations" within the sub-division. Tesla to penalise Supercharger idlers 21 December Tesla has announced plans to charge idle users of its Supercharger stations in an attempt to increase availability of the battery docking stations.  Fees of 30p per minute will incur immediately after a customer's car has been fully charged, although this will be waived if the owner returns within five minutes. There's no upper limit to the fee, so idlers could receive a large penalty if their vehicles are docked for long periods of time. Owners can monitor the status of the charging cycle using a Tesla app, which will also alert them if any idle fee has been imposed.  The penalty only applies to the Model S and X ranges, which get free charging. Model 3 owners, whose cars will be the cheapest Tesla to date, are expected to pay for access to the Supercharger when they start hitting the road next year.  ArsTechnica says Tesla plans to "double the number of Superchargers by the end of 2017" and increase the amount of the lower-speed Destination chargers. However, it warns, these charging stations will become "a much scarcer resource" once Model 3 orders are fulfilled.  Tesla is also expected to release its first of several updates imminently, activating features such as auto steer and auto lane change. Further updates will be rolled out once a month following December's software release, says chief executive Elon Musk.  Tesla to launch autopilot update in three weeks 28 November Tesla's autopilot and performance update will launch in three weeks' time, chief executive Elon Musk revealed. The update will arrive in "about three weeks and it will get rolled out incrementally in monthly releases", he tweeted, replying to a follower curious as to why their new Model S didn't have features such as auto steer and auto lane change enabled. @edwardsanchez about three weeks and it will get rolled out incrementally in monthly releases — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 27, 2016 The incremental upgrades will gradually introduce autonomous options to Tesla models that "are now being made with the new hardware" but do not have the features activated as "promised", Auto Express reports. Footage of the enhanced autopilot mode surfaced in October, with The Verge saying the clip shows "a Tesla leaving the garage, driving across town and finding a parking spot - all autonomously". It is also believed the 8.1 update will introduce a small performance upgrade to the company's Model S and X range. Earlier this month, Musk said improved 0-60mph times would appear in a future update scheduled for a December release. Teslas to get performance boost in new software update 17 November Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has announced on Twitter that a software update due next month will improve 0-60mph and quarter-mile acceleration figures for the Model S and X. "Looks like the Model S P100D Easter egg will allow it to do 0 to 60mph in 2.4 sec and a 10.4 sec 1/4 mile via software update next month", he said. Musk also said the Model X figures "should also improve by 0.1 sec on 0 to 60 and 1/4 mile". The update means the Tesla Model S P100D will be faster to 60mph than a McLaren P1 and LaFerrari. In an earlier tweet, Musk indicated that the performance boost applies to the car's 'Ludicrous Mode', a hidden setting that increases the car's power output by around ten per cent. He also revealed that a problem users have experienced with selecting favourite radio stations will be rectified. This isn't the first update Tesla has released that increases performance figures. Last year, Teslarati reported that a 'Launch Mode' was added through Tesla's 7.0 firmware update, saying it boosted "immediate off-the-line acceleration". Tesla already building fully self-driving cars 20 October All new Tesla cars will be fitted with the hardware needed to be fully self-driving, chief executive Elon Musk revealed yesterday. Revealing the "unexpected" new product fans have been waiting for since last week, the businessman said the Model S and Model X are now being made with the new system in place. It will also go into the Model 3 when manufacturing begins. Autonomous cars will "play a crucial role in improving transportation safety", says a post on the company's website.  See related  The best new cars of 2017: Tesla, Land Rover and more Audi and Nvidia team up to produce AI-powered cars Faraday Future FF 91: All the details The hardware consists of eight cameras around the car's exterior, providing 360-degree visibility with a range of 820ft, 12 ultrasonic sensors, a forward-facing radar and an onboard supercomputer Tesla claims is 40 times more powerful than its current version. "This system provides a view of the world that a driver alone cannot access," says the carmaker.  Tesla claim the hardware, which cannot be retrofitted to current models, will eventually form a large step forward in self-driving technology.  The company's current Autopilot system is a Level 3 on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and SAE's ranking of autonomy levels. That means it can only be used on highways and the driver must remain alert and ready to intervene at all times. The new setup, however, could go straight to Level 5 in a few years, taking over all the driving tasks.  Cars with the new will run in "shadow mode" for now, allowing Tesla to both perfect the system and gather the information needed to convince lawmakers self-driving cars are safe. By monitoring the cars' performances, should any accidents occur, the company will be able to evaluate if they could have been prevented using the self-driving system. The BBC's Dave Lee says Musk's announcement is more "a statement of intent" than a technological leap. "What Tesla will gain by doing this, however, is a huge fleet of cars gathering data on the world's roads, something which could hasten the introduction of self-driving technology," he adds. Musk himself anticipates that will happen soon. The Wall Street Journal reports Tesla's boss wants to demonstrate a self-driving car in grand fashion by the end of next year - driving from New York to Los Angeles with no human input. Tesla's new software upgrade: What the reviewers think 23 September  In a sign of just how much the automobile industry is changing, the latest software upgrade to Tesla cars has been greeted with great excitement. Just a few years ago, the idea that new features could be released on an existing car was unthinkable. But last year, Elon Musk's electric car company abruptly gave existing Tesla drivers the ability to raise or lower their suspension at the touch of a button. Now the firm has upgraded its Autopilot feature with the release of its latest operating system, Tesla 8.0. Here's what the reviewers think. Autopilot is now 'more human' Tesla's cars are now "a little more human", says Bloomberg.  The older version of Autopilot was annoyingly pedantic, claims the news agency, sticking firmly to the centre of a lane even if the vehicle next to it was straying close to the edge. A human driver faced with this would steer a little to one side to avoid an unnervingly close encounter – but Autopilot didn't. Indeed, it might even stop the car rather than swerve round an obstacle. After the update, all of that is improved, says Bloomberg, adding the car "is beginning to act a little more human, adjusting its position in the lane to account for perceived threats from the sides". This is particularly useful in crowded urban places like New York, it continues, where drivers "treat lane markers like suggestions rather than rules".  However, if the car is now more human, Bloomberg feels it is also now more of a scold and says Tesla has instituted the "red hands of shame" – a series of warnings for drivers who are taking the whole autopilot concept too literally. Not touching the steering wheel for a certain amount of time, depending on road conditions and speed, triggers a series of alarms which if ignored will see Autopilot switched off for the rest of the journey. Improved entertainment system There are other changes too. "Importantly," says Bloomberg, the car has a "much improved entertainment system". Another new feature turns on the air conditioning automatically if the car overheats to protect children or animals in parked vehicles. Hack-proofing Announcing the release, Tesla revealed it had updated the software to cope with hacking attempts after a Chinese team were able to open the boot of a car as it was driven along – from a distance of 12 miles. According to the BBC's Dave Lee, the hack – by a team of researchers who immediately reported their success to Tesla – was "notable" for two reasons.  First, the team was able to control the car from a great distance. Second, they were able to take a remarkable amount of control away from the driver: "Brakes, windscreen wipers, all sorts." Elon Musk unveils Tesla's 'master plan' for the future 21 July Tesla's enigmatic frontman Elon Musk has unveiled the second part of his automotive division's "master plan", highlighting ambitions to deliver all-new vehicles and ownership models. The report comes ten years after Musk first published his blueprint for the company, in which he outlined his strategy to get the company off the ground by building three electric vehicles. These turned out to be the expensive Tesla Roadster sports car; the Model S family saloon, and the mass production Model 3, to be released in 2017. Part two includes more EVs, as well as changes to Tesla's structure and the continued rollout of self-driving technology. New home energy technologies Musk's master plan stresses the importance of turning Tesla into a vertically integrated company through the absorption of SolarCity, his solar energy business, allowing the Tesla name to branch out into new areas. Tesla already has the Powerwall, a domestic electricity generator, but Musk wants to create a "smoothly integrated and beautiful solar-roof-with-battery product" for the home of the future. He uses the product to defend the controversial decision to tie the two companies together – the BBC reports that many see the move as a bailout of the ailing SolarCity. All-new cars and more Of course, being a car company, you'd expect plans to build more. Alongside the Model 3, which will remain the company's cheapest car for now, Tesla plans to produce a smaller crossover SUV, to sit beneath the Model X, as well as a "new kind of pick-up truck". In addition to consumer vehicles, Tesla is looking at busses and lorries, both of which are in the early stages of development, although we could get our first glimpse next year. "We believe the Tesla Semi [truck] will deliver a substantial reduction in the cost of cargo transport, while increasing safety and making it really fun to operate," writes Musk. However, it is the company's plans for busses that are of real interest as the company has put self-driving technologies right at the heart of its mass-transit plans The technology, when it becomes legal and accessible, will see bus drivers become "fleet managers", says Musk, overseeing a squad of smaller, self-driving busses that can be summoned on-demand through a smartphone, picking passengers up and dropping them off door to door. Bus stops won't die just yet – they'll just become summon points. Self-driving technology Tesla has already rolled out beta versions of its Autopilot system, saying that even partial autonomy is safer than nothing. Full self-driving is reliant on Tesla cars doing real miles and commutes with the system. Musk predicts that worldwide regulatory approval will require around six billion miles of testing. At present, Tesla's research as a whole provides around three million miles a day. When the technology is ready, all Tesla vehicles will come with the hardware and software necessary to be completely autonomous and fail-safe. Musk says the software is key to this – technologies such as the cameras, radar and sonar systems Autopilot uses are much easier to perfect. The master plan promises drivers will be able to summon their Tesla from "pretty much anywhere" and do almost anything - within reason - behind the wheel. New ownership models Lastly, in a move many say is Tesla going after Uber, Musk writes that full vehicle autonomy will allow drivers to add their car to a fleet of shared ones and have it generate an income. The company also plans to prop up the fleet with its own EVs in towns and cities where there's more demand than owners willing to share. There's a lot to chew on in Musk's master plan, but Wired says that individually, none of its ambitions are particularly radical and are actually quite attainable. Many, if not all the major carmakers are now developing self-driving cars, it continues, with some also developing trucks, while the ownership model all but exists already. However, it adds, the scale of ambition is multiplied when all the parts of master plan "part deux" are tied together. "It's so crazy it's brilliant", concludes the site.

The macOS Sierra 10.12.3 update is available for download through the Apple Developer Center or through the software update mechanism in the Mac App Store. According to Apple's release notes, the 10.12.3 update "improves the stability, compatibility, and security of your Mac." No specific changes, bug fixes, or feature additions were discovered in the first two betas, but we'll update this post should any new features be found in the third beta. Oftentimes, with bug fixes, it's hard to tell what's included until Apple supplies detailed release notes with a release. The previous update, macOS 10.12.2, introduced several important bug fixes to resolve battery life issues, fix graphics problems, and more. Available since September, macOS Sierra is the latest Mac operating system. It includes Siri support, Apple Pay for the web, Universal Clipboard, Apple Watch auto unlocking, improved iCloud Drive integration, Picture-in-Picture multitasking, and dozens of smaller features that can be found in our macOS Sierra roundup. Update: The third public beta is also available.

Those who signed up to the Beta programme only have themselves to blame if their system is unstable.

A federal appeals court in San Francisco revived the proposed class-action lawsuit Thursday after a lower-court judge dismissed it. The three-judge panel concluded the judge erred in finding that the consumers lacked standing to sue as “direct purchasers” of apps. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the court’s decision. Consumers alleged in a complaint originally filed in 2011 that Apple violated U.S. antitrust law by requiring iPhone apps to be sold at Apple’s App Store and prohibiting third-party app developers from selling the software outside of it. Apple requires iPhone software developers to turn over 30 percent of what they charge for an app, increasing prices and excluding competitors from the iPhone “aftermarket” of apps, according to the suit. Read also: Apple removes app to find lost AirPods Mark Rifkin, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said Thursday that millions of consumers should be able to recover most of Apple’s 30 percent take from app store sales. He said that while the case hasn’t won class-action status yet, he may seek to expand the scope of the class to include everyone who has bought apps for iPhones to the present. Based on a provision in federal law that triples the damages awarded in antitrust cases, he estimated Apple’s exposure could reach hundreds of millions of dollars. Apple said in its defense that “it does not sell apps but rather sells software distribution services to developers,” according to the court’s decision. Apple cited a 1977 Supreme Court ruling that bars consumers from recovering damages from a company if it doesn’t directly sell its products to consumers. The appeals panel said Thursday the lower court erred in accepting this argument since iPhone users are direct consumers of content in the App store. “Apple’s analogy is unconvincing,” the court said. “In the case before us, third-party developers of iPhone apps do not have their own stores.” Bloomberg   Technology ANCWL calls for probe into theft of apartheid billions Zim's data tariffs saga takes nasty turn Blacks and Hispanic workers suffer more Cloudy outlook for US overtime rule Tariff increases at Cell C deemed 'insensitive and reckless' Most Read How Yahoo came up with its new name - Altaba A new Google Voice is coming soon When yoga meets Crossfit Apple in trouble over iPhone monopoly Peso traders want Twitter shut down Advertisement MORE business report technologyMenu Companies| Economy| Energy| Markets| Entrepreneurs| Technology| International| Careers| Opinion| Financial Tools| Events| business report technologyMenu Companies| Economy| Energy| Markets| Entrepreneurs| Technology| International| Careers| Opinion| Financial Tools| Events| INFO About IOL Front page Market indicators Movie guide Newspapers TV guide Weather SITES BabyNet.co.za Glamour.co.za GQ.co.za Ilisolezwe Isolezwe IOL Jobs IOL Property IOL Sportzone Loot.co.za Classifieds WomanOnline SECTIONS News Politics Business report Sport Motoring Entertainment Lifestyle Travel About IOL Front page Market indicators Movie guide Newspapers TV guide Weather

Apple Was World’s Most Innovative Company in 2016, BCG Survey Shows GO Apple topped the list for the 11th straight year Jan 13, 2017 11:05 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  US-based Boston Consulting Group (BCG) has released its list of the World’s 50 Most Innovative Companies in 2016. The consulting firm is the world’s leading advisor on business strategy and has been releasing such studies for 11 years now. BCG surveyed more than 1,500 senior innovation executives across multiple countries and industries each year since 2004. The study shows that Apple retained its top position for the 11th straight year, followed by Google this year. “Today’s most successful innovators strike a strategic balance between internal and external innovation. They are smart and efficient at scanning for external ideas - and deft at bringing them inside,” the report reads. This would mean that Apple, Google, Tesla Motors and Microsoft have managed to find that strategic balance and make innovation a key component in their business strategies. Apple spent big on R&D last year It’s no wonder that Apple managed to top the list again, considering that the company spent about $10 billion on research and development last year. The company may focus even more on innovation this year, since the upcoming iPhone 8 is said to bring some novelty features, and some estimate that it will become the best-selling iPhone in history. World's 50 Most Innovative Companies in 2016 Samsung Group only managed to rank 7th in the index, but spent more than Apple on R&D, about $13 billion. This study took other factors into consideration, not just the amount of money spent on research and development sectors. One of the companies that recorded the biggest jumps in this year’s survey is Facebook, which climbed 19 positions to the 9th spot. Out of all 50 companies included in the index, 34 are from the US, ten from Europe, while 6 are from Asia. Xiaomi and Huawei are the two companies from Asia that stood out, ranking 35th and 46th, respectively. Xiaomi did release a number of exciting gadgets last year, including the Mi Mix phone with bezel-less display. Huawei recorded a good year in 2016 with many launches of premium smartphones that incorporated innovative features.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (4 Images) #Apple#Samsung#Facebook#Huawei#Xiaomi subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it World's 50 Most Innovative Companies (4 Images) 01 02 03 04 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple to Record Historic iOS Revenue, Faces Lawsuit over iOS Apps Early Competing iPhone Prototypes Shown in Video Apple iPhone 8 to Feature iPhone 4-like Design with Stainless Steel Frame FBI Refuses to Say Who Hacked San Bernardino Terrorist’s iPhone It's Now Possible to Use openSUSE Inside Windows 10, Here's How to Install It Barnes & Noble Halts Sales of Nook Tablets Due to Faulty Chargers Android Co-Founder Andy Rubin Working on a Premium Bezel-less Smartphone Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Debian GNU/Linux 8.7 "Jessie" Live & Installable ISOs Now Available for Download - Exclusive Linus Torvalds Announces Fourth Linux 4.10 Kernel Release Candidate, Get It Now Debian Outs First Release Candidate of Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" Installer Sony G3112 and G3221 Smartphones Coming Soon with MediaTek Helio P20 CPUs 4 photos    Apple logo New Mac Apps Easy Books: Bookkeeping software that packs a collection of handy templates and presets to streamline the data entry, and analysis tools to evaluate costs, profit and loss Google Play Music Desktop Player: Desktop client for the Google Music service that offers you the possibility to listen to music without taking a serious strain on your system Squirrel: A simple yet very efficient finances management application that can record transactions, generate reports, create budgets and more. iCaching: An easy-to-use manager for GPX files that enables users to manage their collection of geocaches by simply dragging and dropping folders RemotePC: Access and control computers from a remote location, transfer files between the devices, and effortlessly record the connection sessions Swift: Open Source programming language developed and maintained by Apple that aims to provide a cleaner syntax that is easier write and read HandBrake: A free and easy to use application designed to help you quickly convert your DVD and CD media content into MP4 or MKV video files Reader comments Early Competing iPhone Prototypes Shown in Video more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

By Agamoni Ghosh January 13, 2017 10:10 GMT Apple is planning to dive into the entertainment industry by making its debut with original shows Reuters Apple, which has been contemplating entering the video streaming business, finally seems to have chalked out its path on what it wants to do. Reports suggest the tech giant is planning to make original content, mainly TV shows that will challenge the content of potential rivals Netflix and HBO. The iPhone maker has reportedly been in talks with veteran producers in recent months about buying rights to scripted television programmes. It has even discussed making movies, but that is rather preliminary at the moment. Apple seeks to rival quality shows like HBO's Westworld and Netflix's Stranger Things. The content planned is likely to be a part of Apple Music and the programming would be available to subscribers of the same, which currently has a $10-a-month (£8) subscription charge. The music streaming service of the company has been lagging behind the likes of Spotify for a while now. Adding TV-like content may help Apple draw more subscribers. Apple is already said to be actively pursuing Hollywood producers and have discussed the possibility of bringing out the first of these shows by the end of 2017 according to the Wall Street Journal. The company, however, is only targeting the niche content category and is not likely to invest millions of dollars like Netflix and HBO do for each show of theirs. For the last season of Game Of Thrones (Season 6), HBO is estimated to have spent somewhere between $6m and $10m. Earlier, Apple was also in talks with various networks including CBS to launch similar services, but they did not work out.

Leading Apple execs have spoken to producers in LA about producing original drama content in a “significant new business,” according to The Wall Street Journal, with plans to offer programming to customers by the end of the year. The streamer is already working in the unscripted space with Isn’t That Rich?, a series from singer will.i.am, ABC Studios and Propagate Content. The tech giant has also taken exclusive rights to James Corden’s format Carpool Karaoke. Apple is hoping the move can boost its offerings on its music streaming service Apple Music so it can compete with rival Spoitfy. The news also comes as sales of Apple’s iPhones and iPads begin to slow. WSG said Apple, which offers acquired content on a transactional basis, has not yet signed any deals for shows and plans are at an initial stage. US SVoD services Netflix and Amazon Prime Video lead the original content race with a host of original TV series and movies for global audiences. At Sunday’s Golden Globes awards ceremony, Netflix took home the coveted Best Drama Series award for its UK Original The Crown.

With the updated software, the three MacBook Pros in our labs all performed well, with one model running 18.75 hours on a charge. We tested each model multiple times using the new software, following the same protocol we apply to hundreds of laptops every year. We first evaluated the MacBook Pro laptops in December, and found that battery life results were highly inconsistent from one test to the next. (They ran anywhere from a low of 3.75 hours up to 19.5 hours between charges.) That led the laptops to receive low overall scores, despite strong showings in areas such as display quality and performance. The process we followed with Apple is the same process we follow with any manufacturer when we discover a significant problem. We shared our test results with the company so it could better understand our findings and deliver a fix to consumers. Since Apple made a fix, we retested the laptops. Now that we’ve factored in the new battery-life measurements, the laptops’ overall scores have risen, and all three machines now fall well within the recommended range in Consumer Reports ratings. The three MacBook Pros in our labs include two 13-inch models, one with Apple’s new Touch Bar and one without the Touch Bar; and a 15-inch model. (All 15-inch MacBook Pros come with the Touch Bar.) The new average battery-life results are, in order, 15.75 hours, 18.75 hours, and 17.25 hours. We bought the three computers at retail, as we do with other products rated by Consumer Reports, to ensure that we are testing the same models a consumer would buy. Apple’s updated software is available through Apple’s Beta Software Program now, and will be rolled out in a full Software Update to all users in several weeks. According to Apple, the new software fixes a bug in Safari that caused the poor battery-life results in Consumer Reports testing.   Consumers who want to download the new software right now have to sign up for the company’s Beta program. You can confirm you have the new version by clicking on About This Mac under the Apple menu; the operating system will be listed as macOS Sierra Version 10.12.3 Beta (16D25a).

Apple to Record Historic iOS Revenue, Faces Lawsuit over iOS Apps GO Good news and bad news for Apple in the past few days Jan 13, 2017 10:19 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Apple is close to generating $1 trillion in revenue from iOS-related products since the company announced its first iPhone device back in 2007. Apple’s total sales of iPhones and iPads, combined with its share of app sales from the App Store, will reach the $1 billion mark this year. By mid-2007, sales from the iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, Apple Watch and Apple TV will reach $980 billion, according to a report. Add the $100 billion in iOS services revenue generated from the App Store and Apple Music subscriptions, and you will get the $1 billion mark. These are just broad estimates, since Apple has never announced Apple Watch sales, making it difficult to actually calculate total revenue from its products. But just days after it celebrated the 10-year anniversary of the original iPhone, the company is faced with a lawsuit over monopoly charges. Bloomberg reports that a complaint, originally filed in 2011, accuses the company of violating the US antitrust law. The complaint refers to the period between 2007 and 2013, when Apple allegedly required iOS apps to be exclusively sold through Apple’s App Store. Apple could pay hundreds of millions in damages Therefore, third-party developers of apps weren’t allowed to sell applications through their own stores. Apple took a 30% share of every app purchase in the App Store and increased prices for apps, as well as restricted competitors from selling the apps somewhere else, the lawsuit states. The case isn’t a class-action lawsuit just yet, but Mark Rifkin, the lawyer for the plaintiffs believes that everyone who bought iOS apps could be included in the lawsuit. He said that Apple could pay hundreds of millions in damages to users, as millions of consumers could reclaim the 30% share that Apple received whenever an app was sold in its store. This isn’t the first time that Apple faces such a complaint, as a lower-court judge previously dismissed the case, which has now been revived by a federal appeals court in San Francisco. Apple has stated that “it does not sell apps but rather sells software distribution services to developers.” The appeals court found the argument invalid saying that “Apple's anology is unconvincing. In the case before us, third-party developers of iPhone apps do not have their own stores." #Apple#iOS#Apple Store#third-party developers#iPhone subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Early Competing iPhone Prototypes Shown in Video Apple to Cut iPhone 7 Production Due to Disappointing Sales Apple Pulls Nokia Products from Stores Following Patent Lawsuit Apple’s MacBook Suffering from Battery Inconsistency, Loses Top Recommendation It's Now Possible to Use openSUSE Inside Windows 10, Here's How to Install It Barnes & Noble Halts Sales of Nook Tablets Due to Faulty Chargers Android Co-Founder Andy Rubin Working on a Premium Bezel-less Smartphone Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Debian GNU/Linux 8.7 "Jessie" Live & Installable ISOs Now Available for Download - Exclusive Linus Torvalds Announces Fourth Linux 4.10 Kernel Release Candidate, Get It Now Debian Outs First Release Candidate of Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" Installer Sony G3112 and G3221 Smartphones Coming Soon with MediaTek Helio P20 CPUs    Apple logo in red new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Fake iPhone 7 Explosion Video Is Fake more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Next-gen wireless earbuds… Hang onto those cords. Next-gen wireless earbuds still aren’t good enough By Ryan Waniata — January 12, 2017 5:30 PM Subscribe Share Greg Mombert/Digital Trends Wireless earbuds are an extremely cool technology, but they simply aren’t yet ready for prime time. Leading into the chaos of CES 2017 I was prepared for an explosion of so-called “true wireless” in-ear headphones, and I wasn’t disappointed. From run-of-the-mill earbuds to “hearables” that can augment and filter the ambient sounds around you, this year will see a veritable cornucopia of colorful designs and styles entering the earbud market, with no strings attached (physically, anyway). If you’re excited about nabbing a pair of these new wireless buds, you’re not alone. Following Apple’s “brave” decision to drop the headphone jack, wireless earbuds are set to pop up everywhere this year, with rivals fighting Apple’s AirPods for supremacy. Even if the cool factor of popping the tiny beads into your ears wasn’t in play (and it most assuredly is), the sheer convenience of untethering from your phone with a device that packs neatly into your pocket is undeniable. Still, while wireless earbuds are extremely novel, when it comes to replacing your daily workhorse headphones, they simply aren’t yet ready for prime time. Here’s why you should hold onto those wired earbuds a little longer. Battery-life blues While processors get faster, memory gets cheaper, and screens get more pixels, batteries seem to stubbornly lag behind these innovations — just ask Galaxy S7 Note buyers. That’s especially true for wireless earbuds, which have extremely limited space in which to store the lifeblood that powers their constant connection to your smartphone. Recharging your earbuds takes time, as much as an hour and a half for some products. Larger over-ear wireless cans currently offer around 15 to 25 hours of playback per charge, often with features like active noise cancellation thrown in. In contrast, most true wireless earbuds on the market average less than a fifth as long — if we’re being generous. Erato’s popular Apollo 7, for instance, offer only three hours of playback time. The same goes for Earin’s M1, Sol Republic’s Amps Air, Samsung’s Gear IconX, Bragi’s Dash, and so on. Sound-augmenting hearables like Doppler Labs’ all-new Hear One, offer even less time — just 2.5 hours. That’s not enough time to get you through a short flight without a recharge. The next generation does no better. Earin’s new M2 are also expected to offer just three hours of juice per charge, as are Monster’s upcoming models, and I expect similar numbers from across the industry. Exceptions include Bragi’s new scaled-down offering, The Headphone, and Apple’s famed Airpods, which offer six hours and five hours of listening time, respectively. That’s better, but still not enough to get you through a workday without a recharge. To combat this obvious obstacle, virtually every model naps in a wireless charging case, which can push you to around 15 hours of listening time, or more. But recharging your earbuds takes time, as much as an hour and a half for some products. That’s a lot of downtime when you’re in the middle of a movie or stuck on a coast-to-coast flight. Connection woes Perhaps the biggest gripe about the first wave of true wireless in-ears is the widely spread frustration of connection inconsistencies — sync issues between buds often create a wobbly stereo image, while the tiny antennae inside the buds give users fits as they drop connection from the phone. That’s to say nothing of poor call quality. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Dan Baker/Digital Trends Part of the connection issue is the very nature of Bluetooth in its current form, which can’t connect to both earbuds at the same time. Instead, one of the buds must connect to your phone and then relay the stereo information — through your skull — to its counterpart (a less-than-comforting thought, we know). Apple’s AirPods are one of the few exceptions to this rule I’ve encountered. It appears the communication issues between the two buds will be primarily reined in for 2017’s new wave thanks in part to wide employment of NXP’s latest Near Field Magnetic Induction (NFMI) technology, which keeps the two earbuds communicating better than Bluetooth alone. There will still be inherent issues in play with Bluetooth, including potential connection issues between the earbuds’ tiny antenna and the source device, and even potential video sync issues. These issues are usually more prominent in off-brand models, so if you are hell-bent on true wireless buds, I suggest you cough up the dough. Which leads me to my next point … The cost of convenience For a solid pair of true wireless earbuds, you’ll pay a whole lotta green. You get what you pay for, as they say, and for a solid pair of true wireless earbuds from a quality brand, you’ll pay a whole lotta green. By that, I mean two, three, or even four times as much as a comparable pair of wired earbuds. For example, while Apple’s $150 AirPods are the most consistent pair we’ve reviewed, they’re essentially just a wireless version of the critically maligned $40 EarPods with a few fancy features like automated music pausing. If you want something with higher sound quality, you can expect to spend double that much, at $250 to $300 per pair. If you’re thinking about just how fantastic a pair of wired in-ears at that price point would sound, you’ve guessed the thesis of my final topic. Fidelity Though most of the $300 true wireless in-ears I’ve heard offer above average sound quality, they don’t even come close to the fidelity you’ll get in a wired headphone at that price. That’s true not only because Bluetooth headphones digitally compress the music before it hits your ears, but also because at least half of the price tag for true wireless earbuds takes into account the cost of wireless convenience. Greg Mombert/Digital Trends While fidelity is of the utmost importance to audio nuts like myself, I realize it’s not on the top of the list for everybody. Still, the fact that you could save hundreds of dollars on the one hand, or land exponentially better sound for the same price on the other, must be factored in. Unless you’re primarily using your headphones for yard work or practicing for an Olympic gymnastics medal, you have to ask yourself: Is wireless really worth all that? Conclusion Far be it from me to slow the wheels of innovation. In fact, I quite enjoy wireless earbuds, as many of my reviews imply. And with the advancement of new technologies — including rumors of a coming Bluetooth codec that can transfer sound to both buds at the same time — the future of true wireless earbuds is promising. However, if you’re looking for something to replace the go-to cans that help you jam your way through the day, I’d suggest you pump the brakes. Wireless earbuds are on their way up, but they haven’t conquered the mountain just yet. Also watch: Share

Opinion | 07 Jan 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (73) Tell Us Your Mac Automation Stories by Adam C. Engst The news that Apple had laid off Sal Soghoian, who has been a fixture in the world of scripting and automation for decades, hit hard at MacTech Conference back in November. Although Sal hasn’t been making as many public appearances as he used to in the days of Macworld Expo, his indefatigable efforts to promote user automation inside and outside Apple have had wide-ranging impact. Sal worked tirelessly within Apple to encourage support for AppleScript and Automator (among much else), and to ensure that Apple apps provided the necessary scripting dictionaries and Automator actions. He was long a champion for the user, believing that users know best what they need to do and that automation technologies were essential for enabling users to create and streamline their own workflows. What should we make of Sal leaving? Apple didn’t lay him off specifically, it instead eliminated the position of Product Manager of Automation Technologies. It’s my understanding that multiple groups within Apple wanted to hire Sal afterward, but Apple was under some sort of hiring freeze that prevented him from migrating within the company. So it doesn’t look as though Apple was trying to get rid of Sal personally, which is good. What’s less good is that it would appear that Apple doesn’t see the need for having a position that evangelizes user automation. A 9to5Mac reader sent email to Craig Federighi, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, to ask that Apple not kill AppleScript and Automator, and was told “We have every intent to continue our support for the great automation technologies in macOS!” Federighi’s response prompts the question of whether Apple’s future actions will bear out his statement. It may be overreaching to read too much into his precise words, but “intent” is an aim or a plan, not a guarantee. And “support” can mean “maintenance mode” rather than “advancing the state of the art.” Regardless, eliminating Sal’s position isn’t a step in the right direction. Sure, Apple could have plans to replace AppleScript and Automator with super secret magic unicorn technologies, but based purely on what the company has done and said, it’s hard to believe that. It wasn’t always like this. The reason AppleScript survived the purge of products and technologies after Steve Jobs returned was that Jobs understood the importance of automation to key Apple markets, like publishing, finance, and TV and film, not to mention the enterprise and IT worlds. These industries live and die by custom workflows based on AppleScript and other automation technologies built deep into macOS. Jobs personally approved the inclusion of Automator in OS X, and he enabled and supported adding AppleScript as a development language to Xcode. And it was because of his support that Apple’s automation team went on to develop AppleScript/Objective-C, script libraries, and JavaScript for Automation. But the Apple of today is an entirely different company, focusing as it does on the iPhone and iOS. Even so, it’s obvious to anyone who uses iOS that there is still an important role for automation. I can tell Siri to “Change ‘Floating’ to 8 AM” to adjust the time of my wake-up alarm, but I have no way to automate the five taps necessary to play the audiobook we listen to every night in the Hoopla digital library app. Five wasted taps every night isn’t the end of the world, but if you can’t automate the little stuff, you certainly can’t automate the big stuff. If Apple’s seeming indifference toward automation worries you because you rely on scripts, macros, workflows, and more to get your work done quickly, effectively, and accurately, here’s what I’d like you to do. Leave a comment on this article outlining how you depend on Mac automation tools in your job. If there are too many examples to fit in a single comment, just focus on those that are the most important to you. I’ll compile all the comments and publish them as a future article, and I’ll also send a copy to Craig Federighi and Apple CEO Tim Cook so they see concrete examples of why we need these automation technologies to continue to evolve. To kick things off, here’s my most important bit of automation. When it comes time to publish a new or updated Take Control title, I start with three versions of the book: a PDF, an EPUB, and Mobipocket file. A copy of each must be stored in several locations on our internal file server and uploaded both to our Web server and to Amazon S3. Plus, the uploaded versions must be renamed precisely according to an algorithm that’s replicated on our server, so the site can update itself and serve the correct files based on the presence of properly named uploads in the right directories. When I used to do this by hand, it took 15–20 minutes, and I ran the risk of renaming a file incorrectly or uploading to the wrong directory. (And making a mistake meant that I had to spend even more time figuring out what I’d done wrong and fixing it.) Now that I have a series of Automator workflows performing these tasks for me, it takes me just seconds to initiate the uploads, and there are never any errors. So that’s my automation story — tell us yours! Check out the Take Control ebooks that expand on the topic in this article: Take Control of Automating Your Mac If you use copy and paste, you’re taking advantage of an important shortcut. But did you realize that the Mac offers dozens of shortcuts that make tedious tasks quick, accurate, and repeatable? Author Joe Kissell reveals OS X’s many shortcuts and examines the utilities that go further, offering concrete examples and long lists of possibilities.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

It's just pure magic how I can get first and third party apps to collaborate to do just about anything. For instance, I can have the Finder duplicate/rename 300 screenshots, send them to Pixelmator to crop, and then Transmit to upload to my server. It's just a pain in the neck to do it by hand and honestly, it's nothing short of magical having all these apps work together to complete my task for me. Reply Tommy Weir  2017-01-09 14:05 I have a custom naming approach for all files on my system. And every year, they are sorted into relevant groups and archived off using the automator actions which the developers of DevonThink Office Pro provide. It's a simple thing, a folder is monitored, files are imported and tagged. But the knowledge that the organisation is done and it's consistent year in and year out. I can't tell you what that means for my peace of mind in my business. 2. My son uses folder actions all the time, resizing images, converting and renaming them for different use cases, it's like his party trick for employers while he's studying in Boston College. 3. I use a combination of Automator, Hazel and Keyboard Maestro together with some scripts I picked up online to keep my computer organised. These various tools move files around to their rightful folders, rename files to my standardised system, save email attachments and move them to the right folders, clear up strays that land here or there, archive off application installers and delete old files that are backed up and not in use for some time. Reply Chuck Shotton  2017-01-09 15:03 Well, in a nutshell, most of the Web industry on Mac OS in the early days of the Internet would not have existed if not for Sal's work with AppleScript, AppleEvents, scriptability/recordability of applications, AppleEvent Dictionaries, the Script Editor, and the concept of scripts as runnable applications. Every external extension created for MacHTTP or WebSTAR, Userland Frontier, and all of the other HTTP servers on the Mac depended exclusively on these technologies. It was how applications talked. It's still how they should talk, but Apple (NeXT) seems to have never embraced it as they should have. Even the newest incarnation of MacHTTP, MacHTTP-js, depends on a slew of AppleEvents to do its job. Let's hope this great legacy isn't lost just because it doesn't work on iOS... Reply Anthony Reimer  2017-01-09 15:39 I use AppleScript and Automator for automating actions in the Finder. Some common things I have created that I use at work: • Clean the desktop of shared computers. • Automate server connections. • Take any downloaded dmgs and move them to an Installers folder automatically (using Folder Actions). • A service that opens the current URL in a specific browser (e.g., if a page needs Flash, open it in Chrome). I also use it as an integral tool to integrate with FileMaker Pro. (e.g., export text data from FileMaker to a file, have BBEdit clean it up, then upload that edited file to a web site using Fetch — AppleScript + FileMaker scripting can make this a single step for the user). The Mac Admin community is all about automation for both the efficiency that comes from it and the consistency of result. While Python and shell scripting are core to that automation, I know I still put Automator and AppleScript to use on a regular basis. Reply Anonymous   2017-01-09 15:51 For 16 years now approximately 15 times a year I do financials based on a series of companies. The workflow I've created reduces 21 pages of reports to a readable 4 and about 90 minutes of my time to 20. That's roughly 16 * 15 * (90-20) = 16,800 minutes or 280 hours or 35 work days or 6 work weeks of my life. That's time with family, time doing other work things, time that I am not simply throwing down the hole of clicks and points. Thank you for HyperCard, AppleScript, Automator and anything else Apple can provide to give me more time! Reply Paul Ellis  2017-01-09 16:21 Which Mac automation stories? Back in the day, when I regularly had tasks that merited automation, I used QuickKeys. Nowadays I use Hazel for the few regular automated file-handling tasks I have. I've found that on those comparatively rare occasions when I have a repetitive task that could do with automating, Automator invariably lets me down. It's quicker to complete the task manually rather than trying to bully Automator into action. Here's an example: automating iTunes playback. I leave iTunes running when away from my house for an extended period, to stop the place appearing to be empty. A few years ago I spent a couple of hours figuring out how to use Calendar to automate playback, but then found the Calendar events I created didn't 'travel', but had to be created afresh every day. I can no longer be bothered with this palaver: I simply remote in with Teamviewer and manually toggle playback. Welcome to C21 Mac automation, conspicuously lacking in usability and utility. Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-09 16:33 One of the hardest things with automation is picking the right tool. For what you describe, I'd use Keyboard Maestro, which can really easily play random music from iTunes at specific times. Reply Rob Wells  2017-01-09 17:31 I work at a small newspaper and we depend on AppleScript. The most important is one AppleScript that creates working pages from a master InDesign file. It applies the right styles, sets the date of the edition on each page, sets the page numbers and saves a copy to disk with an appropriate, dated filename. This was written almost 5 years ago and has prevented many mistakes, not least with incorrect dates going to print! Previously staff would duplicate an old page — risky for many reasons. On the other end, we use AppleScript to reliably produce the PDF files for use by our printers, custom settings and all. Other things we’ve done with AppleScript include scripting BBEdit to fix common mistakes in stories, retrieving and setting weather forecasts, TV listings, football fixtures & scores, creating the barcode (and checking it is correct — an occasionally major problem before). Newer stuff is often in Python but with an AppleScript interface. Code here: https://github.com/ppps Reply Rob Wells  2017-01-09 17:21 Oh, and that's just AppleScript. There's all sorts of stuff we do with Hazel and Python scripts run as LaunchAgents (through Lingon). Our newsroom is an all-Mac office and on occasion in the past a member of staff has suggested buying cheaper Windows machines. Alongside the longevity of Macs (most of ours are almost 10 years old), automation is always the big reason I give for why we would be worse off. My understanding is that bigger newspapers have software written for them to handle this stuff, which we could never afford. Mac automation technologies have enabled us to do it ourselves in-house. Reply Mike Warren  2017-01-09 17:57 I'm so old I remember when the whole reason for having a computer was automation . I consider AppleScript a programming language. I've created programs for record keeping, budgeting, a foreign language dictionary, flash cards. I use AppleScript for a daily email message to my partner (it pulls info from flat-file databases, Calendar.app; assembles a message, sends it via Mail.app, saves it as my Safari home page.) I have so many little scripts and Keyboard Maestro routines that I feel hopeless when I have to use someone else's Mac. Reply Daniel  2017-01-09 18:00 Keyboard Maestro, with an accompanying mix of Apple Script and shell scripts, is a wonderful glue for web applications with lacking APIs. After a recent migration between institutional repositories (for academic publishing) hundreds of full text files where missing because of a bug in the new systems import script. There were no APIs for uploading new files to existing records in the system, and some manual steps were required in the upload form, but the automation tools allowed me to reduce each process from maybe 30 error prone clicks in both of the applications and Finder to about three clicks per record. It saved me several hours of tedious work. Reply Daniel  2017-01-09 18:12 Another error in the same migration required me to verify the order of attached files in both of the systems, also for a few hundred items. By automation I could with a single keyboard shortcut navigate to the next item in a list of IDs, find the record in both of the systems, then open all attachments in order in new windows and tile them on the screen in two columns allowing me to see differences at a glance. If in order, a new click got me to the next item, else I could handle the error before moving on. Reply Thomas Tempelmann  2017-01-09 18:54 As a developer (for apps such as Find Any File, iClip and iBored), I recently have started using Automator and AppleScript to assist my customers when they have some technical troubles and are not too computer-savvy. I have scripts to collect files I need to look at, fetch system information, email them to me, or copy, move and delete files to fix some of their setups. And just the other day I used AppleScript to verify a slow memory leak in one of my apps, which required 1000s of mouse moves. With AppleScript, it took me 15 minutes to write the code, then have it perform its task for about one hour to cause the issue that otherwise took users days or even weeks to run into. A few hours later, and I managed to identify and fix one of the most obscure bugs I had for a long time in my app. Also, I'm happy to have spent the money on Script Debugger, which makes writing AppleScripts much less of a pain, indeed :) Reply gastropod  2017-01-09 19:43 Currently my main automation use is somewhat indirect. To tolerate Mail.app at all, I've found Mail Tags and Mail Act-on to be indispensable. They do a lot of automating for me by greatly expanding the filter tests and actions available, and by allowing for single key actions such as moving selected messages to a folder without having to drag through the folder tree. Since I run a majordomo server and several mailing lists, intricate mail sorting is a lifesaver. In the past, I used Quickkeys to remap the keyboard and add macros to music software such as Finale. Saved me hours a week and a lot of frustration. I'm planning to dive into Keyboard Maestro soon, partly to improve the modern Finder window handling train wreck. which costs me at least an hour a week in getting windows back where they're supposed to be. Reply gastropod  2017-01-12 22:21 I entirely forgot the services I created with Automator a few years ago to do routine exif handling. Automator calls on exiftool to show all metadata in BBEdit, strip all metadata, strip all but a few exif/iptc fields, alter GPS data, etc. Not only do they save some effort when used, they save the time it takes to periodically check the exiftool docs, since it has so many options I can never remember them. It's also much easier than the command line to do things to an ad hoc file selection. Reply Naomi Pearce  2017-01-09 19:49 Early in the days of Automator, Sal made a comment, something about it changing the way applications work together where you don’t have to learn the application, just find the action for the feature you want it to do. I looked at him sideways and thought, “yeah, right, okay buddy.” Some time later, I had worked on a proposal for several days (days because it involved a fair amount of PR-101 that had been requested), finished it, print-to-.pdf and sent it off. I followed up on it the next day and Andy Taylor of MacSpeech, Inc. said “well, yes, he’d received the Executive Summary and looked forward to the rest of it.” Wait, what?! Print-to-.pdf was something one took for granted, particularly from Word, and I opened the document and sure enough, it had not printed the whole document to .pdf, just the first page. I could get it to print page 1, or print from page 2-on, but not the whole document. Minutes were ticking by, and panic ensued. I was screwed. Or was I? I remembered what Sal had said about Automator and fired it up. I clicked on “workflow” to create a workflow. I used the search and found an action to combine PDF pages and dragged it over. Clearly, it needed to know what PDF pages to use to combine, so I found an action to Get Specified Finder Items and dragged it on top to make that happen first. Then I found an action to open the result up so I could see it (open finder items, I think it was called), and dragged that action below Combine PDF Pages. That’s all I could think of needing to do, so I dragged the page-1-only document and page-2-on document into the first action, and hit run. No more than 15 minutes after I first thought “what?!”→ just like magic → problem solved. And I never learned the applications, just found the actions for what I wanted to do. I’ll be darned. Wow! Only on a Mac. Reply Walt Jump  2017-01-09 20:21 I use Automator to routinely download specific files from government databases, rename them, and move them to specific folders for use by my FileMaker databases. This saves me at least 1-2 hours a day. I also use a program by someone who accesses the PTO databases and provides one file for data obtained from multiple databases by the use of Apple script and Automator. Reply Douglas Mobley   2017-01-09 21:08 The museum where I volunteer has a project to digitize old newspapers to aid the searching of them. The workflow, in simplistic terms, consists of photographing each page, processing the pages through Photoshop, and finally OCRing the images into newspaper issues. I had been using Photoshop actions to automate one step of the process but I was able to improve my productivity (measured as pages per hour completed) by more than 50% in the last year, using AppleScript to automate the workflow. Creation of folders and renaming of files is handled by Applescript control of Finder, and the processing of the page images through Photoshop is handled with AppleScript. I have used Automator to record and then understand what system events to include in my Applescript. Reply valm1  2017-01-09 21:10 The ability to adjust things in order for them to suit your needs is a first requirement for computers. That is why I liked Apple from the 1980s, and that is why I stopped using them 20 years later. I still have an iPad, but only two, maybe three apps are actually very useful. The rest is either buggy, full with ads or just plane useless. And the user cannot do a thing about it, unless you jailbreak the thing. No updates for individual apps either, so we are stuck with a buggy iOS emailer. I have never lost so many emails - many days of work. Never been so disappointed with Apple - a total waste of money and, especially, of my time. Reply Jeff Porten   2017-01-09 21:23 I think I've been writing AppleScripts for as long as the language has existed, and I've done a great deal of professional consulting doing one-off AppleScripts for my clients. I'd be lost without it. Most common use cases: 1) an AppleScript that cleans up and organizes my Desktop icons according to a custom grid, grouping them by color tag. 2) a randomizer selection when I have a group of files to read or movies to watch, picks "some item in the current folder". 3) any application missing a keystroke; i.e., I have dozens of one-line AppleScripts mapped to Quicksilver launch keys, so I can hit control-command-3 and label a Finder item yellow. (Then there's "comment and label yellow", which uses the yellow label to remind me that an item has a Finder comment.) Reply Rob Lewis  2017-01-09 23:16 I've used Macs since 1986, and our family has owned more than 15, along with assorted iPods and iPhones. With Apple's recent neglect of the Mac lineup, AppleScript is pretty much my last remaining reason for staying loyal: if they take that away, there's little reason for me to stay on the reservation. And if my computer isn't a Mac, there's not much reason for my next phone to be an iPhone. I have a fairly elaborate Home Automation system that is totally based on AppleScript and the XTension program. I love how it makes it easy to control and modify the behavior of the system. I've thought for years that an enhanced version of Automator could finally—finally!—make Home Automation accessible by mere mortals. In my opinion this is a gigantic missed opportunity for Apple. I'm frankly very worried. There are so many signs that Apple has lost its soul chasing shiny iObjects. Reply chrischram@gmail.com  2017-01-09 23:23 I have several Photos libraries on two different disks. I use an Automator app, with a bit of embedded AppleScript, to wrangle these libraries and let me select which one to open. I use AppleScript to collect the data from my weather station and upload it to my web space. It's more reliable than the software that came with the station. I also use AppleScript to massage the weather data and import it to a Numbers spreadsheet. Reply Jake  2017-01-09 23:47 I book several music venues in NYC. I book 100-200 acts per month. I rely heavily on automation, mostly with Keyboard Maestro, AppleScript, a bit of automator, TextExpander, and now also with Better Touch Tool to create app-specific touchbar buttons which trigger my applescripts. For those in doubt about the touchbar, I find it to be the best tool Apple has come out with in years. It's an amazing launcher for all my macros, and I have MANY. It's very powerful! I have actions that add confirmed events to the calendar (BusyCal), send confirmation emails at specific dates/times (much of which is because of a powerful CLI utility called iCalBuddy), resize and reformat images automatically, update web calendars with band descriptions, pictures, links, etc...basically everything I do relies on Mac automation in one form or another. It literally turns hours of work into minutes and allows more music to happen in New York. For me, automation is the best part of using a Mac! Reply Firitia  2017-01-10 01:21 Making netboot images requires automater (or system imaging utility which is just a shell around it). Over history the reability of it has been dubious. In 10.12.2 it is not working: the image source (sierra installer) cannot be found, even if you manually select it. In 10.12.1 it could be found, but the programm crashed anyway when trying to make the image. In 10.12.0 it was working. In 10.11.5 also. But it crashed in 10.11.4, 10.11.3, 10.11.2. Working in 10.11.1 and 10.11.0, but not 10.9.5, and so forth with the ups and downs into the times of the past. (Perhaps I mistake some version numbers, and with some versions it appeared to work on one but not on another computer, but the general idea remains.) In addition to that, when you save a workflow for next time, that next time trying opening it either opens, or it does not at all, or it just crashes the program. Reply Jon Gotow  2017-01-10 00:37 Another developer chiming in here (I'm the author of Default Folder X, App Tamer, Jettison, HistoryHound, and a bunch of other stuff going back nearly 30 years). I use AppleScript in 3 primary ways: 1. For automating processes in my own business, including email parsing and message handling, and software development and testing. 2. For customer support, sending AppleScript applets to customers to help them fix problems or collect debugging information. Having someone run an AppleScript is far more reliable than trying to walk them through a set of steps. 3. Integrating my software with other developers' products. As an example, Default Folder X can detect when Path Finder, a popular Finder substitute, is running and ask it to perform various tasks instead of the Finder - which is exactly what Path Finder users want it to do. That wouldn't be possible (or would be much harder) without AppleScript. Reply DeeAnne Lau  2017-01-10 00:52 AppleScript is used in many of the programs that I use! I am really appalled. I use it to tailor my spam controller program, SpamSieve. I have a Repetitive Motion Injury plus a pinched nerve in my neck. Being able to use scripts to control the Finder or web actions have saved me from much pain. I use A Better Finder Rename applets and use Automator to make contextual services that can be triggered by keystrokes. I use Script Debugger, also, to help me understand the underlying aspects of scripts as I compile them and look for problems. I still rely on some of Dougs Applescripts for iTunes to do things in that (frustrating) program. I use Hazel to manage organization of my downloads and printer folders. I am retired, but I still use my Mac for financial management, communications, learning, and recreation. I rely a lot on AppleScript and Automator. Reply paule  2017-01-10 01:16 I use automator to do mass re-namings of files of photos I take for my son's football team. I estimated once that using automator saves me about 45 minutes per week -- and reduces the error count to zero. Over 14 rounds of footy, that's nearly 11 hours of saved effort. I know I could write a shell script to do the same thing, but Automator makes it easy for me to do (it's been over a decade since I last wrote a shell script!) Reply Felix Deimel  2017-01-10 04:21 I'm using parts of AppleScript to allow users of my professional remote management app, Royal TSX to automate keyboard input. This can range from having a password automatically entered to complex scripts that inject values from their associated connections or credentials. The 10.12.2 update made this completely unreliable as uppercase characters or special characters appearing anywhere in the text can completely mess up the casing. Sometimes it's correct, but it's completely unpredictable and the frequency of errors is very high. I've posted a radar and TSI about this but have yet to hear back from Apple. Here's a copy of the bug report: https://openradar.appspot.com/29182929. One of my customers posted a +1 kind of radar for this here: https://openradar.appspot.com/29825727 If anyone around here is affected by this as well I'd appreciate you "duplicating" my radar.

When I decided to also implement bootable clones for backup, I attached all clones to my wife's iMac and cloning is done from my MacBook Pro by authenticated traffic. This gives comfort and protection against ransomware affecting the MacBook Pro. I had disks mounted and making noise all day. My wife rightfully pointed to noise and energy bill: a perspective for divorce. But my MacBook Pro's clones are all sitting attached to the iMac, away from CCC and its easy to use automation tools. So I found on the internet "Mount" and "Eject" Applescripts, adapted them to my needs and, to trigger them, use a timer software (Task Till Dawn). Thus these drives are only mounted and doing noise one hour per day, around midnight. Marriage saved ! Thank you Applescript ! Reply Andy Lietz  2017-01-10 08:07 We're a prepress and printing house and we use AppleScript all the time to automatically typeset and alter layouts in InDesign with data from Excel and FileMaker. AppleScript is the "glue" that binds it all together and one of the major reasons we're on the Mac. But as a programming language, AppleScript feels more and more old-fashioned now compared to, say, Python or Ruby. I've met Sal at MacWorld and especially admire him for persuading Adobe to put good AppleScript support into InDesign. It's very sad to see him (and, it seems, Apple's support for automation) leave the company. Reply Bill Cheeseman  2017-01-10 08:26 I was a trial lawyer specializing in major environmental, financial and intellectual property litigation in a large law firm.

Reply Charles Butcher  2017-01-10 09:26 For me, AppleScript as a way for non-programmers to tie applications together is probably the most important differentiator for MacOS. I've been loyal to Apple since my first Quadra 800, but if they abandon AppleScript I'll probably move to Windows or plain UNIX. I run my freelance business on FileMaker Pro. AppleScript lets me create calendar events and to-dos straight from FileMaker, use BBEdit to clean up text from within another application, scan and OCR documents straight to DEVONthink, and a host of other small tasks that over the years must have saved me many hundreds of hours. Sure, AppleScript can be a pain to write, and I've never got on with Automator. But the fact that so many apps support AppleScript, even if only in limited or idiosyncratic ways, is a real achievement. People say the Mac has been "dumbed down"; I've been OK with this so far, but losing AppleScript would be a big blow to professionals.

I am in academia, so I’ve mostly developed scripts to automate or help with my teaching and with my record keeping. Initially with Excel, I’ve created a script that would create an Excel spreadsheet formatted and with all the formulas to compute grades putting the precise dates I would teach excluding the holidays. And this would be created by me just copying the webpage where the roster of students for the course is. Then, to take attendance I would use a script that would prompt me with the student name and I would just say “present” or “not here” to have the appropriate mark entered in the sheet (“P” or “A”). Macs had the ability to work with voice command I believe since v 7.5 (my earliest Mac OS version) via the SpeechRecognitionServer. Same thing wold work for entering grades (my office mate decided on a Mac after witnessing me doing both the grades and attendance). After that, I would create from each of my student a web page with his/hers record. I could have 1 or 1000 students and the pages would be created in a flash. I would ftp ( using the Terminal app) to my site and name every file according to their location. Then, to enter grades in the (brain dead) software the College uses to get student grade, AppleScript with Safari and Javascript and I automatically put grades attendance status and last class attended by having an AppleScript that reads the Excel or Number (the one I prefer) spreadsheet data. At the college, at one point the Math Department was creating final exams for remedial level Math courses by getting questions from a 2000+ problems from a MS Word document. This document was divided in various sections. These exams were made by randomly selecting one question from each section. It was a long and laborious process. I was asked to help and from then on we would get all (7 per semester) exams created in less than a minute. They would come already formatted ready for printing. Using Smile, from Satimage (Satimage.fr an AppleScript based developer tool) I have created various QT movies that helped me with teaching, Pre-Calculus trigonometry, Calculus differentiation and integration, statistics distribution, etc. I have created Mathematical libraries for all kinds of Mathematics operations, including Matrix algebra and Statistics Library to help me teach Statistics (much faster and easier to access than R or other scientific software). Using AppleScript and a Mac Mini server Apple could easily disrupt the Education Market by simplifying everyone’s life. It would be cheaper and error free, very likely also more secure and private, without violating any law (FERPA). But hey, who wants to make a ton of money anyway? I’ve created an (AppleScript) app that everyday puts the APOD (apod.nasa.gov) as a background picture of my desktops (I’ve many). I’ve created a script that would search and display the lyrics of the current iTunes song. I use AppleScript to organize my folders, I use AppleScript to apply rules to my incoming Mail. I use AppleScript to generate and save passwords. I use AppleScript… Yes, I would say that Mac automation is the single most important reason I use Macs (actually, now most of my extended family uses Mac because of me). So, yes, Apple should support Mac Automation, because each automation user implies in many others that follows.

It sounds more like the work of an efficiency expert accountant lurking in the background. Axing automator does not seem just like an isolated incident. It probably reflects the strategic view that Apple computers (including smartphones and tablets) should serve a menu of isolated self-sufficient apps (except for Apple's own apps, of cour$e). Nothing can be further from truth. Switching among multiple apps does not just requires a bunch of extra clicks. Cumulatively it is debilitating and interferes with even the desire to use the appliances. The approach should be just the opposite: make multi-app automation easy and use will skyrocket.

One I rely on daily creates a alias, on the Desktop, to a new folder created in Dropbox every midnight. The folder is named for the date and each day I drop any new material I want to keep into that "today" folder. The script is kicked off by launchd at midnight (+1 minute) and every time I log in. It's not a big deal but I suspect I wouldn't have the personal rigor to do this manually every day.

That being said, Applescript is one of the main reasons I own a Mac. I have written hundreds of scripts to make my life easier. Two I would pick to highlight are a Software Marketing and Tracking System and a Dead Man Monitoring System. The Software Marketing and Tracking System uses Applescript, Filemaker, and Mail to automatically track software trials, purchases, channels of distribution, etc. Incoming emails are automatically processed to log purchases, issue serial numbers, create a customer database, and track trial installations. The whole system is driven by email arrivals and requires no manual intervention. This has saved man-years of manual effort. The Dead Man Monitoring system is described in the next post Reply Steve Cunningham  2017-01-10 16:15 (Continued from previous post) The Dead Man Monitoring system is for a paralyzed patient who cannot communicate. It guarantees that help will be summoned if someone doesn't enter the patient's room every two hours. Since I am the sole caregiver, if anything were to happen to me the patient would die of dehydration before anyone found her. The system uses a motion sensitive camera to track entrances and exits from the patient's room. When detected, the camera places a message in a folder which triggers the Monitoring script to log it and reset the Dead Man Counter. The Monitoring Script also runs automatically every two hours and, if there has been no activity, initiates a series of alarms and notifications, first locally and then to a list of external responders. A schedule for which hours are monitored during the day can be set and changed as well as the list of responders. Everything is done with Applescript. The system runs on a UPS protected Mac Mini and uses Launch Agents to monitor itself for failures.

Although I am not a huge fan of AppleScript (I find the syntax annoying and at times impenetrable - I also don't like the lack of good debugging tools) I have nonetheless used it, and Automator, for years for a wide range of tasks. At present, I use a combination of AppleScript and Automator to blog from my Mac and to produce eBooks. I have scripts and folder actions that: • Post Evernote notes to my Wordpress blog (yes, I could use Postach.io, but they have been somewhat unreliable of late) - this requires some PHP in the AppleScript • Pass Evernote notes to Scrivner for eBook production • Pass images from an Evernote note back to Evernote as individual notes for posting to Instagram • Resize images for blog posts • Resize images for posting to Twitter One of the most fun scripts I had (and I found this on the Internet and adapted) automated Keynote to send out a tweet when a slide was shown. The tweet contained the text in the speaker notes for the slide. This script caused a lot of confusion as the audience couldn't work out how I was presenting and tweeting at the same time! Reply Rob Lewis  2017-01-11 12:42 I don't think Apple management is considering the "Reverse Halo Effect" that Brent Simmons wrote about: http://inessential.com/2016/11/21/the_reverse_of_the_halo_effect The idea is that with Apple discontinuing or failing to update so many products (like Airport Wi-Fi routers and external displays), a lot of people who once automatically bought Apple's solutions because they could be depended upon to "just work" are forced to look elsewhere. And if you're looking at other monitors, why not other computers? Why not other phones? The walls around Apple's painstakingly constructed (and very profitable) garden are crumbling, and it won't end well. The likely demise of AppleScript and Automator are, well, another break in the wall. Reply Carlos  2017-01-11 13:57 I've saved hundreds of hours every year by using AppleScript every day via apps that rely on it of Keyboard Mastro, Automator, Hazel and Default Folder X. I'm a photographer and one of my favorite workflows that I have created involves launching an application, called PostHaste, every time I insert a SD with fresh new photos, in my mac, this creates automatically a folder on the server that is renamed with the contents of the clipboard, previously copied from the latest event in my calendar. After this, a new Finder window is prompted to the foreground revealing the newly created folder, next to it Image Capturehas been launched allowing me to drag and drop the new photos into the new folder window. My photos then are automatically renamed by Hazel. Reply Patricia Pfitsch  2017-01-11 16:17 My husband and I run a small transcription business. Our clients are production companies who send us raw film footage they’ve taken for documentaries. We create a written transcript of the film by transcribing what they hear and see—then we we send the transcript to the client. Our clients are usually under a tight deadline so it’s crucial that we can create the transcript fast—often we need to transcribe hours of film and get the transcripts to the client within a twelve-hour period. That kind of speed depends on using AppleScript to create shortcuts for names and other words and phrases that are repeated continually in the dialogue. (You’d be amazed at how many times people say ‘you know’ in conversation.) We also use AppleScript to start and stop the film while we’re transcribing. AppleScript is the key to our success and without it we’d be out of business! Reply Brian Christmas  2017-01-12 04:46 I have a 9 years in-the-making vary large App called Mail Manager that takes all incoming artwork, for any art work App, and prints a sheet to monitor factory progress, and 2 barcodes and 2 plain text fields to each image, then prints each piece of artwork at 100% accuracy. It also triple saves (for redundancy purposes), each file before and after printing. These images are used to make metal or plastic printing dies, including the Seal of the President of the United States. All running on a top-of-the-line iMac, and Xcode ASObjC. Reply Emmanuel Levy  2017-01-12 05:10 We at quomodo.com have developed a Web Server environment where XML + Applescript somehow are used instead of the widely used mySQL + PHP. Main advantage is, XML is both the database language and the web page language. Thanks to that environment, we are able to develop enhancements and new features way faster and more freely than if we used the usual mySQL - PHP framework. A specific — yet, very simple — cgi sends the http requests to our AppleScript hub (Smile), which in turn sends the hard stuff to some osax (mainly, XMLLib.osax). A herd of Smile apps handle up to 100 requests a second (approximate — I did not measure recently). Our DIY web site system works wonderfully for 50,000+ sites maintained by 100,000+ admins.

These scripts have enabled me to do creative and production work at a speed which makes it possible for my company to win bids and remain profitable. If the Mac OS doesn't have Applescript, then we will be forced to use instead other tools which have the level of control needed to afford the sort of automation which we need to be competitive. Reply Rob Lewis  2017-01-12 11:39 When the very popular contact manager Now Contact was discontinued some years ago, I was able to create an AppleScript to export its contact files to Apple's Address Book (now called Contacts). It is a commercial product that does a much better job than any other solution, and I still get requests for it. And when I switched from my previous note manager to Evernote, I wrote an AppleScript that transferred my old notes, nicely categorized. I've used AppleScript with OmniGraffle to print custom serialized and bar-coded labels, and with Excel to calculate and print specialized scales for liquid measurement. Reply Mark Leslie  2017-01-12 11:51 I work for a global sports apparel brand, and we could not match the speed of the marketplace without Applescript and MacOS automation technologies. Many years ago when we first implemented large automated workflows, we absorbed two successive years of +20% increases in product SKUs without the need to scale up existing production art team staffing. Not only that, but the very significant decreases in user errors (typos, component placement, file naming) reduced previously typical rework while freeing proofing efforts to be more focused on essential product details. In all aspects of our business - product creation, preparation of manufacturing visual spec documents, color management, merchandising materials / catalogs, product photography - Applescript and deep cross application connections drive our capabilities. Data from corporate data stores are piped to drive workflows and assign metadata attributes to assets. We use hot folders on servers to drive MacOS purpose built “appliances” running as asset creation engines. Assets created in this way are then transferred to other servers for delivery to another art team. With everything we have in place, and all the successes we have achieved, we still regularly discover new opportunities for automation. I can’t foresee any end to how we can harness the deep reach and power of Applescript, Apple Events, and scriptable applications.

We have several scripts to make daily tasks more efficient, and this has led to 25% of our company using MacBooks instead of Dells. I have to say that if support for AppleScript were to become weak, we might well lose the fight to increase Mac use in our business. It's crucial to the ease-of-use and utility arguments.

Soon after I started I began seeing opportunities to improve the department's efficiency by writing AppleScripts to automate many tasks that are done repeatedly in the department. From simple scripts to automatically create job folder structures (use many times a day by every department member) to more complex ones that automate processes and interactions with Excel, Acrobat and InDesign. I've even written a basic imposition program for InDesign with AppleScript. These scripts save untold man-hours over the course of a year. It will be a sad day if this ability is ever removed from MacOS. Reply Joern Dyck  2017-01-14 16:43 I once had the task to open and save 5.000 videos on a remote Xserve. Because back then, QuickTime files would only play in a browser after the file was loaded completely. (Today everybody expects that the video starts to play after the first few Bytes have been loaded.) Apple provided a way to prepare old videos for this: just open the file and save it again with the QuickTime Player, unaltered. But nobody can manually open 5.000 files in the QuickTime Player and save them again. With AppleScript, you just iterate through all files in the folder, open them one by one with QuickTime Player and save them again. It's a few lines of code, and the poor Xserve would be busy for some nights. (Because AppleScript is happy to work at night). I have solved many problems like this with AppleScript. Rarely gets AppleScript the credit that it deserves. Reply To leave a comment, click Add a Comment and then enter the text, your name, and your email address (which won't be displayed).

The Wall Street Journal reports the company is planning to develop original television shows and movies. The move aimed at offsetting slowing sales of iPhones and iPads. The Journal says Apple has been shopping for rights to scripted television programs. It also has been trying to hire experienced executives to promote its content. The company did not respond to our request for comment. "Creating your own content is inherently a very risky behavior, which doesn't necessarily fit Apple's most recent business ventures and the way they behave, but I believe that Apple is a very consumer-focused company that really understands consumers, and, if there is a company that isn't in original content that would get into it, Apple could be one of the companies that could be successful," said Moor Insights & Strategy associate analyst Anshel Sag. Apple's new programming would be available to subscribers of its US$10-a-month (S$14.30) streaming-music service. The company did not respond to our request for comment.

Now, the company’s founder admits that he “pushed ahead too fast.” “We created a miracle,” Lei Jun wrote in a note to employees posted this week to Facebook and WeChat. He said the company now needs to slow down to “ensure sustainable growth for a long-term future.” In 2014, Xiaomi looked like a Chinese miracle. With smartphone sales topping 60 million and a valuation of $45 billion, the Beijing-based private firm was knocking on Apple’s door. But brand loyalty is a fickle thing in China’s fiercely competitive smartphone market. Domestic rivals Huawei, Oppo and Vivo soon surpassed Xiaomi in smartphone sales, and by early last year analysts were flagging concerns about the company’s decline. Lei acknowledged in his note that Xiaomi faced “unforgettable” challenges, including four months of supply chain “issues” last year. Xiaomi made its mark by selling cheap smartphones directly to consumers online. The company touted blockbuster sales numbers, and even set a Guinness World Record in 2015 for the most mobile phones sold in a 24-hour period. But selling millions of inexpensive phones yielded low profits and alienated high-end buyers. “The brand was associated with being cheap, with working class [consumers] or students,” said Nicole Peng, an analyst with market researcher Canalys. “For people who have money to spend, they won’t chose Xiaomi because it’s not chic.” Lei admitted that selling cheap phones online isn’t enough. He said the company will now focus on “innovative technologies and products that speak for themselves.” The CEO also hailed the firm’s recent “breakthrough in the high-end smartphone market” — a reference to the bevel-free Mi Max, which Xiaomi released late last year to positive reviews. The company will also beef up its offline retail presence, more than tripling the number of its brick and mortar Mi Home stores in the next year. Xiaomi currently has 54 Mi Home outlets, three of which topped 100 million yuan ($14.4 million) in sales last year, according to Lei. The stores sell Xiaomi-branded devices like air purifiers, smart televisions, fitness trackers and even body weight scales. Lei’s public admission mirrors a move from fellow Chinese CEO Jia Yueting, who posted a public memo in November acknowledging that his company LeEco had “blindly sped ahead, overextended our global strategy and spent recklessly.” — An earlier version of this story misstated Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun’s name.

Jeff Peel on 13 January 2017 , 8:44 am 0 | 1,494 views This article was first published on BrexitCentral. Brexit has spooked the Irish. In fact, well before the referendum took place back in June, the Irish were spooked at even the prospect of Brexit. In early March last year I attended a Brexit Breakfast addressed by arch-Europhile Ken Clarke, and organised by the AIB Bank. Over 300 business people packed the room at the Dublin Convention Centre. I was one of few Northern Irish in attendance. I think I was the only Leave supporter (apart from the excellent Dr Gerard Lyons who was on the speaker panel).  There was a palpable sense of panic at that event. And understandably…the fact is that the Irish and British economies are joined at the hip.  The panic was less about the UK leaving the EU. It was more about the UK leaving Ireland. After all, Ireland’s relationship with the EU, in recent years, has hardly been a bed of roses. Meanwhile the relationship with the United Kingdom has never been better. The EU’s tendency to tell member states how to behave, grates with the Irish. Remember the Lisbon Treaty vote in 2008? Some 53% of the people of Ireland who voted (an even greater percentage than voted for Brexit) voted to reject the Lisbon Treaty. But the EU was having none of it and insisted that the referendum be held again until the result suited their agenda. Similarly, the EU, during the bail-out negotiations, following the 2008 crash, insisted that the Irish give up their (highly advantageous) corporation tax rates. The Irish, however, held firm and still command a huge share of foreign direct investment (FDI). Similarly, the Dublin government took a dim view when the EU Commission insisted that Apple should repay, to the Irish exchequer, what the Commission deemed to be Apple’s inappropriate tax benefits. The Dublin government considered them to be highly appropriate – to continue attracting big employers like Apple. But while FDI is important to the Irish economy, the UK is even more important. When the UK leaves the EU some two-thirds of Ireland’s foreign trade will be with English-speaking markets outside the EU. America and the UK are Ireland’s two largest export countries. Now that Ireland is a net contributor to the EU budget, some people are beginning to ask whether Ireland might be better to follow its neighbour and big trading partner out of the EU. After all, both nations joined the EEC together, perhaps they should leave the EU together too. And, of course, such an arrangement would be ideal for Northern Ireland. Trading between Northern Ireland and the Republic happens across a land border that has no obvious customs posts despite different VAT rates and different currencies applying in both jurisdictions. But an Irish exit would almost certainly lead to a very rapid trade deal between both nations. Ireland, since it achieved independence from Britain, has always benefitted from a Common Travel Area that allows so many of its people to live and work (and even vote) in Britain and Northern Ireland. The CTA could be extended and enhanced if Ireland were to leave the EU. In October 2016 the Irish Daily Mail published the results of an opinion poll that showed that nearly 40% of Irish people would prefer open borders and free trade with the UK over continued membership of the EU. That’s clearly not a majority of the population but it’s a sizeable percentage. Irish public opinion could move rapidly in the direction of Irish exit if the EU continues its bully-boy tactics and the people of Ireland realise that the EU increasingly represents a drain on Irish tax-payers rather than a provider of never-ending largesse. Interestingly, while the case for leaving the EU has traditionally come from the right of Irish politics (for example, the Sunday Times columnist and free trade advocate Cormac Lucey has written a book arguing the case for Ireland leaving the Eurozone), those on the left are now adding their voices. People Before Profit Alliance, a hard-left Party active in both Northern Ireland and the Republic, has made clear its support for an Irish exit. It has also made some big gains in recent elections at the expense, mostly, of Sinn Fein. Anthony Coughlan, the former Associate Professor of Social Policy at Trinity College Dublin, also considered to be from the intellectual left, recently published a report of a study group of Irish economists and constitutional lawyers that “sets out the reasons why “Brexit” when it happens should be accompanied by “Irexit” (Ireland Exit).” Irexit or not, the fact that Britain will be leaving the EU has obvious consequences for Ireland. The devaluation of the £ alone makes it more difficult for Irish traders (but great for Northern Irish traders in border towns like Newry, who, ironically, were most vocal in their opposition to Brexit).  Ireland needs to consider a future that, within the EU, may not make quite as much sense given the UK’s absence.

They need to build hype around the event as they have had a bad 2016, by their own standards. However, irrespective of the hype, it is worth looking at what this product has done to our lives and to the economy. First it has helped in the transformation of the company itself. For around 30 years Apple had been a personal computer company, with an operating system that was not easily compatible with the mainstream operating system (Windows). It was struggling. Then it challenged traditional thinking and created the iPod and the company moved away from being a computer company to one operating in the entertainment business. The iPhone was a step in that direction, together with other Apple products. The conceptual change in the way it defines its business contributed to the success of Apple of the last 10 years or so. When Steve Jobs announced the creation of iPhone, he claimed that on that day Apple had reinvented the telephone. It may be worth remembering the comment of the chief engineer of the UK Post Office when told about the invention of the telephone in the 1870s. He said something to the effect that the British did not need the telephone as they had enough messenger boys. The old telephone did change our lives and the way we do business. And the iPhone also changed our lives and the way we do business. The point is that we have never abandoned that pocket companion that was capable of playing music, surfing the web, phoning and now of doing even more At the launching ceremony on January 9, 2008, Jobs had said that Apple was launching three innovative products all bundled into one – an iPod with a larger screen and touch controls, a revolutionary cell phone and an innovative gadget to surf the web. This was what the iPhone was. Probably not even Jobs himself had an idea how matters would develop and what it really meant to create a smartphone. Eventually the letters smart would be dropped from the name smartphone as all phones would be smart. Maybe in Malta we feel the change brought about by iPhone even more as mobile phone technology had only been introduced into the local market 17 years before. The point is that we have never abandoned that pocket companion that was capable of playing music, surfing the web, phoning and now of doing even more. It changed the way we communicate, the way we use the web and the way we consume entertainment, but also created new markets and services that previously were unimaginable. It changed our living habits and the dependence on the smartphone can be best gauged by the fact that last year, 1.5 billion smartphones were sold around the world. Another two numbers explain this development. Research shows that on average we unblock the smartphone 80 times a day – once every 12 minutes of our waking life. Note that the data is about the unblock function, and not about the number of times we do an activity on the phone. The second piece of data is that in terms of access to the web, smartphones take up more than 50 per cent, when compared to personal computers. This has led analysts to claim that the iPhone can be placed among those inventions that have revolutionised our lives, such as the car and the washing machine. There are not many more to add to this list. Some IT gurus are also claiming that there is no heir to the iPhone on the horizon. This leads to two crucial considerations. What direction will future technological developments take? The second is access to the smartphone by the population around the world. Addressing these two considerations will shape future investment not just in IT but in other areas as well. « German economy grows at fastest rate in five years Football sector investments are higher risk, Dutch regulator warns banks » Advert See our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.

This updated rating comes after the Cupertino-based company released a software fix earlier this month for the bug that was believed to be causing the battery life issues on the laptops. Consumer Reports says in its new report that the software update released by Apple on January 9 fixed the problems that it encountered in its earlier testing. "We tested each model multiple times using the new software, following the same protocol we apply to hundreds of laptops every year," the firm said. Consumer Reports says that the 2016 MacBook Pro models performed well in the latest tests with one model even running 18.75 hours on a single charge. The three MacBook Pro models tested by Consumer Reports include two 13-inch models (one with Apple's new Touch Bar and one without the Touch Bar) and a 15-inch model. The new average battery-life results on the aforementioned laptops are, in order, 15.75 hours, 18.75 hours, and 17.25 hours, Consumer reports said. "Now that we've factored in the new battery-life measurements, the laptops' overall scores have risen, and all three machines now fall well within the recommended range in Consumer Reports ratings," Consumer Reports said after the latest test results. To recall, 2016 MacBook Pro models were first Apple laptops not to receive recommendation from Consumer Reports and inconsistent battery life was the primary issue because of which firm didn't give its nod to the laptops. Consumer reports earlier said that it won't be doing any retests, but after Apple released its statement on the issue and issued a fix for the bug believed to be causing the problem, the product testing firm decided to give another go at the laptops. Even before retesting the models with the software fix, Consumer Reports clarified that if the battery life results turn out to be consistently high, the laptops will receive the recommendation rating based on its other evaluations. Apple worked with Consumer Reports after the latter came out with its first test results and then announced that the battery life inconsistency was caused by a bug in its Safari browser which was triggered by a setting used by the product testing firm. Notably, Apple said that this particular setting (turning off browser cache) is not used by customers and did not reflect real-world usage.

In a bid to differentiate itself from Spotify, which has about twice as many subscribers, Apple has been speaking with makers of original programming about buying rights to scripted shows and potentially movies, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The discussions were reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal, which said Apple had spoken with marketing executives at movie studios and television networks about joining the Cupertino, Calif.-based company to help promote the new material. Apple's initial plan is to produce a small number of high-quality shows, the person said. That's a different approach than the one used by Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., which have spent heavily to create a wide-ranging library of original shows, documentaries and movies. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Apple's effort would expand on what it already has under way, including a series based on the life of rapper Dr. Dre, a competition show about makers of apps, and a spin off of "Carpool Karaoke" with talk-show host James Corden. Apple's foray into TV programming has had many fits and starts, ranging from making its own TV sets to trying to offer a cable-like package of channels. After years of on-and-off talks with producers, studios and agents, it began investing in original programming over the past 18 months. This is a strategy shift for Apple, which previously preferred to be a platform for other companies to release content rather than become a media company itself. But as Netflix and Amazon have built loyal subscriber bases with an expanding catalog of shows such as "The Crown" and "Transparent," Apple has followed. Apple Music, created in 2015, has 20 million subscribers, while Spotify had more than 40 million as of September 2016. The two companies offer nearly identical catalogs at the same price. In a bid to stand out, Apple plans to steadily increase the amount of video content available through the service, the person said. Spotify said in May it would make 12 original series, expanding the video offerings on the service. As the world's most valuable company, Apple has unmatched resources if it wants to outbid competitors for shows it thinks will boost the service. Its arrival surely will be welcomed by makers of TV shows in Hollywood who have already been enjoying a lucrative boom from the influx of new digital services bidding for their creations.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Kirby: Wait'll you see how much the Mormon church pays me How much do top Mormon leaders make?

Also, tvOS apps can use On-Demand Resources to host up to 20 GB of additional content on the App Store." The increased size will especially benefit game developers as they will be able to offer the entire game as a single download up-front, instead of the current practice of installing a small file and then downloading the rest of the assets at a later stage. The move will also improve customer experience as the complete game will be available to users as soon as the app is downloaded, doing away with wait times. Larger apps would also let developers use higher resolution assets, which will be a treat for the eyes, especially on 4K TVs, where the current limit would have been an injustice. Taking about 4K, some believe this could be a sign that a new Apple TV model with 4K support is coming soon. The current Apple TV only supports full-HD output. Recently, Apple introduced the ability to install apps on an Apple TV directly from an iOS device or a computer running iTunes.

Twitter Facebook Apple must face claims of monopoly in iPhone app market A court ruled that Apple has to face charges as app 'distributor' John Ribeiro (IDG News Service) 13 January, 2017 18:01 - - - - print email Comments An appeals court has ruled that Apple must face antitrust charges in a US lawsuit that alleges that the company monopolized the market for iPhone apps. The U.S. Court for Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed Thursday a decision by a lower court and ruled that the app buyers filing the lawsuit are direct purchasers of iPhone apps from Apple, rather than from app developers, and hence have standing to sue. Apple was a distributor of iPhone apps, selling them directly to buyers through its App Store, according to the court. The proposed class-action lawsuit started in 2011 with the complaint changing several times. The purchasers object to the 30 percent "surcharge" that they pay to Apple. The company collects 30 percent of the revenue of third-party apps on its store, with the balance going to the developer, in a closed system in which Apple controls which apps can run on an iPhone, according to court records. Apple had argued that it does not sell apps but “software distribution services to developers,” and hence cannot simultaneously be a distributor of apps to app purchasers, Circuit Judge William Fletcher wrote for the unanimous panel. Apple’s description of its role as that similar to the owner of a shopping mall that leases physical space to stores was “unconvincing,” as third-party developers of iPhone apps do not have their own stores, he added. The courts have yet to address the complaints of the app purchasers, who allege that Apple prohibits app developers from selling iPhone apps through channels other than the App Store, threatening to cut off sales by any developer who violates this rule, according to court records. Apple is also said to discourage iPhone owners from downloading unapproved apps, threatening to make iPhone warranties void if they do so. Apple did not immediately comment on the decision. The suit covers purchases of apps from 2007 to 2013 but Bloomberg quoted Mark Rifkin, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, as saying that he may try to extend the proposed class action suit to include purchasers who have bought apps for the iPhone up to the present. Apple is being sued for damages and the court is being asked to order the company to change its app store rules.

Home Industry Technology Apple now allows bigger apps on Apple TV Apple now allows bigger apps on Apple TV Apple has announced a change in App Store policy increasing the tvOS apps size limit from 200MB to 4GB. "With the increased data size, developers can include more media in their submission and provide a complete, rich user experience upon installation," Apple said in a post on Thursday. By: IANS | New York | Published: January 13, 2017 12:32 PM “The new feature is available in the US only and can be used on CenturyLink Prism, DirecTV, Dish, GVTC, GTA, Hawaiian Telcom, Hotwire, MetroCast, Sling,” Apple said. (Reuters) Apple has announced a change in App Store policy increasing the tvOS apps size limit from 200MB to 4GB. “With the increased data size, developers can include more media in their submission and provide a complete, rich user experience upon installation,” Apple said in a post on Thursday. Also, tvOS apps can use ‘On-Demand Resources’ to host up to 20GB of additional content on the App Store. Aiming to help users enjoy instant access to video apps that their pay TV subscription includes, Apple last year launched a new iOS single sign-on tool to log in to cable or satellite-TV provider on your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Apple TV. “The new feature is available in the US only and can be used on CenturyLink Prism, DirecTV, Dish, GVTC, GTA, Hawaiian Telcom, Hotwire, MetroCast, Sling,” Apple said. Even if your provider supports single sign-on, there still might be apps that you need to open and sign in to individually. You can sign in with only one TV provider at a time from your Apple TV running tvOS 10 or later versions or from your iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch having iOS 10 or later versions.

These included a touch iPod, a better cellphone and a "breakthrough Internet communications device." Today we know it simply as the iPhone. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) — “We’re going to make some history together today.” With those words on January 9, 2007 — 10 years ago on Monday — Steve Jobs kicked off his presentation to unveil “three revolutionary products.” These included a touch iPod, a better cellphone and a “breakthrough Internet communications device.” Today we know it simply as the iPhone. During the presentation, a group of Apple employees who helped build the original iPhone sat in the audience bracing themselves for disaster. “The memory that I have from that day is doing shots of scotch that we had lined up because the demo was so tenuous,” Andy Grignon, a former Apple employee who was part of the original iPhone team, told CNNMoney. “It wasn’t a sure thing.” After Jobs successfully demoed each feature, the lead designer took a victory shot of scotch. Scrolling through album covers? Shot. Pinch and zoom? Shot. Making a phone call? Shot, shot, shot. “It was this mix of absolute terror and elation,” Grignon said. The presentation went off without a hitch and introduced the world to a product that would indeed make history. A decade later, Apple has sold more than one billion iPhones. The device redefined the smartphone market, gave rise to countless wealthy app developers and propelled Apple to become the world’s most valuable company. In the 2016 fiscal year ending on September 30, Apple’s iPhone sales totaled more than $135 billion, or more than half of its total revenue. The App Store alone, originally created for the iPhone, generated more than $20 billion for developers for the 2016 calendar year. “iPhone set the standard for mobile computing in its first decade and we are just getting started. The best is yet to come,” Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, said in a statement marking the anniversary. But that incredible success wasn’t obvious to everyone at the time. The baseline model of the original iPhone had just 4GB of space, a hefty $499 price tag, a single wireless carrier option and no App Store, despite the objections of Apple employees who wanted to offer one. “In that particular room, those who were pro Apple believed it had another hit,” said Tim Bajarin, a longtime Apple analyst with Creative Strategies, who attended the original launch event. “But there were a lot of other skeptics.” Chief among them: Microsoft’s then CEO Steve Ballmer, who quite literally laughed off the iPhone when asked about his first impressions of it. “That is the most expensive phone in the world and it doesn’t appeal to business customers because it doesn’t have a keyboard, which makes it not a very good email machine,” Ballmer said in one interview. The skeptics were ultimately proven wrong, but a new wave of skepticism abounds about the continued dominance of the iPhone and Apple nowadays. Some early developers who built apps that made the iPhone indispensable to customers are increasingly disheartened as the App Store becomes more crowded and less conducive to building businesses. “The structure of the store hasn’t changed much,” said Loren Brichter, a former Apple employee who worked on the original iPhone before building popular apps like Tweetie and Letterpress. “It’s hard to create an app now that is both genuinely interesting and economically sustainable, so I’m focusing my efforts elsewhere.” Apple’s iPhone sales declined for the first time last year amid concerns about global smartphone market saturation and a sense that the latest iPhone is a dead ringer for the previous two models. That decline pushed Apple’s overall sales below its goal for the 2016 year. Cook and other Apple executives saw their bonuses cut as a result, according to a company filing last week. Apple is widely rumored to be planning a major overhaul of the iPhone for the tenth anniversary edition, likely to be unveiled at its usual launch event in September. That may be enough to reignite interest in the iPhone this year, but a decade after Jobs unveiled those “three revolutionary products,” many are hungering for Apple to unveil another breakthrough device. “[The iPhone] put them in the limelight as being one of the most innovative companies, but it puts a level of expectation on Apple that’s almost impossible to meet in that people want them to do it again,” said Bajarin. “To have another hit like the iPhone would be asking way too much.” Filed in: Nation/World, NewsFix Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Pinterest Reddit LinkedIn Email Connect with Eye Opener!

But now the market has actually launched, we’ve got 12 months of real-world performance and major tech players’ strategies emerging. And that’s changed our views on VR/AR growth. A lot. Our new Augmented/Virtual Reality Report 2017 base case is that Mobile AR could become the primary driver of a $108 billion VR/AR market by 2021 (underperform $94 billion, outperform $122 billion) with AR taking the lion’s share of $83 billion and VR $25 billion. Also Read: 7 Signs Augmented and Virtual Reality Are Ready for the Masses in 2017 What went right (and wrong) last year Let’s start with less than happy times. Facebook (Oculus Rift) and HTC (Vive) had growing pains at launch, whether slower-than-expected shipping or order cancellations. Oculus launched without Touch controllers, which eventually cost $199 instead of being bundled (i.e., non-PC full system costs hit $798 — same as HTC Vive). Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 saw part of its mobile VR ambitions literally go up in smoke, as the new Gear VR was designed to be compatible with that flagship device. Magic Leap also received a boatload of speculation about the tech it used to raise $1.4 billion. Thankfully, Nintendo/The Pokémon Company/Niantic had a breakout success that even they didn’t anticipate. “Pokémon Go” delivered $600 million mobile AR revenue in its first three months alone, making more money through the year than the entire VR games software market in 2016. While this came from a very specific set of circumstances, there have been direct knock-on effects for major tech companies’ mobile AR strategies. As well as Sony’s solid launch of Playstation VR, the quiet achiever last year was Google. It launched its Daydream View mobile VR headset/controller and the first Tango mobile AR phone. What helped even more was Snap’s genius launch of Spectacles, which made wearing goofy future glasses cool again (no more Glassholes) even though it isn’t really AR. Also Read: CES 2017: Hollywood Loves VR More Than Ever, But Watch Out for Augmented Reality All out, all change The absolute performance of VR/AR in 2016 was not as important as how it changed the trajectory of the market. Where at the start of the year we thought 2016 could deliver $4.4 billion VR/AR revenue ($3.8 billion VR, $0.6 billion AR), the launch year’s issues resulted in only $2.7 billion VR revenue. This was counterbalanced by the outperformance of “Pokémon Go” helping AR to an unexpected $1.2 billion revenue, for a total $3.9 billion VR/AR market in 2016 (we were 11 percent optimistic). But the last 12 months have fundamentally reshaped how the market could grow going forward. Virtually the same, but different Mobile VR will still produce the dominant “Explorer” (free up to $100) installed base for VR, with Google Daydream View moving things on from Cardboard days. However Samsung’s troubles last year meant that mobile VR didn’t get off to the flying start it could have. A smaller installed base than expected in 2016 reduces the network effects that platforms need to scale, which could slow things by six to 12 months. Mobile VR is still going to be big, but it might take a little longer to get there. Sony’s Playstation VR launch and Microsoft’s upcoming Windows 10 VR headsets are the boosters VR needs, with consumer price points and performance that work for an “Enthusiast” (less than $400) market. Microsoft’s offering with inside-out tracking (inherited from HoloLens) is a game changer at a $299 price point. Plus, it doesn’t need a brand-new PC to run it, which makes it a genuine consumer product. Facebook and HTC’s higher priced offerings and platform requirements are at risk of being squeezed into a low volume “Specialist” (less than $1,500 total system cost including platform) market by Sony and Microsoft. A deep niche populated by whales, but one that could become a narrow trench unless something can be done about price. Also Read: Why Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality Are 4th Wave for Digital Entertainment (Guest Blog) Augmented by name In response to “Pokemon Go,” Apple’s Tim Cook said that Apple is “high on AR in the long run…continue to invest a lot in this…AR can be huge.” Google’s Sundar Pichai, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft’s Satya Nadella also hailed “Pokemon Go” as a major early win for AR. But there are five big challenges AR needs to conquer for mass consumers: (1) hero device (i.e., an Apple quality device, whether made by Apple or someone else), (2) all-day battery life (3) mobile connectivity, (4) app ecosystem, and (5) telco cross-subsidization. While most attention is paid to what that hero device will look like and when it will get here, two of the other challenges are particularly hard to solve. Until there is a major breakthrough in battery technology, a lightweight pair of AR smartglasses doing heavy-duty AR is hard to power all day without a battery pack or hot swappable batteries (which are fine for enterprise customers, but a harder sell for consumers). This is a non-trivial problem. Plus it’s a major risk for the developer ecosystem to invest heavily in building apps for new platforms until the installed base reaches scale. It’s the perennial chicken-and-egg problem that all new tech platforms face. So where does this leave titans like Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, and all the high-growth AR smartglasses startups? Augmented by nature Mobile AR could conquer the five major challenges for AR to go mass consumer in the short term. Mark Zuckerberg thinks so, “the phone is probably going to be the mainstream consumer platform [where] a lot of these AR features become mainstream, rather than a glasses form factor that people will wear on their face.” Smartphones solve four of the major challenges for mass consumer AR already: all day battery life, mobile connectivity, app ecosystem and telco cross-subsidization. Plus you’re probably reading this on a hero device (iPhone, Samsung or other great Android phone) — it just doesn’t have the sensors and software to be a full AR phone. Yet. “Pokemon Go” is a thin lens into the potential of mobile AR (even if industry insiders don’t like to call it that). The first step to true mobile AR was taken when Google launched its Tango AR phone with Lenovo. While that doesn’t look like the hero device mobile AR needs to take off yet, it points in the direction of the tech that Apple, Samsung and others could use to revitalize innovation and growth in the slowing smartphone market. And this is where mobile AR’s secret weapon comes into play — replacement cycles. It’s free after you’ve paid for it Most developed mobile markets have hit saturation, with sales coming from consumers replacing their phones regularly despite not really needing to. It’s just something that we do. But that replacement cycle has been edging up from under two years toward three years, which is a major headache for Apple, Samsung and others. After nearly a decade of outperformance, Apple saw declining iPhone sales and revenue last year. Samsung’s Kim Gae-youn said it could “secure a baseline profit even if the market stagnates, so long as we don’t make a bad mistake.” And that was before the Galaxy Note 7. Smartphones are a mature market, crying out for innovation to rekindle growth. So it’s no accident that Apple bought Metaio, with speculation in the industry of the core team working in secret deep inside the company. Similarly Samsung’s Sung-Hoon Hong has talked about its “light field engine” that can produce “really, really realistic” holograms that look “really touchable,” and how augmented reality has “much better business development” potential than virtual reality. Qualcomm’s Seshu Madhavapeddy said that its flagship processors could enable phone based AR with significant battery savings and smaller form factors. Neither Apple nor Samsung has said anything specific about their mobile AR plans, but our base assumption is that they could launch AR enabled phones in 2018 (outperform 2017, underperform 2019). Other major phone makers might join them. While there is a chance this could happen in 2017, if an iPhone 7S and Galaxy S8 turn out to be standard phones this year, then next year the iPhone 8 and Galaxy S9 could become the dawn of mass mobile AR. The beauty of this approach is that it doesn’t require consumers to do anything they don’t already do — just replace their iPhones and Samsung phones as usual. If they get everything right, AR phones could become the new hotness to drive mobile growth again. Who wants an old smartphone when you can have a magic window on the world? I want my smartglasses But where (or rather when) are the “true” augmented reality smartglasses we’ve been promised? While you’ll be able to buy your smartglasses from ODG, Meta and others this year, AR smartglasses’ 5 big challenges might not all be resolved before 2019. Smartglasses leaders could remain focused on “Enterprise” (>$1,500 total system costs) and consumer Specialist (<$1,500) markets, until they are able to completely replace your smartphone without a battery pack and also offer a full app ecosystem. For the next few years standalone smartglasses could build a deep high-end market as discretionary purchases independent of the phone you’re going to buy anyway. Smartglasses’ inflection point could come when they begin to cannibalize smartphone sales outright. Apple, Samsung and others could become smartglasses players later (unless Robert Scoble was well informed) as a natural progression from mobile AR, potentially launching them as phone peripherals like smartwatches (only this time cool and disruptive). Google, Facebook, Snap and China’s BAT (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent) could also have big roles to play. So what next? While the market could play out in many ways, let’s look at what major players’ strategies might be. Things could turn out differently, so we’ll revisit as we learn what is (and isn’t) happening. Facebook is the largest single investor in VR/AR after buying Oculus for $2 billion and investing at least $500 million more. The company began telegraphing what might come next by splitting Oculus into PC and mobile divisions and showcasing two different VR social platforms. Oculus’ PC VR division looks set to remain in VR Specialist and Enthusiast markets because of price, so increasingly doesn’t look like a Facebook-sized (i.e., hundreds of millions to billions of users) asset. Facebook could keep the Oculus PC VR division as a high-end test bed to support mobile VR/AR efforts, or spin it out (like Niantic from Google), merge it (potentially consolidating the high-end PC VR market) or sell it outright. Oculus’ mobile VR division is in a prime position to continue running Samsung’s Gear VR appstore and drive Gear VR innovation. Mark Zuckerberg has already said he believes in mobile AR, but as a non-phone maker Facebook could stick to its roots as a software player in that market. Given its track record as a Snap fast follower, we might end up wearing Facebook “Spectacles” too. Apple is the best-placed of all major tech companies to potentially drive mobile AR, with its end-to-end ecosystem of hardware, software, app store, developers and retail. The company has been characteristically enigmatic despite Tim Cook’s stated enthusiasm for AR, but all it needs are a few additional sensors, integrated Metaio software and some serious intent. As above, our base case sees this happening next year (outperform 2017, underperform 2019). For Apple customers, there would be no marginal cost to buying an AR enabled iPhone — they’re going to buy one anyway. Nurturing a growing ecosystem of apps and developers is second nature for Apple, so in the long run smartglasses as an iPhone peripheral might be a logical next step from Apple’s mobile AR efforts. It doesn’t look like Apple will disrupt itself with standalone smartglasses to replace your iPhone just yet (again unless Robert Scoble was well informed. If so, our outperform case comes into play). Samsung is likely to remain a major player in mobile VR, despite what happened with the Galaxy Note 7. But it’s not a full ecosystem play for mobile VR because Facebook runs its Gear VR appstore. Samsung could stick to its hardware roots with mobile AR using similar timing to Apple, with others driving appstores and software in that market too. Also like Apple, AR smartglasses as a Samsung phone peripheral could become a logical progression from mobile AR long-term. Microsoft’s Satya Nadella focused HoloLens AR/mixed reality on the Enterprise market because of its high spec and price, and going mass consumer doesn’t look likely in coming years. So while you could play Minecraft on HoloLens, you’ll only do so as part of “research” at work. Microsoft’s Windows 10 VR is a game changer for the PC/console VR market with its inside-out tracking, low price and basic platform requirements, and the company is staying true to its Windows playbook with partners HP, Dell, Lenovo, Acer and Asus making the hardware. There’s also a good chance Xbox One Scorpio will see a Windows VR headset bundle at launch to drive console VR growth. Yet despite all its assets, Microsoft doesn’t have a focused mobile VR/AR play apart from Minecraft (a big game, but not a platform). Until a clear strategy emerges, Satya Nadella’s Microsoft risks missing the mobile VR/AR platform shift in the same way Steve Ballmer’s Microsoft did with phones. After its misadventures with Glass, Google is doing the Googliest thing possible for VR/AR — everything. For VR Explorers, Cardboard is a low risk entry point for VR and Daydream View could become the mobile VR leader (whether made by Google or others). Google’s approach with Tango (both in-house and with hardware partners) is at the forefront of the impending mobile AR revolution. However, Apple vs Google in mobile VR/AR could end up looking like iOS vs Android: Apple with a hugely profitable end-to-end mobile AR ecosystem, Google enabling a larger open mobile VR/AR ecosystem to drive its core search advertising and Google Play revenues. A good result either way. Speculation about a merged Tango/Daydream standard using Tango sensors for VR might require a new form factor to the current closed back Daydream View, and it’s still too early to make a call on a potential Google Glass 2. The console/PC VR market should also see Sony continue to drive core games revenues with PSVR, while HTC’s Cher Wang could consider how to make the HTC Vive more accessible to a mass consumer audience in terms of price. HTC might also adopt a Facebook-style dual PC/mobile VR strategy and enter mobile AR, but would need to grow its core phone market share to scale. Intel’s Project Alloy all-in-one VR headsets look set to shake up the VR Specialist market when they launch later in the year. And what about all the exciting VR/AR startups (now including Snap)? More on that next time, but from here the only way for VR/AR is up. Roll on, 2017.

The display may have an active region in which display pixels are used to display images. The display may be formed from a flexible display substrate such as an organic light-emitting diode display substrate or other display layers.” The current iPhone 7 makes use of a liquid crystal display (LCD) while the claim hints that the company may for the first time make use of an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display, commonly found in 4K TVs from numerous manufacturers. OLED displays make of use of molecules and light produced by electricity to form a display picture which results in a clearer, sharper image. READ: Apple iPhone 8 rumour mill begins churning OLED also produces a pure black, which results in brighter and more vivid colours, while contrast ratio is also infinite with every pixel of the display self-illuminating. Furthermore the claims that the opposing surface of may have an opening allowing the user to peer through the display.  “The display may have one or more openings and may be mounted in a housing associated with the electronic device,” the patent filed by Apple read. Standard features in the patent that suggest the cryptic technology is for an iPhone are outlined as follows: “An electronic component may be mounted in alignment with the openings in the display. The electronic component may include a camera, a light sensor, a light-based proximity sensor, status indicator lights, a light-based touch sensor array, a secondary display that has display pixels that may be viewed through the openings, antenna structures, a speaker, a microphone, or other acoustic, electromagnetic, or light-based component.” All of which feature in previous iPhone models.  READ: Xiaomi to sell a borderless concept smartphone Chinese electronics manufacturer Xiaomi recently launched its borderless Mi Mix device featuring a display which spans the entire face of the device with the exception of a black panel at the bottom.  The 6.4 inch screen spans 91.3% of the face of the device, with the facing 5 megapixel camera featuring at the bottom of the device and the invisible earpiece working through a piezoelectric ceramic speaker and proximity sensor in the screen. @KyleVenktess on Twitter.

Windows 10 Now Has an Apple Handoff-like Feature GO Cortana lets you pick up from where you left off Jan 13, 2017 06:43 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft rolled out today Windows 10 build 15007 and officially started testing, with help from insiders, a new feature that brings functionality similar to Apple’s very own Handoff. Specifically, the digital assistant Cortana can now let you pick up from where you left off if the feature is enabled with the same account on multiple Windows 10 PCs. For example, if you’re browsing the web with Microsoft Edge on your desktop and then open your laptop, Cortana will let you load the same websites using a notification in the Action Center. For the moment, this feature is limited to just Windows 10 PCs, and Windows 10 Mobile devices are not supported, as compared to Apple’s own implementation which works with both macOS and iOS devices. How Microsoft’s feature works (as compared to Apple’s) Microsoft explains how the new feature works (keep in mind that it’s still in its early days and more improvements should be added in the coming builds, including what could be support for Windows 10 Mobile phones): “If you have multiple PCs, you probably know how cumbersome it can be to find everything you need to resume work after switching between PCs. Cortana can now help with that! When you switch computers, Cortana will display quick links in the Action Center to help you easily get back into the Microsoft Edge websites and SharePoint (or other cloud-based) documents you used most recently.” Currently available in preview stage, picking up from where you left off should become available for all users with the final release of the Creators Update in April. In the case of Apple, Handoff works with Macs, iPhones, iPads, iPods Touch, and even the Apple Watch, as long as these devices are signed in to iCloud with the same Apple ID. Bluetooth must be turned on and some devices also require Wi-Fi to be enabled. Furthermore, Apple is also offering a universal clipboard, which lets you copy text, images, photos, and pretty much any content from one device and paste on another. #Apple#Microsoft#Windows 10#Cortana#Apple Handoff subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Starts Testing Windows 10 “Game Mode” to Boost Gaming Performance What’s New in Windows 10 Build 15007 for Windows Phones Microsoft Rolls Out Windows 10 Build 15007 with Plethora of New Features Windows 10 Home Users Won’t Be Able to Pause Updates in Creators Update It's Now Possible to Use openSUSE Inside Windows 10, Here's How to Install It Barnes & Noble Halts Sales of Nook Tablets Due to Faulty Chargers Android Co-Founder Andy Rubin Working on a Premium Bezel-less Smartphone Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Debian GNU/Linux 8.7 "Jessie" Live & Installable ISOs Now Available for Download - Exclusive Linus Torvalds Announces Fourth Linux 4.10 Kernel Release Candidate, Get It Now Debian Outs First Release Candidate of Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" Installer Sony G3112 and G3221 Smartphones Coming Soon with MediaTek Helio P20 CPUs    Apple Handoff on iPhones New Apps Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool: Detects viruses and other infections that may have reached one's computer with the aid of different scan modes provided by Kaspersky REAPER: A comprehensive software solution that can be used to record, arrange, edit, and render multi-track waveform audio, as well as batch convert files Bitvise SSH Server: Powerful server that helps you get access to your personal computer from a remote location while offering support for Windows groups, virtual accounts, server-side forwarding and unlimited connections Spartan Portable Lite: Easily copy text, images, and links that you can paste at a later date, as well as edit and highlight the contents of any of the available clipboard fields FileLocator Pro: Exhaustively search your computer for all important files, use regex, filter files by attributes and timestamps, generate and save reports SimplexNumerica: Packed with many examples, this well-rounded piece of software enables you to analyze all sorts of data, write C++ code, and create charts, 2D and 3D plots Trend Micro Virus Pattern File: A collection of Virus Pattern Files that are updated to their latest virus database definitions and can help users manually deploy updates to servers and clients Reader comments Microsoft Finally Confirms It’s Working on a Gaming Mode for Windows 10 more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Update your software right away. Registered Developers Can Now Download macOS Sierra 10.12.3 Beta 4 It was only a few days back Apple updated its lineup of beta software for developers, including macOS 10.12.3. Today, Apple is going one step ahead by issuing the fourth beta of its under-development desktop software. And given how quickly the update has arrived, we recommend everyone to download and install it right away on their Macs. Of course, only if you are a developer and have the beta installed in the first place. First of all, make sure you have saved all your work since you will be required to restart your Mac in order to complete the installation. Once that is done, simply connect to a WiFi network and then launch the Mac App Store. The update will be available to download under the Updates tab. Just let the Mac App Store refresh completely before doing so. The installation may take quite a while depending on the type of hardware you have with you. A Mac with a ‘Pro’ moniker along with a SSD will zip right through without any fuss. Others might take a while. If you are looking to download macOS 10.12.3 Beta from scratch, then you can pick up the bits and pieces from the Apple Developer Program website. You will be taken to the Mac App Store in for the final download, however. Advertisement Also, you must have an Apple Developer Program membership at hand in order to access the portal in the first place. The membership will set you back $99 on an annual basis, granting you access to every beta software Apple is currently working in the background on. iOS 10 & macOS Sierra Public Beta 4 Released - Download Now Whether you are a developer or not, we highly recommend updating to the latest macOS 10.12.3 beta immediately for obvious reasons. If Apple pushed out this update in such a short while then it means a critical bug was squashed in the very last minute. Whatever the case might be, hit that download button and be on the latest and greatest. We wil inform our readers whenever macOS 10.12.3 is available to download for the public.

Very few details about the iPhone 8 have been confirmed by the tech giant so far, but rumors have been emerging stating that Apple’s next flagship device would be the company’s most revolutionary product yet. While the specs of the iPhone 8 would most likely be inferior to its top-tier Android counterparts such as the Samsung Galaxy S8, Note 8 and LG G6, Apple seems to be cooking up a number of killer features that would make its premier device truly one of the kind. There was once a time when Apple’s iPhones boasted the most advanced specs of the day. Over the years, however, the Cupertino-based tech giant has steadily been overtaken by its rivals in the smartphone market in terms of both raw power and unique features. The 1GB of RAM in the iPhone 6 is a testament to this, especially since the device was released at a time when its Android rivals boasted at least twice the amount of memory. While this trend might continue with the iPhone 8, the upcoming device’s unique features are rumored to more than make up for the upcoming flagship smartphone’s lack of raw power. Rumors about the iPhone 8 are abounding, but most of them paint a picture of a formidable device that, while lacking in raw specs with its A11 chip and possible 4GB of RAM, could still be a game-changer. Much like the original iPhone that was released back in 2007, the iPhone 8 seems to be a device that is designed to change the smartphone landscape for years to come. This is, of course, speculated to be ushered in by a number of killer features that would debut on the device. [Image by Sean Gallup/Getty Images] One thing that has made headlines about the iPhone 8 is the rumor that the smartphone would feature a revolutionary form of wireless charging. PC Advisor noted that according to speculations, the iPhone 8 would be the first consumer-grade device that would be capable of wirelessly charging itself up to 15 feet away from a charging port. Numerous analysts have already weighed in on the feature, such as KGI Securities’ Ming-Chi Kuo, who stated that long-range wireless charging would be one of the most notable features of the device. Wireless charging might not be new to the smartphone market, but Apple’s approach to the technology appears to be different from its competitors, such as Samsung, whose technologies required the device to be in contact with a charging platform. If Apple could indeed pull a rabbit out of its hat and introduce real long-range charging options for consumers, the iPhone 8 would once more become a device that is truly one of a kind. Another particular feature that has been emerging from the rumor mill is the adoption of a brand new metal frame for the upcoming flagship. The iPhone 8 is speculated to feature a glass front and back, much like the iPhone 4 and 4S from 2010 and 2011, respectively. Unlike its glass-front and backed predecessors, however, a MacRumors report suggested that the iPhone 8 would be far more durable and resistant to damage, thanks to a stainless steel frame. [Image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images] Apple has adopted an aluminum frame since the debut of the iPhone 6. While the metal frame made the device extremely thin and sleek, it also made the iPhone prone to bending and scratching. This eventually culminated in the notorious “Bendgate” issue, where iPhone 6S Plus units were found by consumers to bend with normal use. While the bending issue has been addressed in the iPhone 6S Plus that was released the following year, the stigma of a flimsy, bending iPhone has never really left Apple. Thus, with the return of a sturdy glass and metal design, Apple might end up making the iPhone 8 into one of its most durable mobile devices yet. Couple this with the rumor that the iPhone 8 would feature a wraparound OLED display, and the device becomes even more attractive for avid Apple fans and conventional consumers alike. Lastly, the addition of a color that is codenamed “Ferrari” is also something that seems to be in the works, allowing Apple to expand its devices’ color palette even further. The iPhone 8 is a device that is designed to break the innovation slump that Apple has been suffering from during the last few years. Since the release of the iPhone 6 back in 2014, the improvements in the Cupertino giant’s smartphones have been pretty basic and understated at best. While this is a safe route for the tech giant, the fact that its rivals, such as Samsung and LG, are experimenting with new concepts is something that Apple immediately needs to address. If rumors about the iPhone 8 ring true and the device does get released with revolutionary new features, Apple could once more establish itself as the undisputed leader in the smartphone market.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News US appeals court revives antitrust lawsuit against Apple US appeals court revives antitrust lawsuit against Apple A lower court sided with Apple, but Judge William A. Fletcher ruled that iPhone users purchase apps directly from Apple. By: Reuters | San Francisco | Published:January 13, 2017 11:39 am A lower court sided with Apple, but Judge William A. Fletcher ruled that iPhone users purchase apps directly from Apple. iPhone app purchasers may sue Apple Inc over allegations that the company monopolized the market for iPhone apps by not allowing users to purchase them outside the App Store, leading to higher prices, a US appeals court ruled on Thursday. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruling revives a long-simmering legal challenge originally filed in 2012 taking aim at Apple’s practice of only allowing iPhones to run apps purchased from its own App Store. A group of iPhone users sued saying the Cupertino, California, company’s practice was anticompetitive. Apple had argued that users did not have standing to sue it because they purchased apps from developers, with Apple simply renting out space to those developers. Developers pay a cut of their revenues to Apple in exchange for the right to sell in the App Store. A lower court sided with Apple, but Judge William A. Fletcher ruled that iPhone users purchase apps directly from Apple, which gives iPhone users the right to bring a legal challenge against Apple. Apple declined to comment. The courts have yet to address the substance of the iPhone users’ allegations; up this point, the wrangling has been over whether they have the right to sue Apple in the first place. But if the challenge ultimately succeeds, “the obvious solution is to compel Apple to let people shop for applications wherever they want, which would open the market and help lower prices,” Mark C. Rifkin, an attorney with Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz representing the group of iPhone users, told Reuters in an interview. “The other alternative is for Apple to pay people damages for the higher than competitive prices they’ve had to pay historically because Apple has utilized its monopoly.” The case is Pepper et al v. Apple Inc., case number 4:11-cv-06714 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

 Apple is the greenest tech company in the world, according to Greenpeace Dana Varinsky Jan. 10, 2017, 12:01 AM 3,299 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Images/Chip Somodevilla For the third year in a row, Apple has been deemed the most environmentally friendly of the world’s major tech companies, according to a new report from environmental organization Greenpeace. Apple, along with Google and Facebook — the other highest scorers in the report — made a pledge in 2012 to to transition to 100% renewable energy. Its new headquarters, which are currently under construction, will run completely on renewable energy, with an estimated 700,000 square feet of solar panels. According to the report, Apple has “played a catalytic role within its IT supply chain, pushing other IT data center and cloud operators who help deliver pieces of Apple’s corner of the internet to follow their lead in powering their operations with renewable energy.” Greenpeace has been measuring the energy performance of the information technology sector since 2009, and its newest report states that the organization has seen a significant increase in the degree to which the largest internet companies prioritize renewables. According to the report, the energy footprint of the IT sector is currently estimated to account for 7% of global electricity. But since global internet traffic is expected to rise threefold by 2020 — and with it the sector’s energy footprint — company commitments to and plans for sustainability will become even more important. Greenpeace’s report notes that Apple and Google continue to lead the sector in matching their growth with an equivalent or larger supply of renewable energy. The report assigned Apple the overall grade of A - in the subcategories, the company got As in energy transparency, renewable energy commitment, energy efficiency and mitigation, and renewable procurement, wit its only B in the advocacy category. It’s clean energy index, calculated based on estimates of facilities’ power demand, was an impressive 83%. Google got As in all subcategories except for energy transparency (where it got a B), though its clean energy index was lower at 56%. A newcomer to Greenpeace’s list of top scorers was Nevada-based telecommunications company Switch, which develops data centers. The company was the clear leader in the report’s ranking of colocation and content delivery network companies, with all A’s and a whopping 100% clean energy index. Netflix, on the other hand, stood out with notably unimpressive scores. The report estimates that Netflix’s video streaming accounts for a third of internet traffic on North American networks, but the company received an overall grade of D, with Fs in three of five subcategories. The report points out that Netflix has not given any public commitment to renewable energy, and that “unlike other major video streaming platforms such as Apple, Facebook, or Google, Netflix does not regularly provide energy consumption data, greenhouse gas emissions, or the actual energy mix of its global operations.” The streaming company will have to make some changes if it wants a better grade next year.

Also, tvOS apps can use ‘On-Demand Resources’ to host up to 20GB of additional content on the App Store. Aiming to help users enjoy instant access to video apps that their pay TV subscription includes, Apple last year launched a new iOS single sign-on tool to log in to cable or satellite-TV provider on your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Apple TV. “The new feature is available in the US only and can be used on CenturyLink Prism, DirecTV, Dish, GVTC, GTA, Hawaiian Telcom, Hotwire, MetroCast, Sling,” Apple said. Even if your provider supports single sign-on, there still might be apps that you need to open and sign in to individually. You can sign in with only one TV provider at a time from your Apple TV running tvOS 10 or later versions or from your iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch having iOS 10 or later versions. –IANS anuj/sm/vm Tags App Store launched TV used CanIndia New Wire Service Related Posts Japanese whaling boat caught operating illegally in Australian waters Jan 15th, 201703 Sydney, Jan 16 (IANS) A Japanese whaling boat was allegedly caught operating illegally in Australian...

The nonsense suit claims Apple holds an illegal monopoly over app sales for iOS. A lower court had ruled the class had no standing to sue, but the 9th Circuit’s ruling reverses the decision, allowing the case to proceed. The Case The class suing Apple argues that Apple’s illegal monopoly on apps for iOS devices is anticompetitive. The argument goes that if users could just download apps from anywhere, prices would be lower. “The obvious solution is to compel Apple to let people shop for applications wherever they want, which would open the market and help lower prices,” Mark C. Rifkin, an attorney with Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz representing the group of iPhone users, told Reuters in an interview. “The other alternative is for Apple to pay people damages for the higher than competitive prices they’ve had to pay historically because Apple has utilized its monopoly.” My Response To which I say, go *&^% yourself, Mr. Rifkin. App Store prices are rock bottom as it is, and the security benefits of Apple’s walled garden are obvious and of enormous value. If Apple had a monopoly on smartphones, I would have substantially more empathy for the principles behind this case. Principles not involving attorney fees, that is. But Apple has a minority share of said market, making “monopoly” concerns a non-issue. Users wanting an open market for apps have plenty of choices, including the malware-infested cesspool that is Android. Things to Note Tuesday’s ruling is about standing—as noted by Reuters—and not the merits of the case. Apple’s attorneys have so far focused on standing—meaning the right of someone to sue—and not the case itself. I don’t believe closed systems and walled gardens like Apple’s Whole Widget model have been tested in court. If someone knows better than me, please chime in below.

January 12, 2017 at 7:06 EST PM brilor January 12, 2017 I’ve been wondering if this would happen. Clearly, users can choose Android phones but I think the point is iPhone users have no choice where to purchase an app once they’ve purchased an iPhone. Is that enough to call it a monopoly? I’m not an attorney, so my opinion should be considered skeptically at best. It’s easy to find non-electronic products ( shoes – you can buy laces wherever you want, clothing – you can buy replacement buttons wherever ) but not sure about a similar electronic product. The competition among developers within the App Store keeps prices low and it’s hard to imagine them lower. Indie developers struggle to compete and stay in business even at these prices. Should be interesting to read the court arguments. Brian January 12, 2017 at 7:29 EST PM furbies January 12, 2017 [quote] To which I say, go *&^% yourself, Mr. Rifkin.

What a bunch of A$$hats! January 12, 2017 at 10:17 EST PM RonMacGuy January 13, 2017 Well, wasn’t there a legal decision years ago that jail breaking an iPhone was deemed legal? So, technically, iDevice owners can jail break their iDevice legally and at will and can then install whatever apps they want to from wherever they want to find them. Case dismissed. January 13, 2017 at 4:45 EST PM gnasher729 January 13, 2017 No, _legally_ iDevice owners can jailbreak their devices, but _technically_ Apple does what they can to prevent this from happening (with good legitimate reasons). However, iDevice owners _can_ sell their phone and buy an Android or Windows phone and install apps from somewhere else, so still case dismissed.

Tags xiaomi's marketing Business Xiaomi CEO admits it grew too fast, targets $20 billion revenue in 2017 CNBC | Arjun Kharpal | Friday, Jan 13, 2017 Xiaomi has grown "too fast" in the past few years leading to challenges in the business, the chief executive of the start-up often dubbed "China's Apple" said on Thursday, as it targets 100 billion yuan (S$20.7 billion) in revenue this year. Photo: Facebook/chinadaily Arjun Kharpal CNBC Friday, Jan 13, 2017 Xiaomi has grown "too fast" in the past few years leading to challenges in the business, the chief executive of the start-up often dubbed "China's Apple" said on Thursday, as it targets 100 billion yuan (S$20.7 billion) in revenue this year. CNBC understands that the company has never hit the 100 billion yuan target before. The technology firm - which is valued at around US$45 billion (S$64.26 billion), according to numerous reports - was once the darling of the smartphone world, showing triple-digit growth and challenging the likes of Samsung and Apple. But it has been struggling in the past two years and has since looked to branch into new areas. "2016 was a year in which we took time to catch our breaths and slow our rapid pace to make essential adjustments to our business that will enable us to go further," Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun said in a letter to staff on Tuesday. 331934 2016-10-11 11:52:10 Photo Gallery Xiaomi's new store in Singapore Source: Mi Singapore Still, Lei called 2016 an "exceptional" year and listed the achievements of the nearly seven-year old start-up: - Xiaomi has innovated with the hardware on its flagship Mi 5 smartphone and applied for over 16,000 patents globally, of which 3,612 have been granted - The company has opened 54 Mi Home retail stores to-date, three of which have passed 100 million yuan in gross merchandising volume, a key retail metric. Xiaomi said it aims to open 200 more Mi Home stores in 2017, and a total of 1,000 over the next three years - Xiaomi's India business surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue for the first time, as it looks to expand into markets beyond China - It's other products including smart TVs and smart routers crossed 15 billion yuan in sales in 2016 - Xiaomi said its internet services business saw revenues double in 2016 - The start-up also said that it had improved "organizational efficiency", including reorganising the smartphone hardware team in May Xiaomi 'left behind' Xiaomi's started as a smartphone business and quickly became a major player. But it very quickly lost ground to more nimble players. Xiaomi is estimated to have shipped around 62 million smartphone units in 2016, down from 72 million the year before, while its global market share fell to 4 per cent from 5 per cent, according to Counterpoint research. In China, which accounts for about 90 per cent of its smartphone sales, according to analysts, it was overtaken by players such as Oppo, Vivo and Huawei who favoured selling through physical stores rather than online, like Xiaomi did. "Until 2015, when Xioami reached its peak, they were doing well in China, but China was more than 90 per cent of their total volume globally. So it was a one trick pony market for Xiaomi," Neil Shah, research director of devices and ecosystems at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC by phone. "If Xiaomi's performance remained good in China, they would have still grown year-over-year. But that was not the case. Oppo, Vivo and Huawei in 2016 left Xiaomi behind. Their global growth was curtailed and they didn't expand in newer markets." 'Extremely promising' 2017 Xiaomi originally found strong growth by selling via online channels and creating hype via social media. But the company admitted that this no longer is the only effective method and therefore has pledged to open more bricks and mortar stores. Lei wrote that that online smartphone market only makes up 20 per cent of overall sales. "Xiaomi has great ambitions, and we are not satisfied with just being an e-commerce smartphone brand, so we have to upgrade our retail model, and incorporate offline retail for a new retail strategy," Lei said. But the CEO ended the letter on a positive note suggesting that 2017 looks "extremely promising" with the company looking to focus on artificial intelligence, internet finance and the goal of hitting 100 million yuan in sales. "It is a challenging road ahead, and we must overcome the difficulties as we work towards our dream," Lei said. "In the first few years, we pushed ahead too fast. We created a miracle, but also drew on some long-term growth. So we have to slow down, further improve in some areas, and ensure sustainable growth for a long-term future," Lei said in the letter.
