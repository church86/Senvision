These companies aren’t adding thousands of new workers like Amazon. “Instead, Macy’s plans to close 100 stores to improve profitability, and Sears has sold its Craftsman tools line for roughly $900 million to raise cash. “Conceivably, one or both of these historic chains could go bankrupt,” writes Samuelson. There there’s the news that The Limited is closing all its 250 stores, and Kmart, owned by Sears, continues to reduce its retail footprint with store closings. In theory, this kind of downsizing could lead to a happier outcome, as these companies become more efficient. But Samuelson points out that it hasn’t worked that way in this industry. “What’s puzzling about this episode of creative destruction is that we’ve gotten much pain but are still waiting for the gain,” writes Samuelson. “Instead of improving, productivity growth has slowed dramatically.” As he puts it, “people no longer buy everything in stores, but stores are still necessary. (In 2016, e-commerce totaled about 8 percent of retail sales.) Still, the loss of sales makes brick-and-mortar stores less productive, and their loss of productivity offsets some or all of the gains from digital technologies,” he writes. “This is, I think, the basic explanation of what’s happening at Macy’s and Sears. They have to invest in the new technology, even as the value of the old technology erodes. The effect is compounded because they’ve been slow to shut marginal stores. There’s always the hope that these stores will bounce back and avoid large losses.” Must be nice to be Amazon, which doesn’t have to worry about legacy assets like stores.

By: Samden Sherpa Updated: Saturday, January 14, 2017, 11:24 [IST] Have you ever wondered who created the famous Android System? Well, many of us might not really know since it has been more than a decade when Android was first launched and the creator also has been working silently behind the scenes. However, according to a recent report the creator of Android OS is set to make the headlines again. While it has just been over two years after leaving Google, Andy Rubin, yes the creator of Android OS, is preparing to take on the smartphone industry. As per the new report, he plans to reveal his new company, Essential, in the coming days. SEE ALSO: A new Motorola phone teased to launch at the MWC 2017 Also, Essential is rumored to be launching a high-end bezel-less smartphone to compete with flagships from Apple and Google. Let's get some deeper insights about the developer and the phone. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! High-end Smartphone As Bloomberg notes, Armed with about a 40-person team, filled with recruits from Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Rubin is preparing to announce a new company and serve as its Chief Executive Officer, citing unnamed sources with the matter. It also reports that the company has designed a platform to tie multiple devices together, and is working on a suite of consumer hardware products, including ones for the mobile and smart home markets. From what has been revealed it looks like the centerpiece of the company will be a high-end smartphone with a large edge-to-edge screen that lacks a surrounding bezel. And, Rubin has already discussed the smartphone with mobile carrier executives just a few days back at Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Unique Features On the other hand, the smartphone is still in the prototyping stage but it is aimed at the top of the market where Apple Inc.'s iPhone and Google's Pixel reside. The smartphone is expected to include high-end materials and the ability to gain new hardware features over time. Reports also say that Rubin's company is experimenting with enabling the phone's screen to sense different levels of pressure, similar to an iPhone and the company's engineering team is also testing an industrial design with metal edges and a back made of ceramic, which is more difficult to manufacture than typical smartphone materials. SEE ALSO: Nokia 6 receives 250,000 registrations in 24 Hours Essential's engineers are developing a proprietary connector that serves double duty for charging the battery and expanding the phone's functionality. The smartphone has also been deemed to come with a magnetic connector that would allow hardware accessories to be attached which will add additional features to the smartphone. According to sources, Rubin's engineers are working on a sphere-shaped camera add-on that shoots high-resolution 360-degree photographs. Confirmation Rubin is planning to put the phone on sale around the middle of this year for a price close to that of an iPhone 7, although the plans are still in flux. All these developments come after Rubin registering Essential Products Inc. with California regulators in November 2015. In 2016, the company also registered "Essential" with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, listing smartphones, tablets, accessories and "computer operating software for mobile phones" among its goods and services. However, whether the devices will run on software based on Android is still a mystery. SEE ALSO: Take a Look at the Must-have Apps that Ensure Women Safety Funds and Investments Rubin co-founded Android in 2003 and Google acquired the company in 2005 before officially launching the first version of the OS in 2008. Rubin remained with Google in its Android division until 2013, when he moved over to its robotics unit. In 2014, Rubin departed Google entirely and in 2015 he formed his own tech hardware incubator called Playground Global. The company occupies a sprawling warehouse in Silicon Valley Bloomberg has reported that the incubator has raised a total of $300 million so far from a number of investors, including Google, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., and HP. The company is in talks with Foxconn to manufacture the new smartphone from Essential. Click Here for New Smartphones Best Online Deals Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

The company is reportedly gearing up to boost its original programming efforts with plans to release a series of scripted television shows and (perhaps even) movies later this year. The Wall Street Journal reports the Cupertino behemoth has set sights on enriching its Apple Music offerings with new original content, slated to arrive by the end of 2017. Apple executives have purportedly told Hollywood its foray into video streaming will be focused on high-quality series. Ever been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE Rumors suggesting the tech titan might be going Hollywood first started appearing back in 2015, when the company was reportedly looking into producing entertainment content. Things ultimately never panned out though. Last year, Apple was said to be mulling over buying out Time Warner in an effort to ramp up its production ambitions, but negotiations eventually came to a halt. Interestingly, The Wall Street Journal speculates that with the move towards original programming, the Cupertino heavyweight aims to take on Spotify rather than larger video streaming contenders like Netflix and Amazon Prime. Because it is looking at just a handful of carefully selected shows, and potentially films, it doesn’t appear Apple is preparing to spend the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars it would need to spend annually to become a direct competitor to Netflix Inc., Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Video or premium cable networks. Rather, it would escalate the arms race between Apple Music and Spotify, which both offer essentially the same catalog of tens of millions of songs, by adding other content that could distinguish Apple’s service. Hopefully this time around the iPhone-maker has something better to offer than its previously rumored show about the app economy headlined by living meme Will.i.am – or the auto-biographical drama series about the life of hip-hop icon Dr. Dre. via MacRumors Apple Sets Its Sights on Hollywood With Plans for Original Content on The Walls Street Journal Read next: Google's Toontastic 3D lets kids (and adults) create storytelling cartoons Apple Share on Facebook (66) Share on Twitter (194) Mix is a reporter from Amsterdam.

X Fitness trackers: the good, the bad and the ugly of wearable tech When it comes to our health, more knowledge may not always be a good thing Sat, Jan 14, 2017, 06:01 Jennifer O'Connell More and more people are using smart watches and health apps to monitor their lifestyle. Photograph: Getty Images         My heart soared when Ireland beat the All-Blacks in rugby in November this year. I don’t just mean that metaphorically – I have the data to prove it. At 10pm on November 5th, as the Ireland versus New Zealand rugby game entered its final moments, my heart was beating a healthy 66 times per minute. At 10.06pm, as the full-time whistle blew in Chicago, in my sitting room some 5,800 km away, my heartbeat leapt to 121 times per minute. One minute later, it had dropped back to 88. I know all this because I am the owner of an Apple Watch. Apple launched its first smartwatch 18 months ago, and already it has become the second highest revenue generating watch in the world, after Rolex. Despite reports of disappointing sales, around 12 million Apple watches are thought to be in circulation worldwide. One of them has spent the past 12 months on my left wrist, where it has taken up residence as a kind of portable personal assistant-slash-nanny-slash-Star Trek-style phone. It is a notifications centre and a nifty, car-safe GPS device. I can take calls on it when I’m driving, without taking my eyes off the road or my hands off the steering wheel – invariably prompting me to shout: “Look, kids, it’s the future!” It is a pedometer and a health monitor, nagging me by way of regular, soft vibrations on my wrist to drink water, to stand, to meditate, and to meet my daily calorie and exercise target (170 calories and 30 minutes of daily brisk exercise). But most of all, it is a shockingly comprehensive health database. Over the past year, while I’ve been going about my business, my watch has quietly been recording details of my steps, my calorific output, my sleep cycles – and all of the moments of heartbreak and happiness. At a glance, should I feel the need, I can find out how many steps I took in the month of April, or my heartrate at, say, 7.36pm on March 13th. It could also record my body temperature, my respiratory rate, my reproductive health, my UV exposure, my willingness to be an organ donor and even my sexual activity. ADVERTISEMENT Currently, one in 10 people in the US owns a health tracker such as a Fitbit or an Apple Watch. According to Google’s 2016 Connected Consumer Survey, 5 per cent of Irish people have a wearable device. Valuable data Over the next decade, adoption of these devices will become far more widespread, alongside sensors and apps that can monitor your body for signs of the onset of illness and chronic stress. We may not even need to remember to charge and wear a watch: smart pills are being developed that when swallowed will measure your health from inside your body, transmitting it to the cloud. Contact lenses will monitor us for signs of diabetes. Future generations of Apple Watches, Fitbits, or Android Wear gadgets will detect and mitigate “adverse health events,” such as addiction relapse, according to a recent report published by the MIT Technology Review. The reason tech companies are pouring so much money into this is not – whatever they might claim – that they are on a mission to save lives, or even to ensure we get our 10,000 steps a day (an entirely arbitrary number, by the way). It’s the data, stupid. Our health data is an increasingly valuable commodity, and – chillingly – a recent report by the Center for Digital Democracy and American University warned that there are almost “no privacy safeguards in place for consumer health data”, with multiple industries are ready and willing to mine it for profit. Irish users are protected by the more rigorous data protection environment in Europe. According to Rob Corbet of Arthur Cox, writing in a report from November 2015, there is no firm consensus between Europe and the US “on how to apply privacy rules in a manner that strikes the right balance between encouraging product innovation and protecting user security and privacy” as wearable and Internet of Things technologies evolve. Users in Europe may be asked to specifically consent to the storage of their data – in much the same way as we have to consent to allow cookies to record our movements online. In December, Apple began asking Watch users to opt into anonymous data collection about workouts and activity information. Internationally, a number of employers and insurers have seized on wearable tech and health apps as a way to encourage healthy choices by workers and – the theory goes – cut down on sick days and insurance costs. In the UK, insurance companies are offering cut-price Apple Watches to customers who sign up to a data monitoring program. There are studies to suggest that when it comes to our health, more knowledge may not always be a good thing. An article in the British Medical Journal questioned whether the proliferation of health apps now on the market is, in fact, responsible for an increase in patient stress levels. Wearing a smart watch has certainly made me a bit more hypochondriac: before this year, I don’t think I had ever used the phrase “resting heart rate”. Consultant dietitian Paula Mee, who no longer wears a fitness tracker, says that when she began monitoring her activity with a Jawbone, she found that she was only managing 2,000 to 3,000 steps a day – a finding that was “more dispiriting than motivating”. “Anything that helps people to move is useful, but I do think we could improve it and help people to use the data in a more meaningful way, to set personal goals for themselves. You might only burn off 200 or 300 carlories, but your muscle mass is developing and your visceral fat is decreasing. so part of the challenge is helping people to understand the benefits of exercise, even when the numbers being recorded on their tracker seem low.” ADVERTISEMENT Dr Deirdre Plant, a Waterford-based GP, agrees that more awareness “can only be a positive thing. Obesity is a huge issue for our generation. For the few people who might obsess about it, this technology will be worth it if it stops many more of us being in denial,” she says. “We’ll say we walk three times a week, but we’ll forget that this week we didn’t actually manage to walk once. So a fitness tracker, used properly, can be a good tool.” So has my year of quantified health made me any, well, healthier? The short answer: probably. Looking over my data, I can see that my exercise level increased over the course of the year, from a daily average of a paltry 16 minutes of brisk exercise in the first six months, up to around 24 minutes in the second half. But that may be more to do with a shift in my lifestyle than a conscious choice: halfway through the year, I moved from car-reliant California home to rural Ireland. When the vibrations nudge me to have a glass of water or to stand for one minute, I will often obey. And in return for for the small amount of additional worrying I do about my lack of restful sleep – or whether the repository of data I’m unconsciously gathering in my phone’s health app will one day come back to haunt me – I glean a deep, visceral pleasure from seeing my calorie and activity circles complete, or when I set my watch to time a bike ride or a hike. Unfortunately, the one thing it hasn’t managed to improve is my reprehensible time keeping. That may be beyond even a smartwatch. 10 of the best fitness trackers Apple Watch 2: The Apple Watch Series 2 – a waterproof version – is now available. €349; apple.com/ie Fitbit Blaze: Full activity tracker and heart rate monitor which offers call, text and calendar notifications and on-screen workouts.

According to Ian Fogg, director at market research firm IHS, Apple creates so good products that it always competes with its previously launched products. “They set their own stands. But, there has been no Apple product with greater impact than the iPhone, for Apple, for the mobile industry, and because of the spread of mobile technology, for the whole technology industry,” Fogg said. The original iPhone included multiple innovations including a direct manipulation multi-touch interface and desktop PC class web browser and other built in apps such as Google Maps, Apple Mail, and calendar and contacts. This caused every other mobile handset maker to alter their products. Apple also innovated quickly, using an annual update cycle to the iPhone hardware and software to outpace many rivals, Fogg said. In the ten years since the iPhone’s announcement there are numerous changes directly or indirectly caused by the iPhone, Fogg claims and here are just a few of the important one: 1)The leading handset makers of 2007 – number one Nokia among them – have been replaced by Apple, Samsung and Huawei. 2) The leading smartphone operating systems of 2007 are no longer with us, including Symbian, BlackBerry, Palm, and Windows CE. Read: Apple might launch three new iPads in March this year 3)The smartphone has moved from a product with niche adoption to one which everyone owns. 4) Multi-touch interfaces have become mainstream, not only on smartphones, but on PCs and tablets as well. 5) Apps have become mainstream, replacing websites for many uses, because of Apple’s success of creating an easy profitable way to distribute apps; and, other companies have used the same model, including the Google Play store and Microsoft’s Windows PC app store. Read: As Apple’s iPhone turns 10 today, Cook says just getting started 6) The smartphone has become the hub for consumers’ digital lives, replacing the PC. In 2007, every hardware product connected to the PC, now everything connects to smartphones. 7) Technologies pioneered in smartphones have enabled the creation of new products, from tablets, to smartwatches, fitness trackers and TV streaming boxes such as Apple TV. Companies making mobile hardware and software such as ARM, Facebook and Google, have prospered, at the expense of competitors who have failed to succeed in mobile such as Intel and Microsoft. 9) The aspirational business model for technology companies has changed from licensing an operating system and allowing others to build hardware – like the classic PC business model – has been replaced with efforts to replicate Apple’s tight integration of hardware and software.

By: Samden Sherpa Updated: Saturday, January 14, 2017, 11:24 [IST] Have you ever wondered who created the famous Android System? Well, many of us might not really know since it has been more than a decade when Android was first launched and the creator also has been working silently behind the scenes. However, according to a recent report the creator of Android OS is set to make the headlines again. While it has just been over two years after leaving Google, Andy Rubin, yes the creator of Android OS, is preparing to take on the smartphone industry. As per the new report, he plans to reveal his new company, Essential, in the coming days. SEE ALSO: A new Motorola phone teased to launch at the MWC 2017 Also, Essential is rumored to be launching a high-end bezel-less smartphone to compete with flagships from Apple and Google. Let's get some deeper insights about the developer and the phone. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! High-end Smartphone As Bloomberg notes, Armed with about a 40-person team, filled with recruits from Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Rubin is preparing to announce a new company and serve as its Chief Executive Officer, citing unnamed sources with the matter. It also reports that the company has designed a platform to tie multiple devices together, and is working on a suite of consumer hardware products, including ones for the mobile and smart home markets. From what has been revealed it looks like the centerpiece of the company will be a high-end smartphone with a large edge-to-edge screen that lacks a surrounding bezel. And, Rubin has already discussed the smartphone with mobile carrier executives just a few days back at Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Unique Features On the other hand, the smartphone is still in the prototyping stage but it is aimed at the top of the market where Apple Inc.'s iPhone and Google's Pixel reside. The smartphone is expected to include high-end materials and the ability to gain new hardware features over time. Reports also say that Rubin's company is experimenting with enabling the phone's screen to sense different levels of pressure, similar to an iPhone and the company's engineering team is also testing an industrial design with metal edges and a back made of ceramic, which is more difficult to manufacture than typical smartphone materials. SEE ALSO: Nokia 6 receives 250,000 registrations in 24 Hours Essential's engineers are developing a proprietary connector that serves double duty for charging the battery and expanding the phone's functionality. The smartphone has also been deemed to come with a magnetic connector that would allow hardware accessories to be attached which will add additional features to the smartphone. According to sources, Rubin's engineers are working on a sphere-shaped camera add-on that shoots high-resolution 360-degree photographs. Confirmation Rubin is planning to put the phone on sale around the middle of this year for a price close to that of an iPhone 7, although the plans are still in flux. All these developments come after Rubin registering Essential Products Inc. with California regulators in November 2015. In 2016, the company also registered "Essential" with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, listing smartphones, tablets, accessories and "computer operating software for mobile phones" among its goods and services. However, whether the devices will run on software based on Android is still a mystery. SEE ALSO: Take a Look at the Must-have Apps that Ensure Women Safety Funds and Investments Rubin co-founded Android in 2003 and Google acquired the company in 2005 before officially launching the first version of the OS in 2008. Rubin remained with Google in its Android division until 2013, when he moved over to its robotics unit. In 2014, Rubin departed Google entirely and in 2015 he formed his own tech hardware incubator called Playground Global. The company occupies a sprawling warehouse in Silicon Valley Bloomberg has reported that the incubator has raised a total of $300 million so far from a number of investors, including Google, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., and HP. The company is in talks with Foxconn to manufacture the new smartphone from Essential. Click Here for New Smartphones Best Online Deals Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

Rumours of the next or the upcoming iPhone (iPhone 8) had begun to surface, but there was a bit of a confusion, because there were so many of them along with analysts hinting at some unbelievable stuff (coming from Apple). Which is when eventually we had a bit of a Eureka moment when Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI Securities predicted that Apple was expected to bring in a smartphone with a all-glass design to the game. Hinting that those leaked patents of an iPhone with a wrap around display would only arrive by 2018. Turns out there were rumours not just about the iPhone 8 but the iPhone 9 as well. As far as the latest iPhone 8 rumours go, its does not seem that exciting. While leaked patents have popped up from time to time, they are not as inspiring as the ones we have recently seen from Samsung with new form factors (the Galaxy X1). So with a curved OLED display, a sandwiched glass design with a forged steel chassis in the middle, and an ultrasonic fingerprint reader, will it be enough for Apple to stay on top of the premium smartphone market? This time around we asked the analyst Kiranjeet Kaur, Research Manager, Client Devices, IDC Asia/Pacific for her opinion and she had plenty to comment on. Samsung has been using smartphones with Super AMOLED displays for long. In fact, if the rumours turn out to be true Samsung along with LG would be launching a couple of smartphones with folding OLED displays as well. So why is Apple so late to the game? “Unlike other smartphone vendors who have a limited number of flagship phones supporting top-end specs, iPhones have the limitation or advantage that the specs in its two models (regular and phablet) are largely the same.” said Kaur hinting that Apple unlike other manufacturers produces only premium smartphones. “This means that Apple would need to secure a fairly large supply of OLED displays if and when it decides to bring an OLED display to the iPhone. So obviously Apple would need to wait till it is able to obtain the required number of OLED screens from its suppliers.” She commented that Apple already a formula like nobody else, “Apple has always tried to stay clear of hardware comparisons and has often not been the first one to launch a particular tech/feature. Rather it strives or so it seems to be more focused on the user experience of it. ” “It is not just the specific feature but rather the use case which becomes the defining factor. An example would be the curved screen in some of the Samsung ‘edge’ phones, which did create some hype for the Samsung phones and also helped drive some sales, but didn’t really create any significant use case for the consumer.” But Apple still lags behind when it comes to some features like quick charging, wireless charging and more that we could see in the upcoming iPhone. Wireless charging becomes more evident when you consider that Apple decided to go with a glass back this year instead of a metal one that simply did not make it possible since the iPhone 5. We could see Apple playing catch up with the Android realm in 2017 indeed. But then there’s virtual reality a feature that is expected to make some waves this year because Google decided to officially bring it to mobile with Daydream. So will Apple need AR to step ahead of the game this year? The IDC reasearcher gave a good reason why Apple would not leapfrog into this one. “While Apple’s entry into AR/VR space would signal its leadership in the smartphone industry, where it is currently lagging behind some of its competitors is AI. Making Siri smarter and getting it to redefine the way we interact with our iPhone and all an iPhone can do at a mere command, should set Apple in the front seat.” An iPhone 7 Plus with a zoom lens at the back was not exact a step ahead in image quality, but it good enough to be used frequently. But with Apple who has gradually turned from innovator to follower, 10 years is very long shelf life for the iPhone and the cracks have begun to show. The design of the iPhone has not changed in the past three iterations and while many do not have issues with it, it is getting a bit stale coming from a trendsetter. So I asked Kiranjeet whether Apple could be looking at moulding a new product like it did with the iPod (into an iPhone) back in 2007. The IDC research manager who examines competitive trends and studies end user trends had something really interesting to comment on, “I think there is still a lot of scope on what we can do with the smartphones, think about its use as a personal assistant, or the AR/VR capabilities and respective use cases. We could look at standalone devices for these but I see a lot of potential if the smartphones (or an iPhone in this case) could bring some of these capabilities in the phone itself.” Apple’s iPhone this year, may turn out to be the most polished piece of hardware it has every produced. It could have Siri to control and do everything and even do AR as CEO, Tim Cook as been hinting. It will stay the same iPhone, with the same set of icons and badges. However, Apple with a few tweaks may simply aim at changing the way we use it and as Apple has proved time and again, it just may be enough to take it to the top.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Download: iOS 10.2.1 Beta 4 Now Available By Uzair Ghani Posted Jan 12, 2017 5Shares Share Tweet Submit The fourth beta of iOS 10.2.1 has been released. The new pre-release build arrives a few days after beta 3 was published. Apple Releases New iOS 10.2.1 Beta Build for Developers It seems as though Apple has stumbled upon an important bug in its software, forcing it to release new beta builds for its mobile and desktop operating systems. A while back, the company unleashed the fourth beta build of macOS Sierra 10.2.3, and now, iOS 10.2.1 Beta 4 has been released for registered developers. If you have a previous beta already installed on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, then you can jump onboard the fourth beta with utmost ease. Simply connect your device to a stable WiFi connection, launch the Settings app, navigate to General > Software Update and install the latest update from there. The installation won’t take that long either, just make sure to leave your device on charge while everything is in progress. Although Apple recommends battery beyond the 50% mark would simply suffice. I would suggest being connected to AC just to be on the safe side of the fence. Currently, it’s unclear when Apple will launch iOS 10.2.1 and other software to the public. But given the amount of time aforementioned software has spent under the beta umbrella, we should expect something to bear fruit in a couple of weeks if not later. But Apple has a way of surprising people as well. Take the release of beta 3, for example. One would expect the company to push out the final build with all that time at hand, but nope, Cupertino went on to be classy once again. Advertisement If you are a developer or a non-developer, and happen to have iOS 10.2.1 beta installed on your iOS device, then it is highly recommend to update to the latest build straight away. It’s likely Apple has packed in an important fix for something under the hood, hence the quick release right after the third beta. iOS 10 Adoption Jumps To More Than 66 Percent, Faster Than Previous Updates We will inform our readers whenever iOS 10.2.1 final is released for everyone to download. Till then, hang in tight, and make sure you are ready to update your device as soon as the software drops in due course.

By Karissa Bell2017-01-12 20:09:07 UTC Want to use that new selfie emoji? How about the facepalm or avocado? If you're on Android, or texting someone who is, there's a good chance those new characters aren't working.  That's because Google, like Apple, ties emoji updates to its new software releases: update to the latest version of Android, get the newest emoji. It sounds straightforward enough, but there's one glaring problem that's been a major handicap for Google for years. SEE ALSO: The ultimate guide to the 104 new emoji in iOS 10.2 Unlike Apple, which controls both its hardware and its software, Google relies on dozens of manufacturing partners to create the bulk of its handsets (Google's Nexus and Pixel devices excepted). Those partners also control when their customers get new software and, unfortunately for Google, have a pretty piss-poor record of getting these updates out in a timely manner. That's why Google's Android Nougat update, which rolled out in August, is currently installed on less than 1 percent of all Android devices. Those dismal numbers are alarming for a number of reasons, but are especially bad news for emoji fans. They mean most Android users will have to wait months, or even a year, to get the same emoji as their iPhone-wielding peers. Worse yet, when someone with the new characters sends them to you, all you'll see is a series of blank boxes. Given how much we've come to rely on emoji in everyday conversation, it can be a big hurdle when one side doesn't have the same characters as the other. "A phone that can't see the 12+ months of new emojis is crippled as a communication device," Jeremy Burge wrote on the Emojipedia blog Wednesday. This issue of not-so-timely updates, also known as fragmentation, is nothing new. It's plagued Android for years. In fact, it's gotten so bad, Google was reportedly considering a plan that would publicly "shame" manufacturers who didn't release updates fast enough.  Unfortunately, manufacturers have so far given little indication that they are willing to adopt faster upgrade cycles.  But it's not all bad news for emoji lovers. As Burge points out, app developers have stepped in to fill in the gaps by adding support for new emoji releases independently of the OS updates. That's why you can find new emoji on Twitter, Whatsapp, Messenger, Slack, Snapchat and Telegram before you'll see them anywhere else. Just don't hold your breath to see them on your phone's native messaging app. BONUS: Signs you're reading too much into instant messages with emoji Topics: Android, Apps and Software, emoji, Google, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

When it comes to actual sales, the iPhone 7 series is doing pretty well for Apple, at least well enough to significantly gain market share over Android phones. BGR has the news. “According to new data released this week by leading market research firm Kantar Worldpanel ComTech, Apple’s new iPhone models stole a significant amount of market share from Android during the holiday shopping period last year.” The iPhone 7 Plus has sold very well for Apple. [Image by Daryl Deino] The article adds that in the United States, the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and iPhone 6s were the three best-selling smartphones during the three-month period that ended in November of 2015. When combined, the three devices accounted for 31.3 percent of all smartphone sales in the United States. This is good news for Apple, who has been criticized for lacking innovation with their new smartphones. One of the biggest complaints was that Apple was removing the standard headphone jack. An article in Mashable summarized that the removal of the headphone jack doesn’t represent anything groundbreaking. “And I’ve never heard anything as ridiculous emanate from that stage as I did Wednesday, when marketing chief Phil Schiller explained why the iPhone 7 would not have a standard 3.5mm aux cable input, better known as the headphone jack,” wrote columnist Chris Taylor, who added that music certainly doesn’t sound better over Bluetooth or a Lightning connector. Then, there is the fact that both the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus versions have outdated screen resolutions (750 x 1334 for iPhone 7 and 1920 x 1080 for the 7 Plus). However, many would argue that Apple hasn’t changed the screen resolution because it would decrease battery life. There is also the argument that on such a small device, a higher screen resolution wouldn’t make much of a difference to the human eye. Many believe that the iPhone 7, especially the 7 Plus, smartphones are gaining market share because one major Android flagship phone, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, was recalled. The recall eventually led to many Android users reluctantly purchasing the iPhone 7 Plus. The Galaxy Note 7 recall certainly helped Apple. [Image by Daryl Deino] The Galaxy Note 7 arrived with fantastic reviews when released in August. Then, some phones started to explode. Samsung issued a recall and rushed replacement smartphones to the market. Then, some of the replacement smartphones started to explode. All in all, the Note 7 launch was the most disastrous smartphone launch in history. Samsung suffered a lot of brand damage but is getting ready to come back with the Galaxy S8. According to Tech Radar, the Galaxy S8 is shaping up to be a huge upgrade from the S7 and S7 Edge. “Likely highlights include a 4K screen, a Snapdragon 830 processor, 6GB of RAM and a massively improved camera. There’s even a chance that the Samsung Galaxy S8 will have an iris scanner or a foldable screen, though the latter is somewhat less likely.” The article adds that there could be two different versions of the S8, and both will come with curved screens. One could be a 5.7-inch regular version, and the other, the one that would have the 4K screen, will be 6.1 inches. The S8 could also have a 30MP dual-lens rear camera, an 8MP front camera, and a 4200mAh battery. However, Apple isn’t sitting quietly. The rumored iPhone 8 series is rumored to be the biggest upgrade to the iPhone in 10 years. According to 9to5Mac, we may see 4.7-inch to 5.8-inch curved OLED displays, an all-glass design with new colors, wireless charging, an embedded (into the screen) home button, and something that has to do with augmented reality. Based on the rumors, are you more excited for the iPhone 8 or the Galaxy S8? Let us know in the comments section.

Here Are 3 to Start With Here's what you need to know about buying stocks and why these three stocks are great buys to start with. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Jan 13, 2017 at 4:31PM In both bull and bear markets, it's never too late to buy stocks. Picking the right stocks to buy, of course, is the biggest challenge. For investors looking to buy stocks today, here are three that look enticing. Image source: Getty Images. Buying stocks Why buy stocks in the first place? By buying stocks, investors position themselves to not only save money but to potentially watch their money grow, whether it's through share price appreciation, dividends, or both. Yes, buying stocks is a risk. But it is also an opportunity. It gives investors a chance to earn excellent returns. Finally, investors should keep in mind that there is never a "right" time to buy stocks. Since attempting to time when the market will rise or fall has proved to be impossible for anyone to do consistently, the best thing investors can do is maximize their time in the market, giving themselves the greatest opportunity to watch their portfolios' value rise over time. Ready to buy stocks? Start here Image source: Getty Images. 1. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL): It's no secret that stock valuations are currently a bit exorbitant. Indeed, the average price-to-earnings ratio of stocks in the S&P 500 today is 25, up from about 22 one year ago. This makes conservatively priced stocks that also happen to be excellent businesses rarer than usual. Nevertheless, they're still hanging around -- and Apple is one of them. With a P/E ratio of just 14, Apple gives investors an opportunity to buy a stock with a leading position in its key markets without paying a premium price. In addition, Apple stock shareholders get a nice dividend yield (annual dividend payments per share as a percentage of the stock price) of 1.9%. 2. Costco (NASDAQ:COST): With Costco stock, investors will have to pay a greater premium for the company's earnings than they'll have to pay for Apple. Costco stock has a P/E ratio of about 30. But there's good reason for Costco's steep valuation: Not only has the company carved out a strong, enduring competitive advantage for itself by gaining a cost advantage through economies of scale and wildly efficient operations, but management has also consistently improved operations. This is particularly evident by Costco's swelling net profit margin, which has increased from 1.7% to 2% between 2012 and 2016 -- a big and important gain for a warehouse bulk retailer. 3. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B): Last, it would be a shame to overlook the conglomerate built by the world's greatest investor himself, Warren Buffett. Under the Berkshire Hathaway name, Buffett has built up a portfolio of enduring subsidiaries and stock holdings poised to stand the test of time. Under Berkshire's ownership are built-to-last subsidiaries like Geico, Duracell, and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway. And some of Berkshire's largest stock holdings include iconic businesses like Coca-Cola, American Express, and Wells Fargo. Image source: Getty Images. Of course, when it comes to buying stocks, there's no guarantee. Historically, however, stocks have proved to be well worth the risk, compounding at approximately 10% annually over the last 100 years when dividends are reinvested. While it's impossible to know whether these three stocks could yield a similar 10% average annualized return in the coming years, buying these stocks will likely give investors a good chance of seeing an outcome like this.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley teachers union claims current salaries, expectations are 'unreasonable' Friday Jan 13, 2017 at 6:06 PM Jan 13, 2017 at 6:38 PM Charity Lindsey Staff Writer @DP_Charity APPLE VALLEY — A sea of red T-shirts filled the Apple Valley Unified School District board room Thursday night as about 200 teachers gathered to appeal for a “reasonable contract.” Currently in the process of negotiating a new three-year contract with the Apple Valley Unified Teachers Association, district officials said they are hopeful that the process will wrap up soon, but AVUTA is worried that the district won’t settle on what they believe are reasonable terms. The board last approved a certified salary schedule in September 2015, with beginning teachers holding a bachelor’s degree earning $46,782, and the most senior teachers holding a master's degree or higher earning $98,945. The average AVUSD teacher salary for the 2015-16 school year was $75,980, according to district officials, and is expected to be about the same for 2016-17. In comparison, the average in California for the previous school year was $72,535, according to the California Department of Education. Since negotiations began in March 2016, AVUTA has asked to add an approximate 5.5 percent increase to the salary schedule, along with a fully funded health care plan and an early retirement incentive for teachers, according to AVUTA President John Zachau. “The district has refused to move on any aspect of this proposal,” Zachau said during Thursday’s meeting. He went on to pass out informational charts showing AVUSD teachers’ salaries compared to other area districts. “This information will clearly show not only how uncompetitive we are as a district, but it will also demonstrate how reasonable the AVUTA initial offer was.” Zachau pointed out that AVUSD ranks the lowest “in almost every category of compensation” among the five districts within a 20-mile radius of Apple Valley, which include Victor and Adelanto Elementary School districts, Hesperia Unified, and Victor Valley Union High. The closest comparison would be the only other that is a unified K-12 district, HUSD, which pays beginning teachers $50,458 — about $3,700 more than AVUSD — and its highest earning teachers make $100,917 — about $2,000 more. “This situation is so bad that if we were to get everything we asked for in our initial proposal, we would only move from the fifth lowest paid district to the fourth,” Zachau said, noting they’d only surpass Adelanto. Citing the recent passage of Proposition 55, which extends the temporary tax increase enacted in 2012  to collect revenue for schools, Zachau said the district “is in excellent financial position.” AVUSD Superintendent Tom Hoegerman later responded that in light of Prop 55 and Governor Brown’s recent budget proposal, the district’s administrative team will be working with the board “to be prepared for what we believe is going to be a good settlement.” The grievances of Apple Valley teachers extend beyond their pay, however — they also criticize the district’s expectations of them. “What other career expects their employees to work outside their duty day?” teacher Kristy Croft asked, listing additional responsibilities like grading papers, preparing class materials, attending school events and contacting parents. “The list goes on forever. We are educated individuals who go above and beyond every day and are different than other employees.” After listening to Zahcau and Croft speak, the board responded by saying they understood the frustration. “I’ve been in your shoes, and I know that everyone of your hearts are in teaching, and we’ll do everything we can,” AVUSD trustee Donna Davis said. “We recognize the work of everybody in this room — that’s certainly never a question,” Hoegerman said. “We have an interest in getting this settled and we’re going to commit to doing everything we can to get that done.” Charity Lindsey may be contacted at clindsey@vvdailypress.com or 760-951-6245.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Town Council presented with federal government funding-priorities list Friday Jan 13, 2017 at 5:44 PM Jan 15, 2017 at 3:04 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — Housing programs and homeless services top a list of core needs that will help guide town staff and an advisory committee in determining allocations for nearly $800,000 in federal government funds in the next fiscal year. The list, which consists of five categories, is the result of multiple meetings held between November and December of last year in accordance with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s requirements, town documents show. Housing programs were paramount on the list, according to Apple Valley's Economic Development Manager Orlando Acevedo, who presented the findings to the Town Council during its Jan. 10 meeting. “For example,” Acevedo told the Council, “providing transitional shelters and expanding affordable housing for veterans and seniors. Also, improving neighborhood aesthetics and property values.” Additionally, the category included establishing rent control for affordability, as well as encouraging “collaboration between public agencies, developers, investors and other stakeholders to develop inclusive housing development,” according to town documents. Second on the list was homeless services, including assistance for those who are at risk of homelessness. Acevedo said supporting the development of a one-stop-shop resource center to assist homeless persons with doctor visits and job training, and the like, is an example of those services. Economic development and employment services; human services; and accessibility and mobility rounded out the list, according to Acevedo. He said providing senior, veteran and youth services, as well as music, arts and cultural programs were examples of human services. In addition to guiding staff and the appointed Community Development Citizens Advisory Committee, Acevedo said the listed categories will assist the town in updating its 2017-21 Consolidated Plan and its 2017-18 First Year Action Plan. Officials anticipate an estimated $559,000 in Community Development Block Grant and $538,000 in HOME Investment Partnership Program funding for 2017-18, town documents show. Apple Valley and Victorville share the HOME allocation, and the town will receive an estimated $218,000. The town anticipates a total of approximately $770,000 from both programs. Following Acevedo’s presentation, Town Councilman Larry Cusack said the allocations will help distribute money “out into the community where the needs are.” “We don’t get a whole lot of money from the federal government,” Cusack said, “but we want to use it wisely, and I think it’s a great program. (It) supports our homeless and a lot of other programs we’ve taken care of over the years.” Meanwhile, Mayor Pro Tem Art Bishop focused on the first and fifth categories in his comments. “We have veteran organizations throughout Apple Valley and the High Desert that need support,” Bishop said. “I think giving employment opportunities and economic development is a great way to help people not only today, but tomorrow ... We want to see our citizens be able to do better with good education, with training.” All future projects must meet one of three objectives pursuant to CDBG regulations before receiving funds while HOME monies focus specifically on affordable housing, town documents show. The Council voted 4-0 to approve the list; Councilwoman Barb Stanton was absent from the meeting. Acevedo said CDBG and HOME recommendations will be presented to the Council during a public hearing in late April. Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254.

When it comes to actual sales, the iPhone 7 series is doing pretty well for Apple, at least well enough to significantly gain market share over Android phones. BGR has the news. “According to new data released this week by leading market research firm Kantar Worldpanel ComTech, Apple’s new iPhone models stole a significant amount of market share from Android during the holiday shopping period last year.” The iPhone 7 Plus has sold very well for Apple. [Image by Daryl Deino] The article adds that in the United States, the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and iPhone 6s were the three best-selling smartphones during the three-month period that ended in November of 2015. When combined, the three devices accounted for 31.3 percent of all smartphone sales in the United States. This is good news for Apple, who has been criticized for lacking innovation with their new smartphones. One of the biggest complaints was that Apple was removing the standard headphone jack. An article in Mashable summarized that the removal of the headphone jack doesn’t represent anything groundbreaking. “And I’ve never heard anything as ridiculous emanate from that stage as I did Wednesday, when marketing chief Phil Schiller explained why the iPhone 7 would not have a standard 3.5mm aux cable input, better known as the headphone jack,” wrote columnist Chris Taylor, who added that music certainly doesn’t sound better over Bluetooth or a Lightning connector. Then, there is the fact that both the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus versions have outdated screen resolutions (750 x 1334 for iPhone 7 and 1920 x 1080 for the 7 Plus). However, many would argue that Apple hasn’t changed the screen resolution because it would decrease battery life. There is also the argument that on such a small device, a higher screen resolution wouldn’t make much of a difference to the human eye. Many believe that the iPhone 7, especially the 7 Plus, smartphones are gaining market share because one major Android flagship phone, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, was recalled. The recall eventually led to many Android users reluctantly purchasing the iPhone 7 Plus. The Galaxy Note 7 recall certainly helped Apple. [Image by Daryl Deino] The Galaxy Note 7 arrived with fantastic reviews when released in August. Then, some phones started to explode. Samsung issued a recall and rushed replacement smartphones to the market. Then, some of the replacement smartphones started to explode. All in all, the Note 7 launch was the most disastrous smartphone launch in history. Samsung suffered a lot of brand damage but is getting ready to come back with the Galaxy S8. According to Tech Radar, the Galaxy S8 is shaping up to be a huge upgrade from the S7 and S7 Edge. “Likely highlights include a 4K screen, a Snapdragon 830 processor, 6GB of RAM and a massively improved camera. There’s even a chance that the Samsung Galaxy S8 will have an iris scanner or a foldable screen, though the latter is somewhat less likely.” The article adds that there could be two different versions of the S8, and both will come with curved screens. One could be a 5.7-inch regular version, and the other, the one that would have the 4K screen, will be 6.1 inches. The S8 could also have a 30MP dual-lens rear camera, an 8MP front camera, and a 4200mAh battery. However, Apple isn’t sitting quietly. The rumored iPhone 8 series is rumored to be the biggest upgrade to the iPhone in 10 years. According to 9to5Mac, we may see 4.7-inch to 5.8-inch curved OLED displays, an all-glass design with new colors, wireless charging, an embedded (into the screen) home button, and something that has to do with augmented reality. Based on the rumors, are you more excited for the iPhone 8 or the Galaxy S8? Let us know in the comments section.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple took its lumps last year, and deservedly so. The iPhone was an incremental upgrade and sales were down while most of its Mac line, aside from the MacBook Pro, continued to be let out in the cold, going on years since their last upgrades (Mac Pro, iMac, etc.). This sets the background to Peter Thiel’s proclamation that the age of Apple is over. No, it’s not. Our own Todd Hasselton, who has criticized Apple for falling behind Microsoft and Samsung, rebutted Thiel’s statement, but Jon decided to address the matter with a different perspective. Yes, some of the luster has worn off Apple’s sterling reputation with its head-scratching moves like ditching the headphone jack and prematurely jumping the gun with other ports in the new MacBook Pro, but its reign is by no means over. Apple is still reeling in mountains of cash even though the iPhone isn’t selling as well as it once was. The smartphone market has plateaued with little to no room left for innovation, but with iPhone sales still high, Apple is still making profits off of its bread and butter product. Tim Cook has also pivoted towards new directions to offset some of the waning demand for iPads. Apple is getting in on the original programming game, buying Carpool Karaoke and planning for more TV shows. Last year, new rules were implemented into the App Store in which developers would only have to pay Apple a 15% fee (instead of the 30%) if they used a subscription-based pay model. Apple is making moves to stay ahead of the shifting curb. Will their moves pay off? Only time will tell. But for a company the size of Apple to go belly up in a couple years, I don’t see that happening. Check out the video above to see more of Jon’s thoughts on the matter.

Now Cellebrite—the company the FBI reportedly hired to break through the iPhone’s encryption—has been hacked, validating Apple’s concerns the tools would eventually leak. Cellebrite announced on Tuesday its servers had been hacked saying, Cellebrite recently experienced unauthorized access to an external web server. The company is conducting an investigation to determine the extent of the breach. The Israeli company has a solid reputation with law enforcement agencies for its ability to hack into encrypted devices including some iPhone models, and reportedly used its tools to bypass the security on an iPhone 5c linked to a terrorist shooter. In that case, the FBI was trying to bypass the passcode on an iPhone linked to Syed Farook who was identified as a suspect in the December 2015 mass shooting at a San Bernardino County holiday party. Mr. Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on their coworkers, killing 14 and injuring 22 others. Smartphone hacking company Cellebrite gets hacked The two were killed later that day in a shootout with police. They destroyed their personal smartphones before the attack on their coworkers, but the county-issued iPhone 5c Mr. Farook used was recovered intact. Without the passcode, however, police couldn’t examine its contents to look for potential leads in the case. Cellebrite, the FBI, and iPhone Apple assisted the FBI and recovered what data it could from the phone’s linked iCloud account, but didn’t have any way to bypass built-in security measures. The FBI turned to the Federal Court system for an order compelling Apple to make a special version of iOS without the security measures that destroy a device’s data after too many failed login attempts. Apple refused, saying the order was unprecedented and the code would eventually fall into the wrong hands and expose iPhone owners to serious security and privacy risks. The FBI said that wouldn’t happen because the security-weak iOS version would be used only on Mr. Farook’s iPhone, and could remain in Apple’s possession. Apple countered saying Once the code was written other law enforcement agencies and governments would demand it for their own investigations and surveillance. Apple was almost immediately proven right when the Manhattan District Attorney said he had over 200 iPhones where he wanted to use the code for his own investigations. Hours before Apple and the FBI were scheduled to appear in court, the FBI backed down saying a third party had unlocked the iPhone for them. That third party was Cellebrite. In the end, Mr. Farook’s iPhone didn’t hold any useful information, just as San Bernardino police expected. Had Apple capitulated and created the code the FBI wanted, all iPhone owners would’ve been faced with the prospect of worthless encryption all for a phone without any useful information. The FBI insisted during its fight with Apple that the government needs backdoors into our encrypted personal data. Apple and security experts argued encryption with a back door is the same as no encryption because anyone with the technical skills can use the built-in security weakness, putting our personal data, bank and credit card transactions, and passwords at risk. Cellebrite is currently investigating its data breach with plans to shore up its own security. That should help with future attacks, but that doesn’t change the fact that a company with tools to hack into smartphones and bypass encryption was hacked itself—and that underscores Apple’s stance that any tool designed to weaken encryption and privacy will eventually fall into the wrong hands.

Namely, as various technology elements are developed and then shipped, each seeks to solve a particular problem we have. Sometimes, the problem is intrinsic to our lives, such as answering the iPhone when it happens to be out of reach—with an Apple Watch. Sometimes, the problems to be solved are brought on by the solutions themelves. The iTunes app is a good (or bad…) example. The Particle Debris article of the week comes from someone I frequently mention: Jonny Evans. His article, “10 New Apple Technologies Introduced in 2016.” reminds us all that Apple is always at work doing the little things that often go unnoticed. And that got me thinking…. Apple’s AirPods. We don’t get something like this every day. The Excitement in Our Lives Apple has been successful by figuring out what we need next. That often takes the form of a single encapsulated product like the iPhone or the AirPods. We eagerly get our head around this kind of a package concept. It, whatever “it” is, comes in a box. We open it with glee and are immersed in its joy. Apple does an amazing amount of research to make sure the experience is something we can appreciate with a smile. In an era where so many products from other companies are rushed to market, sometimes it seems in beta form, it’s very satisfying to buy a new Apple product, like an Apple Watch or AirPods, that are complete and pleasurable out of the box. But it’s also true that products like that don’t come around every month. It’s the in-between time where Apple engages in those continuous improvements that go under appreciated. That’s where the article above by author Evans comes in. He cites developments in ceramics, differential privacy, the Watch’s S2 chip, waterproofing technology, and the MacBook Pro keyboard, amongst others, as examples of how, gradually, things get better with Apple products in a way that’s often under the radar. Or else, not mentioned, something like Swift Playgrounds offers up a pleasant surprise. My suspicion is that Apple expected us all to appreciate the MacBook Pro Touch Bar as one of those highly appreciated refinements. But the timing was wrong. Apple gave us a great refinement at the end of the year when something meatier was expected. What the community was hungry for was a splash. The MBP’s Touch Bar is one of those periodic, essential refinements. Splash 2016 was a tough year for Apple. The company didn’t ship any new desktop Macs. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro didn’t get an A10X upgrade. The Apple TV didn’t get upgraded to 4K/UHD/HDR. The result is that we didn’t have the opportunity to revel in many of of those glorious unboxing experiences. Those periodic revitalizations make us feel as if we’re plunging into the future. When we don’t get them very often, the withdrawal symptoms are severe. Even if we’re not ready to upgrade, it’s important to have that special something to dream about. In that sense, Apple’s ability to move forward with new products has a profound effect on our psyche. The company that we love is cranking out the future, and we yearn to be in sync. Or, at worst, only a step behind. However, when Apple has trouble shipping new, exciting products, we feel as if our beloved bandwagon has a broken wheel. We get cranky. That’s why it’s important to look at what Apple does, in little ways, to offset that negative psychology. Technology bursts are glorious, but continuous refinements are also important. The Pace of Apple Time Anther factor to consider is that those who write about Apple do so every day. Apple’s progress is viewed at very fine-grained scale. However, the average customer shows up in an Apple store much less often. All those many refinements accumulate. To many, they must seem overwhelming. For many, a new MacBook or MacBook Pro with only USB-C ports must seem exciting, perhaps a little fightening. The Apple Watch Series 2 is only few months old. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro is still less than a year old. The accumulation of small improvements by Apple, seen at a different resolution of the timeline, can aggregate to to the point of being scary to many customers. After all, most Apple customers only upgrade every few years. To them, just keeping up at that interval is a challenge. It’s almost like Einstein’s relativity theory. For observers on that classical thought experiment’s fast moving train, time moves differently than for those observers at rest. And so, one’s perception of Apple’s progress depends on how fast your own train is moving. Apple has its work cut out in 2017, and I’m looking forward to some big splashes. But, along the way, watch for all those little things Apple does to make our lives better. We need those as well, and that attention to detail is fundamental to how Apple works.

I will miss your optimism and spins. Long Live Mac Ob !!! January 13, 2017 at 6:47 EST PM geoduck January 13, 2017 The sixcolors article was great. Nailed the concerns I and I’m sure a lot of long time Apple users are feeling. What Apple did not deliver was very concerning. What they did deliver was either not for me (Air Pods the exact shape of the old Ear Buds that I could never get to work) or just a non starter (I was really ready to get a MacBook Pro, I had my checkbook out. But the “new” model really struck me as the old model, tarted up a bit with a ridiculous price increase.) Add to that a lot of the innovations from previous years have passed me by. Homekit still strikes me as a $100 solution to a $10 problem. The Apple Watch may be a must have someday. But right now it’s far too much for far too little. Which brings me to the “10 New Technologies …” article. Honestly it was a list of B squad improvements, and background technologies. As important as they may be,, they do not make a headline that will excite the masses. Too many products lay fallow last year. Too many things had minor updates, when major changes were expected. As one of your fellow TMO writers said last yuear, Apple is managing to do less and less with more and more. My biggest Apple memory of 2016? That the iPad, isn’t a true Mac replacement yet. The hardware is there, bit iOS is still crippled. Until they bite the bullet and roll out padOS alongside phoneOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS, they are wasting the promise of this fantastic device. January 13, 2017 at 7:21 EST PM Lee Dronick January 13, 2017 “How is that Kool-Aid” Kool-Aid wasn’t the drink at Jonestown, it was a clone labled Flavor-Aid January 13, 2017 at 9:20 EST PM Lee Dronick January 13, 2017 “Homekit still strikes me as a $100 solution to a $10 problem.” With one exception it beats the hell out of the Phillips HUE app; Homekit does not yet have a fade setting for lights. “Apple Watch may be a must have someday.” For me someday has arrived, it arrived last January. January 13, 2017 at 9:25 EST PM AdamBerkey January 14, 2017 I have this unrealistic hope that every time I visit a Mac-centric (or used to be before “Apple, Inc)” I will see something really great, like the return of 17″ model so I can upgrade because I’m not going to go to a 15″ Mac. But, Apple is not my friend anymore, really. It’s like that first love that I just need to let go of but there’s always gonna be those cherished memories… January 14, 2017 at 1:45 EST PM RonMacGuy January 15, 2017 Look, I understand how bitter a lot of you Apple ‘old-timers’ are that Apple has moved a direction other than what you desire, People like Bosco, CudaBoy, and AdamBerkey feel betrayed and lash out at the new Apple. I am, for sure, a ‘new-timer’ with regard to Apple – not having the history with old Mac Pros and the wonderful stuff done on that equipment. But just realize the new Apple is for the masses, not the niche. The future for the masses is iPhone, iPad, AirPod, Watch, iMac, Apple TV, and MacBook, and whatever wonderful new technology they are working on. They are designing/manufacturing/selling in the tens of millions, NOT the tens of thousands. Sorry. Plain facts. To be honest, I really don’t understand why Apple, with their continued OSX development, doesn’t just toss you boys a techy bone with a huge Mac Pro and 30″ 5K super duper display that has umteen ports and upgradable components. I really don’t. But they are choosing not to, so obviously they don’t want to lose valuable Apple Retail space with hardware for the thousands instead of the millions. But they could easily outsource this stuff and let you order through their website. But that isn’t Apple’s DNA. If it doesn’t sell in the millions they cut it loose. Again, sorry. But your whining about Apple focusing on profit for their shareholders is frankly getting tiresome. Your insults about Apple are ludicrous and also tiresome. Nothing you can say will negate the fact that Apple is the most successful and innovative technology company in the world. Period. That being said, I will say that I am surprised that Apple, who is investing billions a quarter in advanced technologies and development, did not do more in 2016. Perhaps that will lead to an awesome 2017. I do REALLY love my AirPods – awesome technology and par for the course with Apple. My family of five has 2 iMacs (one 2007 iMac that is still running, well, fairly strong and one 2015 iMac which is awesome), 5 iPhones, 3 school Pads, 3 home iPads, 1 Apple TV, 1 MacAir, and one pair of AirPods that my daughters are trying to steal. Technology life is just so easy for us now. THIS is what Apple is about today. Get over it. Looking forward to a third generation Watch later this year!! January 15, 2017 at 10:24 EST AM 2old4fun January 15, 2017 RonMacGuy, that was one of the best comments I have read. But as far as spending billions that should have produced more, money spent does not make up for time or the lack of technology. If Apple is working on something that requires technology or process that do not exist then it just takes longer. Because a researcher comes up with a super battery does not mean that the means to produce it in quantity exists. But I believe that Apple will continue to innovate and bring to market things that will amaze me (my AirPods are on order). January 15, 2017 at 11:35 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Mr. Lattner left Apple, where he was credited with heading development of Swift, for Tesla, where he will be working on self-driving cars. Chris Lattner, former Apple Executive 9to5Mac reported on Wednesday that Matt Casebolt also left Apple for Tesla, where he will be Sr. Director Engineering, Closures & Mechanisms. Openness Citing an unnamed friend of Mr. Lattner’s on Friday, BusinessInsider reported, “one big reason [Chris Lattner left Apple] was that Apple’s culture of secrecy was wearing on him, particularly because it was his job (and his life’s work) to create open-source developer tools.” The site quoted the friend as saying: He always felt constrained at Apple in terms of what he could discuss publicly — resorting to off-the-record chats, surprise presentations, and the like. Similarly, I know he was constrained in recruiting and other areas. Eventually I know that can really wear people down. Nuh-Uh Mr. Lattner took to Twitter to refute the claim, saying: My decision has nothing to do with “openness”. The “friend” cited is either fabricated or speculating. Folk just want to make 🍎 look bad. 😠 — Chris Lattner (@clattner_llvm) January 13, 2017 Praise for Ted Kremenek On a related note, Daring Fireball noted a January 11th email on a listserve from Mr. Lattner. In that email, Mr. Lattner downplayed his own importance and praised Ted Kremenek, who will replace him at Apple. One thing that I don’t think is fully appreciated by the community: Ted has been one of the quiet but incredible masterminds behind Swift (and Clang, and the Clang Static Analyzer) for many years. His approach and modesty has led many to misunderstand the fact that he has actually been running the Swift team for quite some time (misattributing it to me). While I’m super happy to continue to participate in the ongoing evolution and design of Swift, I’m clearly outmatched by the members of the Apple Swift team, and by Ted’s leadership of the team. This is the time for me to graciously hand things over to folks who are far more qualified than me. Swift has an incredible future ahead of it, and I’m really thrilled to be small part of the force that helps guide its direction going forward. That’s the kind of self-effacing commentary one might expect from a confident, talented person like Mr. Lattner. Personally, I suspect Apple will miss him, but it’s likely the Swift team remains strong. At the same time, it’s also likely that the unnamed “friend” cited by BusinessInsider was projecting.

But it's unclear how long Apple can ride the iPhone before smart glasses become cool. Robert Scoble, futurist, blogger and entrepreneur-in-residence at Upload VR, wrote this month that Apple may be working with international optical company Carl Zeiss on a "light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality gasses that may be announced this year," according to a Zeiss employee. These glasses would superimpose computer-generated images on the real world. But Gene Munster, Apple bull and founder of Loup Ventures, wrote Friday that AR goggles "are not the type of product we envision Apple shipping in the next couple of years." Nicky Loh | Bloomberg | Getty Images Augmented reality smart glasses. Munster wrote on Friday that the iPhone's upcoming hardware features will be conducive to "killer" augmented reality apps. "AR is a critical part [of Apple's future]," Munster told CNBC on Friday, on "Closing Bell." "You can put a stake in the ground and say Apple's going to be an AR company." But for the next five years, the iPhone will be Apple's AR device – think "Pokemon Go"-style apps – although Munster sees the company moving to wearables eventually. But Scoble thinks Tim Cook better worry about competing in the "spatial computing" era. "The innovation on smartphones is petering out, although Apple has some surprises in store," Scoble told "Closing Bell" on Friday. "I think the computing world is going to shift now to wearing glasses." A see-through tenth anniversary iPhone, with augmented reality capabilities, could be a "really cool" option for Apple, Scoble said. Augmented reality is the best education tool ever invented by humans, Scoble said, and entertainment will also be "absolutely huge." "Right now it's really geeky," Munster said of AR. "Ultimately, it's going to do everything from how we do social, how we learn, train. Those are just some of the starting points." Loup Ventures managing partner Andrew Murphy wrote this week that Apple is taking "baby steps" to train customers to accept augmented reality while they build up their production line. "The iPhone 7 Plus will have a huge implications for 3D mapping and real-time image processing in an AR world," Murphy wrote, adding: "AirPods (our new favorite toys), in combination with Apple Watch, are clear steps towards a post-mobile world."

Image 48 of 48 Apple reportedly taking aim at the likes of HBO, Netflix with its own shows and movies 1 / 48 Back to Gallery Apple could start offering original streaming video content on its Apple Music platform by the end of the year, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. The tech giant reportedly hopes its scripted shows and movies will become as popular as HBO's "Westworld" or Netflix's "Stranger Things," and has been talking to producers in connection with the project. Apple does not appear to be gunning directly for Netflix or Amazon with its video experiment, according to the Journal, because its offering would still be relatively small. But it could up the ante against Spotify, as well as tee up Apple for a big role in media and Hollywood. Rumors of Apple's interest in television are not new. The company was said to have been planning to launch a streaming TV service as far back as 2012. But negotiations with content providers for TV rights have made it hard for Apple to break into the market and offer a cable-like experience. With more Americans cutting the cord, however, and embracing the kind of original content pioneered by Netflix, Apple may have another shot at building a TV empire. The company has already debuted a number of music-related shows and documentaries on Apple TV, and that is expected to grow with an original series featuring Dr. Dre, a reality show called "Planet of the Apps," and rights to produce a spinoff of CBS' "Carpool Karaoke." "The entire world of communications and entertainment and television are all changing and converging," said Jeff Kagan, an independent telecom and media analyst. "We are going to see many companies enter the space in the same way. Some of them will be successful. Some of them will not. This is just the early days."

Tech rogue Peter Thiel thinks so, telling the New York Times this week that he believes "the age of Apple is over." "We know what a smartphone looks like and does," said the Facebook board member, PayPal co-founder, chess prodigy, and Trump transition team member. "It's not the fault of Tim Cook, but it's not an area where there will be any more innovation." Loyal fans agree, citing lackluster "improvements," a lack of innovation, and a year that saw sales fall for the first time since 2001. As Apple celebrates the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, the company appears to have gone into "maintenance mode" while everyone waits for its next big thing to emerge — if ever. Ronan Timoney, a 23-year-old economics and finance student in Ireland, has had Apple laptops since 2010, iPhones since 2011 and an iPad since 2012. As a young, avid Apple user, he's exactly the kind of customer the company should be wooing for their long-term success. But his most recent smartphone purchase was an Android. Play Facebook Twitter Google Plus Embed Apple's iPhone 7 announcement: Will the headphone jack change pay off? 1:58 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src="http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/760365123587" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> For him, Apple has lost its luster. "Their products have become fashion accessories rather than high-powered gadgets, and prices now outstrip quality," said Timoney. He "will not be buying any Apple products for the foreseeable future," he said. 2016 was a particularly rotten year for Apple. Annual sales fell for the first time since it launched the iPod in 2001, going from a record $234 billion in 2015 to $216 billion. Its new lineup of MacBook Pros this year failed to impress. The best thing about the iPhone 7 is its camera. It also forced users to invest in $159 wireless AirPods, which had a delayed launch, or use an awkward dongle to use their old headphones. Not very "Appley." Core Products for 2017 And what's in store for 2017? Reportedly three new faster iPad models in different sizes as the company tries to fend off other touch-screen phones and computers, but iPad units have declined in 10 of the last 11 quarters. Instead of "thinking different" the company is "thinking slightly better." To be sure, "Apple is a great American success story," but, "a lot of that innovation came from the Steve Jobs era," said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners known for his bearish views on the company. CEO Tim Cook is an efficient caretaker but doesn't necessarily have the late Steve Jobs' "founder's fire" that can propel a company past the threshold of what was thought to be possible, said Gillis. "Amazon, Google, Tesla, Netflix, Facebook, what do they have in common? They're all still driven by their founders. They're still able to make big bets and change directions. Is Apple positioned for the next thing?" asked Gillis. Related: Apple's Poor Performance Takes a Bite out of Tim Cook's Salary That's the big question as longtime users and investors wait to see where the company's $2 billion annual increase in research and development has been going and on what acronym it might it plant a flag next. AR? IOT? VR? AI? "What you're seeing is a point where Apple is making a slower transition away from being a company that historically came out with whizzbang products every couple of years to a company that makes great products we all need," said Gene Munster, the co-founder of Loup Ventures, who previously covered Apple as a Piper Jaffray analyst for over a decade and remains bullish. "As they shift resources, you get what happened in 2016: Not that exciting of a product year." Who's Driving Innovation? He thinks the next big things for Apple will be whatever it decides to do in the car space, artificial intelligence, and, according to the kind of Apple rumors that used to capture fanboys' and pundits' imaginations, a foldable phone with bendable glass. But it won't be Apple making the device, countered Gillis. "They're not driving the innovation... Samsung will be the ones who make it." Even hardcore Apple users say they've noticed a change. Apple is becoming more like Microsoft, a former wunderkind that became large, profitable, boring, and angered pro users. Is Microsoft the New Apple? As a Mac user, I.T. manager Dan Fox is used to standing out at his PC-filled office at an Orlando-based engineering firm. "Apple made these gorgeous, sleek, shiny devices that looked like they were from the future," he told NBC News. "They were cooler than anything else on the market and, more importantly, they actually worked better," said the 45-year-old Fox. His family members are all Apple fans too, and their house is full of MacBooks, Apple Watches, iPads, iPhones, Apple TVs, and he even sprang for the AirPods. As of late though, the "cutting edge" upgrades to the Surface and Office 365 have him considering that Microsoft might be becoming the new Apple, with well-built and innovative products, he says, that show an attention to details. He still loves Apple, but says he feels "Improvements are iterative, and it's almost as though Apple is now relying on its brand more than its tech. It feels like they are stalling on innovation to squeeze one more model out with a tiny upgrade. Rinse. Repeat. Things are starting to feel… stale."

It hits that perfect balance between natural sweetness and knife-edge acidity to create a wine that's absolutely mouthwatering with spicy tandoori chicken. Johner Estate Wairarapa Riesling 2016 $24 Karl Heinz Johner makes wine in opposite hemispheres, with family estates in Baden, (in Germany's Kaiserstuhl region) and in Martinborough's Gladstone sub-region. Riesling is a hero grape for him and he loves the crunchy green acidity, pear notes, baked apple, lime zest and honey characters that Martinborough grapes give so much, he's decided to spend most of his time looking after it in New Zealand, while his son Patrick looks after the German operation. Sip with Thai green apple salad. Two Rivers 'Juliet' Marlborough Riesling 2015 $20 Righto. Hands up who wants a riesling positively erupting with mandarin, apple and lime! Hands up who wants riesling that rocks a splash of sweetness but has crisp, clean, zing-a-ling acidity and a long, racy mouthfeel! Hands up ... wait, you've got no more hands. Just as well you've got tastebuds to enjoy the waves of honeysuckle edged with hints of beeswax then right? Sip this with a steaming bowl of Singapore Chilli Crab. - Canvas Yvonne Lorkin is co-founder and chief tasting officer of winefriend.co.nz and a Wine Writers of NZ member.

RELATED COMPANIES EXPAND ADD TO Portfolio Watchlist OUTLOOK? +ve -ve Wallace x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ By Mark Gurman and Mark Bergen Just over two years after leaving Google, Andy Rubin is preparing to take on the smartphone industry he helped create. Rubin, creator of the Android operating system, is planning to marry his background in software with artificial intelligence in a risky business: consumer hardware. Armed with about a 40-person team, filled with recruits from Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Rubin is preparing to announce a new company called Essential and serve as its Chief Executive Officer, according to people familiar with the matter. A platform company designed to tie multiple devices together, Essential is working on a suite of consumer hardware products, including ones for the mobile and smart home markets, one of the people said. The centerpiece of the system is a high-end smartphone with a large edge-to-edge screen that lacks a surrounding bezel. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in early January, Rubin discussed the smartphone with mobile carrier executives, including some from Sprint Corp., people familiar with the talks said. Rubin registered Essential Products Inc. with California regulators in November 2015. In late 2016, the company registered "Essential" with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, listing smartphones, tablets, accessories and "computer operating software for mobile phones" among its goods and services. It's unclear if the devices will run on software based on Android. While still in the prototyping stage, Rubin's phone is aimed at the top of the market where Apple Inc.'s iPhone and Alphabet Inc.'s new Pixel reside. It's expected to include high-end materials and the ability to gain new hardware features over time, the people said. Representatives for Rubin and Sprint declined to comment. Rubin sold Android to Google in 2005. He spent eight years at its helm at Google, turning the operating system from a tiny project into the globe's most dominant software for running mobile devices. In 2013, he stepped down from Android to form Google's robotics unit before leaving altogether in 2014. Rubin's next venture was a startup incubator called Playground Global, which backs artificial intelligence, robotics, and augmented reality projects. Rubin is convinced AI is the next big change to ripple through the technology industry. "New computing platforms happen every 10 to 12 years," he said at the Bloomberg Technology Conference in June. "What’s the next platform?... It’s about data and people training AI systems to learn." Playground Global, which occupies a sprawling warehouse in Silicon Valley, has raised at least $300 million from big investors including Hewlett-Packard Co., Google, and Apple supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. The latter, known as Foxconn, is in talks to manufacture Rubin's new smartphone, according to people familiar with the matter. At least one prototype of Rubin's phone boasts a screen larger than the iPhone 7 Plus's (5.5-inches) but has a smaller overall footprint because of the lack of bezels, one of the people said. The startup is experimenting with enabling the phone's screen to sense different levels of pressure, similar to an iPhone, the person said. Rubin's team is testing an industrial design with metal edges and a back made of ceramic, which is more difficult to manufacture than typical smartphone materials, two of the people said. Essential's engineers are developing a proprietary connector that serves double duty for charging the battery and expanding the phone's functionality over time, one person familiar with the planning said. The magnetic connector would allow Essential or even third parties to create hardware accessories that add features to the smartphone. For instance, Rubin’s engineers are working on a sphere-shaped camera add-on that shoots high-resolution 360 degree photographs, the person said. Rubin is aiming to put the phone on sale around the middle of this year for a price close to that of an iPhone 7 ($649), a person familiar with the matter said, adding that all of the plans are still in flux. Technology news website The Information earlier reported Rubin was working on a phone. Helping run the project are former Google colleagues and Apple managers, including Rebecca Zavin, Joe Tate, Linda Jiang, and Jason Keats. Zavin, a former senior Google software manager, is running software for Rubin. Keats and Tate are helping run hardware engineering, and Jiang is a key designer for Essential, according to a person familiar with the startup. Kelly Liang, a former business executive with the Google X lab, is managing business development and Brian Wallace, a former Samsung and Magic Leap executive, is leading marketing.

There, the gorgeous 5 ft., 2 in. entertainer sang, All Your Love, her latest single which she said is representative of a 'new energy' she was hoping to convey in her work. Graham, speaking with AOL's Ricky Camilleri, said that she's going for a 'different vibe' with her upcoming album, which she's been collaborating on with legendary producer Kenneth 'Babyface' Edmonds. Whip my hair: The songstress opened the studio in style, performing tunes from her forthcoming album Charisma: Kat shows off her superstar stage presence at the intimate Big Apple venue  'We wanted to do something that felt funk, that felt pop, that was a bit more inclusive,' she said. 'I just wanted to make the kind of music I wanted to make without the restrictions of a label or people telling me, "This is what you have to do if you look like you look, and you can dance like you look, and you're on the show that you're on."' She continued: 'And its just like, I want to make good music - classic music, music that you could listen to in 10 years and be like, "That was the jam!"' When you come into your own, and recognize your own power, I think that it's really amazing that you can make your own music and I want to inspire other people to create their own art and how can I do that if I'm making other people's art and now my own, you know what I mean?' Beaming: The Swiss-born beauty, who was raised in Los Angeles, was clearly elated to be one of the first performers to take the stage as the high-end studio opened its doors Chat: Kat, in a discussion with AOL's Ricky Camilleri, says her forthcoming work will be more the kind of music she yearns to make, as opposed to trying to produce a commercial hit Kat, who's been a regular on The Vampire Diaries since 2009, told The Huffington Post last month that she's prepared to adapt as The CW series wraps up its final season. 'It hasn’t hit me, that’s honestly the truth, because sometimes I’m like, "Oh, I’m gonna miss it. And I can’t believe it’s over,'" said Kat, who's played Bonnie Bennett on the drama horror. 'And I’m completely not there ... but it hasn’t hit me that eight years of a TV show is coming to an end and that I’m not going back to it. 'I haven’t known a free February or a free March in eight years.' Making her mark: Kat's appeared on 171 episodes of The Vampire Diaries since it hit the air in 2009. The CW series will air its last episode March 10 End of an era: Kat, seen here with co-stars David Alpay (left) and Ian Somerhalder, admits the reality of the show ending hasn't quite registered with her yet   Share or comment on this article e-mail 65 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany She's falling for him?

Essential currently touts around a 40-person team drawn from recruits from Apple and Google. According to Bloomberg, the company aims to develop a suite of consumer electronics that would target mobile and smart home markets. The expected centerpiece of the product family is a premium smartphone that is intended to go head to head with competitors like Google’s Pixel lineup and the Apple iPhone. Shipping plans for the phone are still being established, but Essential tentatively hopes to launch the phone later this year at a potential price point of around $650.

The startup is experimenting with enabling the phone's screen to sense different levels of pressure, similar to an iPhone, the person said. Rubin's team is testing an industrial design with metal edges and a back made of ceramic, which is more difficult to manufacture than typical smartphone materials, two of the people said. The smartphone and hardware family are also possible starting points for several new software and hardware technologies. Modular add-ons like those found on the since-cancelled Project Ara smartphone are one possibility for Essential. Per Bloomberg, developers are working on a connector that could connect to accessories like improved cameras. While the extent of Essential’s scope is still up in the air, technology like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa could also be a likely area for the company’s hardware and smart home development. Since leaving Google in 2014, Rubin has been an active presence in the artificial intelligence space and launched startup incubator Playground Global, which focuses on AI and robotics-based ventures.

Rubin aims to launch it this year, reports claim.  ( Justin Sullivan | Getty Images ) Advertisement Two years after departing Google, Andy Rubin is about to make headway on the smartphone industry — a field he helped push. Rubin is the creator of Android, a mobile operating system running on more than 86 percent of all mobile phones in existence as per IDC. He's planning to merge artificial intelligence with his prowess in software engineering, and he's doing it to produce consumer hardware. He's not alone in that venture, however. His team is composed of 40 individuals — some poached from Apple and some from Google — and they're called Essential, a forthcoming company Rubin will helm, reports Bloomberg, citing individuals familiar with the matter. The Creator Of Android Will Create A Smartphone Essential is poised to become a platform company looking to fuse multiple devices together. It's currently developing a suite of consumer hardware products for something as integral as mobile and something as nascent as smart homes. The centerpiece will be a smartphone with an edge-to-edge screen sans a surrounding bezel. The smartphone in question, however, is currently in its prototyping phase, although Rubin is intent on putting it in parallel ranks where the iPhone and the Pixel flagships sit atop. The phone is expected to be manufactured with high-end materials, metal edges, and a ceramic back panel. It's also expected to boast the ability to gain hardware features over time, which might allude to an idea similar to modular smartphones. One prototype of Rubin's smartphone boasts a larger screen than the iPhone 7 Plus but one that gains a smaller footprint because of the bezel's absence. What's more, Rubin is currently trying to create a screen that can sense pressure, similar to Apple's 3D touch technology. A proprietary connector is in the works too, being designed in a way that will enable charging the handset and bringing expanded functionality over time. Developers can come out with compatible accessories with the said connector, and not just accessories, but also hardware peripherals to be clear. For example, Rubin's team is working on a 360-degree camera that will attach to the connector, allowing users to create high-res 360-degree photographs right from the phone. AI Is The Future Google bought Android in 2005. Rubin spent eight years at the company, developing an operating system that would later become the most prevalent platform on mobile devices globally, which is no easy feat. After exiting Google's doors in 2014, his next venture became Playground Global, a startup centered on robotics, AI, and augmented reality. AI, according to Rubin, is the major inflection point the technology industry will experience and in some ways is already experiencing. Every decade or so, he said in June, new platforms naturally emerge, and this time, it's AI. "What's the next platform? It's about data and people training AI systems to learn," Rubin said. Pricing And Availability Rubin is aiming for a price point close to that of the iPhone 7's, although plans still fluctuate at this stage of the phone's development. It's being tipped for mid-year launch, and Foxconn is already in discussions to manufacture it, Bloomberg's report claims. Trademarks for Rubin's company, Essential, have already been filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Bloomberg's report didn't expand on other products Essential is currently developing, save for "a suite" of consumer hardware products — and this has all come about without Rubin's official confirmation. The tech industry is just revving up this year, but it's already becoming an all-bets-are-off situation now that Android's creator is aiming to parallel the pantheon of smartphones dominating the field today. We'll see how this "Essential" phone pans out. TAG Andy Rubin, Android, Essential, Artificial Intelligence © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

This story should serve as a giant wakeup call about the potential surveillance devices that many people are starting to allow into their own homes. original image (1160x768) The Amazon echo is not the only such device; others include personal assistants like Google Home, Google Now, Apple’s Siri, Windows Cortana, as well as other devices including televisions, game consoles , cars and toys. We can safely assume that the number of live microphones scattered throughout American homes will only increase to cover a wide range of “Internet of Things” (IoT) devices. (I will focus on microphones in this post, but these devices can include not just audio recorders but video as well, and the same considerations apply.) The insecurity of a nearby mic I was at a dinner party recently with close friends where the conversation turned to some entirely theoretical, screenplay-writing-type speculations about presidential assassinations—speculations that would be pretty dicey should certain outside parties who did not know us and where we were coming from be listening in. Realizing this as we spoke, the group thought of our host’s Amazon Echo, sitting on a side table with its little light on. The group’s conversation became self-conscious as we began joking about the Echo listening in. Joking or not, in short order our host walked over and unplugged it. It is exactly this kind of self-consciousness and chilling effects that surveillance—or even the most remote threat of surveillance—casts over otherwise freewheeling private conversations, and is the reason people need ironclad assurance that their devices will not—cannot—betray them. Overall, digital assistants and other IoT devices create a triple threat to privacy: from government, corporations, and hackers. It is a significant thing to allow a live microphone in your private space (just as it is to allow them in our public spaces). Once the hardware is in place, and receiving electricity, and connected to the Internet, then you’re reduced to placing your trust in the hands of two things that unfortunately are less than reliable these days: 1) software, and 2) policy. Software, once a mic is in place, governs when that microphone is live, when the audio it captures is transmitted over the Internet, and to whom it goes. Many devices are programmed to keep their microphones on at all times but only record and transmit audio after hearing a trigger phrase—in the case of the Echo, for example, “Alexa.” Any device that is to be activated by voice alone must work this way. There are a range of other systems. Samsung, after a privacy dust-up, assured the public that its smart televisions (like others) only record and transmit audio after the user presses a button on its remote control. The Hello Barbie toy only picks up and transmits audio when its user presses a button on the doll. Software is invisible, however. Most companies do not make their code available for public inspection, and it can be hacked, or unscrupulous executives can lie about what it does (think Volkswagen), or government agencies might try to order companies to activate them as a surveillance device. The dumber and more straightforward a user’s control, the better. Depriving a microphone of electricity by unplugging it and/or removing any batteries provides ironclad assurance that it’s not recording. A hardware switch is nearly as good, provided there’s no software mediation that could be overcome by hackers. (Switches can be bought for just that purpose.) A verbal command is far less certain, and devices like Echo will sometimes misinterpret sounds as their “wake word” and record random snippets of conversation. It's easy to see how a sentence such as “He was driving a Lexus in a way she said was dangerous” could be heard by an Echo as “Alexa: Sin away she said—was dangerous.” The constant potential for accidental recording means that users do not necessarily have complete control over what audio gets transmitted to the cloud. Once their audio is recorded and transmitted to a company, users depend for their privacy on good policies—how it is analyzed; how long and by whom it is stored, and in what form; how it is secured; who else it may be shared with; and any other purposes it may be used for. This includes corporate policies (caveat emptor), but also our nation’s laws and Constitution. Access to recordings by law enforcement We fear that some government agencies will try to argue that they do not need a warrant to access this kind of data. We believe the Constitution is clear, and that, at a minimum, law enforcement needs a warrant based on probable cause to access conversations recorded in the home using such devices. But more protections are needed. Congress, recognizing the extremely invasive nature of traditional wiretaps, enacted safeguards that go beyond what the courts had ruled the Constitution requires. These include requirements that wiretaps be used only for serious crimes, or be permitted only when other investigative procedures have failed or are unlikely to succeed. We think that these additional privacy protections should also apply to invasive digital devices in the home. Unfortunately the existing statutes governing the interceptions of voice communications are ridiculously tangled and confused and it’s not clear whether or how data recorded by devices in the home are covered by them. (CDT’s Joe Jerome has written a good roundup of that law and how it might apply to always-on devices.) When it comes to law enforcement access, the key issues for us as a legal matter are: Breadth. Access needs to be no broader than necessary. Any warrant authorizing access to stored conversations should particularly and narrowly describe the data that law enforcement has probable cause to believe is related to a crime—for example a specific time period, subject matter, and/or type of activity. Minimization. There need to be protections in place to limit the collection of information that is ultimately irrelevant. In the wiretap context these include rules requiring the police to stop listening when a conversation is irrelevant, and analagous rules should be developed for IoT device data. Notice. Historically, citizens served with search warrants have always received notice that their property is being searched—especially when that property is one’s home—and that practice should not be ended just because it is moving into the electronic realm. (We discussed this issue in greater depth last year.) Notice of IoT searches should always be served on all affected parties. In the Arkansas case, the police did serve Amazon with a warrant—but Amazon has fought it, apparently because of overbreadth. Our only information is what the company has said in a statement: that “Amazon objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.” A legal contradiction Digital assistants, like smart meters and many other IoT devices, split open a contradiction between two legal doctrines that both sit at the core of privacy law: The sanctity of the home. The inside of the home has for centuries been sacred when it comes to privacy. The Supreme Court has refused to let police use thermal scanners on private homes, for example, despite government protests that it was only measuring the heat leaving the home. And although the Court has ruled that dog sniffs for drugs are not a search in cars or in public spaces, it refused to allow them near the home. As Justice Anthony Scalia pointed out in the thermal scanner case, “the Fourth Amendment draws a firm line at the entrance to the house.” The third-party doctrine. As strong as privacy jurisprudence has been in protecting the home, it has been very weak in another area. Under the court's so-called “third party doctrine,” the Constitution does not require police to get a warrant to get people's records from their bank, telephone company, internet service provider, Google, Amazon, or any other third party. As a result, law enforcement agencies have argued in recent years that they should be able to obtain information such as individuals’ cell phone records, location history, even emails from companies without a warrant. The contradiction arises when devices inside the home stream data about activities in that home to the servers of a third-party corporation. Because of the third party doctrine, to give just one example, police have been obtaining home energy-use data from utilities without a warrant. In a home with a “smart meter,” that kind of data can be so minutely detailed that it can reveal all kinds of details about what people are doing inside their homes—which appliances they use, and when they use them—and even what television shows they watch (based on the patterns of light and dark in a show, which changes a television set’s electricity draw). In fact, in the very same Arkansas murder case in which the police are seeking data from the suspect’s Amazon Echo, they built their case against him using warrantlessly obtained data from his smart water meter, which prosecutors say shows he used 140 gallons of water between 1 and 3 a.m. They allege he was trying to hose blood stains off his patio. (He says the AM/PM setting on the meter’s clock was wrong and he used that water in the afternoon in order to fill his hot tub.) The solution to the contradiction between the sanctity of the home and the third-party doctrine is clear: the third party doctrine must go. It is increasingly untenable in an era where much of the data created about people's lives sits on the servers of international corporations—and the growth of IoT devices like digital assistants will make its inadequacy in the information age even clearer. Recommendations In addition to rigorously applying constitutional privacy protections as outlined above, the following steps should be applied to IoT microphones: Speech fragments transmitted to companies should be retained for the minimal necessary period, should not be shared absent a warrant, and should not be used for other purposes. Companies should do whatever necessary to ensure their users have a clear understanding about what data is kept and for how long. That means fine print buried in a click-through agreement is not enough. Users should have access to any of their audio recordings that a company retains, and the option to delete them. Commendably, some companies (Google and Amazon, for example) already do this. It needs to become at minimum an expected, standard best practice. It should become standard for microphones to feature a hardwired, non-software-modifiable LED indicator light that turns on whenever a mic is on (defined as transmitting electrical signals to anywhere else). It might make sense for there to be another, separate indicator when software is recording and/or transmitting signals to the Internet. The more transparency to the consumer, the better. It should also become standard to build in a hardware power switch that physically cuts off electricity to a microphone so that consumers can stop a microphone from recording. As much as possible, the power interruption that that switch effects should be tangible or even visible, so that customers can feel complete certainty that the microphone cannot record, akin to the certainty that comes from putting a bandage (or ACLU sticker) over the camera on one’s laptop. To the greatest extent possible, the code governing the operation of microphones should be public. When people depend on software to protect their privacy, transparent code is the only way to give people assurance a device is doing what it’s supposed to and no more. Special attention should be paid to any capability for remote activation of recording. Best for privacy is for no such activation to be possible. If there is a strong case to be made that such capability may be desired by consumers, then it should be to the greatest extent possible designed to be something that only consumers themselves can activate, and that consumers can permanently disable if they wish. Consumers must also be given explicit warning where any such capabilities exist. Companies and policymakers need to address the raft of issues around the stability of IoT devices, especially in-home devices with microphones or cameras. When not regularly updated, for example, such devices quickly become security threats. And what happens when the company providing those updates goes out of business or is acquired—or just changes its privacy policy? Devices that start out as private and secure can become a toxic presence inside the home as a result of things happening in the outside world, and right now, consumers are on their own in a Wild West. One of the best things that can be done for privacy is for speech recognition capabilities to be embedded locally in a device, so there’s no need to send audio clips to servers across the Internet. While that can work now for some simple commands, experts say that good recognition of a broader array of speech still requires processing in the cloud. Legislative privacy protections are also needed. In addition to broad privacy rules governing corporate use of private data, which would help in this area as in so many others, Congress should lay out strong and precise standards for when the government can access data from these new devices. As with wiretaps, the privacy and public interests at stake may require protections beyond a warrant and notice requirement. Again, all of these principles should also apply to video that in-home devices may capture and potentially stream to the cloud, which carries the same threats and problems. It is a healthy thing that this Arkansas story has sparked a public conversation about always-on devices. We and other privacy advocates have been watching this technology for some time—our allies at the privacy group EPIC wrote a letter to the FTC in 2015 requesting an investigation of always-on devices and their privacy implications. And the Future of Privacy Forum, a DC think tank, produced a helpful report on the issue last year. But if microphones are going to be part of our daily lives in our intimate spaces, we need broader awareness of the issues they raise, and to settle on strong protections and best practices as soon as possible. https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-future/priv...

First, one has to realize or understand that Consumer Reports is writing for a very pedestrian audience; they think, right or wrong, that their “consumers” are run-of-the-mill people who are generally ignorant of the nuances of ANY product. So, when you computer geeks see what CU does you become skeptical. I am a photography geek, so when I see the appalling simplicity of the cameras they test and the total lack of real investigative testing I am as skeptical as Jeff is about computers tested by CU. I wish they would test the higher end cameras just once, but that’s not their audience. Similarly, I have a good friend who is a car buff and is equally dismayed by the CU ratings of cars: he wants detailed “Road and Track” analyses, not information restricted for families of 4 headed out on vacation or driving their cars to work and day cares every day. So, my thinking is that CU probably hires engineers and testing gurus whose paradigms are equivalent to the audience that CU thinks they are informing, however badly, about all the products they test. So, the likes of me and photography, my friend and automobiles, or you and computers are way out of CU’s league. So, I stick with the toasters and steam irons that CU tests and ignore their tests on computers and cameras. I am closer to their intended audience when it comes to cars, however, which – by the way – is the ONLY product they test for longevity other than computers: I have discovered, for example, that some of Samsung’s televisions don’t last much beyond their warranty, but CU doesn’t care about how long those products will survive. Nor do thry care much about how long that washing machine will last. But, I digress. See how mixed up I am? January 14, 2017 at 1:42 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Many employees at these tech giants enjoy large paychecks and a host of perks ranging from free dry cleaning to free food to gyms on site. But there are thousands of other people working alongside them who don’t make enough money to afford housing near their jobs so many sleep in their cars between shifts. Some sleep in their cars because they are homeless. Watch the Diane Sawyer report, "My Reality: A Hidden America," in a special edition of ABC News "20/20" on Friday, Jan. 13 at 10 p.m. ET Terrence Rollins is a 51-year-old bus driver who drives the shuttles that ferry tech employees across Silicon Valley to company campuses. He only has a few hours a night at home before he has to be back at work. “I love my job,” Rollins said. “I get up at 3 [a.m.], I make it home about 11, 10 o’clock at night, and I’m constantly traveling. I mean, I have to take care of my family.” The bus drivers who spoke with ABC News starting in 2015 work for independent contractors hired by tech companies. When we first met these drivers, they said their jobs provided few benefits and didn't offer paid company holidays. Some drivers are contracted to work what’s called a “split shift,” meaning they arrive for work at 6 a.m. to take tech employees to their offices, then have to wait around for a number of hours, unpaid, until it’s time to take the employees back home at the end of the day. These drivers work and are paid for a total of eight hours but over a 16-hour period. They said the houses they can afford on their wages are too far away for them to get home between shifts, so many of them stay in their cars or nap at the bus depot. In the bus depot where he is based, Rollins said there was one room with two beds for female drivers and another room with two beds for male drivers. But it wasn't enough to accommodate the 35 to 40 drivers there on any given day. “It’s just awful when you park inside and you have drivers covering their cars’ [windows] with blankets and towels,” said another driver named Jimmy. Since ABC News began this report a year and a half ago, some service workers have unionized and their employers have worked with tech companies to raise wages and offer better benefits to many contract workers who lived at the edge of poverty. These workers are an example of a growing trend in the U.S., in which large corporations contract out service jobs from other companies. Scott Peebles, another driver ABC News spoke to in 2015, said he had been sleeping on an air mattress in his car for months. Peebles used a windshield reflector to help block out the light from the parking lot streetlamps while he slept. “This is foreign to me,” he said, gesturing to his car. “It’s not the way you’re supposed to live. No, it’s just a mirror of society that we’re in right now and that’s -- I’m probably part of millions of people that are doing this.” “It’s sad that it comes down to this,” Peebles continued. “I mean, if people would know this, if corporations of businesses they work for, they would probably be aghast that their employees were living in a car or a van.” At night, if they needed a restroom, the drivers would get out of their cars and walk into the bus depot. Under union pressures and publicity about drivers receiving few benefits, Facebook now requires contractors to pay contract employees a minimum of $15 an hour, 15 days of paid time off, and a $4,000 stipend for new parents if their contractors don’t provide parental leave. Apple and Google followed suit with announcing 25 percent wage increases for all drivers. Many security jobs are also now contracted out. Michael Johnson, who worked as a security guard for several companies, told ABC News the job has changed over the years. “When I first started there were paid vacation, paid holidays, lots of times we got bonuses,” Johnson said. “It was like a regular job, it’s just that you were contract-working. You were treated like one of the gang.” Eventually, Johnson said at the time he stopped receiving paid vacation time or paid sick leave and the hourly rate dropped. “It was incredible what was happening,” he said. “It seemed like it just happened overnight.” In Silicon Valley, amidst the luxury homes, the streets are lined with service workers who live in RVs and trailers. “The folks that are living in these RVs, they are part of the low-wage economy that’s created around the tech industry,” said activist Derecka Mehrens. “There’s a real connection between these families and what happens in the industry.” Some experts on contract workers say some of the jobs provide opportunities that didn’t exist before. Arthur Brooks of the Conservative American Enterprise Institute said,many workers "say that it gives them flexibility. Many of them are immigrants.” But Tamara Draut, Vice President of Demos, a progressive think tank, disagreed that contracting and subcontracting helps workers, arguing that “in each link down that chain, the pressures grow to lower labor costs.” Irma Alvarado is 72 years old and says she spent her life cleaning the offices at Visa, working the night shift from 6 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. She shares a small house with her children and grandchildren. She is a legal immigrant who says she has lived and worked in the U.S. nearly 30 years. When ABC News spoke to her in 2015, Alvarado said it was hard to watch Visa employees throw away food she would love to have and to see them take vacations. She said she once saw a $7,000 check lying on a desk, and was surprised at the gap between her pay and theirs. In a statement to ABC News, Visa said their janitorial staff is contracted through a third party vendor. “All wages, bonuses and benefits are handled directly by the service vendors,” the statement said. “We greatly appreciate their work and dedication to our facilities.” Her grandchildren say they still believe in the American dream. Her grandson Danny said he would like to be an astronaut one day. But for now, he said he just wants a drawer to himself. “It’s hard living in the house because you don’t have that much room, gets crowded,” he said. “I would have a drawer to put all my clothes in.” About half of American adults lived in middle-income households in 2014, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of government data. Pew Research offers an income calculator feature on their website that allows you to see whether you are part of the American middle class. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Bus Drivers Ferrying Silicon Valley Tech Elite Struggle to Afford Rent +Why Thousands of Low-Income Americans 'Donate' Their Blood Plasma +When Working 2 Fast Food Jobs, 16 Hours a Day Still Isn't Enough " Trump Suggests CIA Director 'Leaker' Behind Unsubstantiated Report " Central US Ice Storm Falls Short of Dire Forecasts " Meet Thumbelina, a Tiny Chihuahua Who Weighs Only 1.54 Pounds " 8-Year-Old Battling Cancer Gets Birthday Wish to See Amazon Facility " Twin's Mom Reacts to Emotional Reunion: 'It Didn't Feel Real' " Man Finds Forgotten Lotto Ticket, Wins $1 Million " Newlyweds Nail Iconic 'Dirty Dancing' Routine at Wedding " 2 Women Share How They Collectively Lost 100s of Pounds " Americans Think Obama, Kennedy, Reagan Gave Best Inaugural Speeches " Standing in for the Incoming President and First Lady at Inauguration Rehearsal " Jennifer Holliday Pulls Out of Trump's Inauguration After Backlash President Obama's Inauguration Day Plans " 5 Takeaways From Scathing Department of Justice Report on Chicago Policing " When Working 2 Fast Food Jobs, 16 Hours a Day Still Isn't Enough " Paris Jackson Pleased, 'Surprised' Network Canceled Michael Jackson Episode

By Leila Abboud Attendees at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week could play around with a dizzying array of unmanned aerial vehicles. Drones that take selfies. Drones equipped with thermal imaging cameras to see at night. Drones that help fishermen chase their prey. No use is too niche as drone-makers chase a market that's forecast to grow an average 32 percent annually over the next decade to reach $30 billion, according to ABI Research. But away from the showroom floor, a chill has settled on a once-hyped market. France's Parrot SA, the second-largest maker of non-military drones, is laying off a third of its staff because margins on its consumer drones were "insufficient to deliver profitable growth". That's a remarkable statement from the company that pioneered cheap consumer drones in 2009 and now focuses on those priced between $100 and $500. You may have seen them on shelves of Apple Inc. stores in the U.S. and Europe. Almost 60 percent of Parrot's revenue is from drones. There are two reasons for Parrot's woes. First, it's withering under the competitive onslaught from China's SZ DJI Technology Co., the undisputed king of non-military drones. DJI makes higher-end models pitched at hobbyists and businesses, which use them for everything from crop inspection to construction. The venture-backed company controls the entire process from design to manufacturing, making it more efficient than outsourcing rivals, and with better products. Lately DJI has gotten more aggressive on price, competitors say. Dozens of cookie-cutter drone-makers have also popped up in Asia, further driving prices down. Even camera-makers such as U.S.-based GoPro Inc. tried their hand only to find the business harder than it looked. GoPro's Karma drone suffered power outages that made some fall out of the sky. The sector's following a familiar script for hardware. Commoditization comes fast, even when a segment is growing rapidly. Scale becomes more important than brand. Profit margins can be thin: just ask makers of flat-screen TVs or smartphone makers other than Apple and Samsung. The shake-out is just coming quicker than investors expected. As recently as 2015, venture capitalists were throwing money at startups. Now layoffs are more common than big fund-raising rounds. Smaller Chinese player Zerotech fired a quarter of its workers in December. Third-placed 3D Robotics Inc. laid people off and decided to stop making drones altogether last year, citing DJI price cuts of 70 percent. It's now focusing on making software to power drones and offering services to companies. This rough patch might not be such a bad thing. Drones have the potential to improve many industries when they're deployed to the real world. But if they're to be more than a fad, we don't need dozens of makers of whizzy drones that delight consumer geeks, but don't really improve the usefulness and safety of the tech. VCs are switching their affections to companies more attuned to the enterprise market, including those such as Airware of the U.S. which offer services. That seems a rational way of trying to avoid a profit-less, as well as a pilot-less, future. (This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.)

The pair met on the set of the widely-panned Fantastic Four remake and went public with its romance in May, 2015, when Kate and Jamie were spotted holding hands at a Met Gala afterparty in New York City. British actor Jamie has since proposed to Kate - and she said yes, her representative confirms to E! News. The news emerges days after the former House of Cards actress was spotted out and about in the Big Apple with a sparkler on her left ring finger. She was also sporting the new piece of jewellery in a photo she posted on Twitter last weekend (07-08Jan17). Kate recently opened up about the relationship for the first time during an appearance on U.S. talk show Conan in November (16), when she revealed Jamie had learned all about American football to impress his girlfriend, who is the great-granddaughter of New York Giants founder Tim Mara and Pittsburgh Steelers initiator Art Rooney, Sr. "Somehow I end up dating a lot of Englishmen... They like soccer, not football," Kate grinned. "My boyfriend right now, my boyfriend Jamie, is amazing and he surprised me one day; when we first started dating, he spent a night where all he did was watch all the previous season of the Giants - every game. So the next time we watched a game together he knew everything about it, which was amazing. He did his homework." Mara, 33, previously dated another Brit, fellow actor Max Minghella, on and off for four years before calling time on their romance in 2014. The marriage will be Kate's first, and Jamie's second - the 30-year-old split from Westworld star Evan Rachel Wood, the mother of his three-year-old son, in 2014 after less than two years of marriage.

The manufacturer will use a version of its LEAF electric car with autonomous technology on public roads in London. As PC Mag notes,  the company had previously tested a self-driving prototype of the LEAF on public roads in Japan back in 2015, but the announcement marks Nissan's first tests in the European market. Alongside the testing expansion, Nissan also plans to expand its factory in England.  Related Stories Execs From Apple, Amazon Join Federal Self-Driving Cars Committee GM Bolsters Plan For Self-Driving Cars Huge Fine Proposed For Testing Driverless Cars Without Permit The automotive market continues to be a popular area of investment for a variety of tech companies. At CES 2017, companies like Ford and Faraday Future showcased cars with integrated autonomous technology. Microsoft and NVIDIA are also among the companies bringing their hardware and design prowess to help improve software options for car dashboard technology.  Within this climate, self-driving technology has seen a significant upswing in investment interest during the past few years. Autonomy technology exists on a spectrum, ranging from partially self-driving cars that still require an active driver to — potentially within the near future — fully autonomous vehicles. Currently, the testing environment to bring cars towards this hardware ideal remains competitive and periodically hazardous.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

There have previously been rumors that the Korean giant too was following pursuit to Apple and removing the traditional 3.5 mm headphone jack. But fresh reports now suggest that the said port might actually stay intact. Samsung isn’t willing to take this leap of faith as of yet. Towards the end of last year, SamMobile reported that the Korean giant was mulling the removal of the headphone jack. But, it is now going back on its own report suggesting that the jack wouldn’t be removed in this flagship (maybe, the next one). These claims are being voiced on the basis of leaked renders of a mobile case, potentially for the Galaxy S8. And one can easily notice the existence of the cutting for the jack. As for other features, they are expected to be quite the same as seen in the attached case renders. This report of the headphone jack staying intact for the Galaxy S8 launch has further been corroborated by Android Police. It is citing some personal sources to confirm the existence of the 3.5mm jack on the smartphone. Further, it adds that previous reports of the jack not being on the phone were hastily reported. Back then, Samsung was still in the process of figuring out the specifications of the device. And now, it could be confirmed as the scheduled launch date is almost in sight. As for other hardware features, they are expected to be quite the same as seen in the attached case renders. Samsung will most likely include the USB Type-C charging port and only pack a single rear camera as opposed to another latest trend. The case also shows off the speaker grill on the bottom of the phone. Last year, all the new smartphones started moving towards a digital experience leaving the analog 3.5mm headphone jack behind. Starting with the Apple iPhone 7, which has been a trendsetter, we saw the headphone jack lose its charm. This trend has now caught fire and most Android OEMs are now toying with the idea of getting rid of the same. Moto Z, HTC U Ultra and many other have already accepted the true fate of this generation old technology. Samsung, however, still wants to offer its users a ubiquitous technology and make Galaxy S8 a decent product offering. This launch being very important, in light of its recent explosive events.

Pandora said late Thursday that the job cuts, which would exclude Ticketfly, are being done to help trim overall operating costs. The Oakland, California-based company has been facing increasing competition from Spotify and Apple Inc.'s music service. Pandora anticipates beating its previously announced forecast for fourth-quarter revenue in a range of $362 million to $374 million, citing its strong advertising performance. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $369.6 million. Pandora Media Inc. is expected to report its fourth-quarter and full-year financial results on Feb. 9. Its stock climbed 80 cents, or 6.7 percent, to $12.80 in morning trading Friday. Its shares are up 27 percent over the past year. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Picture: SCREENGRAB VIA YOUTUBE Hong Kong — Megadeals in China helped bring a record $31bn in venture-capital investment to the country in 2016 despite a sluggish global economy and a sharp drop in the number of deals, a report showed on Friday. Venture-capital investment in China rose 19% to account for about a quarter of the global total of $127bn last year, even though the number of deals fell 42% to just 300, according to KPMG’s quarterly report on global VC trends. China had its two biggest deals for the year in the first half of 2016: $1.2bn in funding for peer-to-peer lending platform Lufax and Apple’s $1bn investment in taxi-hailing app Didi Chuxing. Despite cautious investor sentiment shown in a 9.4% drop in global investment value and a 24% slide in deal count in 2016, average investments in China are getting bigger. China’s deal count more than halved in the past three years, but investment tripled from 2014’s $12bn. Beijing alone attracted $37.3bn in venture capital since that year, including $18.5bn in 2016. The strong performance in China is expected to go on in 2017 with artificial intelligence investment "growing by the day" in a new focus for investors, KPMG said. It expected Chinese-outbound VC investment, especially in the US, to grow at a solid pace driven by Chinese companies wanting to acquire technologies for use in the home market. "Investors in Asia are shifting their investment focus," said Philip Ng, Partner and Head of Technology, KPMG China. Artificial intelligence, robotics and big data are replacing online-to-offline to be what is grabbing investing attention, while there is also increased focus on fintech, education and healthcare related start-ups, he said.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Mobile Image Source: iPhone-Crash, YouTube New Galaxy S8 leak says the headphone jack is here to stay Chris Smith @chris_writes January 12th, 2017 at 4:31 PM Share Tweet The Galaxy S8 is shaping up to be the hottest new Android phone of the beginning of the year. Samsung is expected to unveil it either at MWC in late February, or during a special Unpacked event held in late March. Whatever the case, various reports say you’ll find it in stores only in mid-April. But if there’s one indication we’re getting closer and closer to the Galaxy S8’s launch, it’s the increased number of image leaks that we’re getting. After seeing a dubious prototype image and a first Galaxy S8 case leak in the past few days, it’s now time to look at a brand new leak. And this one seems to indicate the standard 3.5mm headphone jack is very much in the picture. Don't Miss: Exclusive: This image could be the world’s first look at the Galaxy S8 Various Galaxy S8 rumors said the phone will not have a traditional headphone jack and rely on USB-C for audio. Furthermore, Samsung is rumored to develop its own Apple’s AirPods alternative, a new pair of wireless headphones made specifically for the Galaxy S8. But a new set of images that depict a purported Galaxy S8 case seems to indicate that the phone will have a 3.5mm port. Found on Slashleaks by SamMobile, the leak also suggests the Galaxy S9 will have a USB-C port that will be placed in the bottom right corner, while a speaker should sit in the opposite corner. Cutouts for the camera and flash are present on the back, and the case also features buttons for three buttons on the left side of the phone, including the volume keys and the standby button. This new render matches the Galaxy S8 case render BGR exclusively obtained, when it comes to side buttons and camera placement. The Ghostek leak from the other day did not show the bottom of the phone where the ports are found, which makes it impossible to determine whether these two distinct leaks are a perfect match. At the same time, we’ll remind you these are still unverified leaks. While accessory makers may have access to inside information regarding the upcoming Galaxy S8 design, we still have to wait for Samsung to confirm everything.

He co-founded Android Inc. before selling it to Google in 2005, then ran it inside the search giant until 2013, when he switched to new projects at the company. Rubin left Google in 2014, started a tech incubator called Playground Global, and also apparently has been working on a smartphone. A new report surfaced today saying that Andy Rubin created a new company called Essential Products Inc., which will soon launch "a suite of consumer hardware products, including ones for the mobile and smart home", according to "people familiar with the matter". Essential has a 40-person team, and its registered trademark with the USPTO lists "smartphones, tablets, accessories, and computer operating software for mobile phones" as areas of focus. Andy Rubin next to the Android logo The key product to come out of Essential will be a high-end smartphone. This will sport a large edge-to-edge bezelless screen, as well as "the ability to gain new hardware features over time". This modularity will work through a proprietary magnetic connector "that serves double duty for charging the battery and expanding the phone's functionality". It will enable third-party modules, but Essential itself is working on a spherical camera add-on that shoots high-res 360-degree photos. At least one prototype of the phone has a bigger screen than Apple's 5.5" iPhone 7 Plus, but a smaller overall footprint because of its lack of bezels. The display could be pressure-sensitive like the ones in Apple's iPhones. As for materials used, the handset will have a metal frame and a ceramic back, thus sharing more than the bezelless display idea with the Xiaomi Mi Mix. The device will allegedly be out in the middle of this year for a price close or identical to what Apple and Google charge for their iPhones and Pixels. Foxconn is reportedly in talks to build the new phone. Rubin pitched the device to US mobile carrier executives at CES. It's still unclear if the handset will run Android.

Nestled in the English countryside are massive research and development centers, top secret labs and various toys that founder James Dyson collected over the years, including a helicopter in the parking lot and a jet plane in the cafeteria. It’s from this unlikely place that Dyson hopes to make a worldwide splash over the next year and change the way people think about the high-end vacuum maker.  An English Electric Lightning fighter jet hangs above the cafe at Dyson’s campus. Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg Ricardo Reyes Photographer: Michael Short/Bloomberg The person leading this charge is Ricardo Reyes, Dyson’s new communications chief. He made a name for himself in Silicon Valley as the top spokesman for Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors Inc. where he survived longer than most who have held that position. Reyes also worked at Google, YouTube and Square Inc. The appointment of Reyes is of note for a couple of reasons. Last year, Dyson launched the Supersonic, a hair dryer that took about four years and $70 million to develop. Like all Dyson products, the hair dryer was intensely engineered and costs a lot -- $400. It also marked a major expansion for Dyson past things like vacuums and air purifiers. Executives have promised more products as the company tries to become the Apple of home appliances. Reyes must solidify this idea in consumers’ minds, and has already honed his talking points. "Dyson is growing from the living room to the bathroom and beyond, so people are going to interact with it a lot more," Reyes said. "The typical consumer has no idea of the amount of innovation going on here." Dyson has also been rumored to be working on an electric car. Last year, the Financial Times turned up government documents that revealed funding to help Dyson on this project. Dyson bought battery startup Sakti3 for $90 million in 2015, and pledged last year to spend 1 billion pounds ($1.2 billion) on battery development over five years, putting it in closer competition with Tesla. Dyson campus Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg Dyson already has deep electric motor experience. Lab 61 at its headquarters is filled with electric motors of all sizes that have gone through more than a decade of research and sit at the heart of Dyson’s products. This includes the hair dryer, which runs on a miniaturized turbine. If you were looking to bring a new electric car to market, then Reyes would be a good choice, since he helped usher in Tesla’s Roadster, Model S and Model X vehicles. Asked about Dyson’s plans for an electric car, Reyes said, "You never know what Dyson has up its sleeve." For Reyes, Dyson was a good match with Tesla. "It’s very rare to find companies that combine software, hardware and manufacturing all together and to find a company like that that goes direct to the consumer," he said. At Tesla, Reyes was known for having Musk’s ear and being able to sway the inventor at times. But the relationship deteriorated as the years went on, and confrontations around product launches grew more heated.  Asked about the personality of James Dyson, Reyes said, "He moves very quickly, but, at the same time, he’s measured and thoughtful." The company’s brand is strongest in Europe and Japan. It hopes new products will make Dyson a more familiar name in the U.S. and other countries. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

News Education Vista High students prep for school overhaul Deborah Sullivan BrennanContact Reporter Instead of tests and worksheets, future students in a transformed Vista High School can expect to play games — and even create them in class — to illustrate and reinforce the academic concepts they’re mastering. Those kinds of innovative learning strategies were the focus of a workshop last week that sought to introduce parents, teachers, community members and incoming students to a new educational model the school will unveil next fall. In an exercise that mirrored actual classroom assignments, visitors teamed up to design a “Game of Life” to represent the myriad options for life after high school. It illustrated the various pathways students could take after graduation, and the unconventional lessons that will be the norm at Vista High, which is re-imagining secondary education through a $10 million grant from XQ: The Super School Project. “It’s giving the teachers and people in the community a sense of what different classrooms would be like,” in the new high school, said senior Bethany Forbes, 17. For two years, the school has already run a personalized learning academy on campus — a school within a school that offers individualized coursework, interdisciplinary assignments and online curriculum, including projects such as the game challenge they introduced at the workshop. That program was the launching pad that helped the school win the five-year XQ grant in September. “We’ve had to create games through design challenges,” Forbes said of her classes. “It’s something that’s fun and innovative.” Students use Chromebooks and iPads to download lessons and resources. They proceed at their own pace, or collaborate in small groups to explore broad themes such as water, energy, disease. The Super School grant — awarded by a national foundation that began with a $50 million donation from Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs — will enable Vista High to reboot its entire campus, officials said. Last week’s workshop offered a glimpse of what the new program will look like. In response to the workshop challenge, one team created a variation on Monopoly, with squares for classrooms, the quad, spring break and academic probation. Another made a game out of the so-called “gap year” in which players progress through getting a job and going on a mission trip in Indonesia, or backslide by getting fired or losing their earnings at a casino. One group composed a song, and another wrote a skit. Vista High math teacher Sandy Baily said she’ll be one of the early adopters of the new system. She attended the workshop to get ideas about her future classes, which she hopes will motivate students who are apathetic about traditional curriculum. “I have so many students that are checked out when they come to my class,” she said. “I want my class to be an exciting place for my students, and one where they learn in an exciting way.” Vincent Lostetter, a retired Air Force colonel who runs the school’s junior ROTC program, performed a skit with his team about a boot camp-style sorting process for selecting students for college, work and military service. He said the new approach to education is more open-ended than military training systems, but shares the same emphasis on flexibility and preparedness. “I think the structure and adaptability of the military is perfect for where we’re headed as a high school,” he said. “The people who succeed are the ones who can adapt to change.” At an employee training the next day, educational consultant Heidi Hayes Jacobs of Curriculum Designers Group walked teachers through the updated approach to learning. Students in the 21st century need a new suite of skills, she said, including time management, a facility for independent work, and media criticism — the ability to distinguish the accuracy and credibility of online information. Some teachers attending the session agreed that those are important goals, but said their students aren’t there yet. Education specialist Janet Malauulu said some students appear to be distracted by digital devices, although they assure teachers that they’re able to multi-task. “They claim they’re able to retain information while listening to very loud music, or they’re on their cellphone and they’re clearly engaged,” she said. Irma Cano, who teaches business and computer applications, said students have ready access to technology, but may lack sophistication about using it. “Many know about using tech devices, but do not necessarily have the ability to write appropriate letters and e-mails," she said. Those are skills students must develop as they become “digitally literate” through the personalized learning academy, Hayes Jacobs said. deborah.brennnan@sduniontribune.com    Twitter@deborahsbrennan   Three must-see headlines  <h1>SDPD puts 'The Wrap' on struggling suspects</h1> <h1>Chargers announce move to Los Angeles</h1> <h1>Brief respite from rain, then possibly more next week</h1>     SDPD puts 'The Wrap' on struggling suspects Chargers announce move to Los Angeles Brief respite from rain, then possibly more next week   See more videos deborah.brennan@sduniontribune.com Twitter@deborahsbrennan Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, The San Diego Union-Tribune High Schools Educators Steve Jobs Other sports teams roasted the Chargers for their new logo, L.A. move Spanos, Chargers stumble amid unprecedented NFL PR blunders L.A.

He was reportedly found dead in his apartment of natural causes. News IT reported he had been dead several days before his body was found. Mardas was probably one of the more infamous characters from the Beatles universe. John Lennon was reportedly introduced to him by Brian Jones of The Rolling Stones after Mardas created a psychedelic light box for them. He was friendly with John Dunbar, who was a friend of Paul McCartney's and the husband of Marianne Faithful before she was involved with Mick Jagger. His strange electronic gadgets were embraced by all of the Beatles, but especially Lennon, who dubbed him "Magic Alex." Some of his ideas had foresight, like the phone that dialed by voice recognition and displayed the numbers of callers. But then there were others, like the electronic brooches that made noise and flashed in no particular order, the artificial sun using laser beams and the invisible curtain that used ultrasonic vibrations to screen the Beatles from their fans. "I invented a large number of electronic devices, none of which had anything to do with music of the business of the Beatles," he said in a statement to The New York Times in 2010. "It must be remembered that none of these had even been thought about by others at the time, although most of them are now in common use," citing an electronic camera and a "memory phone" among them. Lennon thought so much of him that, according to author Philip Norman, he introduced him at a group meeting as "my new guru." His friendship with the band was also demonstrated in the fact he went on several holidays with various members of the group. When Mardas married in 1968, The Beatles attended his wedding. And when The Beatles began Apple Corps, Mardas was hired to head Apple Electronics, which author Tony Bramwell in his book Magical Mystery Tours: My Life With The Beatles called "a waste of time and money." He was also chosen to design lighting for The Beatles' newly opened Apple Boutique and reportedly tried to help them buy a Greek island. John Lennon had Mardas deliver a devastating message to his first wife Cynthia Lennon when he was about to leave her for Yoko Ono. "I've come with a message from John," quoted Philip Norman in his book John Lennon: A Life. "He is going to divorce you, take Julian away from you and send you back to Hoylake," where she grew up. The message caused Cynthia Lennon to lose her voice and be confined to bed with a fever. In 1969, Mardas was chosen to put together a 78-track recording studio for them at Apple. But instead of the studio, The Beatles found only components from a German manufacturer still in boxes. When Allen Klein took over as The Beatles' business manager, Klein pushed Mardas out for good.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG [NEW YORK] BlackRock Inc CEO Larry Fink on Friday criticised a policy backed by US President-elect Donald Trump to entice US companies to bring their swelling overseas cash piles home, saying a tax holiday may do little to boost growth. Mr Trump, who takes office Jan 20, has proposed allowing repatriation of that cash at a 10 per cent tax rate, hoping some of it would be spent on hiring and business investments. Companies such as Apple Inc, Pfizer Inc, Microsoft Corp hold nearly US$1.8 trillion overseas, Moody's Investors Service Inc estimated last month. By doing so, they avoid a 35 per cent US corporate tax rate. "I don't believe the concept that repatriation is going to stimulate our economy - I've never believed in that," Mr Fink told CNBC in an interview tied to his company's 2016 earnings release. Mr Fink said it is not likely that the money companies bring back would go to "building factories" and growing the economy. Instead, he said "it will go back to buyback more shares and it will go towards dividends and maybe M&A," mergers and acquisitions. SEE ALSO: Asset manager BlackRock's quarterly profit falls 1.2% Mr Trump transition team officials did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. BlackRock manages US$5.1 trillion for individual savers and institutions, ranking as a top shareholder of many of the world's largest companies. BlackRock also votes on the composition of those companies' boards as well as on governance proposals from management and shareholders. From his perch, Mr Fink has repeatedly urged top CEOs to focus on creating long-term value instead of emphasising quarterly targets. Buybacks can boost earnings per share figures because the practice lowers the number of shares on issue. In the past Mr Fink has said that executives have relied too much on buybacks and dividend increases rather than making investments in the long-run success of their businesses. BlackRock on Friday hiked its own quarterly dividend by 9 per cent and ramped up its share buyback program but said it did so after making investments in its future growth. Analysts have said lower-tax repatriation could also be a big boost for asset managers. Mr Fink, who had donated to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, recently joined an advisory council to Mr Trump that includes several other CEOs.

This is also the thinnest waterproof iPhone 6 case we’ve seen, and it also works with Touch ID. There are multiple LifeProof iPhone 6 cases, and today we are reviewing the LifeProof frē iPhone 6 case today. Advertisement With a waterproof iPhone 6 case like the LifeProof frē I can take the iPhone wherever I go — out in the snow, to a hot tub or pool or just into the shower to listen to music or watch Football while I am getting ready. Of course most users are looking for a LifeProof iPhone 6 case to keep their iPhone safe from drops, water and other hazards of daily life. You don’t need a kid for a LifeProof case to make sense, but if you are a parent who constantly hands off an expensive new iPhone to a child this case is certainly a great iPhone 6 accessory to have. This is an excellent waterproof iPhone 6 case. Advertisement The LifeProof frē iPhone 6 case is available in six color options including black, pink, white, blue, red and purple so you can match your iPhone and your style. There are gray accents on the white LifeProof iPhone 6 case so it doesn’t disappear in the snow. Advertisement This case offers a lot of protection, and for the size it is one of the most protective iPhone 6 cases you can find. There are some trade offs, but this is the best iPhone 6 case for anyone who needs to protect the iPhone from every season and in practically every environment the average user ends up in. You can buy the LifeProof iPhone 6 case direct for $79.99 with free shipping. The LifeProof nüüd iPhone 6 case that seals to the screen and doesn’t include a screen protector like the frē is coming soon to LifeProof. This case protects against drops, water, snow and dirt. You expect a waterproof iPhone 6 case to add a lot of bulk to the phone and make using it with one hand impossible, but the LifeProof iPhone 6 case is not much thicker than the iPhone 6 Plus in a slim Apple Leather case. Using the LifeProof iPhone 6 case with one hand takes a few adjustments, but it is still easy to do. In some cases it is easier because you can grip the iPhone 6 in the case with one hand easier than you can without a case on it. Advertisement The design obscures the new curved design of the iPhone 6, but it does look nice and the raised edge combines with a built-in screen protector to keep the screen safe from scratches. The screen still looks nice and is easy to use with the built-in screen protector. The LifeProof iPhone 6 case protected the iPhone 6 from water in a shower and while doing dishes. It also provided great protection from the snow during short trips to shovel and longer outings to play in and enjoy the snow in Ohio. Although we didn’t go overboard with testing the protection from drops, the case protected it easily from waist level to hard and carpeted surfaces. You can use Touch ID with this waterproof iPhone 6 case, but it is not as reliable as using Touch ID with no case on. Even with the raised edges around the screen, it is easy to use the built-in gestures. The built-in screen protector isn’t as nice as a glass one, but it still works well and looks good. You can still use Touch ID, but it is not as reliable. Advertisement There is a headphone jack cover that you need to unscrew to plug-in headphones. The cover remains attached to the case so you don’t lose it. You can plug a pair of Apple EarPods in without the included adapter if you don’t need it to be waterproof, but you’ll need the free adapter to keep water out and to use other headphones. A small flap folds down for access to the Lightning port. This flap came off when I forgot to un-snap this before taking the case off, but it is easy to put back in place and you can avoid this by remembering to open this before removing the case. The buttons are easy to use and the case is still relatively thin. The speaker and microphone are covered and it does degrade audio quality and volume some, but for the protection it delivers it is a trade-off we can easily make. It helps that LifeProof improved the sound with the case on from earlier designs. All of the buttons are easy to access, with a handy toggle that makes switching to silent mode incredibly easy. Advertisement The LifeProof iPhone 6 case is an excellent way to protect the iPhone 6 and it is an essential accessory for users that need a waterproof iPhone 6 or who don’t want to buy AppleCare+ for protection. 24 Responses 01/22/2015 NeedIt Reply Okay, seriously. How did you land the case, and when can I buy it?!! Why is lifeproof taking forever?!! 01/22/2015 NeedIt Reply Whoops, misread, thought it was the nuud. Damnit lifeproof, hurry up! 01/24/2015 Renee Reply I am extremely disappointed in this case. It is very cheap looking and cheap feeling. It feels like it was made in China for China…I should know….I lived as an expat there for 7 years. The fingerprint ID DOES NOT work with this case AT ALL! This case is extremely overpriced and I just ordered an Otterbox. 05/08/2015 Charlie Reply U got that right!!! Pricey n not up to their ad…n warranty dept. awful 06/30/2015 Melisa Reply I personally still can use the Touch ID with no problem. So far I haven’t had any problems 09/01/2016 Jay Reply no one cares 04/30/2015 Droppediphone6intoilet Reply I just got this case yesterday, to replace my non-waterproof otter box case (see username). So far, I like the slim design of the lifeproof case. It is far less bulky than the previous case. Hopefully it will protect my newly replaced phone against water damage, should I ever again be clumsy and let my phone go for a swim (argh!) My only issue with this case is the charging port. Generic/aftermarket chargers will not fit through the case and into the port. Only Apple chargers will fit into the port, with the case on. 05/08/2015 Charlie Reply This case sucks big time, the charger port door broke after 3 weeks n the device never dropped or went into water yet n try getting lifeproof to replace as part of warranty good luck!! They’ll ask for serial number that not even superman can read it, and touchscreen always stop or slow because of the stickiness of the materials…there’s few others I know who got same problems as far as broken charger doors n they too have problems with warranty dept. 06/01/2015 dennis Reply I recently bought a Life proof case at Walmart on Saturday, May 23. I went early that morning to purchase my Nuud life proof case. I bought the case and left to go home to leave for my CRUISE and when I got home I put the case on…just to find out that the nuud life proof iphone 6 case does not fit the iphone 6. So before leaving on my trip I went by Walmart and returned the case and swapped it for the life proof fre case. This time making sure that the case FIT THE PHONE gladly the case worked. So I left for my trip. And the night before my trip I stayed in a hotel room so I did the recommended water test…I did the test and the case was completely water proof. The next day I boarded my ship and went for a swim in the pool. The pool was no more than 5 and a half feet deep. And I was only in the water for a few short minutes before water leaked into my case destroying my phone. I love the slim feel of the case but the water proof part not so much. So I WENT THE WHOLE CRUISE WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO TAKE ANY PICTURES THANKS TO THIS CASE. 07/03/2015 Rob Mark Reply haha. Wow you really run it through the ringer, eh review guy? White fluffy snow and branches. Nice pictures but this product is still a piece of garbage. i bought the NUUD and an Iphone 6 in February. Took it canoeing yesterday. Was submerged in water maybe 20-30 mins. it killed my very expensive iPhone. And life proof will only offer to send you a new case or a refund. But they don;t have the balls to stand by their product enough to replace a damaged phone. DO NOT BUY IT. 09/01/2015 Benson Reply Ha well I love my case, had ONE I repeat one problem with it after 4 months of hard hard use. (I show it off frequently) the seal on the clear latex feeling home button came apart. Who knows how long it had been that way because I had swam many times and noticed a tad bit of dew on the inside screen and just left the charger port open to air it out; figured maybe as much I was using it under water it was my phone just getting hot. After I actually pin pointed what was wrong and called LifeProof the woman made it so easy with an email and asking for me to call back if I had any questions about the warranty picture process. Which I did and even though it was a different person on the phone she was just as nice and walked me through the process to do it myself without printing the warranty form. I have the iPhone 6 Fre case and I love it. It was worth every penny! If you think an otter box is the most durable “best thing out there” YOUR WRONG!! Try a LifeProof Fre and you’ll have your friends throwing their 2 and 3 piece plastic case-weird texture- rubber case- away. The LifeProof cases are half as thick, MORE stylish and sleek, and twice as durable. Benson 540- Virginia 09/09/2015 Andrew Reply I paid $110 dollars for my case,from a Telstra shop as I use my iPhone for work,well what a shit case,don’t buy one,firstly the on off ringer rubber switch perished ,secondly the clear membrain over return button fell off ,then the rubber seal fell off,got ripped here ,won’t be buying another one,only one chance with me,and it’s not even a year old,my fault I lost the receipt 09/20/2015 Traci Reply This case really really sucks! If you take it out of its case for any reason and put it back on, it comprises the integrity and water will get in. I took mine to Hawaii after having it for awhile and took a bunch of priceless photos. The last day I took it snorkeling and lost everything! I was in tears over it! Life proof should be responsible, since they guarantee it is full proof, but they don’t! 09/29/2015 Erin Reply no one can hear me with this case. I just purchased yesterday for $90. My voice sounds muffled. I will be returning ASAP. very disappointing as I had the older lifeproof case and had no issues, 10/04/2015 GloTurneround Reply This is the ABSOLUTE WORST purchase I have ever made in my life!!! I paid $80 plus tax on this piece of crap and my phone broke in a matter of days. Wow I can’t believe you people vouch of this ridiculous product. Back to OtterBOX I go!! I will take a big bulky crack free phone anyday over this useless piece of crap! 10/21/2015 Jtesh Reply Can anyone tell me if I read this correct? Under exclusion and limitations LIFEPROOF DOES NOT! Cover replacement or cost of any electronic device inside or outside the LIFEPROOF product! So if the product fails you have junk for a phone and defective cover that they will replace within warranty time for a phone that is no longer working? 11/30/2015 T Reply Purchased a Lifeproof case for my iPhone 6 Plus and EVERY PERSON I spoke to said they couldn’t hear me. Sounded like I was in a tunnel. Turned off the phone noise cancellation as the rep told me to. Nothing changed. I had bought the case less than 24 hours before but could not return due to packaging being opened. When I called to get a replacement I was told I had to pay for shipping. NO. Argued this and finally got that fee dropped and received the warranty case which she SWORE I would NOT have these issues only to put the case on and have the exact same problem. I paid over $100 for a case I cannot talk with and cannot return. Worst purchase ever. Going back to my Otterbox. Furious that this is the best Lifeproof can come up with. 01/29/2016 Alec Reply I love my new case! I work outside in the snow a lot and I’ve dropped my phone several times in the snow and it’s been great! My phone would be destroyed if I hadn’t gotten this case. 02/12/2016 Sandra Reply I’ve had my iPhone 6 Fre case for about 6 months and just noticed the plastic cover over the home button was shifted and exposing the phone. I took the case off and see it is completely unglued from the case. Doesn’t seem very reliable… 07/11/2016 Vanessa Richards Reply I bought my iPhone 6s and immediately put the life proof case on, first time ever. Every time I dropped it, no shatters, Nothing. Yesterday, with my luck, I dropped my iPhone in a muddy waterfall/pond. As soon as I got dried, I opened my phone case, to dry my phone but it wasn’t needed. My phone was perfectly dry. Not broken. And works perfectly. Life proof phone cases definitely are not over priced. If it works to protect your $600 phone, don’t you lwant a highly priced case? I definitely wouldn’t buy a $5 water proof case. Because it obviously won’t work. My volume buttons work great, same with the power button. The home button also works perfectly & to use your thumb print password also works perfectly. 07/18/2016 Stephanie Reply The case is okay but you can’t even hear people on the phone and they have a hard time hearing you. Also, my aux cord broke after not even 2 months and they CHARGED me to send me a new one. you think after spending almost 100$ on a phone case and something doesn’t work the least they can do is send you that part for FREE. 09/21/2016 Amber Reply I’ve had my “Lifeproof” case for almost a year now. Up until 2 1/2 weeks ago I hadn’t tried taking my phone in the water at all, because it’s just unnatural and scary. My family went on vacation and while we were at the pool at our hotel I decided to let my son take a pic of him and his brother under water. (big mistake) I gave him the phone, he went under to snap a quick picture and he came right back up and said the phone had turned off. This was first thing in the morning and my battery life was at 100% so I knew it wasn’t dead. When he handed me the phone I noticed that water had gotten inside the case, so I rushed to a towel and took off the “Lifeproof” case and wiped my phone down. We ended up getting the kids out of the pool and Googled the nearest Verizon store near our hotel. Verizon gave us the customer service number for Lifeproof and said they should replace the phone. My husband called their customer service number and there was nothing they can do. All we were told was “Oh, so sad to hear about your phone, but we can certainly replace the case for you!” SERIOUSLY??? Replace the case??? The case that didn’t do it’s job to begin with?? Oh, but they can send it in a different color! Yay! PLEASE DON”T waste your money. The only protection this case is good for is damage from dropping it. Find a cheaper case and keep it out of harms way. 01/12/2017 Dave Morgan Reply Worst products out there, buyer beware!!! We got my son the FRE for Christmas and 1 week later he took his i-phone 6+ in the pool, well now we have a $700 paper weight that LP won’t repair/replace it. They act so apologetic but not willing to budge on doing what is ethical. Shame on them for making all these “waterproof” claims, the IP68 rating is NOT waterproof. It’s my mission to get them to take such fraudulent claims off their website. Tell the truth and call it splash proof. Dave M 01/13/2017 Dave Reply Worst products out there, buyer beware!!! We got my son the FRE for Christmas and 1 week later he took his i-phone 6S in the pool, well now we have a $700 paper weight that LP won’t repair/replace. They act so apologetic but not willing to budge on doing what is ethical. Shame on them for making all these “waterproof” claims, the IP6x rating is NOT fully waterproof.

Netflix i By David Frese dfrese@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Whether the ice-mageddon of Winter Storm Jupiter arrives or not, we’re always in need of great suggestions for viewing and binge-watching. Here are some favorites of staff members and contributors that should keep you entertained — as long as the power is still on. Stay safe out there. ▪ “Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events”: The story of the terrible events that plagued the innocent young lives of the Baudelaire orphans is too horrible and tragic to explain here. Even the presence of Neil Patrick Harris and Patrick Warburton can’t sugarcoat these horrendous events. On second thought, don’t watch this new series at all. Don’t even think of it. We’re sorry we even brought it up. Netflix. (David Frese, dfrese@kcstar.com.) &nbsp; ▪ “The Crown”: You could watch this biographical drama based on the reign of Queen Elizabeth II just to see what the most expensive TV series in human history looks like. Or to watch recent Golden Globes best actress winner Claire Foy express more in a scene with her eyes than most actresses can with an entire page of dialogue. Either way, you’ll be entertained. Netflix. (Aaron Randle, arandle@kcstar.com) ▪ “The Book of Love.” Hometown boy Jason Sudeikis stars as a man who befriends a teen girl to fulfill a promise he made to his wife. The film hit theaters Friday, Jan. 13, and is also available on your cable provider’s video on demand service. (DF) ▪ “The OA.” Brit Marling plays a woman who had gone missing as a child. And she once was blind. And she once was the daughter of a Russian diplomat. Maybe. The Netflix series is reminiscent of Marling’s excellent film “The Sound of My Voice,” in which she plays a woman who may or may not be the leader of a cult. That film is available through online video rental services such as Apple and the PlayStation store. (DF) &nbsp; ▪ “O.J.: Made in America”: Feels like there’s been a hundred docu/film/drama/whatevers on the O.J. Simpson trial. Forget ’em all. Not a single one is more entertaining, engrossing or thought-provoking than this 2016 ESPN offering (and a leading contender for the best documentary Oscar) that masterfully dissects the trial, psyche and fascinating polarization of “The Juice.” WatchESPN app. (AR) ▪ “Wrecked”: Two Blue Valley Northwest kids just created a sitcom the New York Times is calling one of the best TV shows of 2016. Not bad considering it was their first stab at television. “Wrecked” centers on a group of diverse, wonky plane crash survivors on a remote island as they try to figure out how to endure the elements and one another. Read more here. TBS. (AR) ▪ “Twin Peaks”: An oldie but a goodie. This quirky David Lynch series hasn’t aged all that well, but with the Showtime revival/sequel set to debut this May, maybe this is the perfect time to revisit Special Agent Dale Cooper, Sheriff Harry S Truman, Audrey Horne, the One-Armed Man, the Log Lady, Windom Earle and … BOB (shudder). Netflix. (DF) ▪ “The Fundamentals of Caring.” Netflix. Paul Rudd plays an in-home caregiver who breaks a wheelchair-bound 20-something out of his homebound existence to view some of the country’s more unique cultural attractions. It’s a quiet, poignant and funny film that was released directly to Netflix. The Star’s full review is here. Netflix. (DF) ▪ “Insecure.” This show about a dark-skinned black woman challenges racial stereotypes with biting humor, sharp wit and spot-on acting. Oh, and it has a 100 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. HBO Go/HBO Now. (AR) &nbsp; ▪ “This Is Us”: If you haven’t watched this new show, grab your iPad and download the NBC app. Pull up the pilot and give it a try. This show is for anyone who loves narrative storytelling. The weaving in and out from the past and present is masterful. The acting, great. The bond — and sometimes not so much — among siblings will make you tear up. NBC.com. (Laura Bauer, lbauer@kcstar.com). ▪ “Black Mirror”: This Netflix series is the evolutionary “Twilight Zone.” It’s a superb and cynical show about technology and the way it has changed us. Season 3 debuted in the fall, but start with Season 1 and give it at least three episodes (though you’ll really be missing out if you skip Episodes 4 and 5). You won’t be disappointed. (Terez Paylor, tpaylor@kcstar.com) ▪ “Luke Cage”: Let’s see: a show about a large African-American male who likes to wear hoodies, has a deep moral code and is literally bulletproof with superhuman strength? Throw in the presence of Rosario Dawson and Simone Missick and that’s a recipe for an automatic watch on Netflix. (TP) ▪ “Scream: The TV Series”: Attractive youngsters unravel the mystery behind the masked killer slaughtering their classmates in this pseudo-adaptation of the 1996 horror hit. While the interplay of the cast is appealing — especially the “virgin nerd” Noah (John Karna) and his feisty lesbian BFF Audrey (Bex Taylor-Klaus) — the self-referential parody of the horror genre offers the real draw. First two seasons available on Netflix. (Jon Niccum, Special to The Star) &nbsp; ▪ “Stranger Things”: Few original Netflix shows dominated pop culture last year as thoroughly as this tale of four geeky middle-schoolers who turn detective when one of them vanishes under puzzling circumstances in small-town Indiana. The retro vibe gloriously re-creates the music and fashion of its 1983 setting. But it’s the emotional bond among the friends, their family, a stalwart sheriff and a psychokinetic accomplice that make the series resonate. First season available on Netflix. (JN) ▪ “Maron”: Everybody knows about “Louie,” the brilliant but dark and only occasionally funny sitcom starring Louis CK. Louie, though, isn’t the only stand-up to make a great sitcom in the last few years. Like “Maron,” for instance. The semi-autobiographical take on the cerebral comic-turned-podcasting-superstar, Marc Maron, now has four seasons airing on Netflix. (Hampton Stevens, Special to The Star) ▪ “The Jim Gaffigan Show”: Both seasons are streamable on TV Land. The consistently clever and family-friendly series is loaded with great stars and follows the off-stage adventures of America’s favorite food comic, his wife and brood of five kids. TV Land. (HS) ▪ “Legit”: Not so family-friendly, but “Legit” hilariously and often poignantly explores the ribald adventures of Aussie comic Jim Jefferies and his dissipated life in L.A. TV Land. (HS) ▪ “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend”: Rebecca Bunch (Rachel Bloom) moves from New York to California on a whim after she runs into an ex-boyfriend and learns he’s living on the west coast. Essentially she stalks him but in a more cute, less creepy way. Although mostly light, fun and full of terrific original musical numbers from multiple genres, the series also addresses depression, obsession and sexuality. (Rob Owen, Special to The Star.) Seen those? Try these. We also asked some folks in the arts for their recommendations: ▪ Local singer/songwriter Jessica Paige: “I was sick with bronchitis and watched a ton of TV last week. ‘Westworld’ is fascinating because it poses a lot of hypothetical situations to how humans will respond to developing artificial intelligence and the moral gray land that will result from that. It takes you on a journey that is very thoughtful, sexy and dramatic without knowing exactly where the plot is going. “ ‘Sherlock’ has been a favorite show of mine because (Benedict) Cumberbatch is the best Sherlock Holmes. Quirky, witty and easy to love/hate. I’m also just a big fan of anything spinning off Doyle’s stories and the British humor.” &nbsp; ▪ Eric McHenry, Kansas poet laureate: “My favorite recent binge-watch was the English comedy ‘Detectorists,’ about the micro-dramas of some metal-detecting enthusiasts. Right now Sonja and I are watching and enjoying ‘Catastrophe,’ another comedy set in England. Some of the funniest dialogue I can remember hearing, although it’s so profane that my thumb is permanently on the pause button (kids). It includes Carrie Fisher’s final performance, and she’s just peerless. “And it’s an obvious thing to say, but anybody who hasn’t seen ‘The Wire’ should watch all of it before watching (or even doing) anything else.” ▪ Stephane Scupham, Kansas City film commissioner recommends “The Get Down” on Netflix. The series was written by KCK’s Aaron Rahsaan Thomas. She said it’s a sweet, romantic, musical blast from the past focusing on the cultural and racial landscape of America and NYC in the late 1970s. &nbsp; ▪ Julian Zugazagoitia, director, Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art recommends “Mozart in the Jungle.” “I’ve been fascinated by this! It has an amazing cast and guest appearances by rock stars of classical music like Gustavo Dudamel and Placido Domingo, which makes it feel almost real. The plot is surreal and baroque, but that it is rooted in the art world is what captivates me — it feels close and yet far away. This is the only show I’ve been able to get my wife to watch with me. “I am also waiting for the new season of ‘Homeland’ to watch with my son, and ‘The Crown’ to watch with my daughter.” ▪ Lyric Opera production director Tracy Davis recommends the Amazon Prime series “Goliath.” The series stars Golden Globe winner Billy Bob Thornton, who plays an ambulance chaser who pursues a wrongful death lawsuit against the massive firm he helped create. The opera connection? “In every single episode there is a scene with opera playing in the background,” she said. “It’s a really good show.” If that’s not enough, “Goliath” was created by “Picket Fences” and “Ally McBeal” creator David E. Kelly. ▪ Lyric Opera general director and CEO Deborah Sandler suggests fine arts lovers check out the streaming service of the Metropolitan Opera at MetOpera.org, which features online access to more than 600 full-length Met performances. ▪ Kansas City Symphony music librarian Fabrice Curtis: “Three HBO shows that I absolutely love are ‘The Comeback,’ ‘Enlightened,’ and ‘Getting On.’ Together they make up a trinity of shows that focus on flawed female characters that the viewer becomes empathetic with over the course of the show. They all defy easy categorization, having elements of both comedy and drama. If I had to recommend one, it would be ‘The Comeback.’ Lisa Kudrow's performance is phenomenal; she is able to communicate so much without words, all while being hilarious. She plays an actress being filmed for a reality show that is following her comeback, hence the title. The show examines the making of reality tv, sexism in the workplace, and ageism in Hollywood all while being funny and entertaining.” David Frese: 816-234-4463, @DavidFrese Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story TV News & Reviews Suggested for you   Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 3:16 After nearly 50 years in exile, former KC Black Panther leader Pete O'Neal speaks from Africa Pause 1:38 Tailgaters unfazed by weather while waiting for Chiefs-Steelers playoff game 0:53 Chiefs fans defy weather for playoff game 0:41 Kansas trooper’s dashcam shows semitrailer losing control on I-70 2:33 Iconic 'Star Wars' actress Carrie Fisher has died at age 60 2:45 Chiefs’ Dontari Poe shows off basketball skills with Harlem Globetrotters 1:04 Tarp comes off the field at Arrowhead Stadium 3:35 KU coach Bill Self on win over Oklahoma State: 'I didn't think it was one of our better games' 42:20 Chiefs 33, Broncos 10: Postgame analysis 3:39 How the AFC West was won: Chiefs had talent, brains, guts and luck Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 2 months ago KC bar hopping with George Wendt and friends 3:55 2 months ago KC bar hopping with George Wendt and friends 0:50 3 months ago 'Stranger Things' mash-up with 'A Charlie Brown Christmas' 0:43 4 months ago 'Space, the final frontier:' Remembering 'Star Trek' on its 50th anniversary View more video TV News & Reviews PBS: No 'red flag' on funding under Trump, but it's early Dick Gautier, who played Hymie on 'Get Smart,' dies at 85 Here’s what to binge watch when Winter Storm Jupiter hits Oh Ms. Snap!

Lately, users have also been reporting an issue when transferring files from their Apple MacBooks using the stock Google Pixel USB-C to USB-A cable. After looking into the issue extensively, it would appear that it likely stems from Google’s Android File Transfer program which hasn’t been updated since 2012… This issue has been reported by dozens of people on XDA, Reddit (1, 2), Google’s Product Forums, and elsewhere across the web. After some testing, we were also able to replicate the problem but only when moving certain types of files to the Pixel from a variety of MacBook models. Some types of files and folders seem to transfer without any difficulty. This initially made us think that it was the Pixel’s cable, especially after trying other USB-C cables which — oddly enough — seem to work just fine. But after some additional testing showing that Google’s cable works perfectly fine with another file transfer application called HandShaker, it seems the issue actually might stem from Google’s four-year-old software. Digging into Google’s Android File Transfer program, you will find that it hasn’t been updated since October 15, 2012. This is obviously an extremely long time to not update something that so many Android users rely on to transfer data to and from their phones. This is obviously a small and minor bug in Google’s program that is only affecting a handful of users but it’s still one worth bringing to light. As the Android File Transfer program in question was last updated before USB-C was even publicly available, it might be time for the company to update the app to make sure everything still works properly. Google has stated on multiple occasions that USB-C is a standard that must be followed carefully with one of their own engineers being at the forefront of testing and reviewing cables found on Amazon. So whether it is the cable or the program (or some combination of the two) at fault, Google of all companies should give this problem some attention. Is anyone else in the community having this issue with the Pixel’s USB-C cable or a similar problem? Make sure to let us know. Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

Fuse, bots, chatbots, top-stories Above: If the app industry fails, bad apps are to blame. Image Credit: Shutterstock.com/MR Gao According to bot evangelists, today’s apps are going to be replaced by bots, so why bother with fanciness? Goodbye, delicious Uber UI animations. So long, stickers and filters on Snapchat. Farewell, swiping on Tinder. Will the last app standing be Facebook Messenger? This vision of bots taking over, first painted by Mark Zuckerberg, then co-opted by Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella and many others, has created quite the stir in the app community. I have heard both sides of the argument, and I’d like to quickly recap the current state of discussions on this topic. One side says the death of apps is imminent with this so-called invasion of bots. “Just as websites replaced client applications then, messaging bots will replace mobile apps now,” TechCrunch reported in 2015. Combine that with slowing growth rates of app downloads, and the bot evangelists appear to have a fair point. The other side says these reports are greatly exaggerated, claiming that app store growth is accelerating and citing Apple’s growing payouts to developers as evidence. App developers also point out that bots and conversational UIs are among the most overhyped technologies of 2016. So who’s right? Could bots really cause the world of apps to go belly up? Unfortunately, these are the wrong questions to ask, and they are leading to fundamentally flawed conversations. Here’s why: Bots are a red herring. It makes no sense to pit bots against apps. Bots can’t solve today’s app woes or vice versa. The truth is, download rates are declining due to “crap app” burnout. What everybody wants is something that’s going to solve a problem, to make their lives easier, to seamlessly access a service, or even to enrich their lives in some delightful way. What they typically experience is disappointment or annoyance, which leads to fewer app downloads. People are obsessed with the wrong metric We need to look beyond downloads to Mobile Engagement metrics, not simply app downloads. Are people even engaged on mobile devices? According to Dscout, absolutely. People touch their phones an average of 2,617 times daily. We yearn to go deeper and deeper into the experience. Gartner even predicts these new digital experiences will draw people into nonstop virtual reactions, through AR/VR/MR. Looking at Comscore’s 2016 report, we see that mobile apps clearly continue to outpace the mobile web by a 7:1 margin in time spent, a ratio that has been consistent for the past two years. According to Flurry, it’s closer to 10:1. That’s 90 percent of their mobile screen time inside of apps. But perhaps most importantly, mobile users spend a really high percentage of their time on their No. 1 most used app, and about 9 out of 10 minutes within their Top 5. So if users are spending more time on fewer apps, how can new apps break through and engage them? Bad apps are poison There’s always talk of creating a “killer app,” but people say there’s no recipe for it. Well, there is: It’s creating a killer user experience. Let me give you an example. Today there are over 600 task managers for the iPhone alone, with a new one popping up every other week. Managing tasks in a world of infinite distractions is a great problem to solve. Today all of these apps are flawed, yet in invisible ways. They each lack a focus on creating killer UX. The designer-developer team who pays attention to every little detail — and I mean every micro interaction — is going to win. Above: UX-focused design through great UI and animation by Tubik Studio. According to Don Norman, best-selling author of The Design of Everyday Things, UX “encompasses all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the product.” It may sound absurd, but this level of UX mindfulness is crucial. Uber and Snapchat understand this implicitly because UX obsession is in their DNA. Unfortunately, like so many tech buzzwords, people have completely misused and overused the term UX, as well as mixing it up with the term UI (user interface), adding further to the problem. Let me try to separate the two: Imagine sitting in a beautifully designed car. The magnificent interior is all around you, covered in expensive materials. Now imagine that the hand-stitched leather steering wheel is on the ceiling and you push the gorgeous carbon fiber pedals with your hands. This car would be impossible to drive. The beautiful interior is the user interface in this analogy. Ensuring that the interface is in places that make sense and that the car is not only possible, but also pleasurable, to drive is the user experience. App makers need to step up their UX game. They need to iterate quickly and include user feedback throughout the process until the experience is rock solid. Sloppy apps hurt the mobile ecosystem. In a time where an app store rating of 4.5 overshadows a similar app with a 4.3, the margins are small and the stakes are incredibly high. Above: Experience is everything. Another great example from Tubik Studio. Good bots and apps are like peanut butter and chocolate Apps and bots are better together. Let’s go back to the false choice of bots or apps: rushing either bad apps or pointless bots to market is bad for the customer. Bot-makers are dangerously repeating the same mistakes that app-makers have already made and moved on from. There are already thousands of bots that are completely useless. Just because something can be made doesn’t mean it should be. When the Google Play Store touts that it has passed 2.4 million apps or when Facebook says there’s already more than 30,000 bots in Messenger, these are simply the wrong bragging points. The world doesn’t need another flashlight app, and it certainly doesn’t need another celebrity chat bot. It’s not too late to save bots from a total UX crisis. Bot and app creators must work more closely together so that history does not repeat itself. As more and more technologies are introduced, we must start thinking more holistically about a single and unified brand experience for the user. That will help determine what thing to build for what purpose, and when to integrate, before the bot stores of the future (as with the app stores of the past few years) are overrun with junk. Bots and apps both have the potential to be engagement tools for the same user, and should not be viewed as competing but rather complementary technologies. There is a harmonious space for both killer apps and useful bots on each of our devices. Going forward these two technologies can and must work side by side, filling in gaps in each other’s experience. It’s not enough that we build products that function, that are understandable and usable, we also need to build products that bring joy and excitement, pleasure and fun, and yes, beauty to people’s lives. — Don Norman Brands and enterprises need to embrace quality UX The demand for mobile apps for the enterprise has increased for years and is about to skyrocket. Custom apps in large corporations are used by tens of thousands of employees and partners daily, and proper UX in this space is more important than ever. Enterprise users now have the same expectations for their enterprise apps as they have for their consumer apps regarding quality and overall experience. These types of apps are largely ignored when measuring app store traffic and engagement. Despite today’s false choice between bots and apps, brands must stay in charge of their own destiny to engage users in a cohesive, seamless experience. Above: Air Asia Travel app by Johny vino. The world desperately wants better apps and better tools to make them. We are entering an exciting era where a clear focus on mobile engagement through experience is essential. To get there, we need an increased focus on non-trivial details that will be invisible to most, but that delight us all. Finally, there is a happy place for both high-quality bots and killer apps. As Brian Solis said in his book X: The Experience when Business Meets Design, “The future is in experiences.” See you in the trenches, and may the best UX win.

He hopes to go into the defense industry, and wants to work on an airplane or spacecraft. Photo: Marcus Yam, TNS Aerospace firms start recruiting in prekindergarten 1 / 1 Back to Gallery University of Southern California mechanical engineering junior Stephanie Balais developed a passion for aerospace after joining the university’s AeroDesign team and helping to construct an airplane fuselage hours before transporting the plane to a competition in Kansas. As internships beckoned, she applied to many top defense and aerospace firms. But Microsoft Corp. snagged her first. This summer, Balais, 20, will spend 13 weeks in Redmond, Wash., working in the tech giant’s manufacturing and supply chain department. Silicon Valley and other tech centers have always been popular landing places for young engineers, with their lure of cutting-edge technology and top-notch pay. But aerospace companies are facing an even stiffer challenge as Web and computer companies, and other sectors like the auto industry, move into areas like drones and autonomous systems. Aerospace employers are realizing they have to dig deeper to capture top tech talent. They are starting to reach out earlier to potential employees — as early as elementary school or even prekindergarten — to get them interested in science and math. And they’re recognizing the challenge they have in building awareness with people from a generation that never had a real space race, but grew up with Google, Snapchat and Apple as part of their daily lives. “This is something that’s very critical to our member companies,” said Dan Stohr, spokesman for the Aerospace Industries Association trade group. “They’re putting serious money into this, to the tune of millions of dollars a year.” Lockheed Martin Corp. has started a program called Generation Beyond to encourage middle school students to study deep space exploration. It includes a class curriculum, a Mars weather app and a traveling school bus modified so that children riding it can see the Martian landscape through the windows. “One of the things we’ve been seeing is that this generation of students doesn’t necessarily know (about) Lockheed Martin, as their parents did,” said Steve Hatch, the company’s director for central talent acquisition, of current college students. In early 2015, Northrop Grumman Corp. opened an innovation center called NG Next in Redondo Beach (Los Angeles County), where it is doubling down on basic research to find solutions to problems that may be years in the future. The organization takes a more aggressive approach to experimentation, which can be attractive to potential employees looking for a creative work environment. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 26,000 aerospace engineers were employed as of May 2015 in product and parts manufacturing, a category that covers about 70 percent of the aerospace and defense industry. Joining them were about 5,900 electrical engineers, about 14,000 mechanical engineers and 12,000 developers of systems software. In computer and electronic product manufacturing, there were about 5,700 aerospace engineers, 30,300 electrical engineers, 18,400 mechanical engineers and 48,600 software developers of systems software. Defense firms have long maintained a presence on college campuses, whether at career fairs, sponsoring student engineering competitions, serving on advisory boards or providing scholarships. “Students encounter Google and Amazon frequently on the Web,” said Jayathi Murthy, dean of UCLA’s Engineering School. “So in order for (defense companies) to be heard above that, they really need to engage with us on campus, and they do.” A meeting with a Northrop Grumman executive during a USC recruiting event piqued Justin Jameson’s interest in working at the company. It ended up being the only place he applied to after graduating from USC in 2009. Jameson, 29, has now worked at Northrop Grumman for more than seven years. “I looked at a lot of the big consulting companies as well, but at Northrop Grumman, they offered me the chance to come in and work on real problems,” he said. “At a consulting company, I would be solving someone else’s problems.” That aspect attracted Addison Salzman, 21, who will graduate from USC in May with a degree in aerospace engineering. Salzman, who is interested in higher-level aircraft design, has already landed a full-time job at Boeing Co. and will start in July. “One of the big reasons that I chose it is because they have their hands in not just defense, but they have a very large commercial airplanes business,” he said. “It gives me a cool opportunity to explore the different applications of aerospace technologies.” Timothy John, an aerospace engineering student at UCLA, has been interested in space exploration since elementary school and has sent out a number of job applications to defense companies. John, 25, said he’s looking for longevity and growth in potential employers, but also hopes to work on an airplane or spacecraft. “I’m pretty indiscriminate,” he said. “Any projects that include planes, like anything with a jet turbine, like a F-16 or F-22 or stealth bombers. Or even missiles.” Though Northrop Grumman’s NG Next was not established specifically for recruiting, it has become a useful tool in hiring, Hernandez said. New employees can be part of an environment of rapid development and experimentation not generally associated with large defense contractors. “For us to achieve the great things that we need to achieve to solve the nation’s toughest problems, we have to push hard,” Hernandez said. The organization’s four main components — basic research, applied technology, advanced design and rapid prototyping — employ about 800 full- or part-time people, though faculty from research universities can also collaborate with NG Next scientists. The organization was also designed to have a larger tolerance for risk than what might be assumed for a big government contractor. “We want to move fast and hard, cautiously and consciously, but it’s OK if we fail every now and then,” Hernandez said, voicing a credo that aerospace engineers say held for the space program long before it became popular in Silicon Valley. “If we don’t, we’re probably not pushing hard enough.” Samantha Masunaga is a Los Angeles Times writer.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Andy Rubin, one of the minds behind Android, is ready to burst back onto the scene with a lineup of smart devices, including a mobile device “that lacks a surrounding bezel.” According to Bloomberg, Rubin and his 40-person team are working on a suite of consumer hardware products, one of which will be a high-end smartphone to compete with the iPhone and Pixel. Rubin is said to have discussed the device with mobile carrier executives earlier this month, the report says. “It’s expected to include high-end materials and the ability to gain new features over time,” according to the Bloomberg report. One prototype reportedly being tested by Rubin’s company, dubbed Essential, sports a display in the 5.5-inch range, with a footprint that’s significantly smaller than Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus. Rubin was able to achieve this by cutting down on the bezels. The alleged phone also sports a pressure-sensitive screen and metal edges. The back is said to be made of ceramic, a material that’s difficult to manufacturer, people familiar with Essential’s plans said. “Essential’s engineers are developing a proprietary connector that serves double duty for charging the battery and expanding the phone’s functionality over time,” Bloomberg said. “The magnetic connector would allow Essential or even third parties to create hardware accessories that add features to the smartphone.” It’s sounds a lot like the Moto Z Rubin apparently has a lot of talent on his team, including former Google and Apple engineers. It’s unclear whether or not the device will run Android though the project is said to feature Rebecca Zavin, a former senior Google software manager. The device sounds a lot like a Moto Z, a device released toward the end of last year. Through the use of Mods, users could extend the abilities of the device—a key feature Rubin’s device will reportedly possess. Check out Bloomberg’s report for more information on Rubin’s mysterious project.

BlackRock managed to increase profits in the fourth quarter, though revenue barely grew. The firm was a prime beneficiary of a record year in exchange-traded funds. BlackRock attracted $140 billion to its iShares business last year, including $60 billion in fixed-income exchange-traded funds. Vanguard Group Inc., the second-biggest player in the exchange-traded funds business, gathered $93 billion. "In 2016, it is fair to say across all investor types there was a movement more toward passive strategies," Chief Executive Officer Laurence Fink said in an interview Friday after the earnings were released. "When I am able to increase margins and increase market share through price cuts I am going to do that. The key element is scale." BlackRock expanded its operating margin from a year earlier by keeping company costs down. The shares gained $1.06 to close Friday at $379.35. The company's fourth-quarter earnings of $5.14 a share exceeded estimates. Revenue rose 1 percent to $2.89 billion, falling short of analyst estimates of $2.93 billion. Lower performance fees and a stronger dollar contributed to the modest revenue growth. -- Bloomberg News Fireworks firm fined $200,000 for thefts NEW CASTLE, Pa. -- A Pennsylvania fireworks business used for many national events has been fined $200,000 by federal agents and ordered to close for two weeks after an employee stole fireworks. Family-owned Zambelli International Fireworks of New Castle blamed poor record-keeping on its failure to detect the theft. It has been ordered to improve its record-keeping. Zambelli said state police discovered the missing fireworks in 2014. Nobody has been charged. Zambelli was founded in 1893 and produces about 1,600 shows annually. Its fireworks have been used for presidential inaugurations, the National Mall Fourth of July celebration and state dinners. The company said none of its shows are scheduled during the two-week shutdown. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives won't comment because the investigation is continuing. -- The Associated Press Uber drivers in Russia quit over taxes MOSCOW -- Uber Technologies Inc. has asked its Russian drivers to temporarily bear the load of a new tax charge, causing some of them quit to avoid paperwork and tax filings. President Vladimir Putin signed a law in July to levy an 18 percent value-added tax on electronic goods and services provided by global Internet giants starting in 2017. Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Microsoft Corp. and Netflix Inc. are registered with Russia's tax service, according to newspaper Vedomosti. Uber has passed these duties on to its drivers, requiring them to pay the tax on the company's service fee. Uber will later reimburse them these payments, it said in an emailed response to questions. The company will refrain from raising prices for passengers, it added. The move has caused some drivers to quit Uber, said Stanislav Shvagerus, head of lobby group Taxi 2018. Losing drivers is bad news for Uber, which has struggled to catch Yandex.Taxi, the market leader. "Most drivers only pay a unified annual tax linked to turnover," Shvagerus said. "Why should they start paying [value-added taxes] and become tax agents for a multinational firm? This requires weekly paperwork and also makes them subject to tax audit." -- Bloomberg News Indian airline, Boeing reach $22B deal CHICAGO -- Boeing Co. won a $22 billion deal from budget carrier SpiceJet Ltd., notching the plane-maker's largest-ever order from an Indian airline and strengthening its hold in a market dominated by Europe's Airbus Group SE. The order includes 100 of Boeing's 737 Max single-aisle jets and renegotiated terms for 55 previously ordered aircraft, SpiceJet said in a statement Friday. The airline also has options to purchase another 50 Boeing aircraft, including the 777 and 787 Dreamliner wide-bodies. The commitment, which was included in Boeing's 2016 order tally, comes as the Chicago-based plane manufacturer races to catch Airbus in narrow-body sales, the largest source of profit for the companies. The deal for the Max, which competes with Airbus's A320neo workhorse, also helps Boeing widen its footprint in the fast-growing South Asian market. Most of SpiceJet's low-cost rivals fly the European company's aircraft. "India is an important market both Airbus and Boeing can't ignore," said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics. The SpiceJet order gives Boeing "a lifeline. There's a lot more to grow in India than other parts of Asia." -- Bloomberg News Developer calls for Gettysburg casino GETTYSBURG, Pa. -- A Pennsylvania businessman wants to build a harness racing track and casino near Gettysburg, the site of the 1863 battle that turned the tide of the American Civil War. David LeVan said Thursday he will apply for a harness racing license and a license to operate a casino with slots and table games. The proposed location on about 700 acres is just east of where U.S. 15 crosses the Maryland-Pennsylvania line. It's about 3 miles from the border of Gettysburg National Military Park. It's LeVan's third attempt to bring gambling to Gettysburg. He is a former Conrail Inc. chairman who owns a nearby Harley-Davidson motorcycle dealership. Previous proposals sharply divided the community, and opponents argued it was not appropriate for the historic region. -- The Associated Press Business on 01/14/2017 Print Headline: Business news in brief Tweet ADVERTISEMENT More Business Profits at 2 big banks climb in '16 Renault's market value dives after emissions ...

Maluuba was founded by Sam Pasupalak and Kaheer Suleman from University of Waterloo. The vision of the company is to advance towards a more general AI by building ‘literate machines’ that can think, reason and communicate like humans. “Maluuba’s expertise in deep learning and reinforcement learning for question-answering and decision-making systems will help us advance our strategy to democratize AI and to make it accessible and valuable to everyone — consumers, businesses and developers,” said Harry Shum, Executive Vice President, Microsoft Artificial Intelligence and Research Group in a blog post. Maluuba believes that human language is the holy grail in the field of AI, but is an extremely complex to understand. The aim of the startup is to conduct research in deep and reinforcement learning, and solving the problem of machine literacy through common sense reasoning, memory and communication. Back in 2012, Maluuba was able to secure $2 million in funding from Samsung Ventures. The company the received $9 million in funding from Emerllion Capital and Nautilus Ventures. “Microsoft is an excellent match for our company. Their ambitious vision of democratizing AI to empower every person and every organization on the planet fundamentally aligns with how we see our technology being used. Microsoft provides us the opportunity to deliver our work to the billions of consumer and enterprise users that can benefit from the advent of truly intelligent machines,” the co-founders of the company wrote in an online post. Read: Apple will hit $1 trillion in cumulative revenue generated by iOS ecosystem in 2017 Microsoft is eyeing a future where a user can communicate with an AI agent that will immediately respond to a request of searching through your organisations directory, emails or documents for something – eliminating the need to waste valuable time trying to rummage through the data himself. “The agent would be able to answer your question in a company security-compliant manner by having a deeper understanding of the contents of your organization’s documents and emails, instead of simply retrieving a document by keyword matching, which happens today,” Shum further explains. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: microsoft Best of Express Meghalaya sex scam: Guest-house run by Home Minister’s son under probe EntertainmentOk Jaanu box office collection day 3: Aditya Roy Kapur, Shraddha Kapoor film struggles to hold ground EntertainmentxXx Return of Xander Cage box office collection day 2: Deepika Padukone-Vin Diesel film expected to earn well EntertainmentKoffee With Karan: Kareena Kapoor Khan, Sonam Kapoor turn Karan Johar's show into a mini kitty party EntertainmentHappy Birthday Sidharth Malhotra: As Sidharth Malhotra turns 32, here are facts about him we bet you didn't know.

Launches Reviews Cars Motorcycles Scooters EV Commercial Maruti Suzuki Ignis Launched in India at Rs. 4.59 Lacs! by Mayank Dhingraon January 14, 2017No Comments Country’s leading carmaker, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. today launched its latest premium hatchback in the country, the Maruti Suzuki Ignis. The car which plays in the B segment space of the market, has been introduced at a price of Rs. 4.59 lacs ex-showroom, Delhi and goes all the way to Rs. 7.80 lacs ex-showroom, Delhi. The Ignis has been launched in a total of 11 variants, across both petrol and diesel engine options and then there is the option of an Auto Gear Shift (AGS), which is Maruti’s branding for an AMT gearbox. The complete price range for the car is depicted below – The Ignis sports a crossover design, but will essentially play in the B+ hatchback segment. The car has a tall-boy stance and has styling elements, like flared wheel arches, a steeply raked rear portion and a healthy amount of ground clearance. It also gets projector headlamps with integrated LED DRLs on the top of the line Alpha variant. The front face also sports a mean looking grille and a heavy looking front bumper. The Maruti Suzuki Ignis has been introduced in 4 trims, namely Sigma, Delta, Zeta and Alpha. While the base Sigma trim is devoid of a lot of creature comforts, being a premium positioning for the product, Maruti has brought in dual airbags, ABS and ISOFIX child seat anchors as standard safety kit across all variants. While the Delta and Zeta variants will only feature a 2-DIN music system, the top-of-the-line Alpha trim will come with Maruti’s SmartLink touch screen infotainment system, which will also offer Android Auto and Apple Carplay connectivity options. All three variants, except the base Sigma will however get the steering mounted audio and Bluetooth Both Zeta and Alpha variants come equipped with 15-inch alloy wheels, while the spare wheel across all the variants will be a standard steel rim. The Maruti Suzuki Ignis comes with a wide range of color choices as option, with a total of 6 standard paint shades, along with three custom shades, which offer dual-tone body and roof contrast paint treatment choices. The Ignis will come with the regular engine options of a 1.2-litre petrol and a 1.3-litre diesel engines, which are already on offer on company’s other hatchbacks as well. There will be a 5-speed manual, as well as the option of an AMT gearbox on the Delta and Zeta variants of both petrol and diesel versions of the car. The car, along with the Baleno and the S-Cross, will be the third offering of the company to be sold through its premium NEXA chain of outlets. The company has already sold around 1 lac units of the Baleno hatchbacks through these outlets and is consistently increasing the number of these showrooms.

Matthew V. LibassiFox News Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend IT DOESN’T text. You can’t check your email. And no, it definitely doesn’t have Super Mario Run. The Light Phone is just that, a phone. Designed to rejuvenate those “aha” moments, the Light phone frees up your daily burden of buzzes, rings and alerts while still keeping in touch. “You use this as little as possible! It’s a piece of mind, we call it, going light,” Joe Hollier, co-founder of Light tells FOXBusiness.com You keep your same phone number and the Light Phone is available internationally. For those in the United States you would need to sign up for an additional $7 ($US5) a month plan. By forwarding your numbers via their cloud server, Light phone is meant to be used as a second phone. The $200 ($US150) (white or black “Night” version) phone would allow you to leave your smartphone at home for that coffee run or dinner with the wife. The Anti-Smartphone0:36 Designed to rejuvenate those ?aha? moments, the Light phone frees up your daily burden of buzzes, rings and alerts while still keeping in touch. CREDIT: FOX Business January 14th 2017 2 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ “We all have different clothes, different shoes for different situations. Why does it make sense to have one giant phone everywhere you go?” said Kaiwei Tang, co-founder of Light Phone. This idea led the team to raise over $547,000 ($US410,000) via a grassroots Kickstarter campaign. That opened the doors for angel investors who pumped in over $4.4 million ($US3.3 million) into the phone’s development. Based out of the innovative New Lab in Brooklyn, New York, Mr Tang and Mr Hollier are still shocked about its global appeal. “We sold 4000 phones but we saw this conversation snowballing in so many other ways, which is incredibly powerful to us,” Mr Hollier said. Foxconn in China, the same company that manufactures Apple products, invested in the phone and is also the manufacturer. From the start, Mr Tang and Mr Hollier wanted to make it a priority to show the human side to the technology world. “The whole process from material to assembly to packaging to getting the phone here is all human. It has thousands of humans involved if you really think about it. It’s mind boggling how huge this supply chain is,” Mr Tang said.

My Godfather, Richard Nicastro, was Chief of Detectives for the City of New York in 1986 when Steven was shot in Central Park. When my Godfather passed away in March, 2014, Steven came to the funeral mass. Steven’s capacity for forgiveness was extraordinary. God bless you, Steven.” — Kathleen Masterson. “Any of us who grew up in the '80's, and especially those of us from the Big Apple or the NYC area, know of Steven McDonald. He was a true American hero. Not because of what he did before he was shot, but because of the way he lived his life after becoming paralyzed. A devout Catholic, sainthood is not out of the question for this icon. RIP, Officer McDonald.” — Jim Cull. Mighty had no play on Friday and likes the Seahawks on Saturday. The deficit is 235 sirignanos.

The Dutch beauty took to Instagram on Friday to share a flashback shot of her three children, Gigi, 21, Bella, 20, and Anwar Hadid, 17, all of whom grew up to be professional models. 'Your siblings are worth a thousand friends......... #Family #Loyalty #AlwaysAndForever,' the former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills personality wrote as a caption to the image. Scroll down for video  Three-of-a-kind: Proud mom Yolanda Hadid, 53, shared a shot of her kids Gigi, Bella and Anwar from around 1999 on Instagram Friday Perhaps Yolanda felt the urge to show some love for her kids after a particularly difficult week for Bella (right) when the model found out her ex The Weeknd is now dating her friend Selena Gomez  Perhaps Yolanda felt the urge to show some love for her kids after a particularly difficult week for Bella. The Victoria's Secret beauty found out that her pal Selena Gomez has sparked a romance with her ex-boyfriend The Weeknd. Bella split up with the musician in November and he was spotted out looking very affectionate with the Same Old Love singer on Tuesday night.  Young Hollywood: Already very famous, Gigi (left) and Bella (right) have walked runways around the world, while Anwar seems to keep a lower profile than his sisters Foster had all three kids during her six-year marriage to ex-husband, real estate mogul Mohamed Hadid, from 1994 until 2000: Gigi was born April 23, 1995; Bella on October 9, 1996; and Anwar (who's a baby in the shot) on June 22, 1999. Yolanda, who turned 53 Wednesday, certainly felt the love as all three of her children made sure to publicly wish their mom a happy birthday. Gigi called Yolanda 'the most compassionate, supportive, loving, intelligent, creative SUPERmom in the world,' adding, 'I am so lucky to have someone like you to look up to ... thank you for everything ... I love you so much! Happy Birthday!!!' Fighter: Yolanda, seen here in NYC last month, has led a tireless campaign bringing awareness to Lyme Disease, which she's been personally battling for years  Angel face: Gigi is one of the world's most sought-after gorgeous faces, coming off a win for International Model of the Year in London last month. She was snapped in the Big Apple last month The lady in red: Bella, seen here earlier this month in LA, must have been shocked after her ex, The Weeknd, recently linked up with songstress Selena Gomez  She posted the kind message with a retro shot, as did Anwar and Bella, who called Yolanda 'our beautiful angel, my best friend and mother,' adding, 'Nobody loves you more than me.' A man of few words, Anwar wrote, 'Happy birthday mom,' adding an emoji of a heart. Following her marriage to Hadid, Yolanda was wed to David Foster from November 2011 until December 2015; the famed music composer was snapped with another stunning blonde model, Christie Brinkley, in New York City last month. Yolanda, who's been candid about her bout with Lyme Disease over the past few years, should likely hit the promotional trail in a few months to plug a book she has coming out this spring titled Believe Me: My Battle With The Invisible Disability Of Lyme Disease. Warmth: Gigi posted this shot to Instagram to celebrate her mom's birthday on Wednesday Appreciative: Bella posted a shot of herself, her mother and sister Gigi from years back Too cute: Anwar has since outgrown his light hair, but clearly will never lose the deep love he has for his mom Share or comment on this article e-mail 388 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany She's falling for him?

But it is not for IT or security professionals. Instead, it teaches regular Mac users how to keep their Mac and online accounts safe from the many dangers and threats on the Internet. The Practical Guide to Mac Security consists of 24 lessons that will enable the typical home and office Mac user to secure their Mac from dangers like malware, online account break-ins, data loss, and online scams. The course includes a free e-book of the same name with even more information and details. This course is meant for casual Mac users who use their Macs at home or in the office. The lessons will allow them to secure their own Mac without needing to understand complicated computer techniques. It is an everyday guide for everyday Mac users. MacMost also has a number of other courses including ones on the Mac apps Pages, Numbers and Keynote. Gary Rosenzweig, the producer and host of MacMost's tutorials said he wants this course to be free. "I think that it is very important that every Mac user know the basics of how to keep their Macs secure and stay safe online," he said. "I didn't want anyone to have an excuse not to learn about Mac security and Internet safety." There are four main sections to the course. The first covers online threats and how important it is to have strong passwords and use two-factor authentication. The second section discusses malware and how to protect your Mac with Apple's built-in security. The third section deals with common online scams like phishing attacks. The final section talks about the importance of backups. "Most of the information in the course is useful to anyone, even if they are using tablets or Windows PCs," said Rosenzweig. Advice in the course on strong passwords, for instance, could be used by anyone. However, the examples explain how Apple's iCloud Keychain can be used on Macs to generate passwords. The Practical Guide to Mac Security is available on Udemy.com, the online course website. You can read more about the course at the MacMost website.

By Hyacinth Mascarenhas January 14, 2017 04:32 GMT Close Edward Snowden and his supporters make case for pardon Reuters More than 1 million people from around the world have signed a petition urging President Barack Obama to pardon whistleblower Edward Snowden before he leaves office on 20 January. Proponents of the Pardon Snowden campaign, which include Amnesty International, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Human Rights Watch among other human rights groups, said the petition was delivered to the White House on Friday, arguing that Snowden's actions "set in motion the most important debate about government surveillance in decades." "People from all over the world have come together to show their support for Edward Snowden and thank him for the public service he performed in standing up for their human rights," Salil Shetty, Amnesty International's Secretary General, said in a statement. "Edward Snowden is a hero, not a traitor, and that he remains in limbo years after sparking such an important global debate about surveillance and privacy is a gross injustice. He deserves better than a life in exile. "By pardoning Snowden, President Obama would place himself on the right side of history, and demonstrate that he stands with those who fight for what is right, even at great personal cost," Shetty said. In 2013, the former NSA contractor leaked a trove of classified files to reporters, revealing the scale of mass surveillance programmes in the US and the UK. Since then, Snowden has been residing in Moscow to avoid extradition to the United States where he faces charges under the 1917 Espionage Act that could land him in prison for up to 30 years, if convicted. The massive leaks also sparked an important public debate on government surveillance, privacy, data protection and human rights and led to legislative reform.

Some notable signatories who have thrown their support behind the campaign include Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Open Society Foundations founder and chair George Soros, Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg and actors Mark Ruffalo, Maggie Gyllenhaal among others. "When the internet first came along, we thought it was going to be a beacon of freedom, sharing and learning," Wozniak said. "Edward Snowden showed us that the internet was actually being used by governments and companies to monitor us and invade our privacy. "He gave up his whole life to stand up against secret spying and for the Constitution. That's why he's a hero, and it's why he deserves a pardon." In November, former staff members of the Church committee, a Watergate-era intelligence watchdog group, also called on Obama to extend leniency to Snowden, arguing that although Snowden's disclosures were illegal, they did spur positive reform. They also noted earlier cases of leniency shown by Obama's and previous administrations towards others that violated the same law. Ben Wizner, an ACLU attorney working on behalf of Snowden said "taking action while it's still possible would send a powerful signal to the world, in troubled times, that many Americans are still committed to human rights and democratic principles." However, President Obama has suggested earlier that he would not likely grant Snowden clemency saying he "can't pardon somebody who hasn't gone before a court." In December, the president granted clemency to 231 people - the most in a single day by any US president in history. He has commuted the sentences of 1,176 individuals, including 395 life sentences, and granted pardons to 78 people. Earlier this week, Snowden called on Obama to pardon fellow whistleblower Chelsea Manning over himself saying "you alone can save her." Manning is currently serving a 35-year-sentence for leaking classified military documents and sensitive information to WikiLeaks. One day later, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said he would accept extradition to the US if Obama grants Manning clemency "despite clear unconstitutionality of DoJ case." More Technology news: Julian Assange offers himself up in exchange for whistleblower Chelsea Manning's pardon Pressure on President Obama for controversial pardons ahead of Trump inauguration Edward Snowden still in contact with Russian intelligence, Congressional report claims The world's top human rights groups just delivered over one million signatures to Obama.

A Virtual Reality One PC Makers Need a Reality Check. A Virtual Reality One Jan 13, 2017 Tim Culpan | Bloomberg EMAIL Tweet Comments 1 Bloomberg Advertisement (Bloomberg Gadfly) -- Global PC shipments fell 5.7 percent last year because ... well, you know why: Fewer people want to buy a PC. It really is as simple as that. Analysts can slice and dice the numbers to try to explain every twist and turn in the industry's demise, but Occam's Razor applies. In its press release outlining the latest data, IDC clearly subscribed to the "flat is the new up" theory on market growth by noting that fourth-quarter unit sales fell only 1.5 percent. According to the research provider, the results "continued the recent trend of stabilizing growth." Something needs to be done. Consolidation among players isn't enough -- they tried that and it didn't stop the inexorable price declines that have always been a part of the electronics hardware business. So now it's time for something new. Like, say, producing a product people actually want to buy. Think about the last PC you logged in on. Now compare it to the PC you logged on to 15 years ago. See the difference? Nah, didn't think so. Not since Jony Ive decided that Bondi Blue was a good color for a computer have we seen any real innovation in PC design. The technology inside has barely changed either, merely evolving with faster and more powerful systems, which is thanks to the semiconductor industry, not the PC one. What PC companies need to do now is take the product they make -- little boxes of computing power -- and turn them toward practical applications consumers actually want. Virtual reality is the obvious one. VR is resource heavy and time sensitive, requiring both speed and power. But to date, the major VR players are producing headsets and relying on PC makers to fill that computing void. The exceptions here are Sony Corp., which has leveraged its headset-PlayStation combo to lead the market, and Acer Inc., which is focusing on commercial buyers. PC makers either need to do VR themselves, or buy an existing player. VR isn't the only arena. Home servers are another segment screaming out for a good supplier. This would essentially be a personal cloud server, storing photos and files, streaming content and acting as the hub for a coming wave of automated services. Instead of relying on the likes of Apple Inc. and Google Inc., a home solution would hand control back to consumers and make PC companies relevant again.  Acer has been trying to kick-start the idea with its Build Your Own Cloud initiative but has failed to gain traction. That shouldn't stop others from trying: A few firms took a crack at smartphones and tablets before Apple showed them how it's done. When analysts describe a declining market in positive terms, you know things are bad. And for PC makers, desperate times call for desperate measures. Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 1 CSMR on Jan 13, 2017 "Think about the last PC you logged in on. Now compare it to the PC you logged on to 15 years ago. See the difference? Nah, didn't think so." My computer occupies 60x less volume than the one I had 15years ago. It also has gone from single core to 8 virtual cores, 30x as much RAM, an SSD which is completely new as well as an HDD. which is 100x as large. 15years ago hardly any monitors were LCDs. So I think I have seen tremendous improvements in desktop technology and design. However I don't upgrade as often as I used to, and I don't spend as much as I used to. Everything is so instant that I would hardly notice a 2x speed increase, despite using heavy software. Why are people writing so many web apps? Because people don't notice a 10x decrease in performance. The PC's importance is undiminished, and the situation for PC buyers is great. (Though agreed that there is not much we can do with the huge processing power we are offered.) For PC makers though, it looks grim.

The Food Network star and owner of Mesa Grill, Bar Americain and Bobby’s Burger Palaces is pitching the private equity community for funds to expand his 8-year-old, 19-location burger chain. Owned 100 percent by Flay and his business partner, Laurence Kretchmer, the burger chain is being groomed for a minority partner, Flay told a group of investors and analysts at the ICR conference in Orlando, Fla., this week. Over the past year, the celebrity chef has been tweaking the menu and marketing to make it clear to diners that he is the culinary talent behind the operation. “Fifty percent of the people who come into our stores don’t know Bobby is me,” Flay told Philly.com earlier this year, conceding that he had halted the chain’s expansion while he revamped the menu and branding. There was no cross-marketing of his star power, and he is trying to fix that, he told potential investors this week. Flay, 53, who has parlayed his good looks and culinary talent into a successful TV career, has the chops to give his burger joint more sizzle. The native New Yorker opened his first restaurant, Mesa Grill, in the Big Apple in 1991. The question, say industry experts, is whether the timing is right for a big push into the saturated burger sector. “The better burger has so much competition,” said John Gordon, principal of Pacific Management Consulting Group. “Shake Shack continues to grow and is competing for the best sites.” At the same time, some burger franchises, including Five Guys and Smashburger, have had to retreat from aggressive expansion moves. Flay declined comment.

My Godfather, Richard Nicastro, was Chief of Detectives for the City of New York in 1986 when Steven was shot in Central Park. When my Godfather passed away in March, 2014, Steven came to the funeral mass. Steven’s capacity for forgiveness was extraordinary. God bless you, Steven.” — Kathleen Masterson. “Any of us who grew up in the '80's, and especially those of us from the Big Apple or the NYC area, know of Steven McDonald. He was a true American hero. Not because of what he did before he was shot, but because of the way he lived his life after becoming paralyzed. A devout Catholic, sainthood is not out of the question for this icon. RIP, Officer McDonald.” — Jim Cull. Mighty had no play on Friday and likes the Seahawks on Saturday. The deficit is 235 sirignanos.

But that was five years ago. It's only with Chrome 56, the browser's next major revision, that FLAC will be playable natively. The original "bug", filed on August 23, 2011, can be found on the Chromium issue tracker. Over the years, it received the odd bit of attention, but nothing of real substance. This however, didn't stop ChromeOS and Android getting support, not to mention Apple's mobile and desktop operating systems. Finally, late last year, the issue was subjected to a flurry of activity, culminating in its official implementation. And, once Chrome 56 hits — which should be the end of this month, if the schedule sticks — everyone will be able to enjoy native FLAC support. My question is: Does the guy who filed the request still uses Chrome? [Chromium, via 9to5Google] Comments brettanthony @brettanthony Jan 14, 2017, 5:24pm Does the guy who filed the request still uses Chrome?

Sweden's top diplomat wants to know Syrian selfie refugee sues Facebook for 'defamatory' posts Bangladeshi law proposes child marriage in "special cases" Mexican sex nightmare traps women fleeing for U.S. dream Kenya prepares to expand solar mini-grids into poorest rural areas PARIS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Francois Fillon, the conservative politician seen by opinion polls as most likely to win the French presidential election this year, says France should sell state stakes in firms deemed as not having a strategic importance for the country. "The state should only be a shareholder in strategic companies," Fillon said in an interview with French magazine Capital. He declined in the published interview to name any individual companies to which this might apply. He also told Capital that France "must not show any signs of weakness" in terms of ensuring French technology companies could challenge bigger international rivals such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. Fillon's interview echoed similar comments last month, when he said he was favourable towards privatisations of state shareholdings in order to raise cash for investments in major infrastructure projects. Fillon, a former Prime Minister, said in December France should sell out of "unnecessary investments" in private-sector companies, citing carmaker Renault as an example. The French government holds just under 20 percent of Renault and has significant stakes in several other large companies including Air France, Airbus, Peugeot , Orange and Engie.

The company designs and manufactures vacuum cleaners, hand dryers, bladeless fans, and heaters. It sells machines in over 70 countries and employs 7,000 people worldwide. Dyson founder and chief engineer Sir James Dyson, who was part of British Prime Minister Theresa May’s business delegation last year, had said that the company needed the right products suitable for the Indian market before it invests here. Dyson had declared that it would invest 150 million British pounds (Rs 124.32 crore) in the next 3-5 years to set up stores and open a retail network in India. The other players in the consumer electronics market in India are Eureka Forbes, LG, Panasonic, Philips, Sharp, Blueair, Kent, Honeywell. Shapoorji Pallonji Group’s Eureka Forbes is the biggest domestic manufacturing company. Coimbatore has the largest number of vacuum cleaner manufacturers such as Cleantek, Dynavac India and Altomech, which will be facing stiff competition with the arrival of Dyson in India. The company also wants a  relaxation in the mandatory sourcing norms, recently sought by Apple Inc, because of its state-of-the-art products. Under current foreign direct investment policy, companies making state-of-the-art technology items are exempted from the mandatory local sourcing norms in the single-brand retail sector for up to three years. After this, companies would be given five years to comply with the mandatory 30 per cent domestic sourcing norms. Dyson has filed 7,500 patents for its technology worldwide. It invests 5 million British Pounds each week with over 40 universities to develop early stage technologies.

We're seeing innovation being stepped up in just about every part of the IT industry--enterprise and consumer alike. Applications, chips, servers, storage, networks, connected devices and security (although we're still a long way from solving most of the biggest problems) have seen major improvements. Even batteries, which were innovation-agnostic for decades, are being improved on a regular basis. However, one product type that really hasn't seen a lot of innovation is in hearware. Sure, we're now seeing more fancy shaped and colored earbuds to go with high-end Bose, Beats (Apple) and Bang & Olufsen (HP) audio headsets. Apple EarPods, though trendy, are merely another version of of high-end wireless earbud. Enables Multiple Sound Controls But while these all represent incremental improvements on a conventional approach, there is now a fundamental change in functionality of these items now coming into the market. A new audio product, Lucid's Amped Bluetooth Neck-band, enables the user to control not only the music or phone conversation coming into the headset but also all ambient sounds in the immediate environment. This granular, multi-level control of sound has been unheard of until now. [To see a larger view of the photo at upper left, right-click on the image and select "View Image.] There are two volume controls on the unit, so the user can adjust either up and down as needed.   The Lucid Neck-band is unusual in that it offers the ability to adjust and customize everything a user hears: You can hear music yet also hear sounds of nature, a friend talking or sirens coming down the street while riding your bike or running. On the other hand, a user can completely block out all ambient noise just about as well as the most expensive regular headsets available. I own an excellent Bose headset, but I personally was amazed at how effective the Lucid unit was in delivering nothing but quiet jazz and classical music while sitting near a highly trafficked street during rush hour.   Lucid Neck-band also is an efficient way to conduct hands-free voice conversations. It connects via Bluetooth to virtually all smartphones, thus its hands-free functionality is useful while driving, running or riding a bike. Because it is worn around the neck, the device doesn't interfere with anything worn atop your head. Two Versions Now Available There are two versions of the Lucid device now available. The second one comes with a separate Wireless Audio Streaming unit, which can turn a television or other device into a Bluetooth-enabled audio machine for targeted plug-and-play usage. This can be explained in a personal use case: While testing two of the Lucid devices, we gave the one with the Wireless Audio Streaming unit to my hard-of-hearing mother-in-law, who's 91 and always requires the family room television to be at a high volume for her to hear anything. Using her Neck-band with its Bluetooth connection to the TV, she was able to turn up her own personal volume and hear everything on the TV very clearly while the volume was at a normal level; the rest of us didn't have to plug our ears anymore for having the volume cranked up too loudly. This feature alone might be worth the price of a unit for many families. Thus the Lucid Neck-band can serve as a functional hearing aid in some cases and bring peace to a family television viewing session.   Key Product Facts and Features   --Retractable ear buds --Low-latency Bluetooth connectivity --NRR (Noise Reduction Rating) 24 dB --Sound-activated compression: Utilizing a sound-activated compression circuit, the Amped Bluetooth Neckband instantly shuts down loud harmful noises from gun shots, concerts, and construction work while also amplifying regular conversational sounds up to 9 times the amplification. --Powered by rechargeable battery for 10 hours of normal use --Hi Gain omni-directional microphones for clear sound enhancement on both the left and right sides: The high gain omni-directional microphones provide clear sound enhancement for enjoyable conversations on your phone or with someone while running or working out. --HD speakers/drivers in the ear buds for wide range audio quality --Multiple earbud tip styles/sizes included --AC wall adapter and USB charging cable included --Available in black rubberized and white/gray color options --Price: $129; $179 for device that includes the additional Wireless Audio Streamer unit.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google and Facebook gave more to Republicans than to Democrats: reports By Ethan Baron / January 13, 2017 at 4:23 PM In famously liberal Silicon Valley, two of the region’s biggest tech giants have switched teams to Republicans over Democrats while their workers remain largely on the left. In 2016, a year of fabulously polarizing American politics, the political action committees for Google and Facebook gave more money to the red team than to the blue for Congressional races. Of the $1.5 million from Google’s parent firm Alphabet, 56 percent went to Republican candidates and 44 percent to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That breaks down for House races as $625,000 for Republicans and $512,000 for Democrats, and for Senate races as $190,000 for Republicans and $137,000 for Democrats. Donations ranged from $1,000 to $10,000. Among those receiving $10,000 were southern California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa, who, according to CNBC on Jan. 11, has taken a position “firmly on the side of Silicon Valley” in the dispute between this region’s tech industry and federal authorities over encryption in consumer technology. Bay Area Democrat Kamala Harris, who won her Senate race, also received $10,000 from Alphabet’s PAC, called the “Google, Inc. NETPAC.” Facebook PAC gave a total of $517,000, with the same party breakdown as Google’s PAC: 56 percent to Republicans and 44 percent to Democrats. For the House, Republicans received $147,000 from the “Facebook, Inc. PAC,” while Democrats got $140,000. For the Senate, Republicans received $141,000 while Democrats got $91,000. Neither the campaign of Harris or her rival and fellow Democrat Loretta Sanchez received donations from Facebook’s PAC. Issa received $5,000. Democratic San Jose/Santa Clara Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren received $10,000. Apple, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, did not make donations through a PAC. The right turn by Google and Facebook suggests the firms see Republicans as stronger allies than Democrats, the New York Times reported. “As these technology firms have become corporate behemoths, their concerns over government regulatory policy have intensified — on issues including privacy, taxation, automation and antitrust,” according to the newspaper. But while the corporations are leaning rightward, those working in them remain generally leftist, the Times said. “Most tech executives and employees remain supportive of Democrats, especially on social and cultural issues,” according to the paper. “The Republican tilt of the PACs at … Google and Facebook suggests, however, that as these companies’ domains grow larger, their bottom-line interests are becoming increasingly aligned with the policies of the Republican Party.” Amazon and Microsoft have also swung to the right at a corporate level, the Times reported. “Microsoft has led the rightward charge,” the paper reported. “In 2008, the Microsoft PAC decisively favored Democrats, 60-40, according to … (the) Center for Responsive Politics. “By 2012, Republican candidates and committees had taken the lead, 54-46; and by 2016, the Microsoft PAC had become decisively Republican, 65-35.”   Photo: A man walks past a building on the Google campus in Mountain View.

SAN FRANCISCO: Microsoft announced Friday a deal to buy Maluuba, a Montreal startup focused on making machines able to think the way people do. Bringing on board Maluuba co-founders Kaheer Suleman and Sam Pasupalak, along with their team from the startup, was intended to accelerate Microsoft’s “ability to develop software so computers can read, write and converse naturally,” the company said. Microsoft did not disclose financial terms of the acquisition. “Maluuba’s vision is to advance toward a more general artificial intelligence by creating literate machines that can think, reason and communicate like humans — a vision exactly in line with ours,” Microsoft artificial intelligence and research group executive vice president Harry Shum said in a blog post. “I’m incredibly excited about the scenarios that this acquisition could make possible in conversational AI.” Tech giants Apple, Samsung, Google and Microsoft are all vying to develop the most sophisticated connected assistant — working to give software the ability to understand what people say and even anticipate desires or needs. Amazon virtual assistant Alexa was a star at the Consumer Electronics Show gadget gala last week in Las Vegas. Amazon and Alexa face fierce competition. At CES, computer chipmaker Nvidia said it would use Google Assistant for its interactive streaming devices. Microsoft’s Cortana will power a voice-assistant speaker for kids and families being introduced by Mattel, and will also be in Renault-Nissan’s connected car hub. Samsung’s smart refrigerator, which acts as a connected hub — with a voice activation system unveiled at CES — uses the South Korean giant’s Tizen operating system. Many smart devices for the home also integrate with Apple Home Kit, which uses the iPhone maker’s artificial intelligence and voice assistant Siri. At CES, Chinese giant Baidu showcased its own virtual assistant “Little Fish” which will debut in China this year.

PARIS — Reuters Published Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 6:58PM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 6:58PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Francois Fillon, the conservative politician seen by opinion polls as most likely to win the French presidential election this year, says France should sell state stakes in firms deemed as not having a strategic importance for the country. "The state should only be a shareholder in strategic companies," Fillon said in an interview with French magazine Capital. He declined in the published interview to name any individual companies to which this might apply. He also told Capital that France "must not show any signs of weakness" in terms of ensuring French technology companies could challenge bigger international rivals such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. Fillon's interview echoed similar comments last month, when he said he was favorable toward privatizations of state shareholdings in order to raise cash for investments in major infrastructure projects. Fillon, a former Prime Minister, said in December France should sell out of "unnecessary investments" in private-sector companies, citing carmaker Renault as an example. The French government holds just under 20 percent of Renault and has significant stakes in several other large companies including Air France, Airbus, Peugeot, Orange and Engie.

"The state should only be a shareholder in strategic companies," Fillon said in an interview with French magazine Capital. He declined in the published interview to name any individual companies to which this might apply. He also told Capital that France "must not show any signs of weakness" in terms of ensuring French technology companies could challenge bigger international rivals such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. Fillon's interview echoed similar comments last month, when he said he was favourable towards privatisations of state shareholdings in order to raise cash for investments in major infrastructure projects. Fillon, a former Prime Minister, said in December France should sell out of "unnecessary investments" in private-sector companies, citing carmaker Renault as an example.

According to Le Parisian, a source within the investigation told the French newspaper that the fire in the cockpit of the Airbus A320 may have started where the co-pilot stowed his iPad and iPhone 6S. EgyptAir flight MS804 was travelling from Paris to Cairo when it disappeared from radar on 19 May 2016. Egyptian investigators have speculated that the crash, which killed all 56 passengers, seven crew members and three security personnel on board, was caused by an act of terrorism due to traces of explosives reported to be found on some the victims. Investigators in France have disputed these claims, saying that data recorded from the aircraft around the time it disappeared points to an accidental fire on the right-hand side of the flight deck, next to the co-pilot. According to The Times, CCTV pulled from cameras at Paris’ Charles de Gualle airport show that the co-pilot stored a number of personal items above the dashboard, where the first signs of trouble were detected. This included an automated alert indicating a series of malfunctions on the right-hand flight deck window, followed by smoke alerts going off in a toilet and in the avionics area below the cockpit, minutes before the plane vanished. The co-pilot of missing EgyptAir flight MS804 Mohamed Mamdouh Ahmed AssemFacebook ‘A troubling parallel’ A source from the investigation told Le Parisian that they were investigating links between where the co-pilot placed his items and the spot where the fire started. “The images show very clearly that the Egyptian co-pilot placed his telephone, tablet and bottles of perfume bought before boarding on the glare-shield,” the newspaper said. “The investigators thus note a troubling parallel between the placing of these items that are fed by lithium batteries and the triggering of alarms during the flight.” It is understood that the information provided by the Le Parisian source has not been independently verified. While investigators may have at one point probed whether an overheating mobile device started the fire, this line of inquiry has not been advanced. An Apple spokesperson said: “We haven’t been contacted by GTA or any authority investigating this tragic event. We have not seen the report but we understand there is no evidence to link this event to Apple products. If investigators have questions for us, we would of course assist in any way we can. We rigorously test our products to ensure they meet or exceed international safety standards.” Smartphones containing lithium-ion batteries have been known to explode when exposed to excessive heat or pressure. Samsung was forced to recall its Galaxy Note 7 last year due to widespread reports of the handset catching fire, caused by stressed batteries. This led to a number of airlines banning the phone from flights.

A guide to the best TV streaming services. A comparison of the top video streaming providers: Netflix, Hulu Plus, HBO Go, Amazon Prime Video and more. By Emily Bary October 17, 2016 Text Size Regular Medium Large Illustration: Photo: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News There are so many fantastic alternatives to cable these days that if you signed up for all them … you’d be paying far more than you do for cable. Since that kind of destroys the point of cord cutting, Barron’s Next did the hard work of sitting through 100 hours of shows to figure out which streaming platforms are worth the price. Short answer: Go with Netflix and Hulu, and skip Amazon Prime Video and CBS All Access. Throw in HBO Go if you really need your fix of premium. More than 200,000 Americans are ditching cable every month, and it’s getting easier and easier to join them. Here’s a quick rundown of the streaming alternatives: With the largest TV library of the bunch (3,588 titles as of earlier this year, by Barclays’ count) Netflix is worth the $10 a month. Its original shows are a step above the rest. You don’t want to miss Stranger Things, a sci-fi thriller, or the upcoming revival of Gilmore Girls, packed with much of the original cast plus fancy guest stars. Netflix is weak on the “flix,” but its deep bank of past TV series and seasons make it necessary for a binge-watcher. Best Shows: House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt Watch the trailer for Netflix original series Stranger Things Hulu gets you the closest to the cable experience without a set-top box. You’ll get access to new episodes of ABC, NBC, Fox, and other shows the day after they air, as well as a selection of past episodes that’s smaller than what Netflix offers. It’s inconvenient to wait for months after a season ends before being able to watch a show, so the next-day option keeps you in the conversation. Hulu’s original programming is nothing special, though it did revive The Mindy Project. Hulu will run you $8 a month; for an extra $4 a month you’ll get the ad-free version. Best Shows: Difficult People, The Bachelorette, Community Take a pass on Amazon Prime Video. It comes essentially free with a $99-a-year Prime membership, which is good because there’s no reason to pay for this service outright. With some 2,000 shows, the company lags behind Netflix, but has far and away the largest movie collection, including new hits, such as Ex Machina, and classics like An Affair to Remember and Sophie’s Choice. If you were already going to get Prime for the shipping perks, the video library is a nice bonus, but don’t subscribe just for the streaming content. More Barron’s Next Technology Stories Apple Accessories: When to Save, When to Splurge Why Samsung, Not Apple, Could Really Change Cars 6 Tips to Save Your Holiday Deliveries Best Shows: The Americans, Transparent, The Man in the High Castle Skip CBS All Access. The network went its own way on streaming, opting to charge $6/month for live CBS streaming in many regions, as well as a library of past and just-aired CBS shows. Many of the old shows are available through other services, and while the live stream aspect is nice, it isn’t quite “all access,” since CBS’s NFL games aren’t included. The company hopes to work out a deal for those soon. Best Shows: Big Bang Theory, Criminal Minds, Elementary With Hulu and Netflix you’ll get much of what you need, but some of the hottest shows are on premium channels such as HBO and Showtime, which don’t make all of their content available on the major streaming sites. Showtime costs $11/month to stream on Apple TV or Roku devices, or $9/month if you tack it on to an existing Hulu or Amazon subscription. But Homeland is way past its prime, and new shows like Billions aren’t worth the price. HBO Go, at $15 a month, has better shows, including Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley, and Veep. If you plan to watch a bunch of them, this is the premium service to get. Follow Barron’s Next on Facebook.

(Reuters/Toru Hanai) Share Written by Mike Murphy January 13, 2017 Michael Lynton, the CEO of Sony Entertainment, Sony Pictures, and Sony America—the company has a rather complicated organizational structure—announced today that he will be stepping down from his positions to become chairman of Snap, the holding company behind Snapchat. According to a release from Sony, Lynton will step down this month to ensure a smooth transition for his successor. The Wall Street Journal reported in November (paywall) that Snap had filed paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to begin the process of an initial public offering, which could be valued as high as $25 billion. Lynton, who has worked at Sony for 13 years and was previously CEO of AOL Europe and a vice president at Time Warner, has served on Snap’s board for nearly four years. He was an early investor in CEO Evan Spiegel when Snap was still just Snapchat. “I have been involved with Evan and Snapchat since its early days, and given its growth since then, decided the time was right to transition and focus on my role as Chairman of the Board of Snap Inc,” Lynton said in Sony’s release. Startups have long tapped “professionals” to help them transition into stable, long-term businesses. Facebook brought in former Google exec Sheryl Sandberg as its chief operating officer; Google brought in Sun Microsystems exec and Novell CEO Eric Schmidt to be CEO; and Apple brought in Pepsi CEO John Sculley to run the company (if only for a few years). Snapping up Lynton is the latest sign that Snap is preparing for life after an IPO. Lynton could help Snap position itself as a social media company that knows how to work with the media and publishing industries, given his long history in both. Snapchat spends account for less than 4% of digital advertising budgets globally—Facebook and Google continue to dominate the market. But when Facebook went public in 2012, some analysts worried that it wouldn’t be able to compete with Google. Snap’s investors are surely hoping that, led by Lynton and Spiegel, the company can pull off a similar coup. Still, Lynton will be an interesting fit in a modern, software-focused social company like Snap. After Sony’s email and servers were hacked in 2014, he took to sending his office communications by fax. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

David Guetta to rock in Hyderabad after Bengaluru fiasco Hyderabad seems to have stolen a march on Bengaluru (no surprises, it keeps happening!) as the city is all set to roll out the red carpet for the Grammy-winning musician David Guetta after police refused permission for his concert on Thursday.Bangalore Mirror Bureau | Updated: Jan 14, 2017, 11.31 AM IST Highlights Hyderabad is all set to roll out the red carpet for David Guetta Bengaluru and Mumbai Police refused permission for Guetta's concerts The Cyberabad police extended a warm welcome to Guetta through a tweet The Hyderabad police has tweeted a warm welcome to the French musician HYDERABAD: Hyderabad seems to have stolen a march on Bengaluru (no surprises, it keeps happening!) as the city is all set to roll out the red carpet for the Grammy-winning musician David Guetta after police refused permission for his concert on Thursday. Incidentally, the French DJ could not perform in Mumbai as scheduled on Friday after Mumbai police refused to host the show. The ever-active Telangana government has made sure that no such last-minute glitches happen and it's eager to welcome the popular musician. The Cyberabad police, through a tweet, extended a warm welcome to Guetta and also rubbed it in, adding that they were committed to ensuring a glitch-free event. The Bengaluru police had officially claimed that the permission was cancelled for the Bengaluru concert as their personnel were deployed to ensure an incident-free Agriculture Produce Market Committee ( APMC) elections. But the event organisers had posted on social media that the permission was denied in wake of the recent mass molestation incidents on New Year's Eve in the city and other incidents of women being targeted in the city. "Welcome to Hyderabad @davidguetta. Look forward to host you tomorrow (sic) @ Cyberabadpolice committed to ensure a glitch free event as always,"Tweeted the official handle of Cyberabad police on Friday.

Event managers finally had to remove their initial post and repost that the concert was cancelled because the schedule clashed with the elections. Guetta was slated to perform at Embassy Riding School in Yelahanka.

Telengana policy makers even made it a point to specifically promote its initiatives like the 15-day window period for granting new business license. Some of the global giants like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Flipkart and Ikea have sidestepped Bengaluru and settled for Hyderabad.

Hot Topics: Boulder survey Vance Joseph allegations Pearl Street Mall closures HUD home sale Middle-incoming housing OK'd News tips Print   Email   Font Resize Two Boulder Pearl Street staples close, new retailers on their way in By Shay Castle Staff Writer Posted:   01/13/2017 05:50:57 PM MST Updated:   01/15/2017 08:13:52 AM MST Old Chicago sits empty on the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder on Friday. (Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer) Closures, movement on Pearl Street Mall Old Chicago: 1102 Pearl, Closed, December Bayleaf: 1222, Closed, December Flip Flop Shop (Sand and Salt Sea Company): 1110, Closed, December Woody Creek Bakery and Cafe: 1207, Closed, September Earthwood Gallery: 1412, Moved to Estes Park, October PoshSplat: 1468, Moved to 2035 Broadway, May Ku Cha House of Tea, 1141, Moved to 1211, January The closure of two longstanding businesses is ushering in a rotation of merchants that, experts say, has become typical of the post-holiday season on the Pearl Street Mall. Old Chicago, the 41-year-old original location of the national pizza-and-beer chain, closed its doors last month when its lease on 1102 Pearl St. ran out. Property owner Phil Day, the son of Old Chicago founder Frank Day, has plans to raze the building and replace it with a three-story mixed-use project containing a restaurant, retail, office space and residential units. Boulder's planning board voiced support of the plan in September, and Phil Day said he is still working with the city on design plans and hopes to get approval by the end of the year. Advertisement While he would have preferred to have a tenant to pay rent during that time, he said the restaurant's decision not to renew the lease was "something we contemplated could happen." Old Chicago did not respond to requests for comment, but Downtown Boulder Inc. Executive Director Sean Maher said the decision makes sense from a financial perspective. He speculated that it might not be worth it for Old Chicago to pay rent during the lean winter months in the hopes of a busy summer, only to be shut down by Day's project progressing faster than anticipated. "This is the slowest time of the year" for business on the mall, Maher said. "After New Year's Day, business slows dramatically for three to four months and tends to correct itself in the warmer months. "I'm sure they won't be the only ones who close. We see this every year." In fact, Old Chicago has already been joined by European market Bayleaf, which shuttered for good on Dec. 31 after 12 years at 1222 Pearl St. The closure was announced on the store's Facebook page earlier in the month, but no reason was given. Bayleaf officials did not respond to requests for comment, but landlord Stephen Tebo said it was a personal decision made by the owner. Bayleaf and Old Chicago join a trio of other businesses to close up shop on the mall in recent months. Woody Creek Bakery and Cafe (1207) shut in September, Estes Park-based Earthwood Gallery (1412) followed in October, and Flip Flop Shop (1110, recently renamed Sand and Salt Sea Company) closed in December. Two others made moves: PoshSplat Paint and Wine Studio from 1468 Pearl to 2035 Broadway, and Ku Cha House of Tea from 1141 to 1211 Pearl, a bigger space that will include a tea sipping room. While it might seem like a lot of change all at once, the shuffling of merchants is "inherent to this time of year," said Tebo, who owns the Bayleaf, Woody Creek and new Ku Cha spaces. And it won't translate to a plethora of empty storefronts, according to Gibbons White broker Chris Boston. "I don't think it's a lot of turnover," Boston said. "It's a little turnover, and there's always a little turnover. "There's still very little availability on Pearl Street." Indeed, new tenants have already been signed up on the vacant spots. Regional chain Charlie's t-shirts claimed Earthwood's gallery, Apple repair store Experimac has taken over for PoshSplat, and an as-yet unnamed wine concept is coming into the old Ku Cha space. Tebo has also entertained multiple offers on Woody Creek's vacancy, and expects similar interest in the Bayleaf store. "It's a strong market for retailers on Pearl Street," said Boston. "There's a lot of interest, and we're looking forward to welcoming some new businesses to Boulder."

(AP Photo/Lynn DeBruin, File) Cellebrite, a digital forensics firm known for helping law enforcement crack into locked smartphones, has itself fallen victim to hackers. Technology news website Motherboard said Thursday that it had obtained 900 gigabytes of data related to the Israel-based company. It said the trove of data includes customer information, databases and technical data about the company's products. Cellebrite released a statement Thursday acknowledging that one of its external web servers had been hacked, adding that that it's investigating the extent of the breach. Motherboard journalist Joseph Cox said that an unidentified hacker gave him 900 gigabytes of data from Cellebrite’s servers. In a series of messages posted to Twitter, he said that most of the data consisted of technical information, evidence and log files but that some of the information contained customer data. In an article , Cox wrote that the trove contained messages from authorities in Russia, Turkey and the Arab Gulf. Cellebrite could be in for more unwelcome attention. Cox said that Motherboard would "likely be doing more stories from the data." According to Cellebrite, the server in question included a database backup of an old license management system. It said the hackers accessed basic user contact information and encrypted passwords for users who had not yet moved to the company's new system. While Cellebrite says it's not aware of any risk to customers as a result of the breach, it's still advising them to change their passwords. Cellebrite, founded in 1999, has contracts with the FBI dating back to at least 2013. The firm makes devices that allow law enforcement to extract and decode data such as contacts, pictures and text messages from more than 15,000 kinds of smartphones and other mobile devices. It also makes commercial products that companies can use to help their customers transfer data from old phones to new ones. The company found itself in the spotlight last year after some industry observers speculated that it might have helped the FBI hack into an iPhone used by one of the killer in the San Bernardino, California, mass shooting. That phone was the subject of a major legal fight between the FBI and Apple; the company refused to help break iPhone security. The FBI dropped its case after finding another way into the phone. Cellebrite claims to do business with thousands of law enforcement and intelligence agencies, militaries and governments in more than 100 countries. But its involvement in the San Bernardino case was never proven.

(Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer) Closures, movement on Pearl Street Mall Old Chicago: 1102 Pearl, Closed, December Bayleaf: 1222, Closed, December Flip Flop Shop (Sand and Salt Sea Company): 1110, Closed, December Woody Creek Bakery and Cafe: 1207, Closed, September Earthwood Gallery: 1412, Moved to Estes Park, October PoshSplat: 1468, Moved to 2035 Broadway, May Ku Cha House of Tea, 1141, Moved to 1211, January The closure of two longstanding businesses is ushering in a rotation of merchants that, experts say, has become typical of the post-holiday season on the Pearl Street Mall. Old Chicago, the 41-year-old original location of the national pizza-and-beer chain, closed its doors last month when its lease on 1102 Pearl St. ran out. Property owner Phil Day, the son of Old Chicago founder Frank Day, has plans to raze the building and replace it with a three-story mixed-use project containing a restaurant, retail, office space and residential units. Boulder's planning board voiced support of the plan in September, and Phil Day said he is still working with the city on design plans and hopes to get approval by the end of the year. Advertisement While he would have preferred to have a tenant to pay rent during that time, he said the restaurant's decision not to renew the lease was "something we contemplated could happen." Old Chicago did not respond to requests for comment, but Downtown Boulder Inc. Executive Director Sean Maher said the decision makes sense from a financial perspective. He speculated that it might not be worth it for Old Chicago to pay rent during the lean winter months in the hopes of a busy summer, only to be shut down by Day's project progressing faster than anticipated. "This is the slowest time of the year" for business on the mall, Maher said. "After New Year's Day, business slows dramatically for three to four months and tends to correct itself in the warmer months. "I'm sure they won't be the only ones who close. We see this every year." In fact, Old Chicago has already been joined by European market Bayleaf, which shuttered for good on Dec. 31 after 12 years at 1222 Pearl St. The closure was announced on the store's Facebook page earlier in the month, but no reason was given. Bayleaf officials did not respond to requests for comment, but landlord Stephen Tebo said it was a personal decision made by the owner. Bayleaf and Old Chicago join a trio of other businesses to close up shop on the mall in recent months. Woody Creek Bakery and Cafe (1207) shut in September, Estes Park-based Earthwood Gallery (1412) followed in October, and Flip Flop Shop (1110, recently renamed Sand and Salt Sea Company) closed in December. Two others made moves: PoshSplat Paint and Wine Studio from 1468 Pearl to 2035 Broadway, and Ku Cha House of Tea from 1141 to 1211 Pearl, a bigger space that will include a tea sipping room. While it might seem like a lot of change all at once, the shuffling of merchants is "inherent to this time of year," said Tebo, who owns the Bayleaf, Woody Creek and new Ku Cha spaces. And it won't translate to a plethora of empty storefronts, according to Gibbons White broker Chris Boston. "I don't think it's a lot of turnover," Boston said. "It's a little turnover, and there's always a little turnover. "There's still very little availability on Pearl Street." Indeed, new tenants have already been signed up on the vacant spots. Regional chain Charlie's t-shirts claimed Earthwood's gallery, Apple repair store Experimac has taken over for PoshSplat, and an as-yet unnamed wine concept is coming into the old Ku Cha space. Tebo has also entertained multiple offers on Woody Creek's vacancy, and expects similar interest in the Bayleaf store. "It's a strong market for retailers on Pearl Street," said Boston. "There's a lot of interest, and we're looking forward to welcoming some new businesses to Boulder."
