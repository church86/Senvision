That's more than sterling's devaluation 28 Oct 2016 at 16:23, Andrew Orlowski Andrew Orlowski Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Copyright, Mobile Networks, Nokia, Smartphones, Google Recent Articles Virgin goes 4G with zero-rated Facebook and WhatsApp James Dyson's new startup: A university for engineers that doesn't suck We're great, you don't understand competition law, Google tells Europe Apple has taken advantage of a more competitive sterling exchange rate to hike its computer prices – by far more than sterling fell. Cupertino raised some UK prices by as much as £500. Apple had already raised the prices of its iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch products. Sterling has fallen some 15 per cent from its 1H 2016 average of around $1.45, but Apple's computer prices have risen 20 per cent. But then it wouldn't be Apple if the Apple Tax didn't have an additional Apple SuperTax. The 12in MacBook started at £1,049 yesterday – today the same model starts at £1,249. The most expensive 15.4in MacBook Pro was £2,499. Now it's £2,999. While fanbois rummage down the sofa, economists see the exchange rate correction as a boost for the UK. Sterling had been artificially high for years, with Deutsche Bank last December predicting Sterling would fall to $1.15 in 2017... without Brexit. The IMF's former deputy director Professor Ashok Mody, who negotiated the rescue package for the Irish Republic, and former Bank of England Governer Lord King have both welcomed the more competitive exchange rate. Both point out that the UK economy should be less distorted as a result. "The pound had been driven up to nosebleed levels from 2011 to 2015 by global property speculators and the banking elites acting in destructive synergy, causing serious damage to Britain's manufacturing base and long-term competitiveness," said Mody, cited in the Telegraph (a must read). "History is going to judge that Brexit at last broke the political-economy lock of a British elite wedded to banking interests, even if it happened completely by accident." The UK had a version of Dutch Disease, with an over-reliance on finance capital, and credit-fuelled import consumption. Guardianistas weeping over the fate of the City of London has been one of the stranger aspects of Brexit. But Apple price rises?

Fighting. ‘Did not vote’ was U.S. winner Tuesday. Guess which 7 states were exceptions St. Paul man: I pay for city services not performed. See you in court A winning season year in and year out is not the Minnesota Wild’s only ongoing challenge. Behind the scenes, the downtown St. Paul-based National Hockey League team is largely run off Apple iPad tablets that staffers tote everywhere. However, maintaining the gadgets — mass-installing apps and keeping the iOS operating system on every device up to date — is tricky, time-consuming business. Related Articles Study: Twin Cities one of eight best for tech-startup workers Minnesota ranks high in tech jobs but is losing workers, report says Watch the ‘DocuMNtary’ on Minnesota’s growing tech scene A few blocks away, information-technology workers at Minnesota Public Radio confront a similar hurdle. About 200 Apple Macintosh computers also require the same kind of ongoing attention, which seemingly takes an eternity for an IT worker having to move from machine to machine while doing basic maintenance. Wouldn’t it be cool — and more productive — if an IT staffer at either company could simply push a button and upgrade dozens of iPads or Macs, all at once, from anywhere? Actually, that’s exactly what they do, courtesy of technology from a Minneapolis-based company called Jamf. Founded in 2002, Jamf caters to corporate Apple-hardware administrators who need their drudge work to be largely automated for massive time savings. Former Jamf CEO stays true to St. Paul roots Jamf is, by many metrics, a success. Its tools for streamlining the maintenance of Mac, iPad and iPhone fleets are now in active use by more than 9,200 organizations — up from roughly 6,500 in 2015 — that collectively manage more than 7 million Apple devices. Jamf says it now has $100-million in annual billings with a 95-percent customer-retention rate. But Jamf — known until recently as JAMF Software — also faced a bit of an identity crisis. NEW NAME, NEW IDENTITY The “software” in its former name became inaccurate as its newer tools became Web-based — requiring no traditional software to be installed on any device. Jamf’s automation tools for Apple-device administrators include Jamf Now, a lower-cost and Web-based offerings for smaller companies without dedicated information-technology staffers. (Courtesy of Jamf) The company’s product line also suffered from identity confusion. It’s higher-end Casper Suite software for larger organizations and more-complicated Apple-device deployments seemingly had little to do with Bushel, a lower-end and Web-centric offering for small companies without dedicated IT staffs. Jamf chief executive Dean Hager said a customer who was familiar with Casper often had no idea Bushel exists, or vice versa. This problem, though not necessarily a company crippler, is the sort of situation that could impair growth over the long run, he said. The importance of crystal-clear branding can’t be understated, he insists. GOOD PROBLEM TO HAVE So, when more than 1,200 Apple-network managers from around the world recently met up at Minneapolis’ Guthrie Theater for the seventh annual JAMF Nation User Conference, Hager had news for the attendees: The company would henceforth be known as Jamf — just Jamf with no all-capital letters nor “software” in the name. Along those lines, Casper Suite would now be known as Jamf Pro, while Bushel would be dubbed Jamf Now. The company wants customers to eventually say, “We use Jamf,” regardless of which specific product they’re using. (Hager admits this could take a while.) Jamf clearly is not doing too badly, he added, if this was one of the biggest problems on its plate. PROMISES AHEAD Hager previously CEO of Eden Prairie-based Kroll Ontrack, came on board as Jamf CEO in June 2015. He replaced the company’s founder and co-chief executive, Zach Halmstad, and co-CEO Chip Pearson. Both remain at the company as majority shareholders and board members with some non-management duties thrown in. Dean Hager, CEO of Minneapolis-based Jamf, speaks at the company’s recent user conference at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. (Courtesy of Jamf) Given his newcomer status, Hager said he’s spent the past 16 months doing more listening and learning than making major changes, given that “Jamf was on a terrific trajectory.” The company, he said, is poised for further growth given a couple of industry trends. First, he said, companies of all sizes are increasingly permitting their employees to choose what kinds of computers and mobile gear they wield on the job — and Apple hardware is enormously popular among workers, as it is in the general population. Second, he added, iPads are huge in schools — and about 3,700 Jamf customers are K-12 districts. It is in the educational sphere, however, that Jamf faces potential peril over the longer term. Simplified, Web-centric laptops known as “Chromebooks” — dependant on a variant of Google’s Chrome browser — have increasingly eclipsed iPads and even Macs in K-12 education. Hager said he is not worried, and sees no Chromebook impact on his company’s bottom line at the moment, but acknowledges this is a trend to pay attention to. Meanwhile, he’s delighted to trot out the latest customer success stories. One of the company’s marquee announcements at its recent user conference involves the Jacobs Medical Center at the University of California, San Diego. The medical center is said to be the first with Apple devices (iPads paired with Apple TV video-streaming gadgets that are hooked up to TVs) in every patient room. The facility is using Jamf Pro to run the Apple-device deployment. This, among other things, will allow the patients to use the Apple gear both for entertainment and for accessing their medical details. The tablets will be erased when a patient departs, protecting that person’s sensitive data. Jamf is even going into orbit, Hager added. In a first for the firm, a NASA tech worker used Jamf tools on the ground to manage an iPad aboard the International Space Station, he said. WHAT CLIENTS SAY In St. Paul, meanwhile, a couple of Jamf customers swear by the company’s offerings. Josh Kielbasa, an IT specialist at the Minnesota Wild, said Jamf Pro has been invaluable for managing the organization’s fleet of iPads. Some of these are in the hands of employees and others are in the arena’s suites for visitors to use as TV-control gizmos. “On such a large campus and so diverse in the different uses of the iPads, this allows us to not have to keep walking around to change different features on the devices,” Kielbasa said. “It makes it a one-location kind of thing, and saves a lot of time for us,” he said. “For me personally, I can get on my laptop and make changes on the fly without having to physically touch any iPads. This saves a ton of time.” At Minnesota Public Radio, IT workers keep tabs on 130 Macs in St. Paul and 70 in Los Angeles. The broadcaster has been using Jamf Pro for nearly two years. “It has made our software management much better,” said Joe Juvland, information technology service desk manager. “This is definitely a relief.” Juvland said he loves Jamf tools so much that he wonders when the company might enter the PC market so the broadcaster can keep better tabs on its 800 or so Windows computers. That would be never, Hager said. “That would be watering down the support we have for our Apple customer bases,” he said.

By chuq | Published Oct 29 2016 Apple finally (drink!) announced the updated MacBook Pro computers and the refreshed laptop line that will carry them forward for the next year or so. As expected, these new computers include Skylake CPUs with support for USB C and the newer, faster, Thunderbolt 3 interfaces and improved monitors with the wide color capabilities. I bought one immediately after the event, and I’ll have it in hand in a couple of weeks. Am I happy with it? Yes. But… There’s a huge amount of criticism of Apple coming out online after this event. And there’s a lot to criticize Apple about, unfortunately, because while they updated these laptops, they didn’t even mention the rest of the Mac product line, and the huge questions about where Apple sees this line going over the next few years weren’t even acknowledged, much less addressed. And I think that’s a big problem. I like the new MacBooks. I think some of the criticism of them is unjustified. I think much of the criticism is misplaced anger at other things Apple is doing (or isn’t). But I think most of the criticism is an indication of larger problems Apple simply hasn’t acknowledged, much less worked to resolve. Things like… Where did the low-end macs go? They became iPads. Apple has never been afraid of cannibalizing a product with another product, and with the new MacBooks, we see the result here. Low end laptops? Basically, gone. My guess is this isn’t Apple pushing this change, but following a change that already exists in their sales numbers. And that has an interesting implication for the Mac line: I’m old enough to remember when the “personal computer” was a niche, nerdy product, and I’ve now lived long enough to see the age of the personal computer begin the downward slide back into being that niche, nerdy product again. What is Apple’s long-term strategy for pro apps? To be honest, Final Cut seems like a prosumer app that is used by pros, not a pro app that’s used by prosumers. What’s the future of Logic? they’ve killed Aperture, is it next? Am I going to be pushed to Premiere and Audition in the next two years? I hope not, but to be honest, I’m starting to think about what that would take for me to do, because right now, I have no idea if I can depend on the pro apps moving forward, because Apple won’t say anything and the last year or so of updates and improvements hasn’t been encouraging. I’m worried, because of the poor hardware situation and the — muted — improvements to the pro line in the last 18 months that Apple has decided these are too niche to invest in, and so they’re just moving them into the same path Aperture lived on for so long. Where are the updates to the desktop line? Where are the developer-class macs? And what about users who need high hardware with larger memory configurations? These new laptops all max out at 16Gb which is fine for, I’d wager, 95% of users, but for that other 5%? Is Apple really suggesting they head off to Microsoft instead? Apple needs to sort this out before WWDC, or I wouldn’t want to be wearing an Apple badge at the conference, because it’ll be a non-stop yell-fest. Or more correctly, I’m sure they do have it sorted out and it’s probably on Phil Schiller’s whiteboard in his office, but Apple has to tell its users how it’s sorted out — because more and more I’m hearing these users taking a serious look at alternatives, and I expect many are going to start jumping ship. Microsoft is an option again That’s because Microsoft has gotten its act together, and they showed some really interesting products as well. It’s clear Microsoft has decided it can compete with Apple — and win — in the creative professional world that Apple has been a strength in for decades, and I think Microsoft is right here. I like seeing the Microsoft has finally figured it out and is innovating again. I like that they’re taking Apple on and pushing Apple. The similarities and differences between the new MacBooks with the Touch Bar and the Surface are fascinating; two very different philosophies to solving the same basic problem. Which one will win? I have no idea, and when was the last time we saw technological innovation into a problem where we really didn’t know what the right approach was? This is great. But if Apple thought it’s new MacBook pros were going to push back against Microsoft and it’s drive to bring over the creative professionals, they were wrong. So far, Apple hasn’t reacted to Microsoft. Instead, this looks like a retrenchment to me, retreating into a safe spot in the product area while jettisoning niches — going to where the numbers are based on sales, and simply abandoning groups that don’t fit that mass mainstream population. Unfortunately, they’re abandoning some of their strongest proponents and evangelists, and in some ways, also abandoning a key component, their developers. That’s potentially disastrous. Don’t hit us! We are really committed to accessibility! I love that Apple is so committed to accessibility, and their opening video was awesome in showing some of the things they’re doing to bring the Apple to all. And yet… in the larger context of the event, why was it there? And given the big issues users have been complaining about — the lack of an updated Mini, the lack of an updated Mac Pro, the chaos and neglect of the entire Desktop line, in honesty — wouldn’t they have been better off spending 15 minutes talking about the state of the Mac and some kind of roadmap explaining when these issues were going to be resolved? But no, this is Apple, and Apple doesn’t roadmap, and it certainly never admits that there are problems it hasn’t solved yet, even if the problem is out of their control, and so they did the entire event with an 500 pound elephant on stage that was never acknowledge or fed a single peanut. And so to me, my reaction to the accessibility video ended up significantly reduced, because it came across as trying to prove what great people they were while they were very loudly refusing to deal with the problems much of their audience wanted to know about. I think Apple’s game of holding information close to its chest and not sharing served itself well, but I also think there are times when you have to realize that’s the wrong thing to do, and in this case, they made the mistake of not acknowledging all of the problems within the Mac product line and talking about it, at least in generalities. And that’s left a sour taste in the mouth of many Mac Faithful, including me. But it’s so not Apple, not it’s core DNA. And honestly, spending ten minutes admitting the Mac product line is still a shambles but it’ll take them a few more months to sort out wouldn’t be hard. All it takes is a bit of courage (drink!), and Apple didn’t show any in this event. They spent their time talking about two really interesting trees while completely ignoring the forest dying of drought all around them. And I think the Apple user community has about had enough of Apple and it’s showing in the feedback we’re seeing online. My bottom line on the event My bottom line: Satisfaction with the hardware, and the new 13” MacBook hits my sweet spot, so I grabbed one. But I came away with a much bigger sense of frustration because of Apple’s unwillingness to admit the Mac product line is a cluster and their users and supporters need some re-assurance that it’s being fixed. Instead, we got a couple of new laptops and the rest of the dumpster fire was sitting there unacknowledged as if it doesn’t exist. That’s a typical Apple behavior, but one I’m rather tired of being on the wrong end of. It’s time for Apple to take a long and hard look at how they communicate with their users, supporters, evangelists and developers and realize times have changed. If Microsoft is a legitimate alternative, you’re going to see more and more people start to take that option, because they have no idea when or if Apple will resolve the issues and with Microsoft, you have some understanding of how things are going to move forward. Roadmaps matter. My New MacBook Enough ranting. Immediately after the announcements, I went and bought the 13” MacBook Pro with the touch bar, with upgraded CPU, 16GB of memory and the 1TB SSD. In Space Gray, of course. Why? My old laptop is a 2013 model and going on four years old. That is, I believe, the longest I’ve held a Mac before upgrading, but in reality, it’s chugging along pretty well with a few inconveniences. That I’m happy holding on to hardware this long is an indication of a key change in the Mac product space: these units have, by and large, hit that “good enough” point where there isn’t much motivation to upgrade, because the changes are smaller and more evolutionary. [Update: I grabbed the wrong CPU benchmark; my bad. Updated this to the corrected info — it’s not doubled, it’s roughly the same as my current Laptop, but since I’m going from the top end 15″ model to a 13″ model, that’s really what I was expecting in the first place — chuq] I could stick with this device for another year or two and not feel too bad about it, too, but I’m making the shift for a few reasons: Skylake CPUs: I get the new generation CPU, and I get to upgrade from a 2.3Ghz I7 to a 3.3GHz i7. According to the Passmark benchmarks, the CPU benchmark scores are very close. GPU upgrade: A shift from the GeForce GT 750m to the built in Intel Iris Graphics 550. Passmark says this change will be about a 25% improvement. Now, components are not a system so it’s really about how this all works together. I’m upgrading to a bigger, faster SSD in the unit, which should notably help performance. Memory size stays at 16Gbytes, but the speed of the memory increases from 1600MHz to 2133MHz, so that should lead to a performance boost as well. So overall, there seems to be some nice speed increases in this new computer, but that’s not why I’m doing this: I’ve found in the last few years that I really wanted a smaller and lighter computer than my MacBook pro 15”. The only time I need the big screen is on the road, and even then, with retina screens it’s not that big a deal as it used to be. But the smaller screen of the 13” also makes this a lighter machine, and I’ll be going from 4.5 pounds to 3 pounds. That’s a lot nicer on a couch or in a hotel room or on my shoulder. Moving to the smaller form factor is a huge win for me today, especially since I can do so without sacrificing overall performance compared to my existing machine, and a primary reason I went 15” in 2013 was horsepower; that gap has narrowed with the new models. I can’t wait to see geek bench numbers on these things. On top of that, I get a better retina screen with wide color — and the minute I saw wide color on the iPad, I was hooked, and for my photography, this is huge. And I get Touch ID, and the touch strip, which I’m really looking forward to working with to see if I like it as much as I expect to. Outfitting the new beast Now that I’ve committed to the new computer, I’m considering how that will impact my working spaces and how I need to make changes. The first big one: I’ve traditionally used the laptop closed and docked using a vertical holder, but with the Touch Bar and Touch-ID, I think it’s insane to keep the laptop closed. that means shifting to a different dock, and so I’ve gotten the Twelve South ParcSlope. Switching to this will involve re-arranging my entire desk environment, of course. This shift to USB C will require changing how stuff connects, but solving this is simpler than it seems (I think). I’m right now leaning towards the CalDigit USB-C Docking Station which will give me charging, old USB compatibility, display and speaker connections — pretty much turning hooking into the desktop into a two cable experience instead of 3, because you no longer need a separate charging cable plugged in. The Caldisk will then connect into my existing USB hub, and life will be gravy (I hope). The other cable? thunderbolt to my external disk, and for now, I’ll just use the existing drive with an adaptors or an updated cable. I also need to update my travel bag. Here in some ways there’s great news, because instead of having to carry two big charger blocks (Mac and USB), I can convert to one, saving space and weight. Anker has a nice one that’ll charge everything out of one charger, and this, to me, is a nice improvement. On the road connectivity? It looks like the Satechi Slim Aluminum Type-C Multi-Port Adapter solves the problem pretty well and has great reviews. I’m also considering whether I want the portable version as well for coffee shop usage, and if I so, it’ll likely be the Satechi Type-C USB 3.0 3 in 1 Combo Hub. And yes, I bought a couple of dongles. I know there’s a lot of snide snarking going on about dongles, but, you know what? when I buy a new car, I outfit it with some customizations like chains that cost extra because the chains from my old car won’t fit, and I don’t see reason to complain about that. That’s what this is all about, really — customizing a tool to me specific needs. It’s part of the reality of taking a tool and making it my tool for my needs. Not that this will stop people from snarking, of course. But I think it’s silly, unless you honestly think a computer should be made specifically for how you want to do things, and ignore the reality that every one of us has a different definition of that. So I think I know what I need to make my new computer feel at home, and once I sorted it all out, it was less complex than I was worried about. We’ll see how it works in practice. One more thing One other things I did immediately after the event: I went onto Amazon and bought a 3 pack of Eero wifi hubs to replace my Airports. Apple has neglected other parts of their product lines, including their Airports and Time Capsules, and I’d decided if I didn’t hear about possible updates or some kind of roadmap, it was time to jump ship and move on — and so I have. I think we all have to think about where we stand with Apple if we’re using or depending on niche products. With monitors, Apple announced a partnership with LG instead of a new monitor, and later confirmed that it was out of the monitor business. I think you can take that as an indication of how it’s going to handle other products that are now niche products where Apple isn’t a dominant player, and the Wifi world long ago moved on from Apple; I’ve stuck with it for one reason: ease of use, but the Eero devices seem to have that solved in ways even better than Apple. I get the distinct feeling that Apple simple doesn’t care about the Airport any more, and I’m not willing to wait on zero information to find out otherwise. And as Apple users, we all need to take a look at where we are using Apple gear and ask ourselves if Apple still cares about those things. If not, it’s time to start thinking about upgrading away from Apple to something from a vendor that cares about the product. And then there’s that bigger, difficult question: is the Mac product line itself a niche, and has Apple started losing interest in it? Unfortunately, Apple punted on resolving that worry with us at the event, and it’s clear we’ll get no more answers about it until after the first of the year. And so when I look at people who’ve been faithful to Apple who are now considering jumping ship, all I can say is “I understand, I don’t blame you”, because Apple’s done nothing to resolve the worries we have about where this is all headed, and I can’t blame people for choosing to not wait for Apple to actually do something about it any more. And that’s a problem I don’t see Apple as having really seen, much less come to grips with. But if they’re paying attention to the reaction to these announcements, they should, and I hope they do something to settle the ruffled feathers out in the user community. But this is Apple, and so I don’t expect to hear anything until they make the next announcements. Hopefully it won’t be too late for many of you.

Spend a little more time on the Internet and you’re sure to see the plethora of articles pointing out how Apple seems to become less and less innovative as years go by, many even pointing to Microsoft as a great example of innovation with their really fantastic Surface Pro line of portable computers and the newly announced Surface Studio. Microsoft more innovative and creative than Apple? Let’s dig in and figure out what happened. In his book, "Start With Why," Author Simon Sinek discusses the concept of a company’s “why,” emphasizing the idea that people don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it. Sinek frequently references Apple as a company that established their why from the beginning of the company and have held true to it through the life of the company. "Start With Why" was released in 2009, however, and I am fairly certain that Sinek has a different opinion on Apple’s direction seven years removed from the publishing of his book. Sinek has a concept that he refers to as The Golden Circle, a way of defining your company that keeps you centered on why.   He uses Apple to demonstrate how they hold true to their why, and what they would look like if they didn’t. If Apple were like most other companies, a marketing message from them would move from the outside in of The Golden Circle. It would start with some statement of what the company does or makes, followed by how they think they are different or better than the competition, followed by some call to action. With that, the company would expect some behavior in return, in this case a purchase. A marketing message from Apple, if they were like everyone else, might sound like this: 'We make great computers. They’re beautifully designed, simple to use and user-friendly. Wanna buy one?' Sinek contrasts this example by laying out how Apple actually markets themselves (or at least, how they used to): Let’s look at that Apple example again and rewrite the example in the order Apple actually communicates. This time, the example starts with why: 'Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in thinking differently. The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use, and user-friendly. And we happen to make great computers. Wanna buy one?' That line right there is what used to encapsulate Apple as a company, “We exist to challenge the status quo.” Apple has done this since their inception, challenging the idea of what a personal computer should be, what kind of expertise it should take to use one, and what the experience of the user should be like. Even during the Jobs-less period of the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, Apple continued to push against the status quo of what a computer was, and what the experience of using one was supposed to be like. Let’s rewind back to ‘80s for a moment. Remember this gem?     This isn’t just challenging the status quo, it’s shattering it (literally and metaphorically). Apple’s drive to inspire users and not just sell them features was as foundational in their company as the idea of freedom is for Southwest Airlines (Sinek has a great writeup on Southwest in the book, won’t get into it here). The point is that, for over 20 years, Apple has stood for something, and it’s something their users have identified with, but now that something is disappearing and we’re no longer as captivated as we used to be. I grew up as a lover of computers. Our very first computer was an Apple IIc, and I swear to you that thing was magic. A few years later, we moved to PC, and I was captivated again. By the time I was 11, I was foraging parts to build bastardized PC’s in my bedroom, dumpste- diving and hitting up resale shops to try and upgrade every part I could. I was so deep into the PC mindset you wouldn’t believe it. I made fun of Macs and the people who used them. I built my own stuff; I didn’t need some gimmicky purple laptop to feel cool. Did those people even know how to edit their registry? Then I graduated high school, and someone gave me the white MacBook as a graduation gift. I was going to sell it and use that money to get the Alienware laptop of my dreams, when I thought “what the hell” and I opened the box up, booted up my first Mac, and I was done.   You’ll call it being a fanboy or drinking the Kool-Aid or whatever, but I went from thinking Apple was a joke to thinking they might be the greatest company of all time. Everything just made sense. The operating system was intuitive, even for a hardcore Windows truther like me. The aesthetic fit me, the experience was not just enjoyable, but relatable, and I fell hard. No really, I fell hard. Two months later I was working at the local Apple Store where I spent the next year seeing how Apple’s why inundated not just their products, but their culture and business practices. Since then (2008), I have owned four different Apple laptops (and just ordered the new one, more on that later), a Mac Pro, every generation of iPhone, several iPod Touches (and an iPod shuffle, we can all agree that was a mistake), a few iPads, and an Apple TV. I’ve gotten my family on Macs, my wife on a Mac, I’m the guy friends come to with their Apple questions, and I answer them gladly. But for the last few years, I have felt less and less connected to the brand that sucked me in and more like I’m buying a product for the features. Nothing wrong with that, but feeling marginal contentment is quite a dropoff after years of feeling inspired. At the core of it, that’s what Apple did: they inspired users, not through clever marketing or manipulations, but through genuineness in vision and purpose that came through in their products. Remember that line from Sinek’s book about how Apple challenges the status quo and they do that by making beautiful products that are simple to use and user-friendly? The how of that is still the same; their products are still beautiful, they’re simple to use, and they’re user-friendly, but the why behind that seems to be gone. Why does Apple make beautiful products? Because that’s what they do and that’s what they believe their brand is built on. So what’s the reason for this loss of why? The easy answer is that Steve Jobs passed away in 2011 and that he was the driving catalyst behind Apple’s why. Well, sometimes the easy answer is the right one. Many pundits and industry “insiders” have said much of the same thing, but it’s not just the simple absence of Jobs that explains the slow decline of Apple and the loss of innovation. He was absolutely relentless in the pursuit of Apple’s why. Users shouldn’t be content, they should be inspired. User experience was everything, not because that would help drive the bottom line, but because it was the right way to make something. Think about Apple’s advertising. The ads you remember weren’t about features or upgrades, they were about inspiring a certain aesthetic, a certain personality. Remember the awesome “Get a Mac” TV spots? No one wanted to be John Hodgman; everyone wanted to be Justin Long. Well, maybe not everyone, but Jobs (and Apple) would have told you that they didn’t care about the consumers that wanted to be PCs; they wanted to inspire the users that wanted to be Macs. To do what Apple did in their advertising took balls, no way around it. They had absolute confidence in their vision and in their why. “Here’s a commercial of some silhouettes dancing around on color backgrounds. Why? Because we love to dance to our music. Music should be simple; there shouldn’t be a barrier between you and your music. We don’t have to wow you with the features of our music player because it’s not about how much storage the iPod has or what formats it supports; it just makes enjoying your music easy. Why a click wheel? Because buttons for music are dumb, so we did something better. We think of experience first first, and the features that experience dictates are what we make.” Apple used to be relentless about its pursuit of features that might seem trivial, but enhanced the user experience beyond normal computer specs. I present as Exhibit A the MagSafe. Yeah, magnetic power adapter, whoop-de-doo, but it was small touches like these that made Apple stand out and that elevated the user’s experience. Do you know what feature I bragged about to people when I took my MacBook places? It wasn’t the processor or the amount of RAM I had put in or even the cool, sleek design of the computer’s body, it was that silly little magnetic power plug that popped into place with no effort at all and popped right off if someone or something tripped on the cord. The MagSafe was one the many tiny ways that Apple told its users: “We get it, we’re one of you, this thing about computers sucks, and we don’t care how other people do it, we’re going to do it better.” Well, now the MagSafe is gone, and sure, it’s gone for good reasons; USB-C is a great standard, and it needs to be driven forward for the market to adopt it fully. But the MagSafe is more than just a nifty feature that we all need to move on from for the good of the computing industry, it’s symbolic of the mindset of a company that for so many years seemed to be in lockstep with creatives, understanding our needs and operating as a partner and not just a vendor. Watch the video above again; it’s not a spot about a great feature, it’s saying: “Well yeah, our computers do this because that’s how computers should work, we don’t care how everyone else charges their laptops.” And now, that “feature” is gone. I get it. A large contingent of PC users out there haven’t even read this far and have just scrolled down to the comments to explain all the reasons why they never used Macs, and that’s fine. When it comes down to it, this is just a computer company: they sell a commodity that we buy. But what made Apple different from the IBMs, Toshibas, HPs, or whatever company is making PCs now (is Gateway still a thing?) was how they connected with the needs of their users, and that difference seems to be slipping away, keynote after keynote. So all of that brings me to Microsoft, who announced their Surface Studio the day before Apple’s MacBook announcement. Sure, the announcement felt more like a dressed up infomercial than a TED Talk, but I can’t deny that I felt that same spark of inspiration that I used to feel from Apple announcements. Of course it’s a touchscreen with a stylus! I don’t want to be divorced from my images when I work on them, constantly looking down at my keyboard (or Touch Bar) while I work; I want to be in my images. And of course the display tilts down to a usable angle! It just makes so much sense! Now, do I think that Microsoft has suddenly discovered their why and are on their way to supplant Apple and take back the creative market from the longtime leader? No, I don’t. I honestly think Microsoft has stumbled into something great with the Surface Pro and now the Surface Studio. I almost get the sense that they don’t necessarily understand why those two products are so compelling, but they sure are excited that they are. If they discover that why and embrace it, then awesome. I have no beef with Microsoft. I want companies to succeed, and I want them to make inspirational products for users and not just iterative ones, so if Microsoft heads that direction, then fantastic. All of this to say, I bought the new MacBook Pro. I bought an (almost) maxed-out model, and I’m actually pretty excited to see what sort of additional functionality the Touch Bar adds to my workflow, but that’s really it. My current MacBook Pro is three years old, and I need the latest tech features to help maximize my productivity. This was a purely feature-based decision. When it comes down to it, I think that the Surface Pro might be a better product for my needs; I just really don’t like Windows. It’s a decision that was all about features, not about inspiration. The days of feeling like I am buying a product from a company that understands me, that has the same values as me are gone. I no longer feels inspired by my Apple products; I just feel...productive.

I'm late to the Mac train. I used to build PCs as well. I still love my Mid-2014 MacBook Pro but more than that, I love the customer service that comes with it. I remember the days of being on hold for literally two hours to get 7 minutes worth of customer service. When I don't understand something on my Mac or iOS device or just yesterday, my AirPort Extreme, I get helped nearly immediately and they stay on the line long enough to ensure themselves that I completely understand. Honestly, I can deal with a features based purchase as long as the people keep me excited. While I haven't been on the Mac train ling enough to notice a loss of why, who knows, the people who I speak with in CS might just be able to inspire the why back into Apple. 2 0 Usman Dawood - October 29, 2016 I was almost someone who didn't read the article and just left a comment instead haha. 2 0 Tomas Ramoska - October 29, 2016 13-inch MacBook Pro powered by dual-core processor and Intel Iris Graphics 550 no dedicated video card this is joke yes? :) I will remind you we almost in 2017. UK price £1,949 should be not more than £999 1 0 Alan Klughammer - October 29, 2016 Tomas Ramoska exactly the point of the article... if you want more power, get the 15 inch. But yeah, Apple seems to have dropped the ball with this iteration... 2 -1 Tomas Ramoska - October 30, 2016 Alan Klughammer 13-inch MacBook Pro they should call it just MacBook definitely not PRO 2 0 Kawika Lopez - October 29, 2016 [Edited] This is a great article that grasps a lot of the frustration I've had with Apple lately. I would like to pose a theory though. I think Apple is still operating of of the same 'Why' that it was years ago. Hear me out. They are determined to challenge the status quo and thinking differently. How? They're moving forward and leaving inefficient concepts and dated technologies behind. But then they came to the what, and Steve wasn't there to say, "No." I think the problem is ultimately the "What" and it's execution. Thoughts? 1 0 Oz Photo - October 29, 2016 [Edited] Apple has been going no where now for years, their technology is no different than other vendors, Their electronics are no better, their OS software is still just an OS no better than the others, but they are better at branding. Microsoft has not been good at that. However you can't continue to just change a few things and rely on your branding from one phone and laptop to another. It's boring and not innovative. Branding does not excite me, innovation does. Now I must say that these new products from Microsoft, the Surface and the Surface Studio are very exciting. It remains to be seen whether Microsoft will continue with innovation but for this point in time what they have done leaves Apple behind. 1 0 Daris Fox - October 29, 2016 I use both Windows and macOS and say up front there's no bad OS, but there is a bad PC and both Apple and IBM clone manufacturers are guilty as each other in producing them. In the early days Apple had the conviction to drive their view and people accepted it, why? Because they was often right and they owned their own eco-system so they had total control over it. This is something MS learned the hard way, their hubris culminated in MS Vista but after that you started to see the changes in MS from Win 7 on-wards. The philosophy behind the Surface line is more akin to the original Apple Vision, it's a halo product to be the best that technology can be but more importantly to designed to allow you to be creative and to look stunning. The transformation of MS has taken a better part of the decade, but this article isn't about MS it's about Apple. So you have to ask why didn't they take advantage of MS's own stumbles (and OEM partners) over the last decade? There's been plenty of opportunities and the answer really comes down to mobile devices. The fact that Apple took nearly 4 years to replace the Macbook Pro says it all, and they release a lukewarm make-over (especially against existing laptops on the market like the Surfacebook or Yoga) only when their mobile divisions are starting to flat line or shrink. Sure the TouchStrip is interesting tech, but again it's not attention grabbing, there's been several failures on the PC over the years. However one thing that'll goes against Apple's own philosophy and the reason a lot of people loved Apple computers and the OS is the UI/UX was second to none. taking away the Function keys is a user hostile move. As a touch typist I don't want to be looking up and down trying to find a non-tactile target potentially of varying size let alone finding the esc key. Then you have the removal of other features that photographers my find useful such as video out or even a SD card slot. All this said Apple is pursuing their own vision of the future as is MS. MS sees convergence whereas Apple sees diversity. Neither Vision is 'wrong' but Apple is starting to fray at the edge because before they was relatively unique (especially in the PowerPC days) and didn't suffer the travails of being ubiquitous, before when they was a niche product they had a prestige and a sense of Elitism to go with their marketing. When Apple started to get popular you started to see the cracks in the quality control and also security. In delaying the release of the Macbook Pro so long they've lost some of their mindshare that existed and allowed the competition to steal a march on them and even surpass them. Also Apple was looked to produce the 'Next Big Thing', the tech press always looked to Apple as the weather gauge as to the future of tech. Last year they got lambasted for being a "Me Too" company copying the Surface Pro with their own iPad Pro. However this year more than any other year the Press hasn't been kind to Apple, something usually unheard of as Apple is notorious for being ruthless about not inviting press that says things detrimental to the companies image. Add into the fact the decisions they've done over the last few years with software (OS X Server, Final Cut Pro, the Macbook Pro being limited to 16Gb RAM and so on) has alienated large swathes of their user base. 0 0 1 0 As a multitasking creative content creator: Oh why didn't they give an option of more than 16GB of RAM, whyyyyy? And why did they not make the touchpad Pencil-compatible? Fergal O'Callaghan - October 29, 2016 I think Apple has lost its way. iPhones and iPads are easy to use but the Mac Operating system is awful and so is iTunes . Both very poorly designed and a poor user experience. MacOS makes Windows 10 look good. Apple got a lucky break with Samsung battery issues. It's very hard for Apple to make their IPhones different. The operating system was perfected in the first version. Every new phone looks remarkably like the previous one. I was surprised Apple didn't bring out a large IPad first before the large Surface Pro. They were miles ahead of Microsoft but Microsoft have caught up. A lot of users still want a keypad and Microsoft caters for it. A number of Cop shows have large touch computers - that was pointing the way to the future. I can see a lot of executives wanting that large Surface Pro. Hopefully it will spur on Apple. The industry seemed to be running out of ideas. 0 0 Scott Villalobos - October 29, 2016 I switched to Mac about two years ago, have been very happy I did. But like you, since Steve Jobs is gone, I feel like the innovation is gone as well. It's like no one is pushing them anymore. I hate Windows, seems to be updating for 30 mins everytime I use my PC. No so with my Mac, updates take seconds, it runs like a champ and no virus'. But, I have to say, when I saw the Surface Studio ad I was wow'd. Apple needs another Steve Jobs at the wheel, someone who will push his people to think beyond, to say good enough just isn't. I was pretty bummed to learn they won't be making a 5K Cinema display, that I would have to go and buy an LG or something. Not impressing me with this years offerings. 1 0 michael andrew - October 30, 2016 I use my computer to edit photos and videos. It does not get in my way, once it does I will update it. I use my phone for nearly everything else. I read the news, blogs ect on my phone. Many are like me. I believe computers are literally becoming less relevant, compared to tablets and phones. I hardly browse the Internet on my computer anymore. I work so much on my computer that I simply loath being near it when I don't have to be. 0 0 Steve Urkel - October 30, 2016 [Edited] Apples inability to "Think Different" Is easy to explain. Jobs was a visionary. Cook was a bean counter. Ive was a designer. All three were necessary to bring Apple to greatness. But with Jobs gone and no one to replace him then the company is pretty much exactly what you'd get with a bean counter and designer in charge. Products that are over-designed and over-priced but are uninspiring and unfocused. 2 0 Scott Weaver - November 1, 2016 [Edited] Steve Urkel Exactly. Remember that Cook promoted Ive to a level next to godhood at Apple. I wonder if he can say no to him? Ive needs to be told no, and Apple is melding its fading iPad line with the laptop, because that's the direction Apple needs to go in. 0 0 Paulius Palaima - October 30, 2016 I must say, I agree with almost everything you said. I myself have set up everything apple in my home, not going into details it is just simpler that way. Yet, in the end your essay starts sounding like someone with Stockholm syndrome. It does seem like you regret that purchase yet for some reason have difficulties admitting it. While I love OS X, and absolute despise using Windows (for me it is just naturally backwards to how I work), Apple as a whole has become rather a gimmick. 1 0 Alessandro Bondielli - October 30, 2016 Thats exactly how I feel right now! The main problem though is that here in Italy Apple raised the prices of MacBook Pro so much (e.g. old 15'' is still sold at 2300 euros, new base model 15'' is 2800 euros + dongles) that even if I dislike windows with all my heart, now that I have to buy a new computer I am unsure what to do. 0 0 Doc Pixel - October 30, 2016 I think the next (obvious?) headline is probably, "How Apple Ruined My Chances of Ever Being Considered A Professional Photographer". I wish I was kidding. 0 0 Frederic Dupoux - October 30, 2016 @Andrew this was an interesting read and well written article but allow me to tell you that you're are missing the point here. Apple is again and still fighting the status quo, and you like most consumers are immersed in the idea that innovation means doing something that you have never seen before. Touch screen laptops and desktops are the worst "innovations" of our time it has been done before i.e the cyntiq and many pc hardware companies have tried it a long time ago and failed. Now that the touch screen technology is nicer and more accurate they are trying to bring it back. It's failing for the simple reason that it is not natural to tap on your laptop's screen or desktop's screen it is far more natural to hold a tablet or a phone and work with your fingers. With the new touch bar Apple is fighting the idea that every new computer should have that same touch screen tech. Instead of adopting the trend like everybody else they actually just came out with the perfect combination of touch input and computer use kind of like adding a tool that will become a standard and always present on your machine not an external device like that scroll wheel microsoft just came out with the day you loose it or it stops working you'll only become handicapped from your work routine. To sum it all up, theTouch Bar is innovative and the right thing to do because people can't use touch screen laptops like they use tablets. This is innovation, you can't grasp it just yet like everything that's NEW and INNOVATIVE. p.s i don't understand the move of removing the magsafe but there must be a valid reason to it we will find out. 1 0 Andrew Richardson - October 30, 2016 Frederic Dupoux With all due respect, I don't think you understand me. I have no illusions about what innovation "should be". I still consider Apple to be an innovative company, but I believe they now innovate for the sake of features and not out of a primary drive for user experience and inspiration. Pointing to things that Apple did before anyone else is an easy way of illustrating my point, but it's not the only thing that Apple used to do that "challenged the status quo". Apple's entire retail concept was wrapped around the idea of challenging what a retail experience should be for the consumer. None of what they did in their retail stores were all the revolutionary, but the small things they did created a retail experience most consumers had never had before. Even that experience is now being lost as the Retail directive becomes more and more focused on systematizing everything to such a degree that the customer is no longer the focus and going to the Apple store no longer feels like a personal relaxing experience; it feels like most other retail shops. Again, I did not say that Apple is no longer innovative, I said their core direction and 'why' have changed, therefore their innovation has changed. 2 0 Robert Feliciano - October 30, 2016 Frederic Dupoux @Frederic "i don't understand the move of removing the magsafe but there must be a valid reason to it we will find out." Why do most companies do anything? It's to make or save money. Why add another port when the USB-C port will charge it? I think it's a good idea, now I can bring my laptop to my office, my client's office or home without an AC adapter, just the cable. I can plug it into a monitor to power it. Though I'm sure I'll miss it the next time I knock my laptop to the floor instead of just pulling out the cable. 1 0 Sergio Tello - October 30, 2016 I have been using Apple computers since the Power Mac 6500, about 20 years ago. I used and replaced 7 other macs since then. Personally, I think the problem with Apple is their success, especially with the iPhone. They used to be cool but functional, now days they are trying to be cooler, but they are rendering themselves nonfunctional. It's style over substance all day long at Apple now days. Such a shame. I bought my first PC last year, now I use both Apple and PC, maybe in the future I'll just stick with PCs. 0 0 Allan Higa - October 30, 2016 I would have to disagree and say that their why has not changed. You stayed that their why is challenging the status quo, making computers that are easy to use, and beautifully designed. The status quo is currently hybrid touch screen laptops that double as tablets. Apple is clearly making a stance by saying that keeping the computer, a keyboard and mouse driven idea that requires precision a finger can't replicate, and the iPad, a touch interface, separate gives their customers the best experience possible. Making computers easy to use, the touch bar accomplishes this. Realize that people who read this site are the 1%, the power users who memorize Photoshop keyboard shortcuts, know how to switch between safari tabs without clicking on them with the mouse, etc. For the other 99% of their customers, macOS is easy to use, but these shortcuts are not intuitive and remain completely unknown to them. The Touch Bar is a beautiful piece of technology that brings productivity to the masses by allowing them to get the same app specific productivity without having to reach for the mouse or trackpad and dig into the menus to find different actions and tools. For us here, the 1%, the Touch Bar may not prove to be useful as you know that the [ and ] keys adjust photoshop brush size, but for everyone else learning to use the program, its game changing for them. Yes I do believe force touch on the iPhone is not as intuitive for this same population, but their same why and innovation is there in the hopes of making a product that is beautifully designed and easy to use. Yes the MagSafe is gone, it Apple is clearly moving to a wireless world where you're not plugged in for the sake of mobility and battery life enables this. If Apple's belief is that you should be able to use it unplugged, completely free of cables, the MagSafe is no longer relevant. Yes it's a Pro device that will have most professionals plugging in externals and displays, but in that case, the MagSafe wouldn't save your computer anyways. Craig Federighi just did an interview with CNET he clearly paints this same ideologies, it's a great watch and it assures their user base that they are still focused and have a clear understanding of where they are and what they want to be. 1 -1 JAS Square - October 30, 2016 "When it comes down to it, I think that the Surface Pro might be a better product for my needs; I just really don’t like Windows." Honestly, I don't think so. I have no MacBook but iPhone and iPad + AppleTV (not the latest but the one before). And I have a SurfacePro4! I work in Germany (IT Consulting) and I do that on windows now since the early nineties. First at university I had a PC desktop, later at work I had a PC notebook. Mostly I had Thinkpads. First when the were still from IBM and later the Lenovo versions. My last was the X1Carbon. That was the best PC I ever had, not just by absolute measures, but also by relative means, judging the PCs in relation to their time. Now I have the SurfacePro 4 connected to the dock and to that attached I have two monitors. Maybe the surface is a nice tool if you don't do that, (dock + external monitor) but if you want to be productive I guess, you do not want to edit pictures on that tiny display. Judging by the above mentioned standard, relative to the time I went from the best PC to the worst PC in my working history. I can explain why I think like that, but that way I would continue to be off topic, as this is about the why of Apple and not about Microsoft... so sorry for that detour, but your quote made me think I need to tell Andrew, that the SurfacePro is nothing to look jealously into the PC block. Best wishes J. 0 0 0 0 Fascinating how 2 announcements can so immediately clarify: 1. I love my Macs. 2. But I merely skimmed their announcement 3. While I immediately fantasized my life with the Surface Studio. Luke Adams - October 30, 2016 I was a long-time PC user (and one constantly rolling my eyes at the people who bought Macs and had no idea why they were buying one other than it was trendy). My last PC purchase was a SP3. Not long ago, I started a school program that required me to have a Mac. Now I own a MBP 15". The end result is that I won't be going back to PC for a long time. Even with the nice SP3 running the nice windows 10, there's just something about the MBP that just "works". No, it's not a night and day difference, but those few percentage points of more reliable, better cohesive, less buggy behaviour really goes a long way towards keeping me sane in a world of technology where something always seems to be wrong. MS is always annoying me too with always being late to the game and feeling the need to make their own version of this and that, and then abandoning it or drastically changing it because it doesn't catch on. All that said, I agree that the tides seem to be turning against Apple. Some of it does seem to be their own doing, and some of it just seems to be inevitable. Hats off to MS for a really cool new product. But, that said, I think Apple did something really cool with the new MBP as well with the touch strip. I think it's a fantastic idea and for someone who doesn't really like a full touchscreen - a real ingenious alternative. Anyway, yeah, I hate how the need for profits result in having to make a new model every year which must have new features, which are often not really helpful, and also can be a real pita for existing users as we have to update the OS, update different programs, buy dongles, etc. Bleh! 1 0 Dean Allman - October 30, 2016 Nice article. As an Apple shareholder, former Windows user, current Mac user (including a 3 year old MacBook Pro), I found this latest product announcement put me over the edge. For the first time in years I am worried about the direction Apple is going. I am sure people will buy the new MacBook Pro, but Apple has made this machine a lot harder to want to buy for many other users. How many USB-C devices are currently on the market? Smashing the status quo by abandoning the SD card, USB-3 and HDMI inputs, and the MagSafe connection, and raising prices, and giving us the TouchBar which may be nifty and sleek but has yet to prove it's utility, and not letting us even plug our iPhones into the damned thing, may make management feel like they are living up to their mantra, but for many of us we are simply wondering why they are going this way. It only seems to have the effect if decreasing the number of users who will want to upgrade their machines. Surely that is not the kind of "why" that Apple intended. . 0 0 John Deir - October 30, 2016 I do not agree with the concept of what, how, why. I believe that the PC is a tool and as such I use it to perform and complete a project. And that project can be different for every end user. Example: I need a hammer so I go to the hardware store and there's all types of hammers from finish, roofing, framing, furniture, demolition...and so on. I'll purchase a hammer for the purpose of the job at hand and may have several different type for other purposes intended. There are a few multi-use ones but none that cover all uses. Thus the same concept should be implemented with PC's: types for photographers, videographers, bloggers, musicians, designers, graphic artist, construction, architects... another words from the point of use and need with efficiency and purpose. Nowadays most PC's are developed/built to do this or that, but do not mix well with all the software and applications that the purchaser installs. If the PC is made specifically to function at its maximum related to the software recommended to perform with and different ones per a person's level of need then that to me would be innovative. Microsoft's latest Surface product is meeting that nich need. Apples is just adding revamped features upgrades that do not meet a specific need. I wished Adobe would come out with a PC unit which would work exclusively with their CC products. Think about it, a tool that works in the environment they create. 0 0 Mark James - October 30, 2016 I switched to a macpro a little over a year ago. I'm a photographer with a fairly standard work flow and I have never been able to get comfortable with the mac trying to take control of how I want to do things. I assumed it was just a learning curve and in a few months I'd be praising the glory of macs to everyone. That has not happened. Many things take to many extra steps and I find it frustrating. I also found the mac is just a big marketing tool and it is always trying to get me to spend more money an apple stuff. I hate marketing like that and refuse to be forced to use their stuff just because I have one product. Have you ever priced thunderbolt products!!!! I had to buy aftermarket SW just to sort my photos by date taken because none of the mac users I know in the graphic arts industry could show me how to do it. I needed yet another aftermarket program to get basic EXIF data from my images. The list go's on and on and I will go back to a more user friendly windows device at my next upgrade. Needless to say macs are not for everyone, but if you prefer to be lead and are a natural follower then it might be the right product for you. I personally prefer to have my equipment work the way I do and not the other way around. 0 0 Andre Goulet - October 31, 2016 Mark James This is so typical: each of the things you say you can't do on the Mac are readily available with the built-in tools. EXIF data is a right-click away, sorting photos by date can be done very easily in several places. You can even merge PDF's, fill out PDF's forms, resize photos, change their dpi, rotate them, etc, all with the built in tools. 1 0 Art Altman - October 31, 2016 I was disappointed in the new MacBook Pro until I tried it!!! Go to the Apple Store. They have the 13" with function keys on display now and soon the models with the OLED display replacing the function keys. The new MBP is much smaller than the old one. It looks and feels like a jewel. It feels right. I ordered the 15". :-) I am very curious about Windows but when I look at the best options (Surface pro maxed out) how different is the pricing relative to power really? Is Microsoft support as good as Apples? Is Windows as well integrated with iPhones (or Androids?). I have zero interest in a touch screen on a computer. Much prefer keyboard, mouse, track pad and soon a Wacom. Some months ago my current MacBook Pro stopped working at around 9pm on a weekday. I went to the 24 hour Apple Store, got it diagnosed, and walked out with a new one to use as a temporary by midnight. (Ok, how many cities have 24 hour Apple Stores like NYC, but still ....). I think that a lot of what we pay for in the price of the Apple is for service and high quality construction and design. I went to the Dell web site to check on their computers and yes, you can get similar power and features for $1000 less but even just navigating the web site was a pain in the butt and dealing with their "chat" person was agonizing. I have heard horror stories before about Dell support (please post here about your experience, I am curious, probably others as well). 0 0 Pages 1 2 next › last » Follow @Fstoppers Featured Products Fstoppers OriginalNew Architectural Photography Mike Kelley's Where Art Meets Architecture 2 Fstoppers OriginalNew Swimwear Photography Joey Wright: Swimwear Photography - Lighting, Posing, and Retouching Fstoppers OriginalNew Cityscape Photography Photographing the World: Cityscape, Astrophotography, and Advanced Post-Processing Fstoppers Original Lighting Peter Hurley: Illuminating The Face Support Fstoppers   Popular Articles How to Get Perfect Colors from Your Raw Files Straight Out of the Camera with Capture One Planning for the Shot of a Lifetime - Supermoon 2016 Photography Book Review of Landscape Artist Extraordinaire: Alexandre Deschaumes - Voyage Éthéré First Impressions of the Canon 16-35mm f/2.8 L III Tips and Tricks for Photographing Groups of Dogs Can the New MacBook Pro Handle 5K ProRes Video Editing at Ease?

Follow TechnoBuffalo The Apple hype machine got into full gear this week and left me feeling letdown. All we got was a MacBook Pro (which is nice) and an app on Apple TV called TV. So creative. Even if you don’t care about Apple, it was pretty disappointing. It came on the heels of Microsoft refreshing its Surface Book and introducing the Surface Studio—a crazy desktop with an adjustable hinge. This was a perfect opportunity for Apple to answer back resoundingly, but it didn’t. It seems that the dream of a “one more thing” surprise is just pie in the sky at this point. This is not to downplay how cool the new MacBook Pro and its Touch Bar are, but I was hoping (just like everyone else) Apple would have more than just one big announcement during its October event. Not everyone needs to buy or upgrade a laptop, some of us may be looking for something in a different product category. Nevertheless, we have to move forward and make due with the MacBook Pro and the Touch Bar for the time being. With that being said, I thought it’d be cool to take a look at the products Apple failed to update yesterday. The list is surprisingly long and includes products that should (cross your fingers) get an update within the next year. Who knows, if the rumors turn out to be true, Apple may give us a few more upgrades before the end of the year. Mac Pro Apple’s flagship power computer is very long in the tooth. The Mac Pro hasn’t been updated since its introduction in June 2013. In the tech space, that was a long time ago, and although it was a long shot, there was hope Apple would break the drought, but it was to no avail. Rumors are swirling that Apple might introduce a refresh in November, but until that happens, we’re stuck with a three and a half-year-old computer. iMac The iMac was upgraded last year, but it was mostly minor. This seemed like the perfect time for Apple to one-up the Surface Studio and throw the kitchen sink into its desktop computer and it didn’t happen. The iMac still has a beautiful 5K display and more than adequate specs, but it looks much less cool now that the Surface Studio impressed us with its crazy hinge and touch display. It’s up to Apple to answer back, but who knows when that’ll be. Cinema Display This is Apple’s most neglected product. The Cinema Display has been in dire need of an update for some time. It’s still sporting the old thick iMac design and missing a hig-res 5K display. Those additions didn’t arrive this week, and it looks like they’ll never arrive. Earlier this year, Apple discontinued its legacy Cinema Displays and it doesn’t look like their rushing to get a replacement out at all. Instead of updating its own display, Apple chose instead to partner with LG to create a 5K (and 4K) display. It’s time to read the writing on the wall—more likely than not, Apple is out of the display game. iPad Pro (12.9-inch) The bigger of the two iPad Pros was just introduced last year but was one-upped months later by its little brother. That was rather maddening because within a five-month window, a lot of features came to the smaller iPad Pro including the True Tone display with wide color gamut, 12MP camera capable of recording 4K and 5MP FaceTime camera. It’s been nearly a year since the 12.7-inch iPad Pro was released, and it still doesn’t have any of these features. You have to assume that at some point they will come to the bigger iPad Pro, but the bigger question is when? I don’t know, but it would have been great to see the upgrade at the latest Apple event. It seems that was the theme for the Apple event.

Follow TechnoBuffalo The search for the perfect PC is still ensuing, but no clear winner has been crowned. Apple and Microsoft introduced their next attempt to grasp the crown, and their efforts look like worthy choices, but we won’t know what they can do until we get our hands on those products. Deep in the weeds is Lenovo, which is one of the top PC-makers and has the liberty of embarking on this race with radical ideas, and its latest ultra-thin laptop might be the craziest idea yet. The Lenovo Yoga Book offers a thinner design than any of Apple’s laptops, including the MacBook which is just 1.31 cm thick. The Yoga Book is .96 cm thick and can run Android or Windows 10. The only catch is that you need to buy the model that supports each software, you can’t use both on the same laptop. Lenovo equipped the Yoga Book with an Intel Atom x5-Z8550 processor, Full HD display, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of onboard storage and a 8,500mAh battery. It also features the usual normal laptop tricks you already know such as touch display and a tablet mode when you fold it, but that’s just the beginning. The little laptop packs a secret feature that differentiates it from other competitors—the Halo Keyboard. Lenovo gave it a celestial name, but in reality, it’s just a touch keyboard with actual key symbols. The virtual nature eliminates switches and mechanical parts which enables the laptop to be so thin. Typing on this keyboard is certainly a new sensation, but not a very good one. It’ll be up to each individual to determine if this new keyboard is worth works for them. The Halo Keyboard also serves a dual purpose. The Yoga Book comes with a Create Pad and Book Pad, that coupled with the Real Pen can turn the laptop into your favorite notebook. The Create Pad is put atop the Halo Keyboard, and with the Real Pen can transcribe drawings you do on it to software within the Yoga Book. The Book Pad does the same but with written words. Lenovo’s latest crazy laptop also comes with its patented Watchband Hinge that lets you fully open up laptop from one end to the other. This computer is not meant to be a powerhouse, but more of a creative tool. It doesn’t boast crazy amounts of RAM, but it is enough to do that job and its price point only cements that idea. The Lenovo Yoga Book runs $499 for the Android version and $549 for the Windows 10 iteration. For a complete review of the Lenovo Yoga Book, check out Ron’s video above who tested the computer for a week.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     MacBook Pro Touch Bar Pro Runs EOS, A Variant Of WatchOS Posted: Oct 29 2016, 1:55pm CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Apple     The 2016 MacBook Pro is finally out. The general public opinion and analyst view may vary. But Apple thinks Touch bar is definitely the right way to introduce Touch on a PC and this inclusion is here to stay. Don't Miss: Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals When a new hardware or software is usually announced individuals with technical knowledge dig in deep to see what they can find out. This is what Steve-troughton smith has done too. He has discovered that Apple’s Touch bar is powered by variant of the SoC which is also used in the Apple watch. Granted, the ‘watchOS’ the T1 runs is presumably only ‘watchOS’ by dint of the CPU it’s designed for. T1 must be very similar to S1— Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) October 28, 2016 Apple calls it the T1 chip. Steve has also found out that the T1 chip that Apple mentioned on October 27 seems to run off a disk image. This disk image is a direct descendent of the watchOS. watchOS was the operating system used for the Apple Watch. In addition, it also seems like Apple has christened the operating system powering the T1 chip as eOS. This may be a reference to the fact that the eOS is a true operating system incorporated into the macOS to power the Touch bar specifically. Troughton Smith Steve gave information in his tweet. It is pretty obvious that Apple did not wish to go into such details at its media event. However Apple was well sure it will be only a matter of time before someone dug deep enough o extract this information.

(AP) — All of Minnesota's 201 legislators are on the ballot on Election Day, but the fight for control of the Legislature won't be spread evenly across the state. The fight is taking shape in suburbs like Apple Valley, one of several Republican-held districts that Democrats are targeting in their quest to win back control of the House. In the Senate, a Republican challenger's campaign to defeat the incumbent Democrat in rural southeastern Minnesota will be pivotal for the GOP. Democratic House candidate Erin Maye Quade says she's undaunted by all the outside attention to her Apple Valley race. Her Republican opponent, Ali Jimenez-Hopper, says focus is keeping her going. Democrats need to win seven seats to regain control of the House. Republicans need six seats to win control of the Senate.

As far as Microsoft’s VP of Surface Marketing is concerned, the Touch Bar that Apple has added to these new models is just the first step towards a touch-capable MacBook. Touch and detachable MacBook coming In a series of tweets posted a few hours ago, Brian Hall explains that he’s 100 percent sure that Apple will make a MacBook with touch display at some point in the future and there are 95 percent chances that this screen would be detachable. “I've had a day to think. officially am calling it. 100% Apple is making touchscreen mac, 95% detachable.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Sharp exec confirms iPhone 8 will have curved OLED screen & all-glass design By Christian Zibreg, Oct 29, 2016 Tweet 55 Comments Sharp President Tai Jeng-wu—who is also a high-profile executive at Foxconn, Sharp’s parent company and Apple’s favorite contract manufacturer—said publicly that Apple’s next iPhone will use a curved screen based on organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology akin to that on Samsung’s Galaxy S7 smartphone, Nikkei reported Saturday. As you know, Apple currently uses OLED screens on the Apple Watch and the new MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar. All iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices to date have used traditional LCD screens. Here’s what Tai told students at Tatung University, his alma mater: The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS (low-temperature poly-silicon) to OLED panels. We don’t know whether Apple’s OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn’t walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity. Sharp is one of the several suppliers of LCDs for Apple products. At present, however, the Japanese company has very limited OLED production capabilities. According to Tai, Sharp could even build OLEDs in U.S. if Apple asked it to. “We are now building a new OLED facility in Japan. We can make OLED panels in the U.S. too,” he said. “If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?” Tai was appointed President and CEO of Sharp in August after Foxconn finalized its purchase of the century-old Japanese consumer electronics corporation. He is a close associate of Foxconn CEO Terry Gou. Nikkei said in August Apple would launch three iPhones in 2017—speculating that only a premium model would have an OLED screen and all-glass design. A recent Nikkei report clarified that all iPhone 8 models may use an all-glass chassis with a metal frame after all, but insisted there would be three new iPhones next year. “As part of Apple’s overhaul efforts, all three products will reportedly sport a glass cover and back joined together by a metal frame, a departure from the metal casing of previous versions of the device,” reads today’s Nikkei report. AppleInsider rebuffed Nikkei’s claim of a new five-inch iPhone model launching in 2017, saying there would be two flagship phones next year, one with a screen measuring 4.7 inches diagonally and the other with a 5.5-inch screen. Taiwanese media said Apple’s switch to OLED or AMOLED technology for the Tenth Anniversary iPhone may be short-lived because the company has been researching even more power efficient and brighter Micro-LED panels for iPhones. As we explained, Micro-LEDs could improve the iPhone’s battery power by a significant margin while helping boost screen resolution, improve color gamut and provide two to three times the brightness of OLED technology under the same power consumption. Apple in May 2014 acquired Micro-LED developer and semiconductor maker LuxVue Technology, adding its talent to its own hardware innovations team.

They started it with the V10. siddique Touch bar will be for special function like short cuts and one handed use features ..mark my words YaBoyLilMayo Yall don’t know how to take a joke on this site….so take this L Sohail Wahab OLED screen sounds cool but losing that crazy gorgeous aluminum back would hurt like hell. Picapollo So true Leslie Bee Unless they replace it with a crazy gorgeous glass back. Tommy Use an aluminum back cover/case. You’re gonna use a case anyways so this time get an aluminum one. Rowan09 Well if according to reports OLED is temporary until Microleds are ready. :D Won’t he get into trouble for leaking that info? Storm Well, it sounds like he’s violated an NDA, so yes. Franklin Richards So much for Tim Cook doubling down on leaks. Apple’s secrets are pouring out like a broken tap. Prasoon Singh At least we know it will have an OLED display. That’s all I care about. 5723alex . Hope Apple won’t use the horrible OLED. Rowan09 Horrible OLED? 5723alex . Yes. Look at the washed, green turn to brown, over saturated… colors on a Samsung Galaxy. Mike Apparently you haven’t seen the Galaxy screens before. jOn Garrett lol, clearly he hasn’t. Storm Doesn’t the Sharp president only say that the next iPhone will use an OLED display? The quote attributed to him doesn’t mention a curved-glass or all-glass form factor, which makes the headline misleading. Jayy Bring on oled, but I’m not sure how I feel about a completely glass phone. My iPhone 4 was all glass. Mike M. Powell Already huh, did he also say we’re getting 512Gb storage and 8gb ram now to? .-. therealjjohnson So once my screen curves…then what? Tommy You can do cool stuff like on the S7 therealjjohnson What are those cool things? I don’t see a need for it beside it being different. Can you give me an example? rockdude094 I mainly use the edge to get to shortcuts and widgets. While the screen is off you can gesture on the edge to give you instant information like weather, notifications and news. if the phone is laid down on its face the edge turns into a massive notification light with a waves pattern with specific lighting tariq I use it for quick SMS or call. Also wallpapers with glowing edges look amazing on the curves Muhammad Faraz Khan Also one can shove it in their ass easily with a curved edge. 😉 jOn Garrett I use the edge for the night clock. My wife works nights and I have 2 kids so throughout the night I roll over to look at my phone. The edge plus lock screen notifications let’s me do everything without even touching the phone. These things plus the benefit of having it on a charging pad means I can pick up my phone and put it back down without fusing with a charging cable in the dark. hkgsulphate RIP Sharp Jeffrey Question. Can a Retina screen be OLED? Because I’m sure Apple called the Touch Bar in the new MacBooks ‘Retina’. george Yes Anonymous It look like the board is gonna fire that ceo. lol especially if they lose the apple contract because of it. Lol. What was he thinking! tariq Tim Cook is complete trash. Anonymous Lol that why he’s the ceo of the most profitable company in history and currently. tariq he is only ceo cuz Steve Jobs is gone. Tim cook is just money hungry… Tim is just a flaw in the system Anonymous Nhaw, steve is given all the credit, cook has created the far better company, steve just planeted the seed. tariq I agree to disagree Anonymous Okay, i wont push it anymore. Can i ask why you commented on my comment about tim cook being trash though? tariq i read the first sentence and thought u were saying “Ceo” as in “Tim Cook ” is gonna get fired. so i was just agreeing that he should get fired lol. turns out you werent talking about him so we ended at a disagreement. But youre the first person i know that supports Tim Cook (just fyi). Anonymous Oh i know alot of apple lovers love steve over tim. Lol i ger yelled at alot for that here at idb. Its not that i think steve was a bad ceo though. He was not, but i do think tim has done better. But yes your right i was talking about sharpes ceo. tariq I was looking at alternatives for Macs. Seems like everyone else is using type-c and ditching other ports. Maybe this is how things are going to look in 2017 Leslie Bee So we no longer get to hear Jony Ive say “aluminium” anymore?!! BTW, in the U.S. it’s spelled and pronounced “aluminum”. Prasoon Singh I’ve never truly experienced an OLED display before. The iPhone 8 will be my first device with it. jOn Garrett You won’t be disappointed. rockdude094 That would explain why the there is a little space left beside the control centre’s edges. Seems as if the whole os is prepping to integrate curved edges in the next generation iPhone tariq The back of the phone doesn’t matter. Everyone will have cases anyways. Especial apple users.. Ya be having otter boxes lol george So stupid.. another year of slippery phones. The King iPhone 8 or iPhone 7S? Or is the 7S going to be called the 8? I skipped both the 6S and 7 after I got my Edge. I miss iOS a lot, but since the 6, I haven’t seen much change and going back from an edge screen to a iPhone screen is so noticeable. Dao Sasone Lets see if Apple will implement vr with micro led. jOn Garrett All glass curved AMOLED display with wireless charging water and dust resistance.

AfterDawn > News > This is the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar This is the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Written by Matti Vähäkainu (Google+) @ 29 Oct 2016 14:00 User comments (8) Apple unveiled this week the next generation MacBook Pro. As you might imagine it is more smaller, thinner, lighter and more powerful than ever before. It also has one completely new feature, the Touch Bar. Apple celebrated the 25th anniversary of their first notebook by releasing a new MacBook. The new MacBook Pro comes in 13-inch and 15-inch variants with lots of customizability as expected. One thing that separates the cheapest 13-inch version from the other is that there is no Touch Bar in it. But what is Touch Bar? The Apple's new groundbreaking feature is a touch screen above the updated keyboard with new flatter butterfly mechanism keys. The Touch Bar replaces the old function keys – which are still available on the Touch Bar by pressing the function button – and shows different functionality depending on the application and even inside the applications. For example, in Safari the Touch Bar can show bookmarks, open tabs or quick links to most used features. In Mail app the Touch Bar shows for example CC suggestions or autocomplete depending what you are doing. The software developers can obviously use Touch Bar in their own way to make the application more intuitive. On the right edge of the Touch Bar there's a expandable quick links list to most used system settings, such as brightness and volume. You can customize what to show straight from the system settings from where you drop them to the Touch Bar. On the right side of the Touch Bar you can find Touch ID which makes it debut on MacBook as well allowing easier online payment and login. The 13-inch MacBook Pro is available starting at $1499 with old function buttons, and starting $1799 with TouchBar. The 15-inch MacBook Pro starts at $2399 and features always the Touch Bar.

Any improvements on the specs make it a must have, touch bar or not. 330.10.2016 8:55 Ryoohki Send private message to this user Member Having a touch bar instead of a full touch screen is absolute garbage. I have a macbook pro that i bought late 2015. Damn thing cost me 3k (with apple care). Needless to say, it will be quite some time before I consider buying a newer model. The new version isn't compelling enough for me to even be slightly interested. I would have a windows laptop but I needed to be able to run xcode for some app programming. Comparing models with similar specs between win/lin/mac devices, the prices were very close so it just made more sense to get the macbook pro and dual boot windows vs getting another device and go through the hassle of turning it into a hackintosh. 430.10.2016 21:54 xnonsuchx Send private message to this user Senior Member At least they still sell one of the older models with useful ports built-in! ;-) I wouldn't get the basic MacBook unless it at least had a USB-C port on each side. And like the iPhone 7 'normal' headphone adapter being included, for the price of the units, all the MacBooks should at least come with a few basic adapters (minimum, a USB-C to dual USB 3.0 one). I'll be happy with my mid-2014 13" MacBook Pro w/ Retina Display for quite some time. CPUs haven't been getting that much greater the past few years, so it's going to be sufficient for anything I need it for until it probably has some major malfunction. 51.11.2016 15:54 Bozobub Send private message to this user Senior Member Originally posted by Rezer: Macbook Pros are incredible devices, though.

And yes, we do have Macs because of that. However, we have never paid full price and have bought all of our computers used or refurbished. 73.11.2016 5:00 megadunderhead Send private message to this user Senior Member Actually did you guys hear about there bug.

(AP Photo/Paul Sakuma) Share Written by Mike Murphy October 29, 2016 This past week, Apple spent 82 minutes unveiling a new app, a computer screen made by another company, and three laptops with the same name. They weren’t exactly the major overhauls that many were hoping for, and the event comes not too long after the company released a new iPhone that looked much like the last two it put out, and its other notable innovations of late have been making its products in different sizes and unleashing a sea of dongles on the world. In an old interview that’s making the rounds online today, former CEO Steve Jobs explained, in his mind why companies like Xerox, a company that once had one of the most innovative research labs in the world, failed. He compared the product cycles and the corporate structures of strong, stable consumer brands, such as PepsiCo, which John Sculley, the CEO that once replaced him at Apple, previously ran. “If you were a product person, you couldn’t change the course of that company very much,” Jobs said. “So who influenced the success of PepsiCo? The sales and marketing people—they were the ones that got promoted, they were the ones that ran the company. ” Jobs then added: “It turns out the same thing can happen at technology companies that get monopolies. If you’re a product person at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copier or a better computer, so what? When you have a monopoly market share, the company’s not any more successful.”   steve jobs talking about what happens when the marketing/sales people take over from a 'product' founder is… eerie pic.twitter.com/LQgpaZ6OyU — Owen ⚡️ (@ow) October 29, 2016 Apple doesn’t technically have a monopoly on smartphones or laptop computers or the other categories of products it produces. But its extremely high prices for things such as add-on iPhone and MacBook memory attest to the market power it has over consumers. And its notoriously rapturous marketing-speak about upgrades that merely bring its products up to par with competitors is wearing thin with its critics. Then there’s this Jobs critique of other tech companies that resonates with those critics today: “The product genius that brought them to that monopolistic position gets rotted out,” Jobs said. “The companies forget what it means to make great products.” While Jobs was explaining why he thought old tech giants had fallen from grace, he probably wasn’t thinking about Apple at that time. It’s unclear when this video was shot, but given that there appears to be a NeXT logo behind him—the logo of the computer company he founded after getting ousted from Apple in 1985—it’s likely from before his return to Apple in 1996. It’s also unclear whether he was thinking about working on a device that could fit 1,000 songs in your pocket, an industry-defining smartphone, or any other device that has made Apple one of the most valuable companies in the world, and a company that has started to make a habit out of small iterations on past successes.

Apple just took the wraps off of its brand new 2016 MacBook Pro models, and the new Touch Bar feature is just as cool as we hoped it would be. A long OLED touchscreen replaces the top row of function keys on the new MacBook Pro’s keyboard and it dynamically changes based on your needs in the current app. So in Messages it might show Quick Type word predictions or emoji, and in Photoshop it might show image cropping tools. Of course, there is one big downside to Apple’s new MacBook Pro models: they’re expensive. But guess what — despite the fact that Apple just announced them and they’re not even shipping yet, Amazon has already discounted Apple’s entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro and the new high-end 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, and you can order them right now. Amazon’s pricing is already well below Apple’s full retail prices, less than one day after the new MacBook Pro models were announced. Thanks to the current sale, users can get the entry-level MacBook Pro 2016 model, which does not include the new Touch Bar or Touch ID, for $1,299 in silver or for just $1,139.92 in space gray. This model starts at $1,499 on Apple’s website, so that’s a savings of as much as $360. Moving up to the high-end 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar model, which obviously includes the Touch Bar and a Touch ID fingerprint scanner, Amazon is offering the shiny new laptop for $1,799, which is $200 off Apple’s $1,999 retail price. You’ll find specs for both models below, and orders are expected to begin shipping in the coming weeks.

How much will she use it? [video] Friday Oct 28, 2016 at 2:31 PM Hayley Tsukayama - The Washington Post Two seconds into using Apple's Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro, and I'm in love. The new touch-sensitive control bar, a second display that will display different controls based on the program you're using, is silky smooth, beautiful to behold and incredibly easy to use. What I'm not at all sure about, however, is how much I'll love the control bar once it's no longer in front of me. There are two models with the Touch Bar, a 13-inch and a 15-inch one, which cost at least $300 more than the model without it. (The Touch Bar itself isn't the only difference; the more expensive models also have better processors, more ports and other upgrades.) When you're in front of these machines, it's hard not to be wowed. Both are impressive to look at, with their huge trackpads and bright screens. Both have Touch ID's fingerprint sensor built into the power button, which works as snappily as on the iPhone. Apple also provided me with a 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar to review, and I found the keyboard very pleasant to type on. I use a 12-inch MacBook myself as my usual laptop, and found that I liked the keyboard on the new MacBook Pro much better than on my own machine. Both use the same, slimmer "butterfly" technology that Apple introduced with the MacBook in 2015, which cuts down on bulk but can also feel too shallow to some users. Apple improved the design on the MacBook Pro by making the keys feel like they're traveling a little more deeply into the keyboard. Even in the short time I've had the computer, it feels more powerful and impressive than its predecessors. If you're upgrading from an older MacBook Pro, this will feel like an upgrade: the screen is brighter, the performance is noticeably better and the computers themselves are lighter. Not bad, as a total package. But the focus of this new line really is the Touch Bar. It changes depending on what program you're using. For example, if you're using Safari, the bar may feature your favorite sites. I have nothing bad to say about it - apart from the fact that it may require some creative ergonomics to use comfortably. The display on the Touch Bar is impressive, particularly when showing off color much more vibrantly than you'd expect from that tiny strip. Apple's made it easy and intuitive to customize. I'm a person who likes physical, clicky buttons, but even I have to admit that the added functionality of the adaptable software controls on the Touch Bar is intriguing. Not all of the Touch Bar controls are necessarily time-savers. For example, some observers of Thursday's event remarked that the Touch Bar adds steps in Photoshop. But some of the controls do save you having to go through annoying drop-down menus, instead putting them at your fingertips. Being able to customize the Touch Bar is a huge perk for often-used functions. For example, if you have an abnormal devotion to flagging messages, or if you're an "Archive" person instead of a "Trash" person in Mail (or vice-versa) you can add those quick shortcuts right to your keyboard through the Touch Bar. In other programs, it gives you finer, more visceral control - you can slide through a spectrum to get just the right shade in Photos, or hit just the right decibel level in iTunes without making your finger do a jackhammer impression on your volume keys. And, in any case, the Touch Bar controls are about intuition - not necessarily about saving time for power users who've memorized all of the keyboard shortcuts, but for making various features more available to the average user. With zero training, I knew exactly how to use the Touch Bar. That's not nothing. So, in a vacuum, these are really exciting and excellent computers. In the real world, they are still excellent - but there are other things to consider. Price is a big one. The MacBook Pro line has always been Apple's premium line, and that's never been more apparent. The new entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar is $1,500. If you want the Touch Bar, you have to pay at least $1800. If you wanted, you could spend about $4800 on a fully tricked-out 15-inch MacBook Pro with all the bells, whistles and software that Apple offers. That's not insignificant. There's also the fact that Apple is really pushing its users into new technology - which means we're going to have a transition period here. While the MacBook Pro fixes one of users' greatest laments about the MacBook - the MacBook has a single USB-C port; the new MacBook Pros have four - people will still need to use adapters for most of their accessories. Which, quite frankly, can be annoying. I personally have forgotten adapters on business trips before, making my job unnecessarily harder. (In my case, I need an adapter for my digital voice recorder. Your mileage may vary.) That problem won't last forever; USB-C is likely to become the new standard. But that isn't the case now, and prospective buyers should know they're going to have to wait for an adapter-free existence. Transition periods can be annoying like that. Even the Touch Bar itself, while an intriguing addition that gives an honestly wonderful experience, will take some time to get used to. And if developers other than Apple don't embrace the technology and add some tricks of their own, a worst-case scenario could see the Touch Bar going down in history as a great missed opportunity: a piece of tech that was interesting, but never lived up to its full potential. That grim picture of the Touch Bar's future is not a prediction, by any means. It could easily become second nature to swipe, tap and slide at the top of my keyboard. I sort of hope it does, because it's a lot of fun in the demos. But it will take me - and, likely, most other Mac users - some time to figure out just how to make the Touch Bar personally useful to justify the MacBook Pro's price tag for all but the most faithful Mac users. That hurdle may prove a hard one for Apple to overcome, and it will have to make a strong case to users and developers to get all of us to jump it. --- < Author Information:   Hayley Tsukayama covers consumer technology for The Washington Post. @htsuka Washington Post Bio Download Mugshot More stories by Hayley Tsukayama About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services Reader Services Subscriptions Subscriber Controls Contact Us Submissions Photos Events Letter to the Editor Corrections Announcements Obits Story Ideas Alerts Email Alerts RSS Feeds Text Alerts Advertise Media Kit Products & Services Ad Rates Advertising Contacts Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

"The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS (low-temperature poly-silicon) to OLED panels," Tai told students at Tatung University, his alma mater, during a ceremony in which he was awarded an honorary doctorate degree. "We don't know whether Apple's OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn't walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity," Tai said. Sharp current has limited OLED production capabilities but is looking to expand and likely capture orders for future iPhones. "We are now building a new [OLED] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels] in the U.S. too," he said. "If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?" Nikkei previously reported that Apple was preparing three new iPhone models for next year with only the premium 5.5-inch handset getting a curved OLED display. The three models are all expected to feature glass backs. Click here for more details. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

With the goal of building or designing its own Apple-branded autonomous vehicle all but buried, the Industry Focus guys discuss what it might do on the automotive front instead. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 29, 2016 at 12:01PM Interest in the elusive Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) car finally seems to be grinding to a halt. In the wake of the never-to-be project, Motley Fool analyst Sean O'Reilly and senior auto specialist John Rosevear talk about how Apple might be looking to get into autonomous driving technology instead, a few problems they might run into if they do, and whether or not shelving the car project was the right thing to do. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 20, 2016. Sean O'Reilly: Mr. Rosevear, what is Apple going to do if they're not going to throw $200 billion at building a car? John Rosevear: Well, it would probably only take about $15 billion. O'Reilly: Oh, well, sorry. (laughs) Rosevear: Bloomberg reported that Apple has refocused Project Titan on the idea of developing an autonomous driving system, an Apple-branded autonomous driving system. This would allow Apple to either partner with an existing automaker, or at some point in the future, if it looks good, to go back to building their own car. So here's a problem with that. Everybody else is already attacking that problem, and they're already well along. We've talked about this on past podcasts. Ford (NYSE:F) says it will be mass-producing fully Level 5 self-driving cars, no steering wheel, for ride-hailing services by 2021. That's a little over four years out. Delphi (NYSE:DLPH) and Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) -- we talked about this, too -- they will have a full self-driving system that will be available to any automaker in 2019 ... O'Reilly: I'm going to build my own in my garage. Just kidding. Rosevear: Yeah, good luck getting the Feds to approve it. (laughs) There is that guy, I don't recall his name, who has built one in his garage, who says, "Mobileye blah blah blah." But, it's one thing to build something in your garage that mostly sort of works. It's another thing ... O'Reilly: To mass-produce something that works. Rosevear: Right, that passes an automaker's tests for "this will be perfect for 200,000 miles." And it's not just the traditional automakers. NVIDIA in this, Baidu's in this, Uber is throwing a lot of money in, they want their own system, self-driving vehicles are a key to their business model in the future -- O'Reilly: We have the Volvos in Pittsburgh. Rosevear: Yeah, the Volvos and the Fords. They're all making huge investments. Just last night, Tesla came out and said, "We're going to start shipping our cars with available hardware that will enable fully self-driving software when we have it done," which is sometime, they hope, in the next year and a half or so, if they can get it past the regulators. Why would any of them need Apple? You might see a little company -- we've talked about this before, too -- the companies that might be natural customers for the Delphi-Mobileye effort, the smaller companies that maybe don't have the $1 [billion] to $2 billion to blast into this, companies like Subaru or Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU), some of the Chinese automakers. O'Reilly: Let me ask you -- correct me if I'm wrong: It almost seems like if Apple wanted to do this, they should have done it five years ago. Rosevear: Yeah. There's another problem in this whole thing, too, and that's the problem that [Alphabet's] Google has bumped up against -- the automakers may not want Apple. I've talked to senior executives at some of the other companies. They know what happened in the phone business. They don't want to be making "dumb cars," like dumb phones, the self-driving equivalent of Android. They don't want to be HTC or whatever. They don't want that situation. They're mindful of that. O'Reilly: You mean they don't want to break even at best? John?! Rosevear: It's hard enough to make money in the car business, give me a break! (laughs) And, they don't want to give up control of the data, too. They know: You partner with Google, Google wants the data. Google will monetize the data. You're just a box the data is being collected from. They aren't going there. There have been hints. About a year ago, Google and Ford were reported to be in close conversations. Those talks reportedly broke down. Nobody officially ever said anything. There have been some hints that Ford said, "We're not giving you the data," and Google said, "Then we can't do business." It was all very mindful of the phone example. Like I said, there might be an opportunity with some company. [Fiat Chrysler Automobiles] is the one we always point to because they have a ton of debt and they're scrambling to keep the basics going. They might be willing to compromise to come in here. But then, Apple is in a position where, what is it offering that is special? Because, they're going to be competing with the Delphi-Mobileye effort, probably others, maybe Google even trying to get in here to offer the prefab solution to some automakers. What are they going to do that's special? This is the interesting question. O'Reilly: It sounds like they're making the right decision here, unfortunately. Rosevear: Yeah. Again, it comes down to the question. There are things Apple does really better than anyone else. When it crafts a special, gotta-have project with that Apple magic, it's a lot about user interface, it's a lot about how it works seamlessly with other devices, it's a lot about how it anticipates the user's needs. How to translate that to an automobile, I think, it's a question that they may be haven't answered yet. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) NEW YORK—Apple isn’t the first to add GPS functionality to a smartwatch, but it’s the first to make something that feels like a running watch. And the company is doubling down on that with a Nike edition out Friday, while Nike is bringing features from its phone app directly to all models of Apple Watch. Related Coverage Smartwatches Best Swiss Watches for the First Time in 2015 How We Went From Sundials to Smartwatches Soon Smartwatches Will Listen to Your Body to Work Out How You’re Feeling I’ve found devices without GPS typically awful at measuring how fast and how far I’m running. And those with GPS typically do little more than measure how fast and how far I’m running. The basics are great for casual runners, but anyone who becomes a serious runner needs much more. I’ve logged more than 400 miles over the past six weeks with the GPS edition of Apple Watch, known as Series 2. I’ve also run 34 miles with the Nike Plus version over the past few days; it’s essentially a Series 2 watch with a custom wristband and watch face. With both, Apple addressed many of the shortcomings in the original watch, GPS being just one of them. I’m not ready to ditch my Garmin running watch yet, but the Apple Watch comes close to meeting all my needs. The Importance of GPS The original watch does a fine job of latching onto your phone’s GPS if you’re running with the phone, but with built-in GPS, you can leave the phone behind. Accuracy is on par with other good GPS watches, which is to say, measurements are sometimes off, especially when tall buildings block GPS signals. The watch automatically calibrates to my running style, so it’s better than non-GPS devices even when there’s no GPS. Though GPS drains the battery more quickly, the watch still had about an hour of non-GPS use left after a marathon run of about four hours, 40 minutes. For normal use, Apple says you should get up to 90 minutes a day of GPS workouts; I’ve often gone longer without the watch dying before bedtime. It helps that I’ve disabled the heart-rate sensor during workouts. While Series 2 is meant for stand-alone running, many people carry phones anyway. With it, I get slightly better accuracy and battery life. Improvements for All Series 2 watches start at $369, though it’s $30 more for a larger screen — the optimal size for larger wrists. Non-GPS models, now called Series 1, are $100 less. All models get software updates that address two gripes with the original: — Apple’s Workout app now records your route, something other GPS fitness devices and apps have long done. The Apple app didn’t use to, even with access to the phone’s GPS. — You can double tap the screen to record splits, or manual snapshots of how long it takes to run a stretch. Before, that was limited to mile or kilometer intervals, which didn’t help when you were running laps or loops that weren’t precisely that length. Nike Extras Nike’s app offers a lot to like, including big yellow numerals for easy reading during runs and voice updates every mile and halfway toward your goal. Nike keeps things simple for beginners by displaying just distance and time; turn on advanced mode for current pace and heart rate. My gripes: no manual splits, and average pace appears only when pausing or through the voice updates. Nike excels in trying to motivate you even when you’re not running. It will keep asking “Are we running today?” by reminding you the weather is nice or that a friend (with a watch or just the phone app) is just ahead of you for the month’s total. A scheduling feature shows you weather forecasts in half-hour increments. After making a selection, you get a notification when it’s time to run. Though the app is available for all models, the Nike watch also has a colorful wristband sporting holes to help sweat dry. It offers custom watch faces with one-touch access to the app, plus a reminder of your next scheduled run. Most people will be fine with just the free app, but running enthusiasts can get the Nike version for the same price. Beyond Running Cyclists get similar speed and distance information, though the watch doesn’t measure how fast you’re pedaling, something hard-core cyclists might want. You can swim with Series 2, even with chlorinated or salt water, something most water-resistant gadgets don’t allow. The watch measures distance indoors by counting laps, though you need a pool large enough for at least five strokes per lap. What’s Still Missing Recording splits during runs is great, but I also want to know my average pace and time since the last split, rather than the beginning of the run. I find it useful when I want to go faster in the middle of a run before a gentle cooldown. And while Apple Watch syncs workout data with the phone’s Activity app, many long-time runners already have their favorite online repository, whether that’s Nike, Strava or Garmin. The ability to move data around is limited. While Nike offers an Apple Watch app, it’ll take time for others to catch up. Strava’s still requires running with a phone, while Garmin doesn’t have one at all. For these reasons, I’m sticking with my Garmin Forerunner 220. And while it’s a minor annoyance, both Apple’s and Nike’s app do a three-second countdown before workouts. I just want to run when I hit “start.” (At least with Nike’s, you can disable the countdown deep in the phone settings.) Do You Need Apple Watch? Because this review is focused on runners’ needs, I haven’t gotten into all the other features, such as maps, weather and shopping. Running watches and general-purpose fitness trackers such as Fitbit don’t offer as much. The ability to reply to messages by voice came in handy when coordinating with friends waiting at the finish line, for instance. But if you don’t need the “smarts,” a decent GPS fitness device is more than $100 cheaper.

Apple, Microsoft, and the Coolest Kid in Tech GO The new Microsoft is the old Apple and the new Apple is the old Microsoft; Redmond's stealing Cupertino's cool factor Oct 29, 2016 15:01 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Apple is no longer cool. I know, this is certainly one very risky way of starting an editorial and there are many Apple fanboys out there who’d want to discuss the matter in private with my relatives, but this is exactly why I and so many other tech watchers out there seem to believe after this super-busy week. Let’s rewind a bit first. On October 26, Microsoft held its Windows 10 event where it discussed things like the future of its operating system and introduced new hardware, such as the Surface Book Performance Base and the all-new Surface Studio PC. Redmond’s press conference was full of announcements, although some of them were of less interest for consumers (but this the direction where the company is heading) and several high-profile executives took the stage to discuss and detail what’s to come for Microsoft products (by the way, has anyone noticed that there were more female executives on stage than male? Quite a neat way to tackle gender discrimination accusations after all the scandals). Without a doubt, the star of the show was the Surface Studio, which was introduced by none other than Panos Panay, a man who loves Surface so much that it’s fascinating to listen to him describing new models (which he always refers to as “the product”). Panos admitted that the Surface Studio might look familiar (hint at the resemblance with the Apple iMac), but promised that it’d feel entirely different. And by the looks of things, this is exactly what is happening. The Surface Studio is an All-in-One PC that comes with a built-in Zero Gravity hinge that makes it just perfect for drawing and writing and boasts features such as i7 processors, 32 GB RAM, 2TB storage, and a 28-inch Perspective Pixel screen with touch support. Microsoft’s event was a celebration of new hardware and software, and although there were some boring moments here and there, it was definitely worth watching. Moving over to Apple, Cupertino had its own event planned for October 27. I’m not sure that Apple wanted its press conference to be exactly one day after Microsoft’s, but if it did, whoever made the decision probably regrets it. Apple’s event was all about the new MacBooks, as Cupertino refreshed its laptop lineup with hardware upgrades and new features such as the Touch Bar, more powerful speakers, and little things that few people care about actually. The conference unfolded like pretty much any recent Apple unveiling and it was fairly boring most of the time, with the introduction of the new MacBook generating less enthusiasm in the tech world, pretty much because we already knew most about it thanks to leaks that surfaced recently. Furthermore, the hardware upgrades that Apple introduced on the upgraded MacBook series are nothing to be excited about, as they only bring the devices in line with today’s laptops. The Touch Bar is indeed a neat addition, but this simply can’t be reason enough to pay more than $4,000 for a new laptop. Because yes, that’s how much you have to pay for the top-of-the-range MacBook Pro with a 15-inch screen, as the best the company has to offer right now reaches $4,299 - compare this to the Surface Studio PC, which comes with a bigger screen, touch screens, Pen support and so many others and is available for $4,199 and you get the point. Apple products remain extremely expensive even if they don't bring much over the competition. In essence, the MacBook press event was very similar to the iPhone 7 unveiling in September. Apple introduced upgraded models in both cases, but only with features that somehow make sense. In the case of the iPhone 7, the new CPU and RAM upgrade on the Plus, as well as the new storage options, were absolutely mandatory to stay close to competition. And in the case of the MacBooks, new processors, bigger batteries, and improved displays are things that every manufacturer offers on new products. The point here is that Apple is no longer surprising, pretty much because it lost its power of innovation. Apple no longer takes you by surprise with features that you never imagined, but only with dull upgrades that just make sense and nothing more. Apple is no longer cool. I know, I’m playing with fire here, but I’ll say it again. Apple is no longer cool. If we look at the bigger picture, Apple has become the old Microsoft. And the new Microsoft has become the old Apple. Microsoft is right now exactly what Apple represented a few years ago when it brought new technologies to the market. This is what made it so “cool” and helped it become the most innovative company in the world. But it now lost its cool factor and the declining sales are just living proof. In the case of Microsoft, CEO Satya Nadella seems to be the right man at the right time. Under his guidance, Microsoft is truly inventing new categories, a thing that the company has bragged about so many times. But it’s true, so why not saying it on every occasion? Just look at the Surface. There was a time when no one believed in it and Apple’s CEO Tim Cook himself made fun of it, claiming that putting a keyboard on a tablet is like mixing a toaster and a refrigerator. Fast forward a few years later and here’s Apple launching the iPad Pro, its own tablet with a detachable keyboard that’s essentially its version of the Microsoft Surface. Apple has never been interested in a stylus, and Steve Jobs himself wasn’t a big fan of this little accessory. Microsoft, on the other hand, invested billions of dollars into releasing the Surface Pen and improving it with every generation and now it has become an essential tool on 2-in-1 devices. Apple launched its own Pencil last year, once again a few years after Microsoft. In the end, it’s pretty obvious that Apple is no longer the innovator, but the follower. And the dropping iPhone sales are just the living proof. In the meantime, Microsoft is improving in a way that nobody ever imagined, and it’s all just because they are listening to customers. Yep, that’s true, the new Microsoft is really listening to customers, even though there are departments where they still need to do better, as is the case of mobile. But they’re on the right path here, there’s no doubt about it. The worst thing for Cupertino, however, is that without innovations, there’ll be a time when its products will no longer sell just because they bear the Apple logo. The Apple brand appeal is dropping, and it’s all because of a single reason. And I’ll say it again for the last time. Apple is no longer cool.

But Apple also gave plenty of stage time to the Apple TV’s new TV app. (And, no, we’re not overly keen on these brutally generic app names either.) Having boldly claimed last year that the future of television was here and that said future was apps (with existing app-centric telly device makers presumably receiving said news in bemused fashion), Apple’s seemingly banking on a single app to be the hub of your viewing habits. The snag: it’ll be US-only upon launch in December. And the thing is, I don’t care. Convenience factor It’s not that it's not a good premise. We’re all sick of bouncing between several telly apps, regardless of the device we’re using. Digital was supposed to make things simpler. Instead, our favourite shows remain chained to individual apps. Want to watch the latest Mr Robot, Walking Dead, Stranger Things, or some other fantastic telly? Best remember where to find it, then. It’s like the commercial world hasn’t moved on from traditional TV channels, despite people of a more nefarious bent merrily torrenting everything and selecting whatever they want to watch next from a big list of files. In other words, those that pay get a worse user experience yet again. Hence: TV. Apple iPhone everything together inside one app, marrying discovery of new content and a watch list. Finish an episode of something and the next tempts you to continue. Live news and sporting events can be accessed, too, using Siri, which is smart enough to provide links to related stories and scores. And cable TV customers can use single sign-on for all related pay-TV subscription apps. This all works across iOS devices as well, resulting in a truly unified experience. Missing pieces Only it’s not that simple. Even in the US, there are restrictions. Amazon’s ongoing cold war with Apple means there’s no Amazon Prime Apple TV app. And although a Netflix app exists, the streaming giant’s approach to Apple’s TV is ‘wait and see’. In the UK, things are far worse. When we reviewed the Apple TV, we noted “Apple’s partnerships appear to be very US-focused”. A year later, we now at least have Sky’s NOW TV and BBC iPlayer, but the majority of networks remain conspicuous by their absence. If you want to watch Channel 4 shows (beyond news), ITV, Channel 5 or UKTV, you’ll need to AirPlay it from an iOS app – assuming AirPlay isn’t blocked by it. Most of these networks offer stony silence or noncommittal noises when it comes to Apple TV – baffling given Stuff having heard from developers about how simple it is to get an app up and running – especially if you already have something working on iOS. It seems perverse than 4oD exists on Samsung tellies, but not on Apple TV. It’s absurd ITV’s on Amazon’s Fire TV Stick but not Apple TV. And what the hold-up is – money; control; licensing; the heads of all these networks having been driven to despair by using iTunes – we’ve no idea. But until the UK’s selection of TV apps expands, Apple’s TV app not coming to these shores is no great loss. Liked that? Read this...

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Polar M600 review: For Android users who want to be more connected during workouts Is a true Android Wear sports watch worth $330? by Valentina Palladino - Oct 29, 2016 2:52 pm UTC Login to bookmark 41 Video shot/edited by Jennifer Hahn. There's no shortage of Android Wear watches to choose from. Companies including Huawei, LG, Casio, and Fossil all have smartwatches that run on Google's wearable operating system, and all of them can use Google Fit's activity tracking. Now, the fitness company Polar is getting into the mix with the M600 Android Wear-based fitness watch, which is the first device that integrates Polar's existing exercise software with Android Wear. The M600 wants to appeal to a specific kind of user: one who is into fitness and wants a heart rate monitor and onboard GPS in their tracker, but who also cares about getting wrist notifications and using wearable apps. But at $329, Polar's device is right up there with the Apple Watch in price, and that might be too steep for some consumers, considering the experience it offers is much different. Design: Too bulky for its own good Like most hardcore fitness watches, the M600 is chunky. And since it is running Android Wear, that design almost works against it. The watch module, which can be removed to fit into different bands, is rectangular and holds the square 1.3-inch, 260 PPI touchscreen and two physical buttons: one on the left side of the device that opens the Android Wear app menu and one underneath the display that opens the Polar Flow app. The display is bold and bright, and while it can fall victim to glare in direct sunlight, it's easy to read most of the time and easy to navigate. Inside the M600 is an optical heart rate monitor and a GPS chip. That makes the device fairly thick at .5 inches, and while it's not particularly heavy, it looks monstrous on my small wrist. The band is made of a durable silicone which is much thicker than the regular silicone used in others like the Apple Watch's sport bands. It does have a double-prong watch-like closure, though, making it easy to tighten just enough so that the heart rate monitor can do its job, but also not cut off circulation. The M600's design is perfectly fine for working out, which is no surprise since it's basically just a wider, bigger vision of the $199 Polar A360. It's comfortable and also has an IPX8 waterproof rating, so you can swim in water up to 10 meters deep with it as well. But as a device you may want to wear all day long to take advantage of Android Wear and all its features, the M600 is simply way too big. Only if you don't mind bulky wristbands will you be able to wear the M600 without it feeling ostentatious. The M600 comes with a proprietary charging port that sticks magnetically to nodes on the back of the band. Connecting can be hard if you don't position the charger correctly and allow the nodes to attach in every location. Since this is an Android Wear-based device, I used our battery test to see how long it would last. On average, the M600's 500mAh battery lasted 784 minutes (roughly 13 hours) on a single charge. Our battery test continuously sends messages to the watch to ensure its display never fully turns off, so that estimate is based on never-ending activity. Polar estimates the M600 can get up to two days during normal activity (when connected to an Android phone and regularly receiving notifications) and 8 hours while training. So our test results fall in line with this. Valentina Palladino Polar's $330 M600. Valentina Palladino Polar's $330 M600. Valentina Palladino Removable silicone band.

Valentina Palladino Inside is a GPS, optical heart rate monitor, accelerometer, ambient light sensor, and mic. Valentina Palladino Android Wear apps on the M600. Valentina Palladino Polar Flow looks much like how it does on Polar's other devices. Valentina Palladino Sport profiles always track heart rate, and some that are outdoor activities automatically the turn GPS on. Valentina Palladino "My Day" shows you how much you've moved during the day so far. Features: Fitness made more practical with Android Wear At first, you may not even realize the M600 runs Android Wear. The default watch face shows the time and date in large blue and white text, and it looks like Polar's other devices. As you move throughout the day, a bar slides up the display to show you how far you've gone to reach your activity goal. Of course, thanks to Android Wear, you can change the watch face to whatever you'd like. But since this is a Polar device first-and-foremost, the default display works with the embedded Polar Flow app to make sure you don't forget who made it. On any other Polar device, the button directly below the display would open Polar Flow. But on the M600, it just feels like the default workout program (and it is). There, you can start a new workout session or tap "My Day" to get an overview of your activity progress thus far. You can program up to 20 sport profiles to appear on the watch under Training, so choosing the one you want to start is easy, and the watch will track you. As soon as you tap on Training, the watch starts to glean your heart rate and kick the GPS into gear. Depending on the activity, GPS may not always be activated (it's turned off automatically for indoor workouts) which is convenient since I don't want to have to remember to turn on or off the GPS myself. The sheer number of sport profiles that Polar can track will intrigue well-rounded athletes. But those sport profiles are available on most other Polar devices, so the M600 is just working with the software that wearables like the A360 already have. What makes the M600 so expensive (even for Polar) is not just that it runs Android Wear, but it also has the embedded heart rate monitor, GPS, and GLONASS technology. When compared to the $370 Apple Watch Series 2 during a treadmill running session, the M600's heart rate monitor was a little slow to catch up to the Apple Watch's reading. At its worst, the M600 was nearly 20 bpm lower than the Apple Watch. However, as my heart rate plateaued and started to remain steady at about 168 bpm, both watches remained within 5 bpm of each other. The M600 is also compatible via Bluetooth with Polar's H7 heart rate chest strap. So if you have an H7 already or prefer the precision of a chest strap, you have that option. The one thing you can't do with Polar's interface is take a manual heart rate reading. The monitor isn't on 24/7 and there's no option to read your pulse when you're not working out. You can get around this by going into Google Fit and using that app's heart rate detection screen. However, I prefer the interface on Samsung's $180 Gear Fit 2 that lets you take a manual reading and tag it with descriptors like "resting," "after workout," and "happy." The M600's GPS is automatically on for all non-indoor workouts, and it doesn't take long for it to grab your location. You can start an exercise session before the GPS kicks in fully as well, so there's no waiting involved. Every session recorded with GPS will have a Google Map included in Polar Flow underneath that session's stat breakdown. The GPS is quick, easy, and accurate, which are the most important traits for wearable GPS chips to have. Unlike Samsung's Gear Fit 2, Polar hasn't said it will allow you to view mapped routes on the watch itself. So you'll have to stick with Polar Flow on your smartphone to see all of your maps. Long-pressing the side button or swiping left on the display are your entryways to Android Wear. Both will bring up the app drawer where you can access a bunch of Google apps and any third-party apps you've downloaded. Other Polar devices like the A360 can receive smartphone notifications, so what you really get with Android Wear on the M600 is Google's own spin on those notifications, as well as access to full apps. Notifications are certainly richer on Android Wear compared to the native alerts on Polar's other devices. You can scroll to see full messages and reply from the watch as well. You can't do that on the A360. Even if you aren't excited by the third-party apps for Android Wear, at least you have the option to use them. I mostly stuck with Google's native apps like Maps, which let me view a map of my location and find destination spots from my wrist. This experience could get even better when Android Wear 2.0 is released and you can download apps directly to your wearable without needing a companion smartphone app. But that update won't be available until next year, and when the M600 will get it is uncertain. Google Now-powered voice control is another feature you can use on the M600 but not on any pure Polar device. I used this a lot at home when I didn't want to unlock my smartphone, and it translates my voice to text more accurately than not. You also don't need to go into the Google app on the M600 to start Google Now either: simply saying "Ok Google" with the watch on your wrist will make Google listen, as on any Android Wear device. The M600 can save music locally to its 4GB of internal storage, too. You can download tracks from Google Play Music or other sources and save them to the watch, pair some wireless earbuds to it, and go for a run without your phone. I had a pair of Jabra wireless buds on me for part of the time I spent with the M600, and the watch immediately sensed when the earbuds were within pairing range and asked to sync with them. These music features, combined with the onboard GPS, will be a huge convenience for outdoor runners and cyclists.

Ogg October 29, 2016 9:50 am EST Print Email Tweet Investors have had to interpret a lot of data in this aging bull market and ahead of the election. Despite the recent volatility, the one undeniable trend is that investors have been willing to buy stocks into every market sell-off. That won’t be the case forever, but that has been true for five years or so. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each morning of the week. The goal is to find new investing ideas and trading ideas for our readers. Some of these analyst research reports cover stocks to buy, and some of these end up covering the top stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Investors need to consider many sorts of issues when it comes to buying a stock. How much risk is there? How much potential upside is there? Is the stock viewed as cheap, or does it have a premium because of its position today? Does it pay a dividend and/or does it buy back stock? How is its balance sheet and how solid are the business prospects? The ending on October 28 was the week that the earnings floodgates flew wide open. High valuations in general and the notion that the bull market is seven and a half years old just are not stopping investors from having an appetite. 24/7 Wall St. tracked three unusual research patterns emerging out of the 30 Dow stocks in the week ending October 28. The Big Apple Isn’t Just New York City Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) had a very unusual earnings report. Earnings and guidance were all in all pretty good, but CEO Tim Cook seemed uncertain how to capitalize on Samsung’s smartphone woes. Despite these issues, Apple’s consensus analyst price target has now climbed back above $130. Right before Apple’s earnings report, its consensus price target was $128.81, and was $126.73 just 30 days ago and $124.11 some 60 days ago. Within two days of earnings, 24/7 Wall St. tracked 13 key analyst changes. These were from the likes of Stifel, Credit Suisse, Mizuho, Merrill Lynch, S&P, Barclays and many more key firms. Apple shares were trading at $113.69 upon Friday’s closing bell, down from $118.25 earlier in the week before earnings. Apple has a 52-week range of $89.47 to $123.82. Conglomerate City General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) has seen a moderate downward trend on its consensus analyst price targets going into and after its third quarter earnings failed to impress. But with shares still trading under $30, it was interesting to see that Merrill Lynch not only reiterated its Buy rating but maintained its $37 price objective. That is a full $5 higher than what is now the consensus target, and the report even noted how GE’s third quarter was underwhelming and that the $2.00 earnings per share target would require more cost cuts and more cash deployment to hit. Still, the firm noted: We expect GE to stand out as one of the better growth stories in our large-cap space at the end of 3Q earnings season. GE did not back away from the $2 EPS by 2018, but highlighted that more cost-cuts and buyback are required to get to the goal. It is important to know that this is a tie for GE’s highest analyst target price. GE closed at $29.22 on Friday, and that was after a 2% gain on hopes of a Baker-Hughes partnership for its oil and gas services. GE’s consensus analyst target is $32.00 (versus $33.71 just 90 days ago), and its 52-week range is $27.10 to $33.00. Big Pharma This past week, Argus reiterated Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) at Buy, but what stood out was that the drug giant’s price target was raised to $80 from $65. That was up over 30% from the $60.87 prior close, plus there is the 3% dividend yield. Argus sees earnings growth driven by strong sales of oncology drug Keytruda, Zepatier for hepatitis C,and Gardasil for HPV. The Argus report said: Merck shares trade at 15 times our 2017 earnings per share estimate, above the average multiple of 13.9 for our coverage universe of pharmaceutical stocks. While Merck carries a premium valuation, we believe the company has a strong pipeline of new drugs that could contribute meaningfully to revenue over the next five years… We believe that Merck has a strong product pipeline and that Keytruda has substantial opportunities as a treatment for solid tumors, such as lung cancer, melanoma, and head and neck cancer. Recently approved and forthcoming indications for Keytruda, along with growth from Zepatier and Gardasil, should contribute significantly to future sales growth. Investors might want to notice that the consensus price target was $68.32 on Friday, and that consensus target is up over 10% in the past 90 days. Also note that Merck’s absolute highest price target is now up at $82.00, and it has a 3% yield. Merck shares closed down 4% at $58.84 on Friday, in a 52-week range of $47.97 to $64.86.

And the company is doubling down on that with a Nike edition out Friday, while Nike is bringing features from its phone app directly to all models of Apple Watch. I’ve found devices without GPS typically awful at measuring how fast and how far I’m running. And those with GPS typically do little more than measure how fast and how far I’m running. The basics are great for casual runners, but anyone who becomes a serious runner needs much more. I’ve logged more than 400 miles over the past six weeks with the GPS edition of Apple Watch, known as Series 2. I’ve also run 34 miles with the Nike Plus version over the past few days; it’s essentially a Series 2 watch with a custom wristband and watch face. With both, Apple addressed many of the shortcomings in the original watch, GPS being just one of them. I’m not ready to ditch my Garmin running watch yet, but the Apple Watch comes close to meeting all my needs. ——— THE IMPORTANCE OF GPS The original watch does a fine job of latching onto your phone’s GPS if you’re running with the phone, but with built-in GPS, you can leave the phone behind. Accuracy is on par with other good GPS watches, which is to say, measurements are sometimes off, especially when tall buildings block GPS signals. The watch automatically calibrates to my running style, so it’s better than non-GPS devices even when there’s no GPS. Though GPS drains the battery more quickly, the watch still had about an hour of non-GPS use left after a marathon run of about four hours, 40 minutes. For normal use, Apple says you should get up to 90 minutes a day of GPS workouts; I’ve often gone longer without the watch dying before bedtime. It helps that I’ve disabled the heart-rate sensor during workouts. While Series 2 is meant for stand-alone running, many people carry phones anyway. With it, I get slightly better accuracy and battery life. ——— IMPROVEMENTS FOR ALL Series 2 watches start at $369, though it’s $30 more for a larger screen — the optimal size for larger wrists. Non-GPS models, now called Series 1, are $100 less. All models get software updates that address two gripes with the original: — Apple’s Workout app now records your route, something other GPS fitness devices and apps have long done. The Apple app didn’t use to, even with access to the phone’s GPS. — You can double tap the screen to record splits, or manual snapshots of how long it takes to run a stretch. Before, that was limited to mile or kilometer intervals, which didn’t help when you were running laps or loops that weren’t precisely that length. ——— NIKE EXTRAS Nike’s app offers a lot to like, including big yellow numerals for easy reading during runs and voice updates every mile and halfway toward your goal. Nike keeps things simple for beginners by displaying just distance and time; turn on advanced mode for current pace and heart rate. My gripes: no manual splits, and average pace appears only when pausing or through the voice updates. Nike excels in trying to motivate you even when you’re not running. It will keep asking “Are we running today?” by reminding you the weather is nice or that a friend (with a watch or just the phone app) is just ahead of you for the month’s total. A scheduling feature shows you weather forecasts in half-hour increments. After making a selection, you get a notification when it’s time to run. Though the app is available for all models, the Nike watch also has a colorful wristband sporting holes to help sweat dry. It offers custom watch faces with one-touch access to the app, plus a reminder of your next scheduled run. Most people will be fine with just the free app, but running enthusiasts can get the Nike version for the same price. ——— BEYOND RUNNING Cyclists get similar speed and distance information, though the watch doesn’t measure how fast you’re pedaling, something hard-core cyclists might want. You can swim with Series 2, even with chlorinated or salt water, something most water-resistant gadgets don’t allow. The watch measures distance indoors by counting laps, though you need a pool large enough for at least five strokes per lap. ——— WHAT’S STILL MISSING Recording splits during runs is great, but I also want to know my average pace and time since the last split, rather than the beginning of the run. I find it useful when I want to go faster in the middle of a run before a gentle cooldown. And while Apple Watch syncs workout data with the phone’s Activity app, many long-time runners already have their favorite online repository, whether that’s Nike, Strava or Garmin. The ability to move data around is limited. While Nike offers an Apple Watch app, it’ll take time for others to catch up. Strava’s still requires running with a phone, while Garmin doesn’t have one at all. For these reasons, I’m sticking with my Garmin Forerunner 220. And while it’s a minor annoyance, both Apple’s and Nike’s app do a three-second countdown before workouts. I just want to run when I hit “start.” ——— DO YOU NEED APPLE WATCH? Because this review is focused on runners’ needs, I haven’t gotten into all the other features, such as maps, weather and shopping. Running watches and general-purpose fitness trackers such as Fitbit don’t offer as much. The ability to reply to messages by voice came in handy when coordinating with friends waiting at the finish line, for instance. But if you don’t need the “smarts,” a decent GPS fitness device is more than $100 cheaper. ——— The story has been corrected to show that Nike challenge is based on month’s total, and not by week.     Tags: watch, running, apple, series, while, phone, Other stories from today: Apple double downs on running with Nike-edition smartwatch Stocks wilt after FBI inquiry into new Clinton emails Chevron tops Street 3Q forecasts     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   What do you think of Donald Trump's election as president of the United States?

(AP) On Thursday when Tim Cook launched the new MacBook Pro he made a statement by dropping the glowing “bitten” apple from the device’s lid -- a one-of-its-kind departure from Steve Job’s design philosophy. Jobs had the glowing apple on the lid as a mark of premiumness, which many companies such as HP and Dell copied in their notebooks. Even though the company did not give reasons for this change, it can be assumed from Cook’s previous launches of devices, features and services that he intended to change the Apple that Jobs had created in order to suit the company’s future. For example, Cook launched the large screen iPhones, Jobs was against. He also introduced the Apple Pencil, arguably a stylus-like device that Jobs hated.

The high price of the device is also going to be a deterrent in the country,” he explained adding that the glow logo must have been dropped to make the MacBook thinner. Tarun Pathak, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research also said that Apple had gone wrong with the pricing in India. “Apple has gone way wrong with the pricing in India and reminds us of similar hiccup during pricing of iPhone SE which at one point was costlier the iPhone 6,” Pathak said adding that “initial reviews suggests that most of the excitement went down as Apple announced the pricing for the same.” Read more: Farewell large USBs?

Also, the lack of a direct USB port will cause problems for them,” Pathak observed. The new MacBook Pro comes with Thunderbolt ports (Type-C) which can be doubled as a charging ports, HDMI or USB. “The company also didn't announce any other cable or accessory along with the new notebook which will confuse consumers. In fact, consumers who bought the new iPhones will also face a problem connecting to it. All the consumers will have to buy splitters to use other devices along with the new Mac,” another industry expert explained adding “that this was an aberration to the iPhone 7 which comes with a 3.5 mm to lightning jack splitter to ease consumers with the transition.” The expert also pointed out that some users need the function keys and to avail them on the Touch Bar needs a few steps. “The new Mac is more of a problem for consumers and with the huge price tag will attract a very few customers here in India which is not in sync to Tim Cook’s strategy to make India the second biggest market outside US,” he added.

Also, after the stock of the old MacBook Pro is exhausted, Indian buyers will only have the Air notebooks under the Rs 1 lakh price bracket as a purchase option. All other products will cost consumers over Rs 1 lakh,” a local retailer explained. A guest points to a new MacBook Pro during an Apple media event in Cupertino, California. (Reuters Photo) Apple on Thursday launched three new variants of the MacBook Pro at at starting price of Rs 1,29,900. While the 13-inch MacBook Pro starts Rs 129,900 and features a 2.0 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.1 GHz, 8GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage, and ships right away, the 13-inch Pro with the Touch Bar starts at Rs 1,55,900 and features a 2.9 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.3 GHz, 8GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage. The Touch Bar 13-inch MacBook Pro will ship in two to three weeks. On the other hand, the 15-inch MacBook Pro starts at Rs 2,05,900 and features a 2.6 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.5 GHz, 16GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage. The 15-inch, which will also come with the Touch Bar and Touch Id, will ship in two to three weeks, Apple said in a statement.

By Matt Thomas October 29, 2016 15:00 BST A new MacBook Pro is priced at up to 20% higher than before at the tail end of 2016.REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach Under the guise of releasing a new high-spec range of laptops, Apple has raised prices across its entire computing range. The updated MacBook Pros are more expensive than the machines they are replacing, but computers that have had no change to their specifications at all have also had their prices increased. The price increase has been introduced to offset the new low exchange rate between the US dollar and pound sterling, with no increases being applied to the computers in America. Apple raised the price of its Mac computers by about 20% on Thursday, adding £100 to the 13-inch MacBook Air, its cheapest laptop, to £949. In the US, before VAT, the price is still $999. The iMac 4K and 5K are now £300 more expensive in Britain. The 12in MacBook, currently Apple's smallest computer, starts at £1,249 – although the very same model sold for £1,049 24 hours earlier. And the 13in and 15in MacBook Pros with Retina displays – the older model of MacBook Pro – are still on sale, starting at £1,249 and £1,899 respectively. On Thursday, those computers cost £999 and £1,599. Similar price increases hit the company's desktop computers. The Mac mini, still the lowest priced computer that Apple makes, has gone from £399 to £479. The cheapest iMac is now £1,049 up from £899, while the Mac Pro has seen its base price increase by £500, from £2,499 to £2,99 In a statement, Apple told The Guardian: "Apple suggests product prices internationally on the basis of several factors, including currency exchange rates, local import laws, business practices, taxes, and the cost of doing business. "These factors vary from region to region and over time, such that international prices are not always comparable to US suggested retail prices." But some commentators were unconvinced by this reasoning. David Buik of Panmure Gordon & Co told the Daily Mail: "To pass on the drop in sterling in one hit is completely unnecessary and unwarranted. "Apple are using Brexit and the drop in the value of the pound as a convenient excuse to impose huge hikes in their prices." Fans of the computers took to Twitter to express their disappointment: Apple is not the only technology company announcing price increases. In order to offset the slide in the value of the pound, Microsoft has warned it will be raising the prices of its software by 13% and its cloud services by 22%.

October 28, 2014 Apple faces class-action lawsuit over 2011 MacBook Pro GPU issues 9to5 Staff - 2 years ago MacBook Pro Mac Apple Graphics GPU Comments (161) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Following a petition with thousands of signatures related to GPU complaints, Apple has been named a defendant in a new class-action lawsuit filed against the Cupertino-based company in the United States District Court for Northern California over system failures and graphical issues affecting 2011 MacBook Pros. The class-action lawsuit was filed by Kentucky-based law firm Whitfield Bryson & Mason on behalf of plaintiffs Zachary Book, Donald Cowart, and John Manners, a trio of individuals that accuse Apple of failing to rectify the graphical issues that have affected both 15-inch and 17-inch MacBook Pro models released in 2011. The lawsuit covers California and Florida residents that purchased an affected MacBook Pro model between approximately February 2011 and May 2012. According to court documents, the issue stems from a defective AMD GPU that did not function correctly because of lead-free soldering that caused short circuiting among other problems. MacBook Pro models that were affected by this problem would often have visual banding or malfunctions on the screen, especially when users were performing highly intensive tasks like watching high-resolution videos or using multimedia programs like the Adobe Creative Suite, Final Cut Pro and similar software. Apple did offer a free video card replacement on some mid-2011 iMacs exhibiting similar symptoms, though the cards in the MacBook Pro are different, and recalls as a whole are rare. The most recent was in August, when Apple offered free battery replacements for some iPhone 5 models that were deemed to have defective batteries. The lawsuit alleges that Apple has failed to reimburse customers that were forced to pay for out-of-warranty repairs that could cost between $350 to $600 to fix the GPU issues. The legal filing also accuses Apple of largely ignoring customers that have complained, even those that attempted to reach out directly to CEO Tim Cook. Apple has yet to comment on this lawsuit and, given that it generally remains tight lipped on matters such as these, it might not ever provide any official word regarding the case. Nevertheless, we’ve reached out to Apple for comment and we will update this post if we hear anything back. Whitfield Bryson & Mason is examining this issue further and there is a possibility that legal action could extend beyond the jurisdictions of California and Florida.

When my Macbook first died of premature death, roughly a month before the end of my extended AppleCare. Luckily, Apple Repaired it, but it died again, of exactly the same problem, about 3 weeks ago. What caused me to wonder at first was the fact that all my other Macbooks before that one have lasted more than 5 years, and in fact, that’s why I used to be happy to pay a premium to buy Apple gear. Although, I feel it might not be worth it anymore. And then, just last week, one of my friend also lost a similar macbook from exactly the same problem. And since, like me, he’s now out of waranty, we both had to buy new computers. How can we get in this class action ? Can we do so, even if we live in Canada?

LikeLiked by 1 person Victor DeejayRid Gutierrez - 2 years ago Reply I have that same problem and it started when my Macbook automatically updated from 10.9.2 to 10.9.5. Omg my Macbook was working flawlessly before that update. Now I have to turn off automatic graphic switching as a temporary fix but just recently even with that my screen will turn black and freeze and restart. Sometimes it completely shutsdown. And it overheats so much that it is unbearable. I can’t wait until we get all the needed signatures. I hope we win this case because this is not fair that we receive a product that doesn’t function as advertised or “fails” as soon as the 3 year applecare runs out. LikeLiked by 1 person Victor DeejayRid Gutierrez - 2 years ago Reply A temporary fix for this problem is going to the top left corner and clicking on the Apple sign, click on System Preferences. Then click on Energy Saver. Then uncheck the option for Automatic Graphic Switching. Basically the major issue has been when switching from the on board graphics card to the Nvida Graphics card. Doing this will use your Nvidia card full time but it will over heat your Macbook and that is the down side at least when you are on photoshop or something graphic intensive. Even watching Youtube makes it get hot. Anyways, I hope this helps and I hope you can get some work done with this temporary fix.

I had the issue pictured above happen yesterday- i had just loaded and started using final draft- doing some light editing. i got a skype call and BAM bars everywhere… it was a mess. it worked haltingly after i restarted it, then wouldn’t start up at all. I took it in today and they said 500$ to fix on site, 350$ and several days wait to ship it out. i had a think. went on my cell and searched about the graphics card (that’s what they told me was the problem after about 2 seconds) and i found this lawsuit. i went back in and spoke to the manager. i was complaing also that i had to replace the top case, the hard drive, AND the battery in the 3 years i had the thing and now this? i was like seriously, forget this. go get me the print out on all my repairs. i know about this class action lawsuit, i know that mac is at fault, so if you want to feel happy about selling me a piece of garbage i have to make a major repair on every 8 months, then thank you very much. the manager went into the back for a long time and came back without my paperwork, and without the number he said i should call about the lawsuit… and tried to make some sort of deal. dude seemed very unhappy when i mentioned this case- APPLE MUST KNOW THEY ARE TO BLAME because i played hardball with the guy and they are FIXING MY LAPTOP FOR FREE. ahaha. that’s right. i got those evil trolls who never want to help to pay my 320$ (as it turned out) bill. don’t worry if you’ve already payed… i’m sure the company is paying you back one way or another. i am SO unhappy with my mac and iphone… maybe it was bad luck but i’m running away from apple.

LikeLike jjohart - 2 years ago Reply Yes, I had periods that the screen would freeze, appear like zebra stripe bands and or weird color striping (sometimes it almost looked like a US flag)! It seemed to occur if I had several programs open when I attempted to ‘switch users’. I made several calls to Apple support and they were tight and counter-accustory, particularly as I made the way up the chain of support “command”. They started by complaining I had programs from as old as eight or nine years (transferred by apple store/data transfer when I migrated stuff from the ol’ Powerbook G4… They also started inisting I send my entire OS to an external drive, and kept harping on me for the fact it didn’t happen all the time. They were particularly snooty when I started making noise about how they should replace the computer. Absolute human firewalls against that issue! I finally worked around it by changing the “automatic” switching from high intensity graphics to just the continual high intensity. Even though it said it might use more “power”, I have rarely had freeze ups since, so I guess I was lucky. Thing is, mine is the 17″, and I’ve had failed logic boards from a2008 Macbook..for whatever reason. I can’t tell if these machines are any better these days, but it really annoys me there’s no mirroring available on an early 2011, except by 3rd party like AirParrot.

After the Yosemite install I started getting these crazy bars across my display, once a day or so at first, then twice, then a complete freeze to white, unable to start up my computer. Luckily I still have AppleCare (just barely), so my MacBook Pro is in the “hospital” without cost to me for a new video card (or so says Genius #2).

They were very helpful. I took it in for run of diagnostic tests 4 days ago, and found out that it was experiencing a video chip issue which qualified the machine for “extended warranty coverage”. I thought it was just a fancy way of taking care of the issue without naming the problem a “recall.” However, I was wrong, Apple not only replaced the logic board, but they also replaced the whole keyboard assembly, the right speaker, the Magsafe charging board, and the Clutch barrel joint, which holds the screen and body together. I guess when Apple decides to extend coverage (even for a specific issue) it qualifies the machine for the same coverage that fully warrantied computers receive. Big thanks to the Cerritos Apple Store for its fine/fast work. Without this coverage, I would not have been able to fix this machine at this time. And maybe I would not have.

November 25, 2015 AAPL: 118.03 -0.85 Review: Urban Armor Gear’s Composite Case for iPad Pro kills 3 birds with 1 stone Jeremy Horwitz - 12 months ago @horwitz iOS Devices Reviews iPad Pro IPad Pro Apple Pencil Comments (19) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Two weeks into using the iPad Pro, I’m even more convinced of something I believed during week one: the 12.9″ iPad is good on its own, but if an accessory adds enough bulk to make it feel like a poor man’s laptop, it starts to stink. I suspect that’s why Apple let another company release the first iPad Pro keyboard case; once you’ve tried something as big as Logitech’s Create, you’ll start searching for a “smarter” solution. From where I stand, Urban Armor Gear’s new Composite Case for iPad Pro ($80) is a much better alternative to both Logitech’s and Apple’s solutions — so well thought-out and polished that it’s bound to inspire copycats. It begins by offering a ruggedized case and two highly distinctive features — a three-angle metal kickstand, and an integrated Apple Pencil holder — that would in and of themselves fully justify the price tag. But UAG went further, including optional Apple Smart Keyboard compatibility, and offering MIL-STD-810G anti-drop protection. While there will eventually be slimmer and simpler iPad Pro cases, Composite Case currently offers every feature an iPad Pro owner could want… Key Details: A polished iPad Pro case design with multiple bonus features Includes an aluminum, 3-angle stand for video viewing + typing Apple Pencil holder MIL-STD anti-drop protection Smart Keyboard-compatible thanks to a pop-off edge piece I’ve long favored iPad cases with integrated stands; ZeroChroma’s Folio Slides and earlier Vario-SC cases literally transformed the way my standless iPads get used every day. But even though I love their adjustability, ZeroChroma’s plastic stands tend to wear down over time, requiring replacement. Based on a design previously introduced for Microsoft’s Surface Pro tablets, UAG’s Composite Case instead includes a stand made from silver aluminum, with an internal hard plastic hinge mechanism that supports three different angles. It’s an excellent stand, and the single best feature of the case. The strongest recline is a deep lean that works well for typing on an external keyboard, akin to Logitech’s Create, while the shallowest angle is around 10 to 15 degrees behind a fully upright 90-degree angle. Between them is a third angle that’s a gentle, Apple-like recline. I love the versatility these angles permit; by comparison with Apple’s iPad Pro Smart Covers, the only thing missing is an angle to support on-screen virtual typing. The rest of the case is also made from sturdier materials. Like ZeroChroma’s cases, it’s made mostly from a slightly flexible plastic that mostly preserves its shape, but in typical UAG style, it sports rear panels with “Frogskin” accents that give it a “near-future military” look. In the jet black version (called “Scout”), the Frogskin accents merely add textured grips, but blue (“Cobalt”) and red (“Rogue”) Composite Cases pop with spots of color. I’d personally favor the all-black Composite for an iPad Pro, but to each their own. Between the grips and the MIL-STD-810G anti-drop protection, your chances of accidentally dropping the Pro radically decrease, while the Pro’s chances of safely surviving a drop radically increase. Composite Case’s deliberately (and thankfully) basic front has a 2mm-thick bezel, which can keep your Pro’s screen from touching whatever flat surface the case comes to rest on. The more complex back is the reason Composite roughly doubles the Pro’s natural thickness at some points, most notably at the center and long edges. My second favorite feature in Composite Case juts out from the front right edge: an Apple Pencil holder. While it’s a risky move for UAG to include a place to hold an optional, $100 accessory, the omission of an Apple Pencil storage solution has been conspicuous in other iPad Pro accessories, so it’s welcome here. Made from the same slightly pliable plastic as the rest of the case, it adds 6mm of width and 3-4mm of thickness to a 30mm box on Composite’s edge. As an Apple Pencil user, I consider it a major selling point of an iPad Pro case; UAG’s design firmly grips the pencil while enabling it to be removed as needed. Another nice touch is Composite Case’s optional Smart Keyboard compatibility — the first practical solution I’ve seen to address the needs of both Smart Keyboard users and the many people who won’t spend $170 on the optional accessory. If you want to attach a keyboard, a hard plastic bracket detaches from Composite Case’s long edge to permit both magnetic and Smart Connector attachment. Should you prefer not use the feature, five pegs and latches keep the bracket in place. I love that UAG included the bracket, but have no desire to use it. Why? Composite Case frees iPad Pro users to adopt what will — in the absence of a better Apple solution — become the dominant “large tablet” paradigm going forward: as-needed access to a wireless keyboard such as Logitech’s K811 or Apple’s Magic Keyboard rather than a bulky, always-connected wired keyboard. Up until now, the key missing piece to enable this for the iPad Pro was an integrated stand, but Composite Case fixes that while adding drop protection and an Apple Pencil holder to the tablet. Apple’s $140 alternative — pairing an $80 iPad Pro Silicone Case with a $60 iPad Pro Smart Cover — is more expensive, less drop-safe, and has no Apple Pencil solution. Having actually used Composite Case with my iPad Pro, I can tell you that it’s impressive enough to keep on the tablet at all times: polished, sturdy, and practical. It adds only a little weight and size to the already large tablet, while radically expanding its utility. The only way the iPad Pro fits into my life is when it has an ever-present stand to support it on flat surfaces, preferably with both protection and easy access to the Apple Pencil. I’m genuinely thankful that Composite Case is here already to deliver on all these fronts; it’s worthy of my highest recommendation.

October 2, 2015 AAPL: 110.38 0.80 iPhone 6s Plus: Living with Live Photos Zac Hall - 1 year ago @apollozac Opinion AAPL Company iOS Devices iOS iPhone 6s Linked to this still iPhone 6s Plus photo are both motion and audio that further capture the moment Comments (24) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Live Photos aren’t perfect. The video shot in a Live Photo is a mediocre 12 frames per second, compared to the 30fps iPhones generally capture. Low-light photos are noticeably less vibrant when Live Photos are enabled. Shoot a Live Photo in the wrong orientation then rotate it, and you’ll revert back to a standard photo. Sharing Live Photos is fairly fragmented by Apple standards, even on Macs running the latest versions of OS X El Capitan. And it’s not easy to frame the perfect Live Photo; great ones tend to happen by chance, not technique. But despite obvious day one omissions in the Live Photo experience, I’m honestly quite surprised at just how much I appreciate the new iPhone 6s/6s Plus feature. Using my iPhone 6s Plus for a full week now, my take on Live Photos has evolved from “curious but confused” to “I get it but when should I use it?” to wishing I had Live Photos years ago. Read on for how I believe Apple can improve the Live Photos experience and how the new iPhone 6s feature has changed my approach to shooting photos and videos… [youtube https://youtu.be/-EmYJ14wcrA] Okay, so what is a Live Photo exactly? Apple describes a Live Photo as a full-resolution still image that captures movement and sound just before and after the photo was taken. That means 1.5 seconds of video and audio are captured both before and after you tap the shutter button and snap the picture. Note that Apple won’t call a Live Photo a video, and iOS doesn’t treat Live Photos like videos. The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus let you watch Live Photos only by 3D Touching (deep pressing) the still photo. Older iPhones can play shared Live Photos by long pressing the still images. Apple marks a Live Photo with a special icon in the image’s corner. The video captured during a Live Photo is both low-resolution and low in frame rate (12fps), so the footage plays back with a murky but somewhat dreamy look. It’s noticeable on 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens, and it’s just not pretty on even larger displays like iPads and Macs. The 12MP still photo dramatically contrasts with the dated, stuttering video footage wrapped around it. It’s like pairing an iPhone 6s photo with an iPhone 3GS video. I would love to see the 12fps frame rate increase, or at least provide an option if storage is the issue. Live Photos can be used as lock screen wallpapers on the new iPhones, but the motion is so stuttery that it isn’t as compelling as I’d hoped after Apple’s presentation. You also need to deep press the lock screen for it to animate, likely to keep battery life in control, but would anyone regularly do that? For now I’m using a Live Photo as my wallpaper, but only because I like the way the still photo looks. Once you grasp what a Live Photo is for yourself, the first time you share one with someone else necessarily requires teaching them how to engage it. My experience with both power-user friends and less-savvy family members when sharing a Live Photo to other iPhone users is this: 1) send Live Photo 2) include instructions to open image full-screen, press and hold 3) just hope that makes sense. And that’s just from iPhone to iPhone. (There is a Live Photos icon in the photo’s corner, but it’s not a play button.) There’s a software component to making Live Photos work, too, and not even Apple has caught all of its platforms up. This is what you can expect when sharing Live Photos across Apple’s apps and platforms. iCloud Photo Library can sync Live Photos to the Mac, and Photos allows you to play them back within the app. A button labeled LIVE in the lower right hand corner lets you click and play the Live Photo. Just like on the iPhone, Photos for Mac lets you edit a Live Photo and enable or disable the live part of it. Click edit then toggle the yellow or white Live Photos icon in the top center: yellow is on and white is off. Similarly to iOS, auto-enhancing a Live Photo preserves the motion and sound, but rotating, cropping, applying filters, or adjusting light and color will revert it to a non-Live Photo. Somewhat frustratingly, Messages for Mac currently has zero support for Live Photos. Messages on iPhone and iPad work with Live Photos just fine, but the Mac version of the app treats every Live Photo as a traditional JPEG still image. There’s not even an icon to let you know you should view the Live Photo on your iPhone or iPad. This also happens when sharing a Live Photo directly from Photos for Mac through Messages using the share action. This is the case on both the public version of OS X El Capitan 10.11.0 and the developer beta version of OS X 10.11.1. More reasonable is Apple’s lack of support for Live Photos on the web. This is the case when using iCloud Photo Library on both icloud.com and beta.icloud.com, which sometimes has future features before the main site. You can playback video from both versions of icloud.com, so I wouldn’t be surprised if it eventually caught up with Live Photo support. For now I don’t spend much time viewing my photo library online, though, so the omission is less annoying than no Live Photos on Messages for Mac. And what about Apple Watch? Testing with watchOS 2, Live Photos work as expected when you sync an album that includes them. In my case, I sync photos that I favorite to Apple Watch. This lets you set these photos as your watch face, and Live Photos will animate your watch face each time the display lights up. Viewing a Live Photo in the Photos app presents an icon in the lower left corner that shows motion but not audio when tapped. Live Photos in Messages on Apple Watch work like Messages on the Mac, just still JPEGs with nothing to clue you in to watch it. Sharing a Live Photo online is also tricky. My videos are captured using QuickTime on the Mac with a wired connection to my iPhone, and the result is really just a video that you play and pause. Apple said that Facebook plans to support Live Photos sometime this year, but it’s not clear what that will look like. Still, with Apple behind it there should be a fair amount of support coming. Live Photos aren’t as straightforward as traditional photos and videos, but are they worth the trouble right now? All of these software pieces will come together in time, but the wow effect of what a Live Photo can offer is not something I expect to get over anytime soon. As I mentioned at the top and discussed on our podcast ‘Happy Hour’ this week, my feelings about Live Photos have quickly changed since first trying the new camera feature last Friday. [tweet https://twitter.com/apollozac/status/647786199722119168 align=’center’] The iPhone’s Camera app lets you decide before shooting whether or not you want Live Photos to be on or off. You can quickly toggle it on or off before each shot if you want. After my first couple of days with Live Photos on my iPhone 6s Plus, that’s exactly what I was doing: shoot a photo of a person with Live Photos on, snap a pic of an interesting looking coffee cup with Live Photos off. That’s a lot of work, though, and the extra step of processing that decision isn’t worth missing a good shot. Adjusting my approach (and taking advantage of my 128GB of storage plus iCloud Photo Library with optimized storage turned on), every photo I shoot now starts as a Live Photo then I decide in post if I should revert it to a still image afterwards. I have one exception to this approach. Live Photos capture 3 seconds of motion and audio, including 1.5 seconds after you snap the image. That means taking a Live Photo is noticeably not instant because it can’t be. It’s similar to taking an HDR photo on an old iPhone before the processor got so fast. That process involves taking and mixing multiple images and shooting without moving. Live Photos are the same. They take an extra second and a half, so I toggle the feature off if I want to shoot something very quickly in succession. I joked on Twitter that every iPhone reviewer should have a toddler around when testing Live Photos because that’s when the feature really shines. Parents need Live Photos. It seemed gimmicky when I tried shooting the flag waving in my front yard and getting my cat to pose for one was more annoying than pleasant, but nearly every Live Photo of my daughter just impresses me over and over. [youtube https://youtu.be/qCDVRDAu_EM] iPhones are getting really great at shooting video. My iPhone 6s Plus has optical image stabilization even for video and shoots in 4K resolution, and while I sometimes decide to shoot a video and not a photo, it’s still a fraction of the time. Photos are fast to share, easy to enjoy, and don’t ask for much of your time. Videos catch the moment much better but rarely get re-watched around my house. I’m finding that Live Photos strike a really nice balance between the two formats. I have way more photos than videos of family and friends, but I wish I’d have shot more videos over the years. Live Photos makes that decision much easier for me going forward. I don’t have to change my approach, but I get the benefit of details previously only captured in video. Live Photos seemed ambiguous when first announced and ranked low on my list of reasons for upgrading from my iPhone 6. Yes, the motion quality has plenty of room to improve and Apple’s software still needs to catch up in some corners, but consider me completely sold. Android phones and App Store apps may have been first to the photo format, but being built into the camera and apps that I use everyday in a way that isn’t intrusive is perfect.

July 17, 2015 Confirmed: New iPod nano and shuffle won’t get Apple Music to prevent piracy Jordan Kahn - 1 year ago @JordanKahn Apple Music iPod nano iPod Shuffle iOS iPod Comments (52) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit You might have heard some discussing the state of Apple Music on the iPod nano and shuffle, two products that just got a minor facelift alongside a larger refresh for their bigger brother, the iPod touch. And you might have already guessed that streaming to the devices was a no-go from the lack of Wi-Fi capabilities, but it turns out you won’t even be able to store your offline Apple Music collection on the devices either. The reason, according to sources, is simply to prevent piracy… By not allowing users to sync their offline songs to the iPod nano and shuffle, Apple can guarantee that users aren’t able to keep a collection of songs on their device after cancelling their Apple Music subscription. That’s unlike other iOS devices that have access to the iOS Music app and Wi-Fi that Apple can use to authenticate an active Apple Music subscription. So, if you try to sync offline Apple Music tracks to your iPod nano or shuffle, you’ll simply get a warning from iTunes that “Apple Music songs cannot be copied to an iPod.” It seems like Apple could have worked around this problem with new software to accommodate authentication of Apple Music subscriptions through iTunes once a month, at least for users that want to take that step to get their offline tracks into their new iPod nano or shuffle. But for now, your non-touch iPod will be limited to your purchased iTunes or DRM-free music, and Apple Music won’t be much use if you’re planning on keeping the nano or shuffle alive by picking up one of the refreshed units in new colors launched this week.

August 28, 2015 AAPL: 113.29 0.37 Apple to retire One to One Apple Store training program Sept. 28th Mark Gurman - 1 year ago @markgurman iPad iPhone AAPL Company Apple Inc Apple Store Comments (27) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple is planning to retire its long existing One to One training program within Apple Stores on September 28th, according to a memo sent this week to Apple retail employees. One to One launched in 2007 as a $99 per year subscription program where a Mac user could make appointments with a “Creative” at an Apple Store to learn more about using their Mac and creating content with either consumer or professional applications. Apple cites “fewer customers” signing up for One to One as the reason behind the service’s upcoming closure: On September 28th, we will be ending One to One sales and renewals. Since 2007, there One to One program has given the opportunity to teach members how to get the most out of their products and acquire new skills. As our products and programs have evolved, fewer customers are taking advantage of One to One. We want to offer rich learning experiences to all members of our community, and elevate Creatives as leaders of these experiences. Apple’s memo tells employees that One to One training will be replaced with the recently upgraded Workshops program.: Open Training and Thematic Workshops are great options. Thematic Workshops offer dynamic learning where customers learn from the instructor and other participants. Open Training encourages a collaborative learning environment for One to One members to work on their goals. We’ll be providing guidance to increase the number of Thematic Workshops that your store will offer to customers. MacRumors reported yesterday that One to One would be retired in favor of Workshops. Apple tells retail staff that the September 28th shut down will mean both new signups and renewals will stop, but existing memberships will remain active until they expire. A key component of One to One sessions has been data migration, and Apple has indicated that it will be launching updated standalone migration programs for a fee in the fall. Apple’s One to One website will also begin to shut down toward the end of September, and Apple tells employees to inform members to transfer notes saved to the One to One portal to a word processor by the 27th.

I didn’t grow up with cell phones, but amazingly I learned to use one. I don’t pop out of my mother knowing how to drive, but guess what, I learned. The computers I did grow up with were nothing compared to today’s computers, but yep, I learned to use the new ones. Let’s really face facts here. Those lamenting the closing of One to One are simply to lazy to learn how to use their computers or come in for sessions where they want the trainer to do everything for them. Trust me I had plenty of those sessions. In fact, most people didn’t come in to learn, or follow a curriculum, they just came in to ask rapid fire questions, get answers and not learn one damn thing. In fact I wonder how many of you know we did have a curriculum for you to follow so you could learn all you needed to know? I’d say most don’t because they forgot that after their first meeting with us and next time would come in wanting to work on a photo book without knowing their butt from a hole in the ground about computers. It’s like saying, I want to fly the space shuttle, but don’t teach me any of the basics. Most of you really never took the time to learn. You just wanted hand holding. And your neediness and lack of willingness to truly learn is why this program is closing down. I doubt there was a shortage of people wanting to become one to one members.

February 19, 2015 Apple launches Repair Extension Program for 2011-2013 MacBook Pros with video problems Mike Beasley - 2 years ago @MikeBeas MacBook Pro Mac warranty repair program video problems Comments (66) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Following a number of complaints from consumers regarding graphics issues with Apple’s 2011 MacBook Pro, the company today announced a replacement program to remedy the issue for customers still experiencing problems. The affected models include 15- and 17-inch MacBook Pros built in 2011, as well as 15-inch Retina MacBook Pros built in 2012 and early 2013. MacBook owners who believe they may have one of these machines can check their warranty coverage on Apple’s website to determine whether they are eligible for a repair under this program. Apple is offering in-store and mail-in options for repairs, providing customers with some flexibility in how they wish to handle the situation. Customers who previously paid for a repair related to this issue will be contacted by Apple and possibly issued a refund. Those who have not yet been contacted may reach out to Apple to speed up the process. The program will lauch tomorrow in the United States and Canada, with other countries being added on the 27th of the month. It will run until February 27, 2016 or three years from the original purchase date of the affected laptop. Complete details about the new repair program are available on Apple’s website. In October of last year, court documents surfaced showing Apple was facing a class-action lawsuit over the 2011 MacBook Pro GPU issues. The lawsuit claimed a defective AMD GPU that did not function correctly because of lead-free soldering causing short circuiting and other problems. In addition to the lawsuit, the graphics problems have been a frequent complaint among a large number of users in Apple’s support forums and petitions online garnering thousands of signatures from users demanding Apple fix the widespread graphics card related issues. The graphics bug often results in screen-tearing and other display artifacts, as pictured above. In the past Apple has offered similar replacement programs including for the graphics card in some mid-2011 iMacs back in 2013. More recently Apple offered free battery replacements for some iPhone 5 models that were deemed defective.

How will they guarantee that the repairs last, as they didn’t for me? I see others also have had repeat failures with this issue once repaired. LikeLiked by 2 people freestateguy - 2 years ago Reply This is exactly my problem and Apple first tried to fix it (I was told) by replacing the motherboard and the display. That didn’t work and they then reinstalled Yosemite which wiped out most of my files and had to be restored from my Time Machine over a two day period. That didn’t work although the graphic distortion problem seems to occur now only when I use the Safari browser. Fortunately, I was covered by Apple Care so there was no out of pocket cost – just 10-14 days without my laptop. When I took it back in to my local Apple store ( with the distorted display in tow) again last week, I was told that they had done everything that that could do and that the problem must be the “environment” where I use the computer regularly or some corruption of my existing user account. The Apple Store person suggested that I check the environment (which I subsequently did, but the problem still persists) and that I should create a new user and copy my old libraries and files into the new user home folder. While I will attempt to do this when I have the time, I must confess that I am unhappy with all this inconvenience and am worried that I will do the file transfer imperfectly and that it will end up being a very time consuming effort for naught. I was never told that there was a systemic defect in my model. Apple did not offer to replace the the 2012 laptop for a new one despite having tried to fix it twice.

Just had is repaired through the program in March. This month(July) the issue started again with the video. Now the macbook won’t even give a boot chime. Took it to the apple store today and the guy said it’s past the 90 day warranty. He would have it sent out at $300+ to be fixed. I laughed and said that’s unacceptable. I have issues with this thing weeks after my apple care runs out. They fix it… I have the same issues and now they won’t fix it?

I have more system restarts then before and also the GPU failures in Safari are the same as before after only one month of use. I think it’s very temperature dependent but how could I prove this to the guys at the shop? Can anybody help me out?

I had to replace the logic board on a 2008 MBP myself at high cost, because Apple Canada did not acknowledge the GPU problem. Then again on a 2011 MBP just recently. I sent it to a professional UK GPU repair shop to replace the GPU for a brand new one with lead solder. I don’t know if people realize that part of the problem with electronic components failing has been the stupid move to “green” circuit boards. So maybe Apple should have given Greenpeace the finger, when they constantly downrated them with their phony environmental ratings. Unless you have a damaged MBP sitting around and can carry it into an Apple store and get it repaired for free, or sent to and back for free, it might be a better idea to get it repaired the right way, which is re-balling with a new GPU. Unless they have logic boards with revised chips lead solder mounted, which I doubt. LikeLike djmindblender - 2 years ago Reply This doesn’t matter still doesn’t fix the issue!

Trending in Apple Poll: What is your view of the all-USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pro? June 24, 2015 Review: Apple’s new 15-inch MacBook Pro is a dream for media professionals and creators (Video) Dom Esposito - 1 year ago @macmixing MacBook Pro MacBook Apple Reviews OS X Comments (40) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit It would be silly to say that Apple’s latest iteration of the 15-inch 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina Display is the best MacBook yet, because that’s mostly the truth with every new model. Unfortunately, you won’t find a shiny new processor setup this time around, as Apple stuck with the trusty old Haswell configuration, but there are some nice improvements here. The good news is, there’s a bump in clock speed across the board if that matters to you and we have a new GPU setup thanks to AMD in the high-end model. Even with these modest upgrades, the MacBook Pro I purchased is a beast for content creation… This year I decided to splurge and pick up the 2.8GHz configuration and 1TB of flash storage, but I felt like it was worth the extra cash considering what I do for a living. I plan on using this thing for the long haul as the last MacBook Pro I had was a late 2013. As expected we have a beautiful Retina display here, with a resolution of 2,880 x 1,800 that’s good for 220 ppi. For full specifications on Apple’s 2015 MacBook Pro lineup, check out the Apple Store online. There’s also the new Force Touch trackpad which comes along with some cool features, but none of them are particularly useful to me. If you’d like to check out all of the Force Touch features available with the new MacBook Pro, check out our top features article/video here. Instead of focusing this review on how great (or poor) this MacBook is for everyone, I’m going to tell you how it works for me. I make videos. Most of those videos happen to be in 4K resolution, so it should be no surprise that I’d need something powerful to get the job done when I’m on-the-go. Also, if you’re interested in the carbon fiber skin I’m rocking on this MacBook Pro (shown in the video below), you can find it here. Check out our 2015 15-inch MacBook Pro review video below: I actually edited the entire review video above and the original unboxing video on this MacBook. If you’d like to check out that unboxing video with benchmarks and comparisons to the other 15-inch configurations, you can find it here. Premiere Pro CC, After Effects, and Photoshop run like a boss on this thing. If you need something completely capable of any media-related task, I’d highly recommend it. I was able to export my 3:14 unboxing video of this MacBook with After Effects compositions in under 10 minutes. My last MacBook Pro was clocked at 2.3GHz which is pretty fast, but I can definitely tell the difference in performance. As for benchmarks, Geekbench 3 produced a single core score of 3,894 and a multi core score of 14,807. Over in BlackMagic Disk Speed test we have read speeds as high as 1700 MB/s and write speeds over 1400MB/s. I’m not a huge gamer, but I did test a couple of titles for those curious out there. In Counter Strike: Global Offensive, I saw a consistent 30-35fps with all settings on maximum and full resolution of the MacBook’s panel, but the game was a bit laggy, bringing down the resolution a bit made it completely playable. I also gave BioShock Infinite a run and it played buttery smooth at the max settings and full resolution available. I’m not a gaming expert, but from my testing this MacBook is more than capable of handing a few good titles. This MacBook Pro has been a dream so far. It’s a very powerful laptop for my needs, but obviously it’s not for everyone. This specific configuration will set you back roughly $3,200 (or around $2,499 without the upgraded CPU and storage). If you’re in search of a 15-inch for everyday use, I’d recommend the base model 15-inch MacBook Pro which comes in at $1,999. Overall, it’s also nice to know that I’ll have a very reliable editing machine when on-the-go and a laptop that can handle pretty much anything I’d throw at it. I plan to keep this MacBook around for a while and it looks like it’ll be able to keep up with me.

PMZanetti - 1 year ago Reply Amazing how worthless PC Games are on even the fastest hardware any normal person would buy, yet the same games run beautifully without a hiccup on consoles with far less power. Maybe game developers need to stop doing what they’ve been doing for 20 years and start building with normal hardware in mind, instead of designing around only the fastest water cooled 8 core 3 GFX machine. LikeLiked by 5 people Rob Ribeiro (@azurelogic) - 1 year ago Reply The Radeon M370X that this thing is packing is actually about half as powerful as the aging GTX 660 desktop card. The 660 did fine with games a couple of years ago, but even now it is starting to show its age. For reference, the PS4’s GPU puts out about the same number of FLOPS (~1.8 TFLOPS). So, it makes sense that the M370X can’t keep up. Also, it’s worth factoring in that console games get tuned specifically for the hardware they are intended for. PC games require a multitude of switches and driver optimizations to run well on a wide range of hardware.

LikeLike NQZ (@surgesoda) - 1 year ago Reply Consoles are cookie cutter hardware — they’re all the same, and they run at very low resolution compared to PC games. This allows game developers to make games for these platforms rather easily. PC hardware is the exact opposite of cookie cutter…and games made for them, can run at whatever resolution you want, provided you have the power to drive them. Almost every game gives you the option to tune the game for your system — if that means running it on a lower resolution with not as many effects, well, then I think they might be saying hey borzef, if you got a few more graphics cards and ran them in SLI/CrossFire, you could turn the effects on ‘high’ and run it in a higher resolution at a higher frame rate.

LikeLike Full Name Here (@Onerunjunior) - 1 year ago Reply You couldn’t be more wrong. Fastest hardware? In what? This macbook? Not even close. It’s a couple generations old and they are running these games at the native panel resolution in OS X. The resolution is pretty challenging but the real reason it doesn’t run as well as you think it does is because graphics drivers in OS X are really poor, and the performance is pretty bad. Throw windows on this and play the same games and you’d get easily a 50% in a lot of games. Playing Dota on my 2011 MBP in OS X and Windows 7 is a night and day difference. I have to run it on medium settings at 720p in OS X and I can play in Windows maxed at 1080p with faster framerate. OS X sucks for gaming performance compared to Windows. Consoles run so well because they are rendering at a far lower resolution and using a scaler to get to 1080p. VERY few games run at native 1080p on any console and they are very hard pressed to hit a consistent 60fps if they aren’t capped at 30fps. The console hardware is AT LEAST three generations behind PC hardware when they were released and neither would ever hold a candle next to even a mid-range PC. Consoles are holding back PC development because they know they can sell barely functional games on consoles and make a killing and then they port over very shitty ports to the PC and complain they can’t make any money there. The reason they don’t make any money is because they release horrible ports of low performance games from the console. When the “next-gem” consoles were released they were four to five years behind in terms of hardware and they will never catch up. Steam metrics show that the average PC is running a mid-range card at around $250-300 and they are running a mid-range CPU like an i5 2011 socket. That’s a cheap PC, around $800 all in and they’ll last just as long if not longer than any console could ever hope to. I’ve got less than a grand in my PC from the CPU to the monitor and it will DESTROY anything a console would every try and do in comparison. The really good part is Steam sales. I can get games for stupid cheap unlike a console. Maybe you should actually play some PC games before you make hilariously ignorant comments praising hardware you clearly know nothing about.

It’s obviously modeled after the same ideas that go into other streaming devices that expose content rather than app icons, so why is this a siloed launcher I have to navigate into and out of? Why is this bolted on to the bizarre springboard-like interface of tvOS when it reproduces so much of it? You could argue that people want to have access to apps that are not for movies or TV shows, but I would suggest that that probably occurs less often and would be satisfied by a button in the TV app that showed you the inane grid of application tiles if you wanted to get at something else. As I argued yesterday on Connected, I think the new TV app should be the main interface of tvOS – the first thing you see when you turn on the Apple TV. Not a grid of app icons (a vestige of the iPhone), but a collection of content you can watch next. It's safe to assume that the majority of Apple TV owners turn on the device to watch something. But instead of being presented with a launch interface that highlights video content, tvOS focuses on icons. As someone who loves the simplicity of his Chromecast, and after having seen what Amazon is doing with the Fire TV's Home screen, the tvOS Home screen looks genuinely dated and not built for a modern TV experience. I think Apple has almost figured this out – the TV app looks like the kind of simplification and content-first approach tvOS needs. But by keeping it a separate app, and by restricting it to US-only at launch, Apple is continuing to enforce the iPhone's Home screen model on every device they make (except the Mac). That's something the iPad, the Watch1, and the Apple TV all have in common – Home screen UIs lazily adapted from the iPhone. I wish Apple spent more time optimizing the Home screens of their devices for their different experiences. The Watch is doing slightly better than the other ones thanks to watchOS 3 and its Dock, but the odd honeycomb Home screen is still around, and it doesn't make much sense on the device's tiny screen. ↩︎ Tags: apple tv, tv, tvOS Join Now Like MacStories?

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (52) Post your comment Apple really wants developers to take the Touch Bar seriously 29 October 2016 As we are sure most of you already heard, Apple finally brought an arguably overdue refresh to its Mac Pro laptop lineup on Thursday. It consists of a trio of new laptops, two in the 13-inch and on in the 15-inch form factor. All of them are more powerful and significantly thinner than their predecessors, have better screens, improved touchpads and lets call it a "different" approach to the keyboard and I/O, now entirely made of Type-C ports. However, all that was totally overshadowed by the introduction of the Touch Bar - Apple's new touch-screen strip, that courageously sits above the keyboard (yes, we do think it fits, since the Escape and Function keys are now completely tactile-free) and promises to revolutionize and totally change more than a few familiar workflows. Regardless of your or our personal opinion on the new tech and the respective willingness to look at the keyboard, rather than the screen in order to take advantage of some of the new Apple magic, we can't straight up deny that the input does open up the possibility for more than a few interesting implementations and concepts. A few such definitely caught our eye during the unveiling. However, if you are a developer, anxious to get your hands on the new MacBook Pro and start playing around with the API's, be warned that Apple has already stated loud an clear it wants you to play nice and play safe. Cupertino has a design guideline for using Touch Bar in the proper Apple-sanctioned way on its website and its tone is borderline scolding all throughout. It is almost as if Apple realized a bit too late that it had given developers and tech-savvy users what is essentially a second screen that if used in anything short of an "all-business" serious manner could definitely undermine the whole "Pro" tier essence of the product. To put things into perspective, Apple explicitly states things like: Use the Touch Bar as an extension of the keyboard and trackpad, not as a display. Although technically its a screen, the Touch Bar functions as an input device, not a secondary display. The user may glance at the Touch Bar to locate or use a control, but their primary focus is the main screen. The Touch Bar shouldnt display alerts, messages, scrolling content, static content, or anything else that commands the users attention or distracts from their work on the main screen. Strive to match the look of the physical keyboard. Avoid using the Touch Bar for tasks associated with well-known keyboard shortcuts. Avoid mirroring Touch Bar interactions on the main screen. There are a few other points as well, which you can check out at the source link. However, it seems Cupertino can't decide exactly how it envisions the usefulness and implementation of the Touch Bar, but is already pretty determined that it is no place to have unsanctioned fun. Since this is a design guideline and definitely not set in stone or enforced by Apple in any way, we are sure more than a few "bad apples" (horrible pun intended) will definitely go out of their way to fit an entire browser or GUI inside the tiny strip, or simply an endless looping Nyan Cat animation from end to end. But, hey, its your Touch Bar and if that's what you want from it, we don't believe anybody should ever stop you.

Apple continues its patching ways and Pangu has been left eating their dust. With whittled down operating system signings, the best chances of hacking groups is to come up with an iOS 10.0.2 jailbreak. (Photo: Andrew Burton/Getty Images) Any form of crack for the iOS 10 series has hardly gained any ground though it doesn’t necessarily mean that Pangu, TaiG, and other hackers have given up. They may have been trying but Apple has magnificently thwarted all attempts for a potential iOS 10 jailbreak. Advertisement As most know, Apple delivered a big blow when they said that only operating systems starting from iOS 10.0.2 and above will be signed. This means that downgrading and hoping for support will no longer be feasible, further closing the window of opportunity from jailbreaking groups. With limited options, Pangu, and other hacking groups need to decide on when to start. Right now, the baseline operating system that it bests targets is iOS 10.0.2. Curiously, this is the same iOS that comes with a lot of flaws in security though tied up to iTunes. iOS 10.0.2 was released primarily to address call audio issues on the iPhone 7, Engadget reported. It was the second update week after iOS 10 came out, proving that the current operating system is buggy. If that is the case, would it not hint that iOS 10 would be an easy target to crack? Security leaves a lot to be desired as well. So adding the issues one by one, it becomes a mystery why the hacking groups have not rolled out an iOS 10 jailbreak. From here on, the roadmap indicates an iOS 10.1 coming. Aiming that high could be suicide for Pangu or TaiG at least for now. What is important is that they crack an iOS 10 code and fast. Apple may be inadvertently frustrating Pangu’s efforts, and such is believed from the hackers’ apprehension. Just the same, Pangu should have had one out outside that beta version iOS 10 jailbreak that never saw the light of day. Advertisement If there is one in the works, the best bet is iOS 10.0.2. But for Pangu to prove itself, one has to come out soon. With Apple's frequent adjustments and iOS 10 updates, hackers need to come up with some kid of life to prove that they have not waived the white flag of surrender to Apple in terms of jailbreaks, Neurogadget reported.

 Don’t buy the MacBook Air Jeff Dunn Oct. 29, 2016, 9:00 AM 81,349 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple rolled out three new MacBook Pros last month. They look interesting! Especially when it comes to that multifunctional Touch Bar that lives above the keyboards on the two higher-end models. They're also expensive. The most affordable new model starts $1,499, and doesn’t include the Touch Bar. The other 13- and 15-inch models start at $1,799 and $2,399, respectively. Lots of people don’t want to pay that. But lots of people also want a Mac. That could make the cheapest MacBook model Apple now sells, the 13-inch MacBook Air, seem appealing. After all, if you look at Apple’s Mac page, it’s now the only notebook that’s available for less than $1,000. Note that the "MacBook Pro 13-inch" on the right isn't the newest model. A little confusing!Apple That said, you shouldn't buy it. Though there’s always a certain allure to buying an Apple product, you can get better for your dollar in late 2016. It’s been more than 600 days since the MacBook Air received a significant refresh. (Apple quietly updated the base model from 4GB of RAM to 8GB this past April, but that’s it.) The company did not respond to a request for comment on whether or not a one-to-one update is coming, but considering how it pitched the Touch Bar-less 13-inch MacBook Pro as superior to the Air on Thursday, you probably shouldn’t hold your breath. In any case, that age shows today. What was once a significant leap forward for notebook design has been surpassed on all fronts. There are several thinner and lighter laptops available now. Their bezels are slimmer to boot. Flickr/Tim Trueman The entry-level MacBook Air runs on a 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 chip. For a few hundred dollars more, you can go up to a stronger 2.2GHz Core i7 processor. Both of those processors sound fine, and for the most part they are, but they’re the 5th-generation “Broadwell” chips Intel launched in 2015. We’re on the 7th generation (“Kaby Lake”) now. That doesn’t mean the Air can't do most everyday tasks. Much like the iPhone and iOS, the MacBook can get more out of lesser specs because Apple intertwines hardware and software so tightly. But it’s still not great. “Fine” is not what you want when you’re shelling out $1,000 for a new computer. It’s a matter of futureproofing. You don’t buy a laptop for today — you buy it for three or four years down the road. In 2019, you’ll want a Kaby Lake or Skylake (the 6th-gen chip found in the most recent MacBook Pros) machine more than a Broadwell one. Worse, the Air is notoriously stubborn about letting you upgrade other components like the RAM or hard drive. Reuters/Robert Galbraith Along those same lines, the MacBook Air has no USB-C ports. While we’ll all miss Apple’s old MagSafe connector dearly, there’s a reason why the company put four of these things on its new MacBook Pros: It’s very obviously where all laptops are headed. It’s where all non-iPhone smartphones are headed too. It’s faster, it’s more versatile, and most future accessories are going to use it. Unless you’re on a budget, it’s a must-have today. The worst offender, though, is the MacBook Air’s display. With a resolution of 1440x900, it is simply not up to par for a $1,000 laptop in 2016. There are notebooks that cost less than $600 with sharper screens, letting you see more things at once. Resolution isn’t everything, but even then, the Air’s colors, brightness, and viewing angles are all just decent by today’s standards. Full disclosure: I look at it everyday for work. It's just not enough. Flickr/Matthew Pearce To be clear, the MacBook Air isn’t a bad laptop. It’s sturdily built, its battery is great, its keyboard is above-average, and its trackpad is second-to-none. It’s just a laptop from 2015. If any other company launched it for $1,000 or more today, it’d be roundly ignored. Everyone else has caught up. This makes it all the more frustrating that Apple opted not to update the device last month. The way to make the MacBook Air appealing again seems simple: Refresh the processor, and update the screen to full HD. There is a big, vocal group of people who do not want to adjust to the super-thin keyboard on the new Pro models. But Apple is a business, and updating the Air would likely cut into the margins made by the iPad Pro and the new MacBook Pros. Yes, that new MacBook Pro looks and feels fantastic. For now, though, if you don’t want to pay that kind of premium, it’s time to leave Mac behind. Try a Dell XPS 13, Razer Blade Stealth, HP Spectre x360, or — if you’re really strapped for cash — Asus Zenbook UX305UA instead.

What Apple hasn’t mentioned, however, is that the new MacBook is also more expensive, and when we say that, we actually mean that it’s a lot more expensive. The top-of-the-range Apple MacBook Pro costs no less than $4,299 (as you can see in the photo attached to this article) and this without even opting for pre-installed software such as Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X, which would add another $500. For this price, you get a 15-inch MacBook Pro in silver and powered by a 2.9 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, with turbo speed up to 3.8 GHz, 16GB RAM, 2TB SSD storage, Radeon Pro 460 graphics with 4GB memory, a backlit keyboard, four Thunderbolt 3 ports, Touch Bar and Touch ID. But for the exact same price, you can also get any of the following (which at first glance might actually bring more benefits than this new Apple thing): 1. A Surface Studio All-in-One PC priced at $4,199 for the top configuration, and you still have $100 left to pay dinner at a fancy restaurant. 2. Half of a Dacia Sandero 3. A trip to Paris (from the US, first-class tickets could cost up to $2,000, an exquisite hotel room could set you up to $1,000 for a weekend, and you still have $1,000 for shopping) 4. David Bowie’s hair 5. 4,299 $1 ice-creams 6. A Titanium toothbrush that promises the best dental care ever 7. 635 jars of Nutella at $6.76 each 8. Play the lottery and hope to make $16,000 so you can buy a Victoria’s Secret show ticket 9. 191 acres of land on Mars at $22.49 per acre (plus tax) 10.

Apple Inc. introduced the first overhaul of its MacBook Pro laptop in more than four years, demonstrating dedication to a product that represents a small percentage of revenue. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg   Mark Gurman and Alex Webb Bloomberg     Apple Inc. unveiled new Mac computers as it seeks to revitalize a product line that co-founder Steve Jobs once said would be rendered redundant by the iPad. Overhauled MacBook Pro laptops and a new computer monitor were presented in a press conference at Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters. While laptops are traditionally more profitable for Apple than the iPad, customers often spend more on films, music and apps with the iPad, making it a long-term moneymaker. The new MacBook Pro has a fingerprint scanner which makes it easier to buy online using the Apple Pay payments system. Jobs heralded tablets as laptop replacements by calling the iPad a "post-PC" device after it launched in 2010. But products like the MacBook Pro have shown surprising resilience. While Mac revenue has fallen from its 2015 peak, the decline in iPad sales has been more precipitous and the laptop now outsells the tablet. Cook has meanwhile sought to expand services revenue from the App Store, iTunes and iCloud to offset slowing hardware sales. The new version of the MacBook Pro comes with either a 13-inch or 15-inch display. The new laptops are lighter, thinner and narrower than their predecessors, and include larger trackpads and faster chips. The highlight was a new digital function display at the top of the keyboard called the Touch Bar, replacing physical buttons. The thin organic light-emitting diode screen allows functions to change based on the application currently in use. Apple also announced a 5K monitor developed with LG Electronics Inc. that connects to the new MacBook Pro, and a new TV app. Apple last released new laptop computers in the middle of 2015, and has gradually lost customers in the intervening period. The iPhone-maker's personal computing market share fell to 7.4 percent in the three months through September, down from 8.1 percent a year earlier, researcher IDC said this month. "Apple is going to be able to regain some of the market share that they've lost in the higher end notebook market because so many of their products have got so long in the tooth," Shannon Cross, an analyst at Cross Research, said before the event. If Apple is able to sell more services through Macs, they can become far more profitable than iPads, Needham & Co. analyst Laura Martin said before the product launch. "Then you really do want to sell more Macs, because it's not only a higher upfront fee but then if you can get the same services revenue that's a more powerful growth engine." The Mac's average selling price is almost $800 more than the iPad, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and Apple got 11 percent of its $216 billion annual revenue from the computer, with the iPhone accounting for most of the rest. Siri, introduced to the Mac operating system in September, could also help guarantee a cut of revenue from taxis, meals and other services ordered with the virtual assistant via computers. Siri can be activated more easily using the new Touch Bar.

Bloomberg photo by David Paul Morris   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     CUPERTINO, CALIF. -- Apple unveiled a redesigned MacBook Pro, which incorporates smartphone-like touch-screen features into the keyboard and carries a higher price tag of $1,800. Apple has been furiously updating its smartphones every year, but it has been years since customers saw much more than basic refreshes of the company's highest-end laptop. At its event here, Apple spent considerable time showing off its newest innovation for its new MacBook Pro. The company called it the "touch bar," which replaces the long-standing function keys at the top of the keyboard with a small touch-screen strip. The touch bar changes depending on the program that is running on the computer. It offers quick typing suggestions in a word processor, emojis in a texting program, or volume and play buttons in a music program. It also offers "touch id," allowing the computer to be unlocked with a fingerprint. The 13-inch MacBook Pro without the touch bar costs $1,500. The new feature brings that price up to $1,800. The 15-inch screen starts at $2,000. Previously the MacBook Pro line started at $1,300. The rising price of Apple's notebooks is unusual in the consumer electronics world, where products such as big-screen TVs and computers become cheaper over time. But Apple has been making a bid to become an upscale retailer, something some analysts long ago thought was difficult to do in mass-produced hardware computers. "The price points for the new MacBook Pro models sit in a rarefied stratum of the PC market," J.P. Gownder, a technology analyst at Forrester, said Thursday. Laptops and tablets designed by Microsoft, he added, "have eaten away at Apple's lead among both high-end buyers and creators, so Apple had to fight back ... but Apple's deep brand loyalty will make the products successful among the target audience anyway." Price also appears to be the way that Apple is distinguishing its somewhat confusing lineup of laptops. The new 13-inch MacBook Pro is actually thinner and weighs the same as Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air, which was originally intended to be the company's ultralight laptop. The MacBook Air is priced at $1,000 and is Apple's cheapest notebook. Beyond these computers, Apple also offers its traditional MacBooks at various screen sizes, starting at $1300. Apple said its new MacBook Pro has a 67 percent brighter screen, a faster processor, and is lighter -- four pounds for the 15-inch notebook, which Phil Schiller, Apple senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said was "almost unheard of" for a high-performance professional notebook. It can be ordered online starting Thursday. The Apple event comes just a day after Microsoft introduced two new expensive computers -- the Surface Book laptop and the Surface Studio desktop. Microsoft took aim at its rival by noting that the Surface Book was three times faster than Apple's best 13-inch MacBook Pro. On Thursday, Apple had its chance to hit back. Apple kicked off its announcements with a somewhat unexpected subject: Apple TV. The company did not announce a new version of its set-top box, but it announced some new apps that could make the device more appealing to consumers. Apple chief executive Tim Cook said that Minecraft, the popular building game owned by Microsoft, will hit Apple TV by the end of the year. Twitter's Ryan Troy, the company's global lead for TV devices, also took to the stage to show off the new Apple TV Twitter app, which is being held up as a prime example of interactive viewing apps. Apple is trying to simplify the Apple TV for users -- a key move as more cord-cutting services flood users with more options than they may be willing to sift through. With a new Apple TV app, simply called "TV," the company is aggregating users' many streaming options into one spot, making it easier to search and surface content. It looks somewhat like iTunes, but with television content. And it works with Siri for search. The app will look the same across Apple TV, iPhone and iPad and will be part of a free update in December.

October 29 AAPL: 113.72 -0.76 iPhone 8 Plus model likely to use OLED display says Sharp CEO, company could make future iPhone OLEDs in US Seth Weintraub - 2 weeks ago @llsethj Sharp iPhone 8 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Japan’s Nikkei again reports on upcoming features for Apple’s next iPhone just a month after the launch of the iPhone 7. Three days ago, it reported that there would be 3 versions of the all glass-backed iPhone 8 line including a 5-inch screen model. Today the news organization is reporting that at least the biggest model will use a OLED and Sharp could be making some of those future OLED displays in the US. “The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS (low-temperature poly-silicon) to OLED panels,” Tai told students at Tatung University, his alma mater, during a ceremony in which he was awarded an honorary doctorate degree. “We don’t know whether Apple’s OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn’t walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity,” After the Foxconn purchase of Sharp was finalized in August, Tai, a close associate of Chairman Terry Gou, was appointed CEO of Sharp. Foxconn, known as Hon Hai, is of course Apple’s principal manufacturer of iPhones. Apple’s next iPhone, called ‘iPhone 8’ by many because of its rumored sweeping changes, is also expected to do away with the physical touch button and place touchID behind the display among many other innovations. Bloomberg previously reported that Sharp OLED iPhones would have to wait until 2018. OLED displays offer sharper color contrast compared to LTPS screens that iPhones have traditionally used. Apple’s competitors including Samsung, LG, Motorola and others have been using OLED for quite some time and Apple and its proxies have often labelled OLED technology as “oversaturated”. Apple began using OLED displays on Apple Watch last year. Perhaps most interesting about the report is that the displays could be made, at least in part in the US. Sharp only does very limited OLED production currently. “We are now building a new [OLED] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels] in the U.S. too,” he said. “If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?” Previously it had been reported that Samsung would make the curved OLED display for Apple’s iPhone 8 but as we know, Apple likes to have multiple suppliers for key components, especially when one of those suppliers is Samsung.

Home Industry Tech Microsoft takes on Apple: Here is how iMac is too late and Surface so great; which desktop should you buy? Microsoft takes on Apple: Here is how iMac is too late and Surface so great; which desktop should you buy? Microsoft's Surface Studio is probably the bravest product with innovative tech, the company has produced in recent memory years, and it will take on Apple's iMac which has dominated the global creative tech industry for a long time now. By: Sumit Chakraborty | Updated: October 29, 2016 6:03 PM The basic model of the newly launched Apple iMac series is much less powerful than Microsoft Surface Studio, yet it works as one of the best desktop computers ever built. Microsoft’s Surface Studio is probably the bravest product with innovative tech, the company has produced in recent memory years, and it will take on Apple’s iMac which has dominated the global creative tech industry for a long time now. The basic model of the newly launched iMac series is much less powerful than Surface Studio, yet it works as one of the best desktop computers ever built. But if you are a user who constantly looks to expand his horizon and explore possibilities of imagination and innovation, not matter the budget, Microsoft Surface is just for you. If talking purely on numbers, Apple iMac wins by a small margin, yet since Surface is a hybrid the pricing is justified. With the Surface Dial, the all-in-One Desktop and the awesome base support, Surface clearly has made big inroads into Apple’s tech. Surface gives its users Intel Core i5 or i7, 8GB to 32GB RAM, and the Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M-980M at 2GB-4GB GDDR5 memory. Apple iMac initially seen in 2015, meanwhile, uses Intel Core i5 or i7, 8GB to 32GB RAM, using AMD Radeon R9 M380, M390, and M395X at 2GB-4GB GDDR5 memory. Microsoft chose to use Nvidia GeForce though Apple went for AMD. The decision to include a 980M is very little disappointing since it belongs to Nvidia’s last generation of mobile graphics card, and it can be easily outclassed by Nvidia’s new graphics cards of 1000-series. Apple wins the display round. The Surface Studio has a big 28-inch display at 4500×3000 resolution. The display uses PixelSense, which gets the user higher than 4K resolution. While it is awesome, the iMac’s top-of-the-line model is 27 inch Retina 5K display with 5120×2880 resolution, that comes around 14.7 million pixels. That is is 1.2 million higher than that of Surface Studio. Personal computers, once a workhorse for consumer tech industry, has risen from the ashes. They have made a comeback and just shown how they have aged well. With global tech giants Microsoft and Apple, releasing their PCs a day apart, it is an indelible fact that they are convinced that desktops are not dead. The interesting thing to note here is that both the companies who chose to put a stamp of authority on personal computers have a long history to look back to, and however strong they may be with their respective technologies, they are the opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to the kinds of user bases. Microsoft seemed to be an afterthought in the tech world, having slept through the mobile revolution. But Satya Nadella’s steps prove that we just can’t write off Microsoft and that the CEO is making good on his promises to bring ‘innovative products that people loved’. Microsoft, with productivity as its forte, was once known for a no-option desktop for workers in cubicles. But the way the company presented its products in New York on October 26, speaks volumes about its innovation and passion. Microsoft unveiled a new desktop, with technology earned through Surface tablets – touchscreen and pen. The big-screen 28-inch PC known as the Surface Studio rests on a sleek chrome arm, adjustable to flat angles; different for different professions. Writers can sit straight and write, while sketchers can lay it flat and use the screen as a huge canvas. The Microsoft PC also comes with a hockey puck-like dial and a mouse. The dial can be used to change things directly through the screen, or off it. The minimalism of the Surface Studio is reminiscent of Apple Macs’ love for design. At a time when creativity is taking over the world, where the lines between work and play domains are blurring, Microsoft after a long time seems to be joining the race at the right time. It is a race for devices for creative types, where Apple has always been leading, but Microsoft seems eager to push open the space of old rivalry. Interestingly, Apple will also launch the refreshing new MacBooks, which has been a long time coming. With Apple aiming for productivity and Microsoft setting targets on creativity, it remains to be seen whose innovation gets more consumer love. Not so long ago, tablets were touted as devices to begin the massacre of PCs. While being great for internet and movies, eventually users realised that they cannot replace desktops for writing, designing and hardcore gaming. Apart from that small touchscreen keyboards were no substitute, added to the revolution of smartphones. All of this has now lead to a start in the resurgence of the PCs, and tablets have started writing their own premature obituaries. Apple has made it clear with its launch of new MacBooks that it want to make its foray into Microsoft’s domain of the world of business. With the way both of them will sell high-end products clearly indicate the target of premium buyers. But the sales will indicate how they perform and whether newer products will be launched for budget buyers.With 3D models and augmented and virtual reality being the new in thing, it is only a matter of time when we will see them being a part of every range and lineups.With Windows 10 Creators edition, it is clear how they are innovating with its software as well. Peoples bar, personal emojis and Beam, Microsoft is luring in consumers by making streaming and communicating easier than ever. There are a few other things to note, which will mark the milestones for the revolution. Encryption will make it less of a hardware-based security, and more of virtual guarding like TPM, Secure Boot and Credential Guard. Biometric support will minimise the friction of sign-ins. The fact that with the ever evolving technology the focus on CPU specs will be lesser than the comfort of usage. And add to all this, not being biased with legacy, instead of accepting drastic changes will be the key to innovations like USB type-C. Nevertheless, one has to accept, that desktop computing may never make it to the central position in personal computing, as mobile devices have already made deep inroads. But PCs will always be easier and the first choice for offices, business and wealthy homes. Apple is quite late into the reimagining of its MacBooks, yet with the way both Apple and Microsoft are betting on new premium devices, it is clear they are going to stay and their place in certain spheres are more secure than what tech watchers imagined it to be. So, what is the price of progress and what are the things that you wish for, in order to jump into the revolution? Please Wait while comments are loading...

Call it an iPad Super-Pro or whatever you want, there's a gap in the lineup. Sarah Tew/CNET Deny it all you want, Apple, but Macs and iPads need to fuse 0 Share: Computers by Scott Stein October 29, 2016 5:00 AM PDT @jetscott Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech The first time I saw the Touch Bar on Apple's new MacBook Pro laptops, I thought: hey, there's a little strip of an iPad grafted onto that Mac. Macs don't have touch. At this point, they're the outliers in the computing world. Windows and Chrome touch computers have flooded the world for years, now. There are tablets. There are phones. There are, well, the iPad and iPhone. Apple says that the Mac and iPad probably won't combine, and that a hybrid touchscreen laptop computer isn't in the company's current plans. Instead, it seems, we have the Touch Bar. The idea of Mac computers not having touchscreens is now so odd that my wife was surprised when I told her. No, she doesn't follow tech. But she hasn't used a Mac in years, either. Apple's new MacBooks Does the Mac still matter? The Mac and iPad aren't merging, get over it The new MacBook Pro's Touch Bar I like the idea of a Touch Bar, or at least having a more customizable keyboard and second-screen controls. I haven't used one yet. And my colleague Dan Ackerman was impressed with his brief hands-on demo of the tech earlier this week. All in all, it seems like a useful way to evolve keyboard interfaces. But the Touch Bar is small. And the Touch Bar isn't a full touch interface like a touchscreen. It feels like Apple's just dipped its toes into touch on the Mac, instead of exploring the full range of what could be. Like, for instance, what you can do on an iPad. That's what makes Apple's statement that the Mac and iPad will never meet even more curious. Maybe they won't. But I bet that hybrid still happens. In fact, it's already happening. And until a new iOS super-device -- or, maybe, a post-iOS super-device -- emerges to take the Mac's place, I'm not thrilled with the divide at all. Pencil support, anyone?Photo by Josh Miller/CNET Hi, meet the iPad I've used iPads to do work. I've tried to make them do everything. I'm writing this story on an iPad Pro, and a MacBook. I alternate. The iPad is something that's so close to a full computer, even Tim Cook beckons us to make the switch. But it's still not fully there. It does around 70 percent of what I need. The rest, due mainly to OS design and some software and hardware limitations, is a challenge. Apple's software engineering chief tells us why there's no touchscreen Mac Craig Federighi discusses the thinking behind the Touch Bar, describes the challenges of adding Touch ID - and reveals that Apple had built several touchscreen prototypes. by Connie Guglielmo 5:21 Close Drag We're well past the time when a touchscreen of any sort should be considered cool. It's standard issue. From here on in, it's all about touch as a tool. Apple's iPad tablets and Windows PCs are useful because their entire canvas can be versatile. You can touch. Or, you can not. Sliders or palettes can be anywhere. Microsoft is already pushing into something different: tools that interact with touch. Microsoft's new Surface Dial, a haptic metal wheel that rests on Windows displays to create an instant pop-up interface, feels like an augmented expansion of the touchscreen. Gimmicky? Maybe. But when everything's touchable, controls can be anywhere. Compare that to the Touch Bar, which is one strip, one place. Do I think the Mac is going touch in the future? Maybe not. But I think Apple's already got the pieces to the puzzle of touch-screen computing lying right in front of us. The Touch Bar is the start of bringing some form of a touchscreen to the Mac.Photo by James Martin/CNET Why Apple's probably waiting The iOS and MacOS operating systems remain separate beasts, year after year. I think I know why. Apple effectively makes its own chips for iOS devices. (They are manufactured by companies such as TSMC, but custom-designed by Apple.) And they're getting more powerful every year. Good enough to replace the Intel chips used in a power professional Mac? Not yet. But there's already some anecdotal evidence that they're getting awfully close. One benchmark, as highlighted recently by Apple pundit John Gruber, suggests that the iPhone 7's A10 processor can go toe-to-toe with the Intel CPU found in the 2013 MacBook Air. Whether the comparison is 100 percent accurate or not is almost besides the point. In the next few years, Apple's "mobile" chips look to be on target to meet or exceed Intel's computer CPUs in terms of raw processing power. At that point, the only thing holding back an iPad is software and accessories. And Apple actually is positioning it as a full-fledged Mac replacement. A future, more powerful hybrid computer with Apple's own processors could mean more flexibility in design. Or it could mean Apple controls the future of its product even more. The future of magic do-it-all tablets is already here...let it happen As Apple's Craig Federighi said regarding iPads and Macs, "To attempt to bend one into the other is at its root to make a compromise." Fair enough. While a touch-based Mac is easy enough to envision from a hardware perspective, bringing its cursor-based interface along for the ride could indeed be a bridge too far. Windows did a few years ago, but at a great expense: remember the rough years of user discontent that was Windows 8. But those "compromises" Federighi aims to avoid are already happening on the Mac, to some degree. Some people have already grumbled about the disappearance of MagSafe, or the shift to USB-C type ports that will require more dongles for now. And there's skepticism about the Touch Bar. After all, it requires app support. The iPhone's 3D Touch has taken a while to develop meaningful uses across iOS 10, and many third-party apps I use were slow to support it. Will Touch Bar be better? Change is perpetual. I read Apple's executive comments on the Mac and how it would weaken with touch, and how the iPad shouldn't necessarily be like a Mac, and I thought...regular people can't afford two expensive, large-screen devices with an increasingly large functional overlap. I bought a laptop last year because my previous one was eight years old, and no iPad has the software underpinnings to replace the needs I have. But, I bought it for utility. Meanwhile, iOS is the touch-friendly landscape. It's also where Apple's next-gen creative tools lie, like Pencil. But you know what? Apple can converge the two. It should. My son recently had a birthday party where he and his friends played Minecraft. They gathered around touch laptops, touched the screens and had fun. They know how to use them because that's what they do: use touchscreens. The iPad can be a utility device too. And if the iPad Pro can have a keyboard and a stylus, it can have a lot more. If the Mac won't evolve to accept touchscreens, then bring on the advanced iOS hardware...because my kids, and the rest of the world, are waiting. I don't care what they're called.

Marina Shores development stands in California, on Oct. 17, 2016. Bloomberg photo by David Paul Morris.   Prashant Gopal Bloomberg     In a darkened master bedroom, David Kaiserman stood in shirt sleeves next to a turned-down king bed. "Good morning, Siri," he said to the iPad in his hand, and the lights went on while the blackout shades retracted. "Your home is ready to rise and shine," the virtual assistant replied. Inside this four-bedroom stucco house in Alameda, California, Kaiserman, president of the technology division at construction company Lennar Corp., was pitching a vision of a home controlled via iPhone or iPad. Tap your phone, and AC/DC's "Back in Black" blasts. Tap again, and the bath runs at a blissful 101 degrees. Sweet, right? Of course, your dad might view it as a bit over the top. All told, $30,000 worth of gadgets and gizmos were on display here, many run with Apple's free HomeKit app. As iPhone sales growth slows, Apple is teaming up with a handful of builders and using these kinds of test beds to inch its way into the market for Internet-connected home furnishings, a nascent field that has attracted rivals like Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Amazon.com. The gamble is that pricey wireless home devices will be an easier sell when bundled into the home itself. Builders market granite countertops and brushed-nickel fixtures at thousands of models homes across the U.S. Why not video doorbells? Unlike Google and Amazon, however, Apple isn't hawking hardware meant to connect the home. Instead, the HomeKit app could increase the value of its iOS ecosystem -- and make it tougher for users to switch to Android phones and tablets. "We want to bring home automation to the mainstream," said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of product marketing. "The best place to start is at the beginning, when a house is just being created." The convenience on display in the Alameda stucco doesn't come cheap. A single motorized, battery-operated Lutron shade starts at $349. Or consider the Schlage "touchscreen deadbolt," which can be controlled remotely, so you can text an unexpected visitor a code. It can retail for $200. A regular deadbolt fetches $32 at Home Depot -- and there's always hiding a key under the flower pot. In Fremont, California, about 15 minutes from Facebook's headquarters, Los Angeles-based KB Home is also getting its own Apple house ready. Along with the automated thermostat, lights, security system, locks, fans and shades, it lets you, on voice command, change the color of the light underneath a vanity. With the words "good night," the light turns purple. With a "good morning," it switches to white. KB offers wireless devices as upgrades. A basic package runs about $2,000, "which once rolled into a mortgage is pennies a month," according to spokesman Craig LeMessurier. Lennar builds the cost into the price of homes. The Alameda house sells for $1.2 million, though it was a beta model and an actual dwelling wouldn't include $30,000 worth of gadgets. Apple is also working with Brookfield Residential Properties. and other builders. The companies declined to say when the homes would go on sale. Consumers will buy about $24 billion worth of connected home devices in 2016, according to Strategy Analytics Inc. Though that's a drop in the bucket compared with smartphones, the research and consulting firm expects those sales to nearly double by 2020. For most people, connected homes remain a ways off, said Jonathan Gaw, an analyst with research firm IDC. The proliferating devices remain difficult to install in older homes and, in some cases, seem useless. Gaw cites the wireless candle he saw the other day. "Give me a break," he said. "That only hurts the message. It tells people that we have gone too far. There's too much crap out there, it's only diluting stuff that's really cool." Even some who sell such gadgets say the hype may be getting ahead of the reality. The discount retailer Target opened its own Target Open House showroom a year ago in San Francisco. Shoppers walk through a futuristic home, watching prerecorded displays projected onto its transparent acrylic walls and furniture. In the nursery, a baby wears a Wi-Fi onesie -- made by a company called Mimo, founded by whizzes from MIT. It tracks the infant's breathing, skin temperature, sleep and body position. When she stirs, it triggers the home's lights, turns on soothing music on the Sonos wireless speakers and even tells the coffee maker downstairs to start brewing Java for red-eyed parents. You can pick one up for $199. Many parents brew the coffee themselves and let their babies wail -- or buy a traditional baby monitor for as little as $19.99. Connected home devices can cost five times the price of the old-fashioned version, according to Target spokeswoman Jenna Reck. "The smart home will get there but it's not there yet," Reck said. "Adoption is happening even slower than people predicted." As with all things tech, there is the matter of glitches, frustration and complexity. Markus Giesler, 40, equipped his 1924 house with an Apple home system so he could be a subject for his own academic research at the Schulich School of Business at York University in Canada. When the associate professor of marketing pulls up to the house in his BMW, the GPS on his phone alerts the garage door to open and turns on lights in various colors and brightness throughout his home, depending on his preferences and the time of day. At least, in theory, they do. "Certain devices obey, and some do not," Giesler said. Homebuilders started offering smart devices such as automatic locks and thermostats more than five years ago. In its current model homes, Miami-based Lennar works with a company called Nexia, a unit of Ingersoll-Rand Plc. Lennar's Kaiserman hopes working with Apple will have a "halo effect," helping convince customers that a new home in a subdivision can be a "cool" alternative to an existing one. No doubt, Apple would be heartened by the experience of Ken Bieber. Last year, Bieber, a 39-year-old executive at a consulting firm, bought a $357,000 Lennar smart home after visiting a model north of Tampa, Florida. With his Nexia system, his lights automatically start dimming in the evening, signaling that it's time to get ready for bed. When his wife, April, went into labor two months ago, he stayed with her in the hospital and texted a temporary entry code to a friend who walked the dog. Since buying his house, Bieber has spent another $1,000 for wireless motion detectors, a video camera and controls for his light dimmers, ceiling fans and irrigation system. Neighbors ask him for advice on their own smart home device purchases, and he plans to add motorized blinds. "I'll be watching a movie and suddenly I have to get up and pull blinds -- apparently it's just too much for me at that point," Bieber said. "I'm so used to saying things and they just happen." --- Bloomberg's Alex Webb contributed.

Image by: BECK DIEFENBACH / REUTERS About six months ago, people working on hardware and the voice-activated Google Assistant for the Pixel phone started sitting next to each other at the company's Mountain View, California headquarters, hammering out minute details of its first phone. Save & Share Tweet Email Print The new seating arrangement illustrated a much larger shift underway at Alphabet's Google, which crashed Apple's smartphone revolution eight years ago by giving away its Android software and letting handset makers do the rest. Google software now runs on 85% of the world's smartphones, but as voice control threatens to replace touch as the primary means of using a hand-held device, the company is experimenting with a different approach — more akin to Apple's tight integration of hardware and software. The Pixel's hardware and Assistant teams gather for happy hour every Friday and have already received a prototype for the camera on next year's phone, said Brian Rakowski, vice president of product for Google's Android operating system. The town that's got everything - except people  Their ambition: to make the company's voice-powered digital assistant better than rivals such as Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana. "We really wanted the Assistant on the phone to feel like a natural extension of the ways you ask Google for information," Rakowski said in an interview. Leaf from Apple's book The fusion of hardware and software is key to that goal. Certain specifications are crucial for a high-performing assistant, such as a well-placed microphone and a powerful processor to crunch reams of data. Creating an app isn't enough; that requires a few clicks for users to get to it. Great Wall of Africa on the cards  The hardware and software teams worked closely on details such as the graphics that appear when users call up the assistant, settling on a flurry of colorful dots, which Rakowski called a "whimsical touch to give a little bit of life to the home button." The Assistant is always at the ready on the Pixel phone and can be summoned by pressing the home button or saying the words "OK Google." By integrating the Assistant into the Pixel, Google "doesn't have to do negotiations with another handset maker — they can make it as tight as they want," said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, which offers a digital assistant by the same name. Google revives good landline  To make sure users get the best possible experience, the Assistant will live only on Google products such as the Pixel, at least for now. In the long term, however, it is unclear whether Google will keep it that way, or return to its original phone strategy and try to push the product out to the millions of smartphones running on other manufacturers' Android phones, at the risk of offering a slightly lower-quality experience. Rakowski said making sure the Assistant works well on other phones would require a close level of integration with handset makers, beyond the typical work that happens on the Android operating system. Apple's privacy stance starting to eat into its bottom line  "We want all these features of the Assistant to work well and work quickly and be nicely integrated so it gives the right idea of what the Assistant can do," he said "We don't want it to feel limited or bolted on in any way." He admits it could be challenging to execute the Assistant on some current Android phones. "You can't do some of the always-on 'OK Google' detection on some phones because they don't include the right hardware to do that," he said. "In some cases, the microphone is not in a great position." WhatsApp dumps BlackBerry  Samsung going it alone? Whatever Google decides, there are already some signs that its Assistant may not be welcome on all Android phones. Samsung Electronics, the world's top selling smartphone maker and the leading Android manufacturer, recently acquired Viv Labs, an artificial intelligence startup founded by the creators of Siri, and plans to weave the assistant into its phones. Having already ceded their operating systems to Google, Android manufacturers may be reluctant to delegate the digital assistant as well, people in the industry said. "If we get to the point where the face of the brand is the assistant itself, that is totally a differentiator," said Babak Hodjat, co-founder of artificial intelligence company Sentient. "They will be relegated to just pushing hardware." There’s an app to make you 'shark smart' in Cape Town  Google is coy about its plans. "Over time, we want to bring the Assistant to as many people as possible," Steve Cheng, product management director for the Assistant, said in an interview, without giving details. Analysts expect that eventually Google will try to make money by taking a share of transactions brokered by the Assistant — such as when a user buys flowers from a store the Assistant just located. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai appeared to hint at that possibility during the company's earnings call on Thursday. Google adds fact-checking to news articles  "The Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the voice experience," he said. But he did make clear, whether on its own or others' hardware, the shift from touch to voice-controlled assistants presents a prime opportunity for Google. "As we went from desktops to mobile, it's not like one replaced the other... It expanded the pie," he said. "I approach this the same way."

It's what keeps things interesting. It's also what keeps the cauldron of commerce at a full boil. And in the technology industry, change is constant. This week, Apple and Microsoft revealed new computers that'll tempt many — particularly folks working in the creative arts — even if they come with eye-watering price tags. Change can also be cause for consternation. Apple decided to eliminate the headphone jack from its phones a month ago, and yesterday it banished everything without a USB-C or Thunderbolt connector from its laptops. This is the pain of progress. Given enough time, the benefits received will, we hope, be a good bargain. It often is. In other instances, change comes slowly. Jess Conditt wrote about how powerful video games have become as a medium for cultural and social commentary. Yet respect and investment for such projects trail more "traditional" arts, despite games' arguably wider potential impact. And finally, Edgar Alvarez explained Amazon's difficulties in becoming a purveyor of luxury fashion items. It seems that scale and quality can't mix — at least in the minds of those running haute couture. Hey, artists use Windows too!They're used to paying Apple prices, right? Microsoft wants to be the company for creative types. Like in the worst way possible. The company's big Surface event this week was all about creating, building and drawing. There was even a little 3D printing thrown in for good measure. Of course, the biggest news was the launch of the Surface Studio all-in-one PC, but we'd be lying if we said MS Paint 3D didn't kinda steal the show. Apple wants your fingers to caress its new laptopAll in the name of stimulating your artistic sensibilities Apple couldn't let Microsoft hog the spotlight, though. The Cupertino crew held their own big event this week, and the focus was all on the MacBook Pro. The most exciting news was the addition of the Touch Bar on the high-end models — an OLED touchscreen strip in place of those anachronistic function keys. The less exciting news was that Apple ditched basically all the ports except for USB-C. At least they didn't ax the headphone jack. Shhh ... you hear something?That's the sound of sick video game sound effects, y'all Microsoft went all out for the sound on "Gears of War 4." Most games treat the audio like a second-class citizen, but developer the Coalition fired up some elaborate software that simulates how sound reacts in different environments and how it interacts with different materials to make "Gears 4" seem ultra-realistic. Or as realistic as a game set in the future on an alien world can seem. R.I.P. VineWe (most of us) hardly knew ye Twitter announced that it was going to be laying off more than 350 people, and now, it seems, we know where at least some of those cuts are coming from. Vine is coming to an end, and with it the art of six-second video loops. Some Engadget editors will miss it more than others. What are pro designers saying about Microsoft's Surface Dial?No thanks, mostly. We talked to a host of illustrators, designers and other creative types to see what they think of Microsoft's newest devices. The Surface Studio seems to have piqued their interest. The Dial, on the other hand... Please don't do this. Seriously.11 super-sexy Hallow-meme costumes Look, sexy nurse and policeman are passé.

British Airways (BA) has now warned of a price hike after its profits took a hit while Apple said its computers will be £500 more expensive. And gym-goers at a Holiday Inn were reportedly left furious after being told they were no longer entitled to a free towel service 'because the UK voted to leave the EU'. It's the latest in a string of price changes that has sparked controversy for consumers, including the 12% hike in the cost of Marmite - which Morrisons bowed to yesterday. The chief executive of BA's parent company International Airlines Group (IAG) Willie Walsh said on Friday it may increase BA ticket prices to offset the collapse in the pound. He revealed that industrial action and sterling's weakness had dealt a £145 million blow to operating profit in the three months to the end of September. Apple Apple has already increased the prices of its Macbook Pros The group, which also owns the Aer Lingus and Iberia airlines, said it suffered "weak trading conditions" in June - both before and after the Brexit vote - with its premium cabins bearing the brunt of the slowdown. Mr Walsh told the Daily Telegraph: "In time, if sterling continues to be weak, we are looking at increases, not just in fare but in all goods." Read More Morrisons becomes first supermarket to put up price of Marmite just weeks after Tesco refuses Unilever post-Brexit pressure Meanwhile Apple has been accused of using Brexit as an opportunity to increase prices for its customers in Britain after increasing the cost of some of its computer models. The company's most basic laptop, the 13-inch MacBook Air, has risen from £849 to £949 while its highest-powered version has increased from £2,499 to £2,999. Getty A health spa has said its no longer offering a free towel service due to the falling pound value The price hike means after currency conversion and UK VAT, the costs closely resemble US prices as the sterling fell around 20% against the US dollar post- Brexit . Apple said it sets its prices based on 'currency exchange rates, local import laws, business practices, taxes and the cost of doing business', the Daily Mail reports. Read More Microsoft hikes prices for British businesses in wake of Brexit vote But veteran City commentator David Buik told the newspaper: "To pass on the drop in sterling in one hit is completely unnecessary and unwarranted. "Apple are using Brexit and the drop in the value of the pound as a convenient excuse to impose huge hikes in their prices." It comes as a Holiday Inn health club decided to end its free towel service for customers, blaming it on the drop in the pound since the EU referendum, the Telegraph reports. Getty Marmitegate has been one of the most controversial price hikes following the EU referendum A note displayed in the reception of the Spirit Health Club in Portsmouth explained: "We have been informed by our Head Office that... we will unfortunately no longer be handing out free towels upon entry. "The reason the Company has decided to do this is because since the UK voted to leave the EU the pound has dropped significantly." Outraged gym-goers have branded the move as 'ridiculous' with some vowing not to return. Read More Poundland has started selling things for more than a £1 and it's the last straw Una Herman, 64, told the newspaper: "It’s ridiculous to blame Brexit – especially when it’s a UK company they send the towels to be laundered." Kew Green Hotels, which manages a total of 21 health clubs, reportedly said they launder over one million individual leisure towels. Director of Leisure, Justin Andrews, said: “We are one of the very last health club operators to withdraw the issue of free ‘per visit’ towels to members, despite the increasing costs to the business with the widely publicised rise in the cost of utilities and other consumables over the years.” DailyMirror Comments Show more comments Recently Published David Davis tells MPs to respect the referendum result and stop trying to 'wreck' Brexit Mr Davis told MPs: “There must be no attempt to remain in the EU, no attempt to rejoin by the backdoor and no second referendum” Theresa May stays in No 10 bunker refusing to face the music over High Court Brexit ruling Pound skyrockets after High Court rules MPs must vote on Brexit before Theresa May can trigger article 50 Previous Articles Britain's Brexit economy is growing, reveal first set of figures since EU referendum The first official statistics for the period since the June 23 vote show gross domestic product grew by 0.5% between July and September Morrisons becomes first supermarket to put up price of Marmite just weeks after Tesco refuses Unilever post-Brexit pressure Related Tags Products MacBook Event EU Referendum Organisations Holiday Inn European Union Apple British Airways In the news Brexit Recommended in UK News Crime Instagram 'Romeo and Juliet' live-stream shootout with police before 'killing themselves in horror double suicide' Animals Mutant cyclops goat born with one eye paraded in bizarre footage Ministry of Defence Britain's £6billion new aircraft carriers 'at risk' because of Tory government defence spending cuts Dangerous driving Drivers still risking lives by using mobile phones while driving - despite huge crackdown Brexit Labour warns Chancellor not to use Brexit as an excuse to make more cuts World War I Unseen Lawrence of Arabia letter expected to sell for huge amount almost 100 years after it was written Facebook Should you post pictures of your kids on Facebook?

However in the process, the Cupertino company also removed other features like more traditional USB ports, the DisplayPort, and also the SD card reader, just to name a few. The good news is that if you’re not adverse to third-party accessories, Belkin has taken the wraps off its Thunderbolt 3 Express Dock which will basically bring back some of those ports. On the front of the dock, it will feature a USB-A port and a 3.5mm headphone jack. On the other side, we are looking at 2x USB-A 3.0 ports, an Ethernet port, audio out, 2x Thunderbolt 3 ports, and a DisplayPort. It will offer users 40Gbps transfer speeds and will also allow users to daisy chain up to five Thunderbolt devices at once. However the only downside is that it will require users to connect it to a power source, meaning that it’s not exactly the most portable solution. It’s not impossible, but it’s not exactly convenient either. We should also remind users that the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has reduced bandwidth on its right Thunderbolt 3 ports, so that should be taken into consideration if you plan to use this dock with it.

The touch-sensitive OLED panel Apple is fitting to its new MacBook Pros lets you access smart shortcuts that change depending on the application you're using: pause music, drop in emojis, scroll through photos, and so on. iOS developer Steven Troughton-Smith has been taking a closer look at this new component and thinks the Touch Bar is basically an adapted Apple Watch, using the same integrated system-on-a-chip as Apple's timepiece plus watchOS. The modified component handles user Touch Bar input separately from the rest of the operating system and then feeds it back to macOS. This should keep performance snappy and keep the Touch ID element more secure at the same time. Will the new MacBook Pro qualify for our best laptops list? Touch Bar future Apple isn't commenting on the internal architecture of its new machines but Troughton-Smith told The Verge that "the Touch Bar theoretically could run while the rest of the machine is turned off, so you get all the low-power and security benefits of an iOS device", opening up all kinds of possibilities - like seeing iMessage notifications come up before you switch your laptop on. Sources speaking to TechCrunch have confirmed this is indeed how the new MacBook Pros are set up, and Apple Pay transactions are another duty that the modified Apple Watch chip is assigned to handle. The revelation probably isn't going to change your mind about whether it's worth shelling out for one of the new laptops, but it gives us some interesting info about how the Touch Bar might be used in the future - a separate, mini iOS device running right above the MacBook Pro keyboard.

Dr. Kevin Campbell Published: October 29, 2016, 4:00 am Updated: October 29, 2016, 4:00 am Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) — Wearable health-related technologies are becoming more common. Despite their growing popularity, little has been done to evaluate their accuracy during exercise.  Now, a new study from Cleveland Clinic found that some monitors are better than others. What is a wearable medical device and how are they being utilized? Heart rate monitors such as Fitbit, Apple Watch and several others are being used by millions of Americans.  Many use it as part of cardiac rehab—certainly professional athletes and others use very advanced wearable technology to maximize their athletic performances. Tell us about the newest study on wearables Researchers at the Cleveland Clinic’s Heart and Vascular Institute tested four different wrist-worn heart rate monitors and compared their accuracy against EKGs and medical quality monitoring equipment used in cardiology offices. In treadmill tests, the Apple Watch and Mio Fuse were the most accurate. The other two devices fell short: Basis Peak, which is no longer being manufactured, overestimated heart rate during moderate exercise, and Fitbit Charge HRunderestimated heart rate during more vigorous exercise, the study found. All of the devices worked quite well at rest. Earlier this year, Maggie Newland and I did a similar test in a local gym comparing Fitbit and Apple Watch for accuracy and we found similar findings in our small test. Based on this new study, how should we use wearables in order to improve health? What does the future hold? I believe that wearable tech is the future. I think that we have to remember that many of these wearables are not classified as medical devices by the FDA and do not have to undergo rigorous clinical trials. Even so, these devices can provide helpful real time feedback to patients and athletes — steps, resting heart rate, etc. are all very important when training or when in rehab. It can also provide target HR information when exercising — just know that it is not 100 percent accurate during peak exercise, but it can give you enough information to reassure you that you are exercising where you intend to. I do think that wearables will only get better. Many companies are now working to produce medical device quality devices. I have a prototype of an EKG that you can do on your phone or on your watch — called AliveCor.

Microsoft Surface Exec Thinks Apple Will Build a Touchscreen MacBook GO The Touch Bar is just the beginning of a touch-capable Mac Oct 29, 2016 07:48 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Apple has launched its new-generation MacBooks and just like pretty much everyone expected, a touch-capable display is not available on the refreshed lineup, which makes many wonder whether Cupertino plans to ever make the transition to this tech or not. As far as Microsoft’s VP of Surface Marketing is concerned, the Touch Bar that Apple has added to these new models is just the first step towards a touch-capable MacBook. Touch and detachable MacBook coming In a series of tweets posted a few hours ago, Brian Hall explains that he’s 100 percent sure that Apple will make a MacBook with touch display at some point in the future and there are 95 percent chances that this screen would be detachable. “I've had a day to think. officially am calling it. 100% Apple is making touchscreen mac, 95% detachable. They're too smart not to,” he said, adding that “they would not have planned just the touchbar. Buy a Surface now & let's let the games really begin when they get (real) touch.” Truth be told, Apple doesn’t seem to be too interested in making touch-capable laptops at the moment, but this device category invented by Microsoft is rapidly gaining ground, so Cupertino might not have any other option at some point than to align with the market demand. There are people who think that Apple doesn’t have to make a touch and detachable MacBook because it already has the iPad Pro, but since it’s powered by iOS, this one is closer to the tablet category rather than to laptops. The iPad Pro does come with touch capabilities and a detachable keyboard, but since it’s not capable of running desktop software, it can’t be considered a Surface Book or Surface Pro rival. Time will tell if Apple is indeed planning the switch to touch displays, but for the moment, the company seems to be betting big on a more traditional approach that Microsoft, on the other hand, is not at all interested in. 1/2 I've had a day to think. officially am calling it. 100% Apple is making touchscreen mac, 95% detachable.

Less Guilt. Delectable New Items at Tropical Smoothie Cafe October 31st Chicken Apple Club Flatbread and Three Acai-Blend Smoothies Offer Sensible Indulgences     ATLANTA, GA, October 29, 2016 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Cooler weather means appetites start turning towards comfort foods and richer flavors. But this year, thanks to Tropical Smoothie Cafe, those tasty treats don't have to come at the expense of a healthful diet. The fresh, inventive minds behind one of the country's most diverse and nutritious fast-casual menus announced that their fall specials will feature "smart" indulgences that are just as delicious as they are satisfying. The Chicken Apple Club Flatbread is a comfort-food twist on the classic Rustic Turkey Apple Club, featuring three smoked cheeses, seasonal fruit and veggie accents. On the beverage side, Tropical Smoothie Cafe is highlighting its fan favorite, the Acai-Berry Boost smoothie, and also introducing two new variations for the season. The two new options both include acai berries, blueberries and banana, and guests can choose to either keep it simple (Acai Blue), or add a touch of Ghirardelli chocolate (Acai Blue Truffle).

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Microsoft > Surface FLASH SALE: Driver Booster 4      40% OFF! Microsoft Trashes the New Apple MacBook Pro on Its Official Website GO “It’s easy to switch from Mac to Surface,” Microsoft says Oct 29, 2016 07:01 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft positions the Surface Book as a direct Apple MacBook competitor, and now that both companies have new models available, customers can once again decide if they go Windows or macOS. Microsoft itself wants to make this decision easier, so the company has set up a page on its official store page to highlight how the Surface Book performs against the MacBook, while also providing instructions on how to migrate from an Apple device to its own laptop. A side-by-side comparison between the Surface Book and the 13-inch MacBook Pro published on Microsoft’s website shows that the Windows 10 laptop comes with a detachable and touch-capable screen, while also featuring a discrete NVIDIA graphics processor, whereas the Apple model lacks all of these. Furthermore, the Surface can be used with a pen, but due to the lack of a touch screen, the MacBook is once again left behind here. Microsoft also emphasizes that its Surface Book comes with higher screen solution (267 PPI and 6M pixels on the Windows 10 laptop vs. 227 PPI and 4.1M pixels on the MacBook), but also with a better front-facing camera. Furthermore, the Surface Book also comes with a rear-facing camera. “iTunes will work on Windows too” It’s worth mentioning, however, that Microsoft picked the entry-level MacBook here and those specs improve as you go higher in the 2016 model lineup. But no matter the configuration, the MacBook still lacks modern features such as a touchscreen and support for pen, with Apple apparently more interested in a traditional laptop approach that provides customers with features they’re already familiar with (except for the Touch Bar, of course). “It’s easy to switch from Mac to Surface. Your new Surface will work well with iTunes, iCloud, and iPhone. And many of the gestures, shortcuts and features are similar to what you already know,” Microsoft explains on the page. It remains to be seen how many Apple customers would agree to switch to the Surface Book, but comparisons like these clearly show that Microsoft’s devices are substantially more powerful and offer better quality for the money than the new-generation MacBooks.

(Image: Reuters) About six months ago, people working on hardware and the voice-activated Google Assistant for the Pixel phone started sitting next to each other at the company's Mountain View, California headquarters, hammering out minute details of its first phone. The new seating arrangement illustrated a much larger shift underway at Alphabet Inc's Google, which crashed Apple Inc's ; smartphone revolution eight years ago by giving away its Android software and letting handset makers do the rest. Google software now runs on 85 percent of the world's smartphones, but as voice control threatens to replace touch as the primary means of using a hand-held device, the company is experimenting with a different approach - more akin to Apple's tight integration of hardware and software. The Pixel's hardware and Assistant teams gather for happy hour every Friday and have already received a prototype for the camera on next year's phone, said Brian Rakowski, vice president of product for Google’s Android operating system. Their ambition: to make the company's voice-powered digital assistant better than rivals such as Apple’s Siri and Microsoft Corp’s; Cortana. “We really wanted the Assistant on the phone to feel like a natural extension of the ways you ask Google for information,” Rakowski said in an interview. LEAF FROM APPLE'S BOOK The fusion of hardware and software is key to that goal. Certain specifications are crucial for a high-performing assistant, such as a well-placed microphone and a powerful processor to crunch reams of data. Creating an app isn't enough; that requires a few clicks for users to get to it. The hardware and software teams worked closely on details such as the graphics that appear when users call up the assistant, settling on a flurry of colourful dots, which Rakowski called a "whimsical touch to give a little bit of life to the home button.” The Assistant is always at the ready on the Pixel phone and can be summoned by pressing the home button or saying the words “OK Google.” By integrating the Assistant into the Pixel, Google “doesn’t have to do negotiations with another handset maker – they can make it as tight as they want,” said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, which offers a digital assistant by the same name. To make sure users get the best possible experience, the Assistant will live only on Google products such as the Pixel, at least for now. In the long term, however, it is unclear whether Google will keep it that way, or return to its original phone strategy and try to push the product out to the millions of smartphones running on other manufacturers' Android phones, at the risk of offering a slightly lower-quality experience. Rakowski said making sure the Assistant works well on other phones would require a close level of integration with handset makers, beyond the typical work that happens on the Android operating system. "We want all these features of the Assistant to work well and work quickly and be nicely integrated so it gives the right idea of what the Assistant can do," he said "We don't want it to feel limited or bolted on in any way." He admits it could be challenging to execute the Assistant on some current Android phones. "You can't do some of the always-on 'OK Google' detection on some phones because they don't include the right hardware to do that," he said. "In some cases, the microphone is not in a great position." SAMSUNG GOING IT ALONE? Whatever Google decides, there are already some signs that its Assistant may not be welcome on all Android phones. Samsung Electronics Co, the world's top selling smartphone maker and the leading Android manufacturer, recently acquired Viv Labs, an artificial intelligence startup founded by the creators of Siri, and plans to weave the assistant into its phones. Having already ceded their operating systems to Google, Android manufacturers may be reluctant to delegate the digital assistant as well, people in the industry said. “If we get to the point where the face of the brand is the assistant itself, that is totally a differentiator,” said Babak Hodjat, co-founder of artificial intelligence company Sentient. “They will be relegated to just pushing hardware.” Google is coy about its plans. “Over time, we want to bring the Assistant to as many people as possible,” Steve Cheng, product management director for the Assistant, said in an interview, without giving details. Analysts expect that eventually Google will try to make money by taking a share of transactions brokered by the Assistant - such as when a user buys flowers from a store the Assistant just located. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai appeared to hint at that possibility during the company’s earnings call on Thursday. “The Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the voice experience,” he said. But he did make clear, whether on its own or others' hardware, the shift from touch to voice-controlled assistants presents a prime opportunity for Google. "As we went from desktops to mobile, it’s not like one replaced the other... It expanded the pie,” he said. “I approach this the same way.” Google Google Assistant Samsung Siri Trending Articles Arunachal Press Condemns Killing of Dainik Bhaskar Journalist Dharmendra Singh in Bihar Watch: Off Centre With Sheila Dikshit Modi Government's Demonetisation Move a 'Foolish Decision': AAP 'Rasgulla' Sale Increased by 16.25 Per Cent Since Liquor Ban: Nitish Kumar Trending Articles Arunachal Press Condemns Killing of Dainik Bhaskar Journalist Dharmendra Singh in Bihar Watch: Off Centre With Sheila Dikshit Modi Government's Demonetisation Move a 'Foolish Decision': AAP 'Rasgulla' Sale Increased by 16.25 Per Cent Since Liquor Ban: Nitish Kumar Trump Terms Obama as Terrific, Says he has 'Great Sense of Humour' Swamy Lashes Out at Finance Ministry, Says Demonetisation Poorly Planned Bigg Boss 10, Day 27: Salman Khan Questions Rahul, Rohan and Karan's Lethargic Attitudes Stop Treating People Like Criminals: Shiv Sena Tells Aurn Jaitley From Our Network Modi in Ghazipur: PM's rally is to convince people that demonetisation is a good decision- FirstPost Naxal-hit village in Latehar gets electricity for the first time - Pradesh18 Thousands throng gurdwaras to mark Gurpurab - Pradesh18 About Us Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap Complaint Redressal Advertise With Us sections India Lifestyle States Tech Politics Auto Sports iVideos Football Power Circuit Latest News 'Whole' BJP is Against Demonetisation, Alleges Arvind Kejriwal Australia vs South Africa Live Score: 2nd Test, Day 4 at Hobart 15 Dead in Iraq Suicide Bombings Claimed by Islamic State Syria Conflict: Scores of Pakistani, Afghan and Iranian Fighters killed in Aleppo Watch: India@9 With Zakka Jacob & Bhupendra Chaubey Watch LIVE From Network18 News18 India CricketNext News18 States Pradesh18 Bangla News Gujarati News Urdu News Marathi News Topper Moneycontrol Firstpost CompareIndia History India MTV India In.com Burrp CNN name, logo and all associated elements ® and © 2016 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

Apple has unveiled a redesigned MacBook Pro, which incorporates smartphone-like touch-screen features into the keyboard and carries a higher price tag of $1,800 (NZ$2512). Apple has been furiously updating its smartphones every year, but it has been years since customers saw much more than basic refreshes of the company's highest-end laptop. READ MORE: • Gear Friday: Long wait for new MacBook Pros was worth it At its event, Apple spent considerable time showing off its newest innovation for its new MacBook Pro. The company called it the "touch bar," which replaces the long-standing function keys at the top of the keyboard with a small touch-screen strip. The touch bar changes depending on the program that is running on the computer. It offers quick typing suggestions in a word processor, emojis in a texting program, or volume and play buttons in a music program. It also offers "touch id," allowing the computer to be unlocked with a fingerprint. The 13-inch MacBook Pro without the touch bar costs $1,500 (NZ$2093). The new feature brings that price up to $1,800 (NZ$2512). The 15-inch screen starts at $2,000 (NZ$2791). Previously the MacBook Pro line started at $1,300 (NZ$1800). The rising price of Apple's notebooks is unusual in the consumer electronics world, where products such as big-screen TVs and computers become cheaper over time. But Apple has been making a bid to become an upscale retailer, something some analysts long ago thought was difficult to do in mass-produced hardware computers. Continued below. Related Content Fran O'Sullivan: Working with Tasman mates Auckland Les Mills trainer gets $48K after work fall Microsoft beats Apple at its own game "The price points for the new MacBook Pro models sit in a rarified stratum of the PC market," J.P. Gownder, a technology analyst at Forrester, said. Laptops and tablets designed by Microsoft, he added, "have eaten away at Apple's lead among both high-end buyers and creators, so Apple had to fight back . . . but Apple's deep brand loyalty will make the products successful among the target audience anyway." Price also appears to be the way that Apple is distinguishing its somewhat confusing lineup of laptops. The new 13-inch MacBook Pro is actually thinner and weighs the same as Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air, which was originally intended to be the company's ultra-light laptop. The MacBook Air is priced at $1,000 and is Apple's cheapest notebook. Beyond these computers, Apple also offers its traditional MacBooks at various screen sizes, starting at $1300. Apple said its new MacBook Pro has a 67 per cent brighter screen, a faster processor, and is lighter - four pounds for the 15-inch notebook, which Phil Schiller, Apple senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said was "almost unheard of" for a high-performance professional notebook. It can be ordered online starting Thursday. The Apple event comes just a day after Microsoft introduced two new expensive computers - the Surface Book laptop and the Surface Studio desktop. Microsoft took aim at its rival by noting that the Surface Book was three times faster than Apple's best 13-inch MacBook Pro. On Thursday, Apple had its chance to hit back. Apple kicked off its announcements with an unexpected subject: Apple TV. The company did not announce a new version of its set-top box, but it announced some new apps that could make the device more appealing to consumers. Apple chief executive Tim Cook said that Minecraft, the popular building game owned by Microsoft, will hit Apple TV by the end of the year. Twitter's Ryan Troy, the company's global lead for TV devices, also took to the stage to show off the new Apple TV Twitter app, which is being held up as a prime example of interactive viewing apps. Apple is trying to simplify the Apple TV for users - a key move as more cord-cutting services flood users with more options than they may be willing to sift through. With a new Apple TV app, simply called "TV," the company is aggregating users' many streaming options into one spot, making it easier to search and surface content. It looks somewhat like iTunes, but with television content. And it works with Siri for search. The app will look the same across Apple TV, iPhone and iPad and will be part of a free update in December. - Washington Post By Hayley Tsukayama Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

The Apple iPhone 7 and Air Pods. Picture: Beck Diefenbach, Reuters. Credit: REUTERS Inside this four-bedroom stucco house in Alameda, California, Kaiserman, president of the technology division at construction company Lennar, was pitching a vision of a home controlled via iPhone or iPad. Tap your phone, and AC/DC’s “Back in Black” blasts. Tap again, and the bath runs at a blissful 101 degrees. Sweet, right? Of course, your dad might view it as a bit over the top. All told, $30 000 worth of gadgets and gizmos were on display here, many run with Apple’s free HomeKit app. As iPhone sales growth slows, Apple is teaming up with a handful of builders and using these kinds of test beds to inch its way into the market for Internet-connected home furnishings, a nascent field that has attracted rivals like Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com. Video doorbells? The gamble is that pricey wireless home devices will be an easier sell when bundled into the home itself. Builders market granite countertops and brushed-nickel fixtures at thousands of models homes across the U.S. Why not video doorbells? Unlike Google and Amazon, however, Apple isn’t hawking hardware meant to connect the home. Instead, the HomeKit app could increase the value of its iOS ecosystem -- and make it tougher for users to switch to Android phones and tablets. “We want to bring home automation to the mainstream,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s vice president of product marketing. “The best place to start is at the beginning, when a house is just being created.” The convenience on display in the Alameda stucco doesn’t come cheap. A single motorised, battery-operated Lutron shade starts at $349. Or consider the Schlage “touchscreen deadbolt,” which can be controlled remotely, so you can text an unexpected visitor a code. It can retail for $200. A regular deadbolt fetches $32 at Home Depot - and there’s always hiding a key under the flower pot. $2 000 upgrade In Fremont, California, about 15 minutes from Facebook’s headquarters, Los Angeles-based KB Home is also getting its own Apple house ready. Along with the automated thermostat, lights, security system, locks, fans and shades, it lets you, on voice command, change the colour of the light underneath a vanity. With the words “good night,” the light turns purple. With a “good morning,” it switches to white. KB offers wireless devices as upgrades. A basic package runs about $2 000, “which once rolled into a mortgage is pennies a month,” according to spokesman Craig LeMessurier. Lennar builds the cost into the price of homes. The Alameda house sells for $1.2 million, though it was a beta model and an actual dwelling wouldn’t include $30 000 worth of gadgets. Apple is also working with Brookfield Residential Properties and other builders. The companies declined to say when the homes would go on sale. Consumers will buy about $24 billion worth of connected home devices in 2016, according to Strategy Analytics. Though that’s a drop in the bucket compared with smartphones, the research and consulting firm expects those sales to nearly double by 2020. For most people, connected homes remain a ways off, said Jonathan Gaw, an analyst with research firm IDC. The proliferating devices remain difficult to install in older homes and, in some cases, seem useless. Gaw cites the wireless candle he saw the other day. “Give me a break,” he said. “That only hurts the message. It tells people that we have gone too far. There’s too much crap out there, it’s only diluting stuff that’s really cool.” Wi-Fi onesie Even some who sell such gadgets say the hype may be getting ahead of the reality. The discount retailer Target Corp. opened its own Target Open House showroom a year ago in San Francisco. Shoppers walk through a futuristic home, watching prerecorded displays projected onto its transparent acrylic walls and furniture. In the nursery, a baby wears a Wi-Fi onesie -- made by a company called Mimo, founded by whizzes from MIT. It tracks the infant’s breathing, skin temperature, sleep and body position. When she stirs, it triggers the home’s lights, turns on soothing music on the Sonos wireless speakers and even tells the coffee maker downstairs to start brewing java for red-eyed parents. You can pick one up for $199. Many parents brew the coffee themselves and let their babies wail - or buy a traditional baby monitor for as little as $19.99. Connected home devices can cost five times the price of the old-fashioned version, according to Target spokeswoman Jenna Reck. “The smart home will get there but it’s not there yet,” Reck said. “Adoption is happening even slower than people predicted.” Disobedient devices As with all things tech, there is the matter of glitches, frustration and complexity. Markus Giesler, 40, equipped his 1924 house with an Apple home system so he could be a subject for his own academic research at the Schulich School of Business at York University in Canada. When the associate professor of marketing pulls up to the house in his BMW, the GPS on his phone alerts the garage door to open and turns on lights in various colors and brightness throughout his home, depending on his preferences and the time of day. At least, in theory, they do. “Certain devices obey, and some do not,” Giesler said. Homebuilders started offering smart devices such as automatic locks and thermostats more than five years ago. In its current model homes, Miami-based Lennar works with a company called Nexia, a unit of Ingersoll-Rand. Lennar’s Kaiserman hopes working with Apple will have a “halo effect,” helping convince customers that a new home in a subdivision can be a “cool” alternative to an existing one. True believer No doubt, Apple would be heartened by the experience of Ken Bieber. Last year, Bieber, a 39-year-old executive at a consulting firm, bought a $357 000 Lennar smart home after visiting a model north of Tampa, Florida. With his Nexia system, his lights automatically start dimming in the evening, signaling that it’s time to get ready for bed. When his wife, April, went into labor two months ago, he stayed with her in the hospital and texted a temporary entry code to a friend who walked the dog. Since buying his house, Bieber has spent another $1 000 for wireless motion detectors, a video camera and controls for his light dimmers, ceiling fans and irrigation system. Neighbours ask him for advice on their own smart home device purchases, and he plans to add motorised blinds. “I’ll be watching a movie and suddenly I have to get up and pull blinds - apparently it’s just too much for me at that point,” Bieber said. “I’m so used to saying things and they just happen.” Bloomberg Connect with us on LinkedIn Like us on Facebook Follow us on TwitterSHOW ALL International Primedia CEO Terry Volkwyn quits Trump plans worry dreamers Mozambique seeks debt deal Dollar hits 11 month high Dollar weighs on emerging markets Most Read Eskom leadership: Koko tipped to succeed Molefe 'Molefe's exit a blow to SA's nuclear plan' Trump plans worry dreamers Primedia CEO Terry Volkwyn quits Zuma reprimanded mines minister Advertisement MORE business internationalMenu News| Personal Finance| Budget| Companies| Startups| Markets| Indicators| International| Opinion| Leadership| Financial tools| Savings| WEF| business internationalMenu News| Personal Finance| Budget| Companies| Startups| Markets| Indicators| International| Opinion| Leadership| Financial tools| Savings| WEF| INFO About IOL Front page Market indicators Movie guide Newspapers TV guide Weather SITES BabyNet.co.za Glamour.co.za GQ.co.za Ilisolezwe Isolezwe IOL Jobs IOL Property IOL Sportzone Loot.co.za Classifieds WomanOnline SECTIONS News Business Sport Motoring Tonight Lifestyle Travel Scitech About IOL Front page Market indicators Movie guide Newspapers TV guide Weather

Picture: Beck Diefenbach, Reuters Boston - In a darkened master bedroom, David Kaiserman stood in shirtsleeves next to a turned-down king bed. “Good morning, Siri,” he said to the iPad in his hand, and the lights went on while the blackout shades retracted. “Your home is ready to rise and shine,” the virtual assistant replied. Inside this four-bedroom stucco house in Alameda, California, Kaiserman, president of the technology division at construction company Lennar, was pitching a vision of a home controlled via iPhone or iPad. Tap your phone, and AC/DC’s “Back in Black” blasts. Tap again, and the bath runs at a blissful 101 degrees. Sweet, right? Of course, your dad might view it as a bit over the top. All told, $30 000 worth of gadgets and gizmos were on display here, many run with Apple’s free HomeKit app. As iPhone sales growth slows, Apple is teaming up with a handful of builders and using these kinds of test beds to inch its way into the market for Internet-connected home furnishings, a nascent field that has attracted rivals like Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com. Video doorbells? The gamble is that pricey wireless home devices will be an easier sell when bundled into the home itself. Builders market granite countertops and brushed-nickel fixtures at thousands of models homes across the U.S. Why not video doorbells? Unlike Google and Amazon, however, Apple isn’t hawking hardware meant to connect the home. Instead, the HomeKit app could increase the value of its iOS ecosystem -- and make it tougher for users to switch to Android phones and tablets. “We want to bring home automation to the mainstream,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s vice president of product marketing. “The best place to start is at the beginning, when a house is just being created.” The convenience on display in the Alameda stucco doesn’t come cheap. A single motorised, battery-operated Lutron shade starts at $349. Or consider the Schlage “touchscreen deadbolt,” which can be controlled remotely, so you can text an unexpected visitor a code. It can retail for $200. A regular deadbolt fetches $32 at Home Depot - and there’s always hiding a key under the flower pot. $2 000 upgrade In Fremont, California, about 15 minutes from Facebook’s headquarters, Los Angeles-based KB Home is also getting its own Apple house ready. Along with the automated thermostat, lights, security system, locks, fans and shades, it lets you, on voice command, change the colour of the light underneath a vanity. With the words “good night,” the light turns purple. With a “good morning,” it switches to white. KB offers wireless devices as upgrades. A basic package runs about $2 000, “which once rolled into a mortgage is pennies a month,” according to spokesman Craig LeMessurier. Lennar builds the cost into the price of homes. The Alameda house sells for $1.2 million, though it was a beta model and an actual dwelling wouldn’t include $30 000 worth of gadgets. Apple is also working with Brookfield Residential Properties and other builders. The companies declined to say when the homes would go on sale. Consumers will buy about $24 billion worth of connected home devices in 2016, according to Strategy Analytics. Though that’s a drop in the bucket compared with smartphones, the research and consulting firm expects those sales to nearly double by 2020. For most people, connected homes remain a ways off, said Jonathan Gaw, an analyst with research firm IDC. The proliferating devices remain difficult to install in older homes and, in some cases, seem useless. Gaw cites the wireless candle he saw the other day. “Give me a break,” he said. “That only hurts the message. It tells people that we have gone too far. There’s too much crap out there, it’s only diluting stuff that’s really cool.” Wi-Fi onesie Even some who sell such gadgets say the hype may be getting ahead of the reality. The discount retailer Target Corp. opened its own Target Open House showroom a year ago in San Francisco. Shoppers walk through a futuristic home, watching prerecorded displays projected onto its transparent acrylic walls and furniture. In the nursery, a baby wears a Wi-Fi onesie -- made by a company called Mimo, founded by whizzes from MIT. It tracks the infant’s breathing, skin temperature, sleep and body position. When she stirs, it triggers the home’s lights, turns on soothing music on the Sonos wireless speakers and even tells the coffee maker downstairs to start brewing java for red-eyed parents. You can pick one up for $199. Many parents brew the coffee themselves and let their babies wail - or buy a traditional baby monitor for as little as $19.99. Connected home devices can cost five times the price of the old-fashioned version, according to Target spokeswoman Jenna Reck. “The smart home will get there but it’s not there yet,” Reck said. “Adoption is happening even slower than people predicted.” Disobedient devices As with all things tech, there is the matter of glitches, frustration and complexity. Markus Giesler, 40, equipped his 1924 house with an Apple home system so he could be a subject for his own academic research at the Schulich School of Business at York University in Canada. When the associate professor of marketing pulls up to the house in his BMW, the GPS on his phone alerts the garage door to open and turns on lights in various colors and brightness throughout his home, depending on his preferences and the time of day. At least, in theory, they do. “Certain devices obey, and some do not,” Giesler said. Homebuilders started offering smart devices such as automatic locks and thermostats more than five years ago. In its current model homes, Miami-based Lennar works with a company called Nexia, a unit of Ingersoll-Rand. Lennar’s Kaiserman hopes working with Apple will have a “halo effect,” helping convince customers that a new home in a subdivision can be a “cool” alternative to an existing one. True believer No doubt, Apple would be heartened by the experience of Ken Bieber. Last year, Bieber, a 39-year-old executive at a consulting firm, bought a $357 000 Lennar smart home after visiting a model north of Tampa, Florida. With his Nexia system, his lights automatically start dimming in the evening, signaling that it’s time to get ready for bed. When his wife, April, went into labor two months ago, he stayed with her in the hospital and texted a temporary entry code to a friend who walked the dog. Since buying his house, Bieber has spent another $1 000 for wireless motion detectors, a video camera and controls for his light dimmers, ceiling fans and irrigation system. Neighbours ask him for advice on their own smart home device purchases, and he plans to add motorised blinds. “I’ll be watching a movie and suddenly I have to get up and pull blinds - apparently it’s just too much for me at that point,” Bieber said. “I’m so used to saying things and they just happen.” BLOOMBERG Hungry for more business news?

It will offer a variety of controls that change according to the app or website that's open. It also has functions that will be familiar to many iPhone users — showing word suggestions as you type, for example, or letting you scroll through a library of emojis. The company unveiled the laptops at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, where executives showed how the Touch Bar works with a variety of apps and software — providing playback and editing controls for videos or music, for example, and search functions for Apple's maps and photos apps. Apple is also opening the Touch Bar to work with outside software, including Adobe's Photoshop editing program and Microsoft's Word, PowerPoint and Skype. Along with faster processors and brighter screens, two of Apple's new laptops will also get a fingerprint sensor, similar to the one on iPhones. The sensor can unlock the device, authorize software installations or recognize a different user and quickly switch to that person's settings. It works with Apple Pay, so users can authorize an electronic payment for online purchases. At least for now, the new Touch Bar and Touch ID features will be available only on higher-end models — a 13-inch MacBook Pro that starts at about US$1,800 and a 15-inch MacBook Pro at about US$2,400. Both ship in a few weeks. Starting Thursday, Apple is selling a 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar or Touch ID, but with other improvements, for about US$1,500. Older versions sold for prices starting at about US$1,300 for 13 inches and US$2,000 for 15 inches. Apple will still sell older MacBook Pros at those prices, along with less expensive MacBook and MacBook Air models. But its cheapest laptop, the 11-inch MacBook Air for about US$900, will be sold only to education markets. The company is also replacing some computer ports with new outlets compatible with USB-C standards, which can be used both for charging and transferring data. Connectors with USB-C technology can transmit data faster than older USB jacks. They are also smaller and have a symmetric shape, which means the USB-C jack can be inserted with either side facing up. But older USB printers and other devices will need adapters. The new Macs still have traditional headphone jacks, unlike the latest iPhones. Sales of the Mac have been in a slump this year, after a streak of growth in 2014 and 2015 that seemed to defy global trends. Consumers generally are buying fewer PCs and using smartphones or tablets instead.Apple itself has promoted its latest iPad tablet, the iPad Pro, as capable of replacing the laptop for many users. And in contrast with the Mac's earlier years — when Apple marketed its computers to people who saw themselves as creative professionals or just independent thinkers — Apple also has begun promoting the Mac as a computer for businesses, which once mostly used competitors' PCs running Microsoft's Windows software. Microsoft, meanwhile, has begun selling its own line of high-end Surface laptops and this week introduced its first Surface desktop PC. Analysts say the new Surface Studio has a premium price and features that will most likely appeal to visual designers and other creative professionals — an area that has been Apple's strength. Microsoft has boasted about modern controls with touch screens; the Touch Bar is Apple's answer to that, placed near the keyboard where people's fingers are already. For Apple, the Mac line has been eclipsed financially by other products — first the iPod and now the iPhone — that have made far more money in recent years. But the Mac has been important for Apple since co-founder Steve Jobs introduced the first model in 1984. It commands intense loyalty from fans. “The Mac is more than a product to us. It's a testament to everything we do and everything we create at Apple,” CEO Tim Cook said Thursday. Cook also used the event to promote a newer endeavor, Apple TV, and a new unified menu feature that shows recommendations and new episodes of recently watched shows, so viewers don't have to search through different apps to find them. Amazon's Fire TV is taking a similar approach with a software update, though the unified experience will be part of the home screen, not an app. Tweet < Prev Story   Next Story > ENTER COMMENTS - 3,000 Characters max ENTER IMAGE CODE  Receive China Post promos  Respond to this email Submit Terms Close By submitting your comments, you agree to the following conditions: Submissions are subject to review and edit, although The China Post is under no obligation to monitor your comments.

Home Auto Gadgets Hardware Internet IT Science Software Blogs Polls Submit News Hardware Apple Launches New MacBook with Two Missing Items Saimin (Blog) - October 29, 2016 1:00 AM Print Recipient E-mail Sender E-mail Apple’s new MacBook Pro comes in two sizes, 13 inch and 15 inch. It comes with a touch bar and touch sensitive display along with a touch ID sensor.       It will go in the market from $1400.00 to 1,700.00 and higher. The Apple TV, iPad and iPhone has TV app in USA.  TV app allows you to select the show that you want to watch from one central location and moves straight into the correct app.   As this has been the case in the past, the Apple app does not support Netflix, and jumping to correct app does not work in this case.  MBP 13 inch does not have new Touch Bar but it is repudiation of the top-end laptops layout.  The new MacBook Pro is a thinner and lighter Laptop with Touch ID fingerprint scanners but nether USB-A ports and SD card slot nor MagSafe power adapter. Instead it has quick access to emoji with Touch Bare, and 3.5 mm headphone socket.   To use existing accessories with the new Laptop, you will need adapters, which are not included.   EMOJI:  to use the Emoji feature, position the cursor in any text field that you would like to insert an emoji like a tweet then press the command + control key+ press the space bar and click on the Emoji icon on the sidebar. Here is an emoji box example.           The new laptop has OLED panel, which is better than standard keyboard, which replaces multi—function F keys and allows shortcuts to control window management and volume functions.  According to Phil Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing for Apple: “It’s a retina display, multitouch, responding to gestures and taps. We call it Touch Bar. First it replaces the standard system functions, but it goes way beyond that. It adapts to whatever software you’re using.”     Stephen Lam- Getty images     You could see emoji or Emoticons on the keyboard displayed, which was demonstrated at the Apple Event on October 27,2016 in Cupertino. Also, more about the functionality of Touch Bar was discussed and shown by Graig Fedeighi senior vice president of software engineering for Apple.           According to Apple media discussion at Cupertino’s event, the new 13 inch MBP can be upgraded with the Intel dual–core i5 or i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, 256 GB storage and Iris 550 with a faster gaming, video editing and 3D graphics performance, than previous versions.   According to Tony Avelar/ EPA.  Four Thunderbolt 3 USB–C mean that all old USB accessories will require adapter to connect them to new MacBook Pro.                                    If you are in the market for purchasing one, make sure to shop around, also it would be a bad idea if you wait a week or so for more reviews to come out with real pricing. However, we recognized in the past that Apple products do well with testing and this may be another one that just took or will take over the market.

Runners, which are a key market segment in fitness-oriented wearable devices, will clearly appreciate such improvement.” “Apple Watch Series 2 is also water-resistant up to 50 meters, and it even rejects the water from the speaker after being used under water,” Cardenal writes. “The new activity app allows swimmers to record workouts in both open water and a pool, and it includes sensors that count laps, average lap pace, and estimated calorie burn while swimming.” Apple Watch Series 2 with built-in GPS and water resistance to 50 meters   “Apple has partnered with Nike to develop Apple Watch Nike+ edition, which comes with unique specially designed sports brands, exclusive Nike watch faces, and the Nike+ Run Club app, which provides run reminders, challenges from friends, and weather-related alerts, among other fitness-oriented features,” Cardenal writes. “If industry demand is transitioning, and consumers are demanding increasingly more functionalities from smartwatches, then Fitbit will be fighting an uphill battle against Apple.” Read more in the full article here.

Comment Feed 13 Comments PC Apologist Thursday, October 13, 2016 - 5:58 pm · Reply I don’t think so. If Apple Watch is in Fitbit’s market segment, it’s horribly overpriced. If it’s in its a separate segment (it is), then Fitbit users aren’t going to overlap with Apple Watch users in huge numbers. whatever Thursday, October 13, 2016 - 7:11 pm · Reply It really is not that much more expensive especially for what you get. I think the Fitbits are overpriced $199 for a piece of plastic/rubber? I can have a great watch for $269 Krioni Friday, October 14, 2016 - 11:22 am · Reply Yeah. If the Fitbit was under $70, they’d be in a different market. At $150+, the Fitbit-to-Apple Watch upgrade is not huge. If you’re looking at paying over $150 to track your athletic activity, you’ll probably drop the extra $100 or so to get so much more. Spark Thursday, October 13, 2016 - 6:16 pm · Reply Not to mention that recent study that showed the Apple watch to be a far more accurate heart monitor than Fitbit. macnificentseven48 Thursday, October 13, 2016 - 7:55 pm · Reply Wall Street still claims AppleWatch is a monumental failure, so I’m not sure whether it’s considered a threat to Fitbit. Only recently Fitbit was downgraded on some particular fitness watch that wasn’s selling as well as expected but other than that there has been far more praise for Fitbit devices than AppleWatches especially in terms of device market share. Even though I don’t think they’re in the same class but Wall Street doesn’t care. Whatever company has the most market share in similar products, that company is declared the overall winner. peterblood1776 Thursday, October 13, 2016 - 9:49 pm · Reply Fitbit DIE!!!! niji Friday, October 14, 2016 - 1:20 am · Reply wow. i had to read more of the article to see who/what organization is putting out such lies and to try to understand the rationale behind claiming that apple Watch 2 threatens Fitbit. – Distribution. Fitbit is sold the world over in 3rd party electronics, fitness, lifestyle shops etc etc. repeat: the world over. – apple’s Watch barely is approaching parity in some kinds of usage as Fitbit’s offerings. – its so easy to find a Fitbit wearable that meets your requirements and the pricing is not fashion band related. – the appeal is completely different. kfaw Friday, October 14, 2016 - 1:48 am · Reply When the Apple Watch battery last more than it does now, which I think is eighteen hours, then I most likely buy one. My Fitbit Blaze last about three days. Grant it that it doesn’t do as much as the watch but improve the battery and I’ll buy one. zulaufdesign Friday, October 14, 2016 - 2:32 am · Reply I’ve had three Fitbits. None have lasted a whole year. I like the tracking software, and I really want to like the brand. But I’m done with them. Ordered the Apple Watch series 2 in aluminum with a white band last week. I expect it to be a far better deal given Apple’s product design and engineering. If this lasts less than two years, I’ll be shocked. So yeah, Fitbit should be worried. Apple is delivering far more economic value to customers. Especially those already in the ecosystem. Magoo Friday, October 14, 2016 - 12:53 pm · Reply My Fitbit Charge HR did not even last 9 months before the band started curling and the bezel scratches way easy….for a $150 watch…it’s junk….love my new AW series 2!!! 2Birds in Paradise Friday, October 14, 2016 - 9:02 am · Reply With 8 hours of battery I’ll stick to my Pebble steel and look forward to the Pebble steel 2. It’s a wonderful little smart watch that can go for 10 days plus. roguedog Friday, October 14, 2016 - 2:57 pm · Reply I don’t think Apple Watch will ever be a challenge to FitBit’s market share or sales numbers…, they are actually in fairly different segments of the market & mind share, and so will never meet. I do believe however that Apple Watch does challenge the axiom that FitBit is… THE …wearable fitness device. Billybobby Saturday, October 29, 2016 - 12:12 am · Reply I just don’t see it. Not the same people for the most part. Apple Watch is pretty much for Apple fans. Most people don’t see much use for one. I’ve got a bunch of Apple products and I have no interest in Apple Watch, oddly I find the Fitbit intreging and much better looking. Apple Watch just looks big and awkward.

I’ve found devices without GPS typically awful at measuring how fast and how far I’m running. And those with GPS typically do little more than measure how fast and how far I’m running. The basics are great for casual runners, but anyone who becomes a serious runner needs much more. I’ve logged more than 400 miles in the past six weeks with the GPS edition of Apple Watch, known as Series 2. I’ve also run 34 miles with the Nike Plus version in the past few days; it’s essentially a Series 2 watch with a custom wristband and watch face. With both, Apple addressed many of the shortcomings in the original watch, GPS being just one of them. I’m not ready to ditch my Garmin running watch yet, but the Apple Watch comes close to meeting all my needs. The importance of GPS The original watch does a fine job of latching onto your phone’s GPS if you’re running with the phone, but with built-in GPS you can leave the phone behind. Accuracy is on par with other good GPS watches, which is to say, measurements are sometimes off, especially when tall buildings block GPS signals. The watch automatically calibrates to my running style, so it’s better than non-GPS devices even when there’s no GPS. Though GPS drains the battery more quickly, the watch still had about an hour of non-GPS use left after a run of about four hours, 40 minutes. For normal use, Apple says you should get up to 90 minutes a day of GPS workouts; I’ve often gone longer without the watch dying before bedtime. It helps that I’ve disabled the heart-rate sensor during workouts. While Series 2 is meant for stand-alone running, many people carry phones anyway. With it, I get slightly better accuracy and battery life. Improvements for all Series 2 watches start at $369, though it’s $30 more for a larger screen — the optimal size for larger wrists. Non-GPS models, now called Series 1, are $100 less. All models get software updates that address two gripes with the original: Apple’s Workout app now records your route, something other GPS fitness devices and apps have long done. You can double tap the screen to record splits, or manual snapshots of how long it takes to run a stretch. Before, that was limited to mile or kilometer intervals. Nike extras Nike’s app offers a lot to like, including big yellow numerals for easy reading during runs and voice updates every mile and halfway toward your goal. Nike keeps things simple for beginners by displaying just distance and time; turn on advanced mode for current pace and heart rate. My gripes: no manual splits, and average pace appears only when pausing or through the voice updates. Nike excels in trying to motivate you even when you’re not running. It will keep asking “Are we running today?” by reminding you the weather is nice or that a friend (with a watch or just the phone app) is just ahead of you for the month’s total. Though the app is available for all models, the Nike watch also has a colorful wristband sporting holes to help sweat dry. It offers custom watch faces with one-touch access to the app, plus a reminder of your next scheduled run. Beyond running Cyclists get similar speed and distance information, though the watch doesn’t measure how fast you’re pedaling, something hard-core cyclists might want. You can swim with Series 2, even with chlorinated or salt water, something most water-resistant gadgets don’t allow. The watch measures distance indoors by counting laps, though you need a pool large enough for at least five strokes per lap. What’s still missing? Recording splits during runs is great, but I also want to know my average pace and time since the last split, rather than the beginning of the run. I find it useful when I want to go faster in the middle of a run before a gentle cooldown. And while Apple Watch syncs workout data with the phone’s Activity app, many runners already have their favorite online repository. The ability to move data around is limited. While Nike offers an Apple Watch app, it’ll take time for others to catch up.

Technology 1 0 0 October 28, 2016 MacBook Pro 2016 Review Roundup: Impressive With A Hefty Price, But Can It Save Apple’s Decline? Patrick Frye The MacBook Pro 2016 reviews are in. It seems to be a hit among veteran Apple consumers and might be what brings their shares back up in the final quarter of 2016 and maintain the rising profit streak. As previously reported by the Inquisitr, Apple’s stocks have dropped this year, breaking the 15-year streak of increasing profits. It may be due to the hefty price tag on their products or the push to “go green” under the direction of Tim Cook. It might also be due to the possible trend of exploding iPhone 7 devices, mirroring the problem Samsung has been facing with their Galaxy Note 7 and some appliances. The new MacBook Pro could change that with what many reviewers are calling a real break-through. The Mirror claims that the Pro is often overshadowed by the Air and the latest improvements to the stock MacBook, making it appear to be a “neglected workhorse.” Up until now, it seems, the Pro always seems to be the least popular option of the three. Apple’s new T1 chip that drives MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar runs “eOS”, a variant of watchOS https://t.co/4fMIBDX4Bx pic.twitter.com/hbhXGPmzrZ — iDownloadBlog (@iDownloadBlog) October 28, 2016 The sixth-generation Core i7 processor and ATI Radeon Pro graphics card with up to 4GB of RAM, combined with a 2TB SDD hard drive, make it what Apple claims to be up to 50 percent faster. The 15-inch model comes with 16GB of RAM, making it clearly superior to the 13-inch model. Better speakers are also allegedly part of the deal. However, what’s under the proverbial hood isn’t always a selling point. Sometimes, it’s the proverbial paint job and body work. What this means is that the MacBook Pro for this year not only performs better but looks and functions better overall. The first and most notable addition is the touch bar, which changes its function based on what you want it to do. You can drag applications into the touch bar to make it a programmable shortcut, much like the PlayStation 4’s touchpad, but much more versatile. Combine this with the back-lit keyboard and keys and you can even use it in the dark. For those who want to eliminate the mouse, the MacBook’s touchpad is much larger this time, so navigating the screen feels a lot more refined. Hopefully, Apple’s research made the touchpad palm-proof, because you’ll be resting your hand on it a lot. Apple expected to launch first MacBook Pro in 4 years https://t.co/oUv5wcYP3G pic.twitter.com/Tlvs1AmY6y — Michael Chase (@chasethisnow) October 28, 2016 Reviewers at the Verge say that the backlit keyboard is bright, but not distractingly so. Even more impressive is the programmable function of the keys themselves, via a menu. The touch bar has one major drawback, and that’s the lack of media playback controls when it’s customized. Thankfully, there is a button on the right that puts those controls back. If you want to skip a song while searching for information on Facebook, you aren’t stuck with it just because the touch bar is optimized for productivity. The Verge says that the keyboard might annoy some, as it’s identical to the one on the Air. However, the simplicity might be a plus if you’re not a fan of overwhelming numbers. The new 15″ MacBook Pro can push four 4K monitors at once https://t.co/DtPIdCyFmM pic.twitter.com/Fcvnmnr3M3 — Engadget (@engadget) October 28, 2016 Trusted Reviews says that the MacBook Pro is remarkably thinner than the previous model. This means it’s lighter and easier to tote around if you’re the type to use it on the go. The 2016 model’s non-button inputs and outputs include “four USB Type-C ports which can be used to charge the machine or as a thunderbolt, USB, display, HDMI out, or VGI ports. That means no MagSafe charger port.” This means that like the iPhone 7, there is no headphone jack this year. With improved speakers, you might not miss them unless you’re in a noisy room. The MacBook Pro powers up just by opening it and comes with a fingerprint ID so only you can use it. The biggest downside to Apple’s latest model is the price tag. At over $1,000 at the cheapest, even after an early price drop on Amazon, it’s no drop in the proverbial bucket for those on a budget. Of course, Apple has rarely ever made new technology affordable. If you have a 2016 MacBook Pro, what do you think of it?

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Developers can now hand out promo codes for in-app purchases By Steffen Reich, Oct 28, 2016 Tweet 1 Comment Apple is offering a new promotional tool geared towards app developers, now allowing the distribution of promo codes for early access to in-app purchases by means of iTunes Connect. The codes are limited to 100 promo codes for each in-app purchase and a total of 1,000 codes per app every six months. In a short news blurb added to iTunes Connect, Apple shares more details about the new in-app purchases promo codes: Give press and influencers early access to your app’s in-app purchases with in-app purchase promo codes. You can give away up to 100 promo codes for each in-app purchase item, up to a maximum of 1,000 codes per app, and the codes expire 28 days after they are generated. You can request promo codes if you have an Admin, App Manager, or Marketer role in iTunes Connect. Concessions for paid apps have been available for a while but free apps relying on in-app purchases proved difficult, as in-app fees were detached from the original app purchase and could not be unlocked through a promo code. The move will find a ready welcome, as developers now get the freedom to allow the press or influencers access to specific features of their app that used to be locked behind a paywall. In-app purchase promo codes can be requested on iTunes Connect and are programmed to expire 28 days after they have been generated. In line with previous promotional code policy, they do not grant the receiver of the code the right to rate the app on the App Store once downloaded.

Apple's iOS 10, the latest version of its iPhone and iPad operating system, packs some great new features like an all-new lock screen, an improved keyboard and updates to most of Apple's existing apps. However, we've also experienced loads of iOS 10 issues, from crashes and bugs to weird new features that we really don't like. If you're experiencing problems with iOS 10 as well, don't fret. We've been kind enough to compile this extensive guide to some of the biggest iOS 10 issues and how to solve them, quickly and easily. And if you're rocking an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus, take a look at our iPhone 7 tips and tricks guide for more ways to get the most out of your iPhone. Read next: How does iOS 10 run on an iPhone 5s or iPhone 6? iOS 10 issues solved: App crashes When you update to iOS 10, chances are not all of your old apps will work as expected. Since we've updated, we've had dozens of apps fall on their arse every time we try and load them. Between crashes and the rest, it can be pretty frustrating. Thankfully the answer is almost always quite simple. Like the time-honoured tradition of 'turn it off and turn it on again', all you need to do to solve 95 per cent of these app woes is delete the troublesome app and then reinstall it. To delete an app, just push your finger against the icon and hold it there until all of your apps begin to shake. Note that if you have the iPhone 6s or above, you'll need to push the icon very lightly, or 3D Touch will think that you're trying to open the shortcut menu. Once everything's jiggling, just tap the X at the top right corner of the app icon and it will be deleted. Head to the App Store and re-download the app (which won't cost you a thing if you've already bought it). When this is done, the app will hopefully work as before. iOS 10 issues solved: Running out of storage A common problem with iPhones and iPads is running out of storage space, which means no more room for your photos, videos and apps. And good ol' Apple decided not to include microSD memory card support, so users can quickly and easily expand the on-board storage. However, there are plenty of ways to get around this issue. Check out our full guide on how to add extra storage to iPhones for more info. iOS 10 issues solved: Disable having to push the home button to unlock your iPhone with Touch ID One of the most irritating new 'features' of iOS 10 is having to push down the home button on your iPhone or iPad in order to unlock them with your fingerprint. No longer can you simply rest your digit on the surface, an action we were all very much accustomed to. Thank the purple stars then that this little issue can be solved in your iPhone or iPad's settings menu. Once you're inside the Settings menu, tap General, followed by Accessibility and then find and tap Home Button. One of the options in here is called 'Rest Finger to Open' and it's disabled by default. Turn this on with a tap of the virtual switch and you'll no longer have to push the button to unlock your iOS device. Phew! iOS 10 issues solved: Worse battery life If your iPhone or iPad battery life is suddenly a lot worse since you updated to iOS 10, chances are there's one or two culprits that you need to clamp down on. To find out what's killing your battery life, head to the Settings app and then tap Battery. In this menu you'll see a handy breakdown of everything that's been sapping your iOS device's power. Tap the 'Last 4 days' tab to get a more accurate report. If the top of the power-sucking table is inhabited by an app that you don't really need, then getting rid of it could help to get your battery life back to normal. Anything with 'Background activity' next to it is allowed to operate even when you're not actively using it, which means it could be draining your iPhone or iPad's battery without your knowledge. If this is the case, head to the General menu in the Settings app and then tap 'Background App Refresh'. Turn this feature off for the biggest power-draining offenders. If you find yourself running low on power when you're nowhere near a plug socket, try activating Apple's Low Power Mode. Head to the iPhone or iPad's Settings, then Battery. This turns off some key iOS features but will help to prolong your device's remaining life, so you can keep in touch with your contacts. iOS 10 issues solved: Bluetooth has stopped working properly One of the biggest irritations when we first updated to iOS 10 was our Bluetooth gear failing to properly connect each time we turned it on. Sometimes our wireless headphones would connect to our iPhones, but we wouldn't hear any sound through them. Other times, our Bluetooth gear would just refuse altogether to pair up. If you're having these problems too, try heading to the iOS 10 Settings and then General, and then scroll to the bottom and tap Reset. In here, tap the Reset Network Settings option. You'll need to re-enter your WiFi details when this is done, as well as pairing your Bluetooth kit again. However, with any luck you won't have connectivity issues any longer. Note that this method can also be used to resolve most WiFi issues in iOS 10. iOS 10 issues solved: New emails don't appear or the Mail app won't accept your password If you get your mail through Apple's mail app, there's a chance that you might not be seeing any new messages popping up in your inbox after updating to iOS 10. Alternatively, the Mail app might not even let you log in with your email ID and password, claiming that your credentials are crap. This problem may also rear its ugly head if you're using a different mail app, including Gmail or other popular clients. In most cases, this can be resolved by removing the impacted email account and starting again. To do this, head to Settings and then Mail. In here, choose Accounts. Select the account that you're having issues with and choose sign out. With that done, hit 'Add Account' and re-enter your details. Hopefully this should solve the problem. iOS 10 issues solved: iMessage effects If you find that those cool new iMessage effects aren't working on your iPhone since you updated to iOS 10, check to see if you have 'Reduce Motion' enabled on your device. Head to the iOS 10 Settings, then tap General, and then Accessibility. In here you'll see the Reduce Motion option, which will either be on or off. If it's on, give it a poke and flip the virtual switch to turn it off. You should then see those snazzy iMessage special effects. Do you like this article?

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > Apple Says It's Out of the Standalone Display Business Apple Says It's Out of the Standalone Display Business Friday, 28 October 2016 (2 weeks ago) Alongside the new MacBook Pro, Apple introduced a 27-inch 5K UltraFine Display made in partnership with LG, calling into question future plans for an Apple-branded display product. While rumors have suggested Apple is working on a Thunderbolt Display replacement powered by an integrated GPU, Apple's LG partnership seems to indicate that Apple may have shelved plans to build a new display, something that's been confirmed by The Verge's Nilay Patel. According to Patel, Apple told him it is out of the standalone display business. Good notes by @jsnell. I can add that Apple told me it's out of standalone display biz. https://t.co/6t1KqQODwD — nilay patel (@reckless) October 28, 2016The last rumors about an Apple-branded display came in June of 2016 from BuzzFeed's John Paczkowski, a reliable source, so if Apple has ceased work on its own display product, it's a decision that may have been made rather recently. In lieu of its own display, Apple is selling the aforementioned 5K display product from LG and a second LG-branded 4K display, both of which have been designed with input from Apple and optimized for Apple products. As pointed out by Jason Snell of Six Colors, the brightness and settings of the LG display can be adjusted from the Mac, suggesting a deeper level of hardware integration than you'd get with a standard 5K display. Priced at $1,299.95, the 5K LG UltraFine display uses multi-stream transport and connects to the new MacBook Pro using a single Thunderbolt 3 cable. Because it requires Thunderbolt 3 connectivity, it's only compatible with the MacBook Pro (and any future Macs equipped with Thunderbolt 3). LG's 21.5-inch 4K UltraFine display is more affordable at $699.95, and because it doesn't require Thunderbolt 3, it's compatible with any USB-C Mac, including the new MacBook Pro and the less powerful MacBook. Both displays offer charging capabilities, support for wide color gamut, built-in stereo speakers, and include additional ports on the back for connecting accessories. The larger 5K display also includes a camera and a microphone, offering all of the features that might have been included in an Apple-designed display.Related Roundup: Thunderbolt Display Buyer's Guide: Displays (Don't Buy) Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit Tech - 2 weeks ago< > Embed Could iPhones Soon Start Folding in Half? 00:43 According to sources, Apple has just received a patent that could make future iPhones fold in half.

It was the first policy change since Facebook bought the messaging service in 2014. The authorities, known as the Article 29 Working Party (WP29), requested that WhatsApp stop sharing users' data with Facebook until the "appropriate legal protections could be assured" to avoid falling foul of EU data protection law. WhatsApp's new privacy policy involved the sharing of information with Facebook for purposes that were not included in the terms of service when users signed up, raising questions about the validity of users' consent, the regulators said. A WhatsApp spokeswoman said the company was working with data protection authorities to address their questions. "We've had constructive conversations, including before our update, and we remain committed to respecting applicable law," she said. Facebook has had run-ins with European privacy watchdogs in the past over its processing of users' data. However, the fines that regulators can levy are paltry in comparison to the revenues of the big U.S. tech companies concerned. Meanwhile, Apple has vigorously defended a tax settlement in Italy led by one of its senior Irish-based executives. The company agreed to a settlement of €45,000 for unpaid taxes in the country without any finding of law-breaking. Michael O'Sullivan, head of Apple's Irish-based unit, Apple Sales International, agreed the tax settlement with Italian authorities. "Michael has agreed to settle this case on behalf of Apple in order to put the matter behind us," a spokesman for Apple told the Irish Independent. "He has our full confidence and support and remains an important part of our management team in Europe." The case was the first of its kind to be brought against any Apple employees in Europe relating to unpaid taxes. Italian prosecutors swooped on Apple's offices in 2013 and alleged that the company's scheme for redirecting revenues to Ireland was illegal under Italian law. However, Apple says that it adhered to all Italian legal guidance from authorities. "Apple has always complied with the instructions we received from the Italian tax authorities and during a tax audit in 2012 the authorities again confirmed we were filing our local tax returns correctly," said the Apple spokesman. "In 2015 the tax authority contradicted its guidance and said they now believed Apple had not filed its returns from the correct entity. When the authorities changed their view we complied." The Apple spokesman said that Michael O'Sullivan acted properly at all times. "Michael O'Sullivan has worked for Apple for over 25 years and has always operated with the highest integrity," said the spokesman. "He is a valued member of our finance team and his responsibilities include oversight of the team filing some of our international tax returns and other regulatory requirements since 1999."

Apple says that developers can give away up to 100 promo codes for each in-app purchase item, up to a maximum of 1,000 codes per app every six months. That means if you have 10 in-app purchase items, you could distribute all 1,000 codes spread across those 10 in-app purchases. In the past, some developers have been able to offer free in-app content for promotions via workarounds, but this change is official, works similarly to normal promo codes for redeeming full apps, and is available to all developers with in-app purchase content on the App Store. I recently ran into a situation where a developer asked me to look at an app, but couldn’t provide a promo code because the content was behind an in-app purchase. Thus, I was not able to explore the entirety of the app without paying for the in-app purchase. Needless to say, this is a very welcomed change for developers and members of the press.

USB, Firewire, eSATA, etc: they're not sexy, but they're important. They decide what you can do on your device and how quickly you can do it. So, when Apple introduced its latest MacBook Pro laptops with Thunderbolt 3 ports, you probably didn't think much about it - until you realised that Apple ditched every single port on its old machines and replaced it with just Thunderbolt 3. So, what does that mean? Well, if you want to connect anything to the new MacBook Pro, you'll need to do so via the Thunderbolt 3 ports. You can't simply plug in your devices via existing cables and connectors. If you want to do anything with the new MacBook Pros, you're going to need to buy new cables or adapters with a USB Type-C connector (about £226 worth, in fact). Why would Apple do this? The answer is easy: Thunderbolt 3 is the one port to rule them all. Here's everything you need to know. What is Thunderbolt 3? Intel introduced the Thunderbolt platform in 2011 at a time when USB 3.0 was all the rage and could transfer data at speeds up to 5Gbps. Thunderbolt was capable of twice that, plus it could transfer multiple types of data, not just serial data to storage devices. It could, for instance, pipe video data to displays. It could also daisy chain devices together, such as your hard drive to your computer and a display to your hard drive. Intel Thunderbolt 3 is the latest version of Thunderbolt, and it uses the same design as the familiar USB Type-C connector. Intel uses the new connector for a number of reasons. Early versions of Thunderbolt relied on a Mini DisplayPort style connector, and Apple was the only major manufacturer to embrace Thunderbolt. But now that Thunderbolt uses a USB Type-C connector, it is starting to show up in not just new MacBook Pros but also new ultrabooks and notebooks. Thunderbolt 3 first appeared with Intel's Skylake chips that rolled out in 2015, so that's why you're seeing a tonne of devices showing up this year with Thunderbolt 3 ports. Apple is sticking with Thunderbolt 3 because it can do a lot with a single cable. It supports the DisplayPort protocol, for instance, so you can use one cable to daisy-chain and drive multiple 4K displays at 60Hz. Thunderbolt 3 allows for connection speeds up to 40Gbps, double the speed of the previous generation, USB 3.1 10Gbps, and DisplayPort 1.2. It also offers USB speeds of up to 10Gbps, and it can connect up to two 4K displays, outputting video and audio signal at the same time. It also supports DisplayPort 1.2, HDMI 2.0, and 10GbE fast networking. Plus, Thunderbolt 3 is backwards compatible to Thunderbolt 2. What is USB Type-C? Thunderbolt 3 first features a USB Type-C connector. USB Type-C is the latest USB connector that everyone's talking about. It's replacing Micro-USB connectors used by most Android phones and even USB Type-A, which is the standard USB connector people imagine when they hear "USB". Apple's 12-inch MacBook even has a single USB Type-C port. Pocket-lint USB Type-C is well-known because it allows for quicker data transfer. By default, USB Type C offers 7.5W and 15W transmissions, whereas USB 3.0 offers 4.5W transmission. USB Type-C also allows your devices to charge, because it can transmit up to 100W, which is enough to charge most laptops. That means you can use a single cable with a USB Type-C connector to quickly transfer data to your device while you charge it. But the most interesting thing about USB Type-C is that the connector is reversible: there is no "right way up". You can just blindly stick it into a port on a device, and it'll smoothly go in and work. Why is Apple using Thunderbolt 3? Apple has embraced Thunderbolt 3 not only because of its USB Type-C connector but also because of Thunderbolt 3's features. One computer port can connect you to Thunderbolt devices, all displays, and billions of USB devices. It provides four times the data and twice the video bandwidth of any other cable, while also supplying up to 100W of power. You can use it to connect your Mac to displays, transfer data quickly between computers and hard drives, daisy chain external devices, and power up - all with just one physical connection. Intel For years, Macs have had USB ports and Thunderbolt ports and now they're combined. The thing to remember about Thunderbolt 3 is that although it uses the same shape connector as USB Type-C, it offers support for a wider range of different standards (HDMI, USB, DisplayPort), and it does everything faster while supplying power. You just need the right cable to plug into it. Not all USB Type-C ports support Thunderbolt 3. While smartphones and tablets may use the connector, the Thunderbolt platform is only available on devices with Intel processors. So, while you can technically plug any USB Type-C device or cable into a Thunderbolt 3 port, it won't support Thunderbolt's features. And a Thunderbolt 3 peripheral plugged into a regular USB Type-C port won't support Thunderbolt features either. Do other laptops use Thunderbolt 3? Pocket-lint Apart from Apple's latest MacBook Pro laptops, tonnes of laptops offer Thunderbolt 3 ports. The Asus Transformer 3 and Transformer 3 Pro, Alienware 13, Dell XPS 13, HP Elite X2 and Folio, HP Spectre and Spectre x360, Razer Blade Stealth, Lenovo ThinkPad Y900, and dozens more have shipped with Thunderbolt 3 ports. Ultrabook Review has a comprehensive list of all the laptops now available with Thunderbolt 3. Want to know more? Check out the Thunderbolt 3 promo video above and Intel's FAQ page.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Ridiculous IDC Survey Says that After the Note7 Recall, 50% of users switched to the iPhone 7 based on 12 Converts | Main | Sharp President Confirms in Speech that Apple will be shifting to OLED Displays » October 28, 2016 The Battle between Microsoft and Apple Events focused on the Pro Market Sets Off a Firestorm   Earlier today Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Executives Continue to Hold the Philosophy that Touch Screens Aren't Right, but Not Everyone Agrees." I was late getting the report out this morning because I was taken aback at how much negative press the Apple event was generating. The day after a Steve Jobs event and the press was buzzing about Apple for hours, days and weeks. The euphoria was like nothing that I've ever seen. Every event we were on the edge of our seat waiting for that gotcha moment when something cool would be announced or the 'One more Thing' would be uttered. Apple was on fire and everything Jobs touched turned to gold. Apple was toppling Microsoft and the world still didn't even see it coming. If was such an electifying era. Yesterday was yet another boring event. Today, there was hardly a story to read except for the negatives ones for the most part.   What made it worse was that Apple's event was coming after a successful Microsoft event. If anything I was more pumped hoping that Apple was really going to hit it out of the park with it's new MacBook Pro and new iMac. Oh ya, Apple was going to show Microsoft up and crush them with true innovation. Ouch. We got a TV app that no one outside the U.S will be able to use and a nifty tiny little modern F-Key bar replacement. And ….. well, that's it. That's what we waited four and a half years for.   The back to back events seemed to show that one company was damn hungry to innovate and win back their market while the other show was slow and too focused on a single new feature that didn't impress most. Maybe in the long run it will. But on the surface without the 'Touch Bar' extending to the iMac's keyboard and more new things to get excited about, it was deafening how small that single innovation felt like.   MIT was first up to kick Apple today with a report titled "Microsoft Is Looking Like the New Apple." The report stated that "This week, one giant technology company looked like an innovator, launching a sleek new suite of forward-looking hardware to help media professionals work more effectively. Another added a row of buttons to an existing computer. In the past, Apple would have been the former—for the moment, at least, that role has shifted to Microsoft."   The report further noted that "At an event in New York on Wednesday, Microsoft unveiled the sleek, futuristic-looking Surface Studio: a 28-inch all-in-one PC that converts into something akin to a digital drafting table. Reclined at about 20 degrees, it can be used with a dedicated stylus and so-called Surface Dial—a small puck that adds a mechanical means of interacting with the touchscreen.   Microsoft also launched a new set of tools to create art in 3-D, which the company imagines people will view using its HoloLens. Or, perhaps, a VR headset, given that Microsoft also made good on its promise to help make the devices ubiquitous. It's been working with HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus, and Acer, and promised that all will soon all ship VR headsets for $300.   Apple, meanwhile, showed off its latest hardware offering on Thursday: an updated version of its MacBook Pro laptop. With—drum roll, please—a new row of buttons. They are, admittedly, very smart buttons. Actually a slim second screen, they adapt depending on which program is being used, and there's also Apple's fingerprint-sensing Touch ID built in to enable login, payments, and other secure operations.   More important than price is what the announcements signal about what the companies are trying to achieve. Microsoft is now attempting to push the boundaries of what computing looks like, by trying to change the way we interact with desktop devices and providing the tools for us to become more involved with the virtual world.   Apple, meanwhile, appears to be stuck in a rut. As we've explained before, it seems to be struggling to look far beyond its existing products. Instead, it's simply adding new features to already successful devices rather than reinventing our relationship with technology."   Over at BGR, they posted a report titled "Developers and creative pros are blasting Apple's new MacBook Pro." The report tore into Apple by stating that "Apple's new MacBook Pro has created quite a stir in the Mac community, with many developers and creative professionals expressing outrage and frustration that Apple has seemingly created a Pro machine that is decidedly underwhelming and watered down.   Apple pissing off the pro community is an especially interesting dynamic because, as many seasoned Mac observers can attest, Apple managed to survive some of its darker days in the early to mid 90s precisely because the Mac was the computer of choice for a wide swath of creative professionals."   Business Insider took a shot at Apple today in a report titled "For crying out loud, Apple, just build a touchscreen Mac already." The report concluded "It's time for Apple to take the next step, swallow its pride, and join the PC world in offering a laptop with a touchscreen that's actually useful."   The Next Web posted a report titled "All the disappointments from Apple's MacBook Pro event." The report noted that "Apple announced a refresh of its MacBook Pro line-up yesterday, and aside from one major feature, it was mostly an iterative update.   That's disappointing, given how long it's been since Apple last overhauled the design and hardware of its flagship laptop. Plus, it was just the previous day that Microsoft stunned the tech industry with its innovative Surface Studio, which represents the company's forward-thinking approach to computing.   Ultimately, it's clear that this is not Apple's finest hour. The company did its best to talk up its new products on stage yesterday with flashy visuals and fancy voiceovers, but the wishy-washy presentation only served to expose Apple's inability to innovate as it once did."   Forbes posted a report titled "Apple's New MacBooks: Out Of Touch Or Just In Time?" MacDailyNews picked this story up and retitled it "Apple Will Remain Loyal lto the Mac until Mac users Die Off." There was a lot of anger from some. One comment on the report was as folllows:   lol…"Apple will remain loyal to the Mac until Mac users die off"   Apple is killing the Mac Users… they are not waiting for them to die off….   Nowhere is this more evident than in what Apple choose to call PRO… in all their devices! Its a shame, its a Huge and Disastrous Mistake.   I hope i am proven wrong when the next iMacs and Mac Pros are released… way sooner than later….. hell its already way late….   Wake-up Apple… you are losing your core reputation and followers…… next thing you know no one will give a shit anymore.   Where is all that R&D money going?….. jet black? two cams? touch strip? they Ignore battery case? the pencil that never stays with its device and is missing elementary functions. ..with the most stupid charge solution?. mouse with weird charge port?   No Pro products?……..10 billion$ plus r&d and growing and growing… for fashion? and Apple Dogma? Where is the Wonder ? the wonder we all loved.   Of all the events I've seen, this one seemed to set a lot of people off. After watching the Microsoft event the day before I was really pumped for the Apple Event yesterday thinking Apple would outshine Microsoft hands down. Unfortunately when I saw Cook winding down the event I was thinking, really, that's it?   For many pros, as we've shown in this report, the event was a real let down. A sign that after four and half years the Pros got left behind. They see Tim cook and gang pushing all things iOS. Cook said to the Telegraph in 2015, "Why do you need a PC anymore?" Some feel that after seeing Apple's only move in four and half years being so anemic, that the writing for Pros is on the wall.   Remember that it was Steve Jobs who set Apple on this path; who set this mentality down playing PC's or Mac's as trucks in a world of cars. It's no longer a mass product, move on. But for Pros, those that were the ones who kept Apple afloat when they were about to go under, the most loyal of the loyal, now feel slighted and yesterday's event didn't impress them in the least. Microsoft's focus on the creative pro community is unique because they're really tapping into the Mac communities core and appealing to them. They just might win that niche if they stay committed to this group as Apple focuses on all-things iOS.   Yet I still believe there's one more event to come in the first half of 2017 with updates to the iMac, Mac Pro and more. Apple was likely waiting for the new i7 core processors for desktops that got pushed back by Intel. Apple's next event could be the home run we were hoping for yesterday and it could be a way to end that doubt that's lingering in the pro community that Apple just doesn't give a damn about them anymore.   Writing about Apple's patents every week, I'm able to see so much innovation on the drawing board. So to those that felt let down by yesterday's event, keep the faith and wait for Apple's next event for the heavy hardware to come. I think the air will be recharged and the fire in-their-belly return.   Will that really come to be? I believe it could. If I'm wrong, then the fall out that we've witnessed over the last 24 hours will exponentially explode and it could push Apple's pro community to call it quits and jump ship. Today we've heard just a few testimonies that it's already begun. But it could just be the tip of the iceberg. I hope the captain makes the right call soon.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Observers who have been diehard Apple fans are casting jealous eyes towards the new Microsoft products. Meanwhile, some observers who have been against Apple for political reasons are making some solid observations that don’t have the traditional earmarks of being self-serving and misinformed. [Note: this discussion isn’t about phones. Or VR. Or games. It’s about PCs and Macs.] Did Apple make everything right with the Mac community yesterday? Did the company heal the wounds from so much product neglect? Are Apple’s instincts about the Touch Bar better than Microsoft’s instincts about how technical and creative professionals want to work? Has Microsoft shown signs of a reinvigorated ability to innovate under CEO Satya Nadella? These are some of the questions that are on my mind in the aftermath of those two events. Microsoft Surface Studio. 28-inch touch screen. Image credit: Microsoft Let’s walk thorough the Microsoft PC technology, then some of the reactions. First, there’s a good product overview of the Microsoft Surface Studio over at The Verge. “Microsoft’s Surface Studio is a stunning desktop computer.” There, you’ll find videos of analysis by The Verge and Microsoft’s introduction event. Next is Mashable’s article. “What it took to design the Surface Studio.” Lance Ulanoff spoke with Ralf Groene, Microsoft’s head of industrial design and revealed key insights into the design. After reading these articles and viewing the videos, you’ll have a really good feeling for what the Surface Studio is all about and the innovation involved. One decent article that summed up the event comparison was at MarketWatch. “Apple demolished by Microsoft at their respective PC events.” Articles like this won’t make Apple happy, but then, as an old boss once told me, “perception is everything.” Apple, having dealt from a position of technical strength and favor for so long, seemed to get wrapped up in the Touch Bar to the exclusion of its overall customer base. The USB-C-based 2016 MacBook Pros get so immersed in the idea that touching the display of a notebook computer is ergonomically unsound that they’ve ended up forcing the customer into certain technical and operational cubbyholes. I mentioned a few yesterday. More importantly, the painful gap in time from the last MBP updates (March, May 2015) seemed to overwhelm the technical significance of the Touch Bar. When contrasted to what Microsoft has achieved with the Surface Studio, the reaction amongst the press, perhaps for the first time, came down with sobriety and logic on the side of Microsoft. The Surface Dial rests on and works right on the display itself. Image credit: Microsoft. One of the things that may have assisted in this assessment was the Surface Dial (US$99) which, on the surface, has the instinctive technical feel of something from a science fiction future in contrast to Apple’s touch sensitive Touch Bar which is merely cool. (But see page 2 here for more.) Time will tell if Microsoft’s instincts prove superior or are simply a trade-off in concepts. In the meantime, Jason Snell at Six Colors looks at the relative merits of touching your work or touching the Touch Bar in “Perpendicular philosophy.” These products are very new. We’ll have to see how the two philosophies end up meeting consumer needs and which turns out to be solid money maker. But the sense I have, at this early stage, is that Apple had become complacent and was caught by surprise. Nadella’s Microsoft which had met with so much derision under Steve Ballmer is now the fresh thinking underdog in the PC arena. Apple is not the kind of company that explicitly, outwardly acknowledges this possible shift. Healing will have to come in the form of its new product designs and decisions from now on. And less stony silence. Now, on to Apple’s vision. That’s on page 2.

After watching the MacBook Pro keynote, I can firmly say that Apple is repeating the steps of the early 1990’s. Confusing product lineups and ridiculous pricing that started with the new MacBook last year. I bought an Apple watch 6 months ago and now I’m selling it because I never used it for anything other than getting notifications. The excitement is gone. I was actually excited watching Microsoft’s keynote the other day. There was no excitement watching Apple’s canned keynote – where everything is magical and the most beautiful thing Apple has ever created. The Apple magic is over. It’s been 5 years since Steve left and Apple is in reverse. October 28, 2016 at 5:21 EST PM Jamie October 28, 2016 I’ve got some time left in my Mac, so I’ll see where Apple goes before jumping ship, but at this point I’m not hopeful. I’ve been using their stuff since 1995 professionally, and since the 80s as a student. Would be sad to bid them adieu, particularly given they are the only tech company whose privacy policies are worth a damn and that’s no joke these days. Nevertheless, I can’t argue with the fact that a Surface Pro beats the pants off of an iPad Pro as a professional tool. What a weird world. October 28, 2016 at 5:46 EST PM geoduck October 28, 2016 bdkennedy1: You are dead on with your comparison with the early ’90s Apple. Lots of things, but few that actually work as advertised. Lots of models, but none that really do what you want. To that they’ve added gadgets like the AppleWatch that are gee whiz neat, but really do little that I, or if the recent BBC article its to be believed, few others need. Meanwhile their desktop Macs are moribund, their AirPort routers are very out of date, they’ve dropped displays completely, the iPod line is dieing. I was impressed by the Surface Studio. That said I am not getting a system running Windows or any derivation of Windows. I run that at work and I’m not doing that at home as well. So what to do. Spend $3k-$4k on a laptop that isn’t really as good as I wanted but already cost more than I budgeted to spend? Or should I go with Linux system which I can get build to order with better specs, but it won’t work with anything else in my ecosystem and I’ll have to learn all new applications for graphics and movie making, and writing, and layout etc., etc.? Or maybe become a goat herder and say f-it to all these computer things. October 28, 2016 at 5:46 EST PM Lee Dronick October 28, 2016 I disagree with you all on the Apple Watch. I find it very handy for things in addition to notifications. As to yesterday, time and the Apple Watch will tell if it was a death knell. October 28, 2016 at 5:55 EST PM geoduck October 28, 2016 Been pondering this MacBook business. You know, I might wait and get the next gen iMac instead. I use my iPad for most of my mobile work. The MacBook spends 75% of its time on my desk attached to a monitor. I like having the ability to take it with me, but really any more it’s the iPad. I could get an iMac with better specs, more space AND a 27 inch 5k display for $800-$1000 less than an equivalent MacBook Pro, which I’d want to connect to a monitor most of the time anyway. Does anyone know of a good remote desktop app for the iPad that would let me run an iMac from across the room? October 28, 2016 at 6:31 EST PM macjeffff October 28, 2016 256 GB SSD in a $1799 laptop? So, I have to spend $1999 to get something usable with the new Touch Bar, before I buy AppleCare? And then I’m forced to buy a bunch of dongles, and keep track of them? The Touch Bar looks absurdly thin, doesn’t it? I guess that saves production cost. The new MacBook Pro is nice, but I’m going to put off buying one until the next generation. I can hang on for another year or so. I’m disappointed though, because I was ready to buy. I bet their numbers will be disappointing. I think the problem is Jonny Ive. I wish they would just tell him work on the car, and let people with fresh ideas for the Mac and the iPhone take over. I’m convinced he’s the bottleneck that’s starving the product line. October 28, 2016 at 6:54 EST PM skipaq October 28, 2016 Until Apple gets the message that thinner is not always good design, they shouldn’t design cars whose major selling point is they are thinner and lighter. October 28, 2016 at 8:54 EST PM Lee Dronick October 28, 2016 “Does anyone know of a good remote desktop app for the iPad that would let me run an iMac from across the room?” There are such apps, but I don’t know how well they work or how comprehensive they are. October 28, 2016 at 10:54 EST PM Lee Dronick October 28, 2016 Remote desktop app Jump Desktop (Remote Desktop) – RDP / VNC by Phase Five Systems https://appsto.re/us/_e5Vv.i October 28, 2016 at 10:57 EST PM DudeMac October 28, 2016 The problem with Microsoft’s hardware is that it ships with Windows and I’m sorry, but I don’t like Windows all that much as it’s just not that user friendly to use. IMHO, it’s a cluttered mess with a chock full of confusion to boot. I just returned to using Windows professionally after about a 10 year hiatus and even with Windows 10 I have to say that I’m not all that impressed. Some things like refreshing the Desktop manually simply because some files got moved around, other files get trashed and so on but failed to take notice on-the-fly is just plain dumb. I have some other gripes, but that one definitely sticks out. And Microsoft has yet to get it right with the CLI though PowerShell is a step in the right direction, but falls short when compared to Bash or Zsh! October 28, 2016 at 11:37 EST PM JonGl October 29, 2016 The problem isn’t Ive per se, but that Apple seems to be depending on him too much to replace Steve’s vision. But he’s not Steve. Steve always had an overarching vision, and he was ready to move heaven and earth to achieve it. Ive was his greatest tool in the toolbox, but he was just a tool. He has good vision for things, but he is not a mover and shaker, and he doesn’t have the status of CEO nor Steve’s drive. Simply put, his temperament is not Steve’s. IMO, Tim is the problem. His focus is on many things that have nothing to do with creating product. The proof of that is that he was actually seriously considered to be Hillary Clinton’s running mate! Why would that be? He’s more politically inclined than product-minded. Apple has diluted priorities, and frankly, I am not sure they even know what their priorities are or what they ought to be. IMO, that’s their greatest problem. They are busy building buildings all over the world, and expanding their presence, playing benefactor to the world, rather than making product–good product. Now, I don’t think that any of those things are bad, but the problem is that they seem to consume Apple more than making product. It’s like they have a cash cow, and don’t know what to do with it to take it to the next level. Lack of vision… October 29, 2016 at 3:01 EST AM vpndev October 29, 2016 I just wonder if Apple had more to show but pulled it when they saw Microsoft’s lineup? I don’t think it’s likely but it certainly wouldn’t be the first time. What was shown with updated MBPs doesn’t match Tim Cook’s comments a month or two ago about renewed interest in the Mac. Not at all. October 29, 2016 at 10:12 EST AM skipaq October 29, 2016 I don’t think there is a problem with I’ve as head of design. He rightly fights for everything he believes in. Certainly the direction that Apple has taken over the last few years is Cook’s responsibility. I couldn’t watch more than a couple minutes of the watch our products get thinner presentation. Could they honestly think going in that this thin Mantra plus a touch bar was going to bring Mac users to their stores. I’ve seen more exciting diet infomercials. They have been sacrificing function for the sake of esthetic design. There is no way around faulting Cook for allowing that to happen. Surely there must be someone at Apple who can speak up for the way users use Macs, especially pro users. They should make pro products and take the pro moniker off of these MacBooks. Their products are getting too thin and their product line is dangerously thin. October 29, 2016 at 10:17 EST AM Lee Dronick October 29, 2016 I just wonder if Apple had more to show but pulled it when they saw Microsoft’s lineup? I don’t think it’s likely but it certainly wouldn’t be the first time. What was shown with updated MBPs doesn’t match Tim Cook’s comments a month or two ago about renewed interest in the Mac. Not at all. I am thinking they had other products that were not far enough along to debut. October 29, 2016 at 12:26 EST PM BurmaYank October 29, 2016 The image of  I’m getting from its recent announcements & after hearing these thoughts discussed here is of a gifted operation with an expert manager who is no leader;  has been without any leader since a year or so before Steve died. ’s rudder works well, but is adrift without a course-charter. October 29, 2016 at 9:34 EST PM MarcusNewton October 29, 2016 I am in the same boat as Geoduck, I have a 2014 MacBook Pro 15″ that sits on my desk 80% of the time hooked up to other equipment. I was really hoping for new desktop Macs from the hello, again keynote, but I came away, as many did, really disappointed. The new MacBook Pros are nice, but a bit expensive for me. I am shocked that they are still selling the older model MacBook Pro and kept the price the same for almost 2 year old hardware. Jonathan Ive’s bulimia problem and Angela Ahrendts’ luxury pricing is seriously making me reevaluate my commitment to Apple. I guess I better start taking classes to study up on Linux. October 29, 2016 at 11:07 EST PM roarcjw November 1, 2016 I am so disappointed with Apple. They used to be so clued in as to what the consumer is looking for. Now it seems that they are stopping up their ears and regurgitating the same old commercialize pitch but with no innovation behind it. Listen to what the people want! I’m amazed that Microsoft is now out appling, Apple! November 1, 2016 at 12:20 EST PM wab95 November 1, 2016 John: I’ve been away for awhile due to unavoidable circumstances, but have monitored, when possible, the traffic at TMO. There has been no small amount of not simply angst but dysthymia, anger and outrage over many things Apple, particularly the recent Mac event, in that interim. I’ve been uncertain if and when to post this, as well as under which column, but this seems as appropriate a place as any. It has been argued at TMO that one of Apple’s most important user bases, graphics and video professionals, have had a disproportionate role in propagating Apple products and enlisting new Apple clients, and that by not listening to and addressing the needs of this sector, Apple are engaged in a bloody-minded self-immolation that will possibly lead to an exodus that will cost the company their relevance and perhaps their future as a leader, with references being made to the Apple of yore and Ballmer’s MS. Apple’s failure to address these users’ demands with the Mac event was a spurn worthy of fury. John Kheit, for example, and not to pick on him, as he’s a smart bloke who makes excellent points, has argued for a customisable Mac Pro, as have you and others. Personally, I think that that is an excellent recommendation. For 1997. In 2016 it’s a more challenging justification, particularly in the harsh light of cost/benefit analysis to a company already challenged to meet demand across all devices, and may be even more so in future. Here’s why. I see two trends at Apple (Caveat Emptor: this is a layman’s opinion). Indeed, I’d say that these are more than trends, but two major revolutions. The first has been a steady but substantial demographic transition in the user base. The current user base is fundamentally distinct, in both demand and practice, from that of the 1990’s and early Naughties (2000’s). Taking the entire universe of Apple clients, the overwhelming majority are iOS users and not macOS users. That said, I’d venture that the video/graphics professional sector comprises substantially less than 1% of that universe. Indeed, with the halo effect that has seen increased adoption of the Mac platform, I’d argue that this sector may even less than 1% of current macOS users. In the 1990’s, perhaps this sector was important for inspiring adoption of Apple products, however we now have retail stores and an arguable critical mass of users across all sectors, including science, medicine, law, architecture, agriculture, security and law enforcement and so on. Thus, modelled adoption is no longer as dependent on movie product placement as it once was, and may even be irrelevant. The technology is accessible and adoption is spurred by one’s own peers. Regarding the hardware, current MBPs have more processing power than many supercomputers of 30 years ago. In my field, what I cannot do on my MBP, I will probably not be able to do on a Mac Pro either, and will require university level resources. The old user base has been displaced by a newer one with different needs and demands. Apple’s cost/benefit ratio for addressing a single and dwindling niche like video editing may no longer be tenable let alone germane to the company’s future, which leads to the second trend or revolution. That second trend is a focus on AI and smart management of the user experience. Beyond the personal assistant, this is about smart management of device and platform performance, including workflow, memory, battery life, device interoperability, cloud-based back up and storage, security, information access and so on, that in many ways, has a multiplicative effect on the raw computational power, data storage and access needs of today’s users that exceed the big iron solutions of the 1990s. This AI-powered paradigm appears to be the future, in which Apple have as much at stake as any other tech company, whereas in enhanced legacy devices, that is, mechanical power, for a dedicated use case has diminishing returns, particularly if there are readily available options, like Linux boxes, out there that can address that need. This is no longer SJ’s Apple. That fact may be driven far more by exigency and industry trend than by any single CEO and senior management team. Chasing, indeed, leading those trends is essential for any company’s future, whereas if anything is a recipe for irrelevance and death, it is likely stubborn adherence to the past. In my view, suffering unrequited love from one’s preferred vendor is irrational. If anything, we’re witnessing a convergence of solutions, with variations on themes. I’d venture that the current environment has never been more amenable to experimentation and platform switching for users. If one vendor’s specific options do not address one’s needs, then find one that does, and be happy and productive.

For certain applications – drawing, music, tabletop games – it seems like a winner. Too bad it doesn’t run iOS. 🙂 November 1, 2016 at 8:01 EST PM archimedes November 1, 2016 Physical gadgets for the iPad have been around for a while – I’ve been interested in trying out the Tuna Knobs ( http://www.tunadjgear.com ) with various music apps. November 1, 2016 at 8:05 EST PM webjprgm November 1, 2016 Thank you wab95, someone needed to say that. Sometimes TMO becomes too much of an echo chamber for the same ideas and they’ve become rather depressing of late. I hope Apple knows what they are doing, though I am a little frustrated by some of the trends that I don’t find personally useful. (I like thin, but I still want USB ports rather than tons of adapters. Or include a couple adapters in the box to appease us.) I do think the Touch Bar is something that will spread to desktop Macs and is the start of a cool future in new interface interactions. I also think the vast majority of people I meet (professions) can do all they need on a laptop, including myself, if you just add a desktop monitor for convenience when needed. And it’s the direction I prefer, if you add in extra computing resources in the monitor/dock (GPU, drives, memory, etc.). But in any case, Apple still puts out high quality products so I’ll be hopeful they keep making things I can use. They still beat Windows for OS and the laptop hardware is still prettier than the competition. I also think Apple bottle-necks itself a little more than they need to. They could delegate Mac Pro updates to a team that doesn’t need any executive / Cook / Ive input to just update the internal specs each year. Really, why not? They can hire a bunch of people to do nothing but update and test these machines each year. But I don’t (yet) consider this problem to be the death of the company. Every company has some flaws.

Not sure what the differences are and how they affect you? Read on to learn more. Apple’s MacBook Pro with Touch Bar sports USB-C ports with USB and Thunderbolt support Understanding the USB Naming Mess USB, or Universal Serial Bus, is kind of a complicated mess with loads of letters and numbers like A, B, and C, 1.1, 2.0, and 3. Then there’s mini and micro muddying up the list, too. Since mini and micro aren’t used on Apple’s computers, we won’t worry about those. The letters tacked on the end of USB describe connector types. A, for example, is the flat rectangle port first introduced on the original iMac. B is the little house shape typically found on printers and other devices like USB microphones, and C is the thin flat slot with round ends. What we don’t get from those letters is which protocols can pass through the connectors. For that we turn to the numbers. USB 1.0 is the oldest and slowest. USB 1.0 Low Speed transfered data at 1.5 Mbit/s and USB 1.0 Full Speed handled 12 Mbit/s speeds—painfully slow compared to later USB protocols. USB 2.0 came along later with 480 Mbit/s transfer speeds, and USB 3.0 bumped that up to 5 Gbit/s. USB 3.1 takes that up to 10 Gbit/s. USB 3.0 is also known as USB 3.1 Gen 1, and USB 3.1 is USB 3.1 Gen 2, because the engineers behind these protocols clearly hate us with the fire of a thousand suns. How USB Names and Protocols Fit Together Now that we have USB ports and protocols under our belts it’s time to see how they fit together. Luckily, this is a lot easer than sorting out the protocols. USB A—the flat USB connector we’re familiar with from almost two decades of Macs—can support USB 1.x, 2, and 3.x. Apple started phasing USB 3 into the Mac lineup in 2012, and earlier models support USB 2.0. Older USB versions are supported, too, so a USB 3 Mac also supports USB 2 and 1, and a USB 2 Mac also supports USB 1. UBS-C connectors support USB 3.1 (or USB 3.1 Gen 2, for those engineers who want to make our eyes bleed) and earlier, but they can also support other protocols, too. That’s where Thunderbolt 3 comes in. Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C Thunderbolt 3 needs a way to connect to your Mac, and the port type it uses just so happens to be USB-C. Remember, the “C” designates a connector type, not the protocols that pass through it. Along with Thunderbolt 3, The USB-C connector also supports Thunderbolt 2, USB 3.1, USB 2, and USB 1 protocols. You can also pass DisplayPort, HDMI, and Ethernet through USB-C if you have the right adapter dongle. That makes USB-C sort of like the One Ring to Rule Them All of device connectors because it can be used for pretty much everything. MacBook Pro with USB A port (left) and USB-C port (right) Power to the Ports USB-C is also designed to handle some serious power—enough to charge your laptop. That means the same port that sends data to your external hard drives, keyboard, and printer, also powers your laptop. The upside is that USB-C frees up space by being thinner and more versatile. The downside is that it means MagSafe power connectors are a thing of the past. Seeing MagSafe go kind of sucks because it’s been an awesome way to keep our Macs from flying off coffee shop tables when someone snags the charger power cord with their foot. USB-C or Thunderbolt…Which is on My Mac? USB-C ports look exactly the same if they support just USB protocols, or USB and Thunderbolt. If you plug a USB device into a USB-C port it’ll just work, but plug a Thunderbolt device into a USB-C port that supports only USB protocols and nothing happens. Here’s how that breaks down for Apple’s laptop lineup today: The MacBook includes a single USB-C port that support USB 3.1 and earlier. The Retina MacBook Pro with Touch Bar USB-C ports support USB 3.1 and earlier along with Thunderbolt 3 and earlier. This is one of those situations where you just have to know which protocols your Mac supports because there aren’t any clever visual cues to give you a hint. That said, plugging a Thunderbolt device into a USB-only USB-C port isn’t going to blow up anything—but you’ll still want to know what your Mac supports before you rush out and start buying peripherals. And those engineers who came up with this crazy letter and number scheme for USB? Seriously. What did we ever do to them?

It certainly was a good idea, and worked in either orientation. Could someone come up with a dongle that has a similar magnetic breakaway? October 28, 2016 at 10:00 EST PM Frank V October 29, 2016 Lee, there is one for USB-C connecters, Griffin makes one: https://griffintechnology.com/us/products/cables/usb-c-cables/breaksafe-magnetic-usb-c-power-cable BTW I guess this means that my Thunderbold 2/display port Ethernet adapter, I use to connect my MacBook Air now, will be as useful in the time to come as my SCSI and FireWire stuff. Or is there a cheap adapter? I saw a $ 49 one, but then it is cheaper to buy a new Ethernet adapter. October 29, 2016 at 5:16 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

It’s compelling, and the people who’ve had hands-on time with it say it’s all that and a bag of chips*. We’ll be reviewing it in-depth, but the thing that really stood out for me was this: Touch Bar is Apple’s double down against the ToasterFridge. More specifically, Touch Bar is Apple’s solution for the same need that ToasterFridges are trying to fill. A woman using Touch Bar on MacBook Pro Say the What? To lay out my case, we need to go back to netbooks. Remember those? They were all the rage a few years back. Apple spent a couple of years denigrating Netbooks while analysts and pundits criticized the company for not offering one. But while Apple executives hammered on netbook quality and experience, and insisted customers weren’t happy with them, the company was also very clear never to denigrate the need netbooks filled. People wanted an ultra portable device to consume content on the go, do email, and other light needs. Apple never said people didn’t want that, and instead said that netbooks were the wrong solution. It was all said in Cook Code™ and a couple of throw away comments from Steve Jobs. To loudly toot my own horn, I put those pieces together and argued that Apple was planning to compete with netbooks with an “iPod Supertouch.” To continue that tooting, I nailed it. Apple released the iPad and netbooks were gone faster than you could say “Samsung’s Galaxy Tab 10.1 was a shameless knockoff.” ToasterFridges Apple’s quest against the two-in-one devices has taken a similar tack. CEO Tim Cook and other executives have called tablets that convert to a laptop and computers with touch-sensitive displays “ToasterFridges.” That epithet is intended to belittle such devices. While the unwashed masses don’t care, I’ve little doubt that this term has had some effect on analysts and others in the industry. “ToasterFridge” successfully frames such devices as ungainly, hacked-together kludges. Words have power, and Apple’s CEO uses Cook Code™ effectively. But just as with netbooks, Apple has never bashed the user need that ToasterFridges are trying to fill. Touch controls are useful for some things. Just as styluses are useful sometimes and mouses have their use and keyboards remain the best way to type. None of these user input methods are best at all things, but each is best for certain things. ToasterFridges came about in part because the PC industry was looking for some way to compete against iPad. But they’ve found adherents precisely because there is a user desire to harness the power of touch while keeping the utility of a keyboard. Apple has never said there’s no such need. Instead, Apple has said that ToasterFridges offer a poor user experience, and that the company doesn’t think people want to touch their computer screens. Touch Down And Lo! Let there be Touch Bar. Apple hasn’t talked smack about ToasterFridges in a while. But when Touch Bar was introduced, it was obvious Apple was serious about its stance on such products. Touch Bar harnesses the power of touch (as well as the power of context-aware keys, but that’s another issue) without users having to dirty up their displays with grody fingerprints. It’s how Apple always approaches these new paradigms. The rest of the world throws blunt force trauma at new ideas, while Apple uses finesse, subtlety, and diverse disciplines to identify a need and provide an elegant solution. My only real complaint about Touch Bar is that I can’t use it on my iMac. Hopefully that will change. Bro, What about that Smart Keyboard? I hear you, bro. The iPad Pro (12.9-inch) with Smart Keyboard is very much an acknowledgement that Microsoft’s Surface Pro has some legitimacy. But in hindsight, I see the Smart Keyboard as less of a ToasterFridge and more acceptance that iPad Pro (both models) are powerful enough for content creation, and that typing is easier and faster on a physical keyboard. But iPad Pro is still not a ToasterFridge, and I suspect that Touch Bar is Apple’s signal that it will never become one. *As the kids say**. **Kids are still saying that, right? Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: Apple, MacBook Pro, ToasterFridge, Touch Bar 9 Comments Add a comment skipaq October 28, 2016 I like the touch bar concept over touch screen laptops. But Apple has limited their marketing to consumers and low level pro users. There is a need to appeal to a wider market. If this is all they have coming near term they risk losing the gains of recent years. They tout their ecosystem; but much of that ecosystem seems to be going extinct. They just seem to have lost their focus. October 28, 2016 at 9:19 EST PM Matthew Sorensen October 28, 2016 Bryan, I have to respectfully disagree with your assessment about iPad Pro not being a toasterfridge. I have been an avid Apple enthusiast since the Summer of 2000, when I got my very first Mac. Since that time, I started collecting Macs, and I have now acquired 27 Macs. (I know, it’s a little much) Everything from a 512k Macintosh, PowerMac G4’S, iMacs, an eMac, Mac Mini, Clamshell iBook, and a lot more. And my newest being a 2014 MacBook Air. Anyway, when I upgraded to an iPhone 6+, from an iPhone 5s in 2014, I gave my mom my iPad mini because I thought my iPhone 6+ could replace my iPad. I was wrong. I still needed a tablet, and the 6+ was too big for me. I stuck with my 6+ until this last June when it suffered from the infamous “touch disease” I got a 6S, but now, I definitely needed a tablet. And seeing as though I only had being using Macs, for the past 15 years, I thought I would give the Surface Pro 4 a chance. And in part, because I had been running Windows 10 on my MacBook Air, and I really liked it. When I got my Surface Pro 4, (with type cover), I was blown away with pretty much everything about it. Number one, the keys on the type cover are full size, and are spaced just like the keys on a MacBook Air. And just like the MacBook, they are backlit. Number 2. The type cover has a glass, multi-touch trackpad. It’s not nearly as big as the trackpad on a MacBook, I’ll give you that. But, it is very usable, and I personally have had no issue with it. And as you pointed out, having a trackpad fits. Also, to your point about the Smart Keyboard, in 2010, when Steve Jobs was introducing the redesigned MacBook Airs, he made a point about how “Touch surfaces don’t want to be vertical. It gives great demo, but after a short period of time, you start to fatigue, and after an extended period of time, your arm wants to fall off.” This is true! But thankfully like I said, my Surface has a glass trackpad, so I don’t ever have to be in that situation! The same cannot be said for iPad Pro. It does not have a trackpad. And just because it’s an iPad, and not a Mac, does not mean your arm will not want to fall off. It will. And that actually brings me to my third, and final point. Windows 10. Windows 10, is actually a really great OS! Microsoft has definitely learned from their mistakes from Windows 8, and 8.1, when their OS really was a confusing toasterfride. (Also, that’s when Tim Cook made that comment” Like I said, they have learned. As an example, when my keyboard is attached, the UI is optimized for keyboard and mouse, and when I remove the keyboard, the UI changes to a more tablet friendly UI, and it really does! Contextual menus change, the UI for all of your apps change, and it really does offer an amazing tablet experience. I am a very picky user, and I have a very low tolerance for a less than great experience, so believe me when I say, the surface pro 4 is an amazing device. And I even forgot to mention the adjustable kickstand, which lets me adjust the screen to pretty much any angle, like a real laptop, which is also something the iPad Pro can’t do. Bottom line, at the end of the day, people will need to choose the device that is right for them, and in my case, the Surface Pro 4 fits the bill, and from my point of view, offers a vastly better, and uncompromised experience. Something I cannot say about iPad Pro. Thank you. October 28, 2016 at 9:52 EST PM Lee Dronick October 28, 2016 There is a need to appeal to a wider market The iPad, and other tablets market? October 28, 2016 at 9:53 EST PM JonGl October 29, 2016 @Matthew- I’m with you. I’ve only had my Surface Pro 4 for a couple weeks, and already I’m seeing its future. I was shocked to discover that even InDesign has a touch-specific interface! I thought I would have to seriously tolerate Windows 10, but on the Surface, it’s quite good, and the morphing interface is useful, though, to be honest, I tend to keep it out of tablet mode. 😉 However, the unsung hero is the kickstand. I thought it would be a problem, especially in switching to tablet, but I find that even in tablet mode it’s great. I can keep it open and use it as a handle, but its best use is to open it all the way when sitting on the sofa, and use it as sort of a “hook” over my crossed leg that both holds it in place and helps it sit at a comfortable angle that a flat slab cannot do. I was really worried that I’d come out hating the kickstand, but so far, it’s one of my favorite features. That and the pen. I love taking a screen shot, writing on it, and sending the result to somebody, or even, on occasion, just keeping it for future reference. I love the precision of the pen as well as the ability to write and have it converted to text just like with my Newton–ok, “just like” is an exaggeration. The Newton could write anywhere on the screen. This is more like the PalmOS, but still… it’s nice to have that again. I really don’t know what Apple has for us in the future, and I’m not going to say their best days are behind them–people said that about Microsoft–but for now, I’m entirely OS agnostic. I have iOS, Android, Mac and Windows, and maybe even some Linux still on board. No more “all in one basket” that’s how I view my future. October 29, 2016 at 3:19 EST AM memrystax October 29, 2016 Spot on. Apple builds world class tools with full time content creators in mind, which tends to mean minimal-kludge-factor when it comes to hardware design philosophy. For instance, when the Surface Book hit the shelves I found the concept intriguing, so when I saw one in the store, I couldn’t help but give it a quick test drive. Hated it. Even brand new, the screen wobbled every time I touched it. How was I supposed to get precise work done if every time I needed to touch the screen I had to hold the display still with my other hand? And trying to use a stylus on an upright screen always feels like kindergarten and crayons, not worth the effort. Neither is any of this a physically restful way to work. When you have hours of content creation effort ahead, more strain on the shoulders will tend to reduce productivity. Unfortunately, Apple has internalized this philosophy so well that they don’t do a good job of articulating the base line advantages of having a huge, extremely precise, non-mechanical track pad combined with the simple elegance of the touch bar. That’s where they miss Steve. He was never afraid to expose the competition’s weaknesses–disembowel them on stage in fact–in order to fully spotlight the rightness of their design choices. I stick with Apple because of the inherent stability of macOS and iOS, and for the fact that when I’m working, I always feels as though I’m working with professional tools that do not get in the way or try to mix too many interaction metaphors just to score points with pundits. October 29, 2016 at 6:43 EST AM skipaq October 29, 2016 The iPad, and other tablets market? I was speaking of the PC market that a tablet doesn’t satisfy. The mini needs updating. The MacBook line needs entry level, consumer level and pro level (yes, these should be upgradable) products. They should also go back to making a true MacPro tower that pros can tinker with to their particular use. I do not believe the Mac is viable in just the form factor they just announced. It cannot be beyond the talent level for Apple engineers to built a tower or upgrade the mini. They can do this while still pushing the innovation forward in iPhone, iPad and MacBook. October 29, 2016 at 11:18 EST AM NorthSaanichBC October 29, 2016 Like in the story of “The Emperor’s New Clothes”, we need someone to point out what should be obvious… The Surface PC (and similar laptop models from other companies) is just a rehash of the Microsoft Tablet PC. In 2002 Microsoft introduced the Tablet PC. It was a Windows laptop with a touch screen, a pen, and a removable keyboard, so that you could use your Windows PC as a “tablet”. Other PC manufacturers came out with their own versions of the Tablet PC. At first, it was hailed as the future of computing, and like the Surface and other current “convertible” PCs they sold well at first. But after a few years, and people actually using the Tablet PCs, sales dropped off. People bought regular notebook PCs (which were less expensive) or bought Netbooks (those also died off after a few years on the market). Then in 2010 Apple introduced the iPad. It brought a fully multi-touch operating system (instead of trying to shoehorn a desktop operating system into it) and apps, it was much lighter and thinner than a laptop (and did not require fans to cool it), and it was affordable. By 2010 Tablet PCs were dead, and the iPad put the nails in the coffin of Netbooks. So here we are today. The Surface type of PC is the new Tablet PC. It has a newer version of Windows, and technology has advanced to make it thinner and lighter, but it is still a Windows PC laptop with a removable keyboard, and it is still more expensive than a competitive notebook PC. The Surface and Surface-type notebook PCs are expensive, thick, heavy, run hot requiring internal fans, and they run a desktop operating system and apps that have really require an external keyboard and pointing device. I doubt that anyone would buy a Surface or Surface-type notebook PC without ever needing to use an external keyboard and trackpad or mouse. Those things are necessities for using a Windows desktop operating system and apps that run on Windows. In contrast, iPads hardware and software are fully self-contained and designed specifically for multi-touch use. External keyboard covers are options that some people buy, but most users never buy one at all. And no external mouse or trackpad is necessary or even available for the iPad, because it is designed specifically for multi-touch only… There is no cursor on screen to drive with a pointing device, as we see in desktop operating systems and computers. iPads and MacBooks are two entirely different types of computing devices. The hardware, software and user interfaces, are entirely different from each other. Apple’s executives have stated on many occasions that it makes absolutely no sense to try to combine the two different types of devices into one. We will (fortunately) never see a Mac computer with a multi-touch display… And that is a “very good thing”. October 29, 2016 at 5:33 EST PM Rick Allen October 29, 2016 I think the “ToasterFridge” moniker was a bit of a diversionary and marketing tactic. The Surface Pro 4 is a great device as is the iPad pro. I own both. I have my reasons for using the Surface Pro 4 as my mobile device. As a MS SQL administrator / Developer I got tired of living in a Remote Desktop world or trying to find some app that would let me work. Surface Pro 4 means I don’t have to compromise. I also don’t see the device as a compromise between a tablet and a pc. It is entirely different as described in the above comment by Mathew Sorenson. I also think the Apple pattern is to denigrate anything that they see as a possibility until they have a solution. Then lo and behold the new iPad pro adds come out saying “I’m a computer.” I have stopped being a fanboy for any technology. I tell people what I use and why, however I am not going to proselytize for the Apple brand. Use what works for you! Apple is limiting my choices right now both with the iPad pro and the new MacBook lineup, so my MacBook Pro is going to live a while longer in my household. If I could say anything to the Apple management about what this Pro user needs, it would be “Please give me choices!” October 29, 2016 at 7:57 EST PM A October 31, 2016 Bryan, Totally agree with your assessment! Apple has thought through the issue of when it is appropriate to use touch and or stylus (IPD pros). You just forgot to mention the seamless content sharing inside the apple ecosystem. Create on any device….share with all! There is the real reason MacBook Pros will never be toaterfridges! October 31, 2016 at 1:10 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Apple revealed its new line of MacBook Pro laptops as well as a new Apple TV app. — AFP photo APPLE’S high-end Mac laptops are getting a touch control strip above the keyboard, part of a long-awaited update aimed at reviving interest in a product often overshadowed by newer gadgets like the iPad and iPhone. The new Touch Bar, which is both a narrow display and a control panel, replaces the old physical function keys on a traditional laptop. It will offer a variety of controls that change according to the app or website that’s open. It also has functions that will be familiar to many iPhone users – showing word suggestions as you type, for example, or letting you scroll through a library of emojis. New features, higher price The company unveiled the laptops on Thursday at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, where executives showed how the Touch Bar works with a variety of apps and software — providing playback and editing controls for videos or music, for example, and search functions for Apple’s maps and photos apps. Apple is also opening the Touch Bar to work with outside software, including Adobe’s Photoshop editing program and Microsoft’s Word, PowerPoint and Skype. Along with faster processors and brighter screens, two of Apple’s new laptops will also get a fingerprint sensor, similar to the one on iPhones. The sensor can unlock the device, authorize software installations or recognize a different user and quickly switch to that person’s settings. It works with Apple Pay, so users can authorize an electronic payment for online purchases. At least for now, the new Touch Bar and Touch ID features will be available only on higher-end models — a 13-inch macbook Pro that starts at about $1,800 and a 15-inch macbook Pro at about $2,400. Both ship in a few weeks. Starting Thursday, Apple started selling a 13-inch macbook Pro without the Touch Bar or Touch ID, but with other improvements, for about $1,500. Older versions sold for prices starting at about $1,300 for 13 inches and $2,000 for 15 inches. Apple will still sell older macbook Pros at those prices, along with less expensive macbook and macbook Air models. But its cheapest laptop, the 11-inch macbook Air for about $900, will be sold only to education markets. The company is also replacing some computer ports with new outlets compatible with USB-C standards, which can be used both for charging and transferring data. Connectors with USB-C technology can transmit data faster than older USB jacks. They are also smaller and have a symmetric shape, which means the USB-C jack can be inserted with either side facing up. But older USB printers and other devices will need adapters. The new Macs still have traditional headphone jacks, unlike the latest iPhones. Laptops vs. tablets Sales of the Mac have been in a slump this year, after a streak of growth in 2014 and 2015 that seemed to defy global trends. Consumers generally are buying fewer PCs and using smartphones or tablets instead. Apple itself has promoted its latest iPad tablet, the iPad Pro, as capable of replacing the laptop for many users. And in contrast with the Mac’s earlier years – when Apple marketed its computers to people who saw themselves as creative professionals or just independent thinkers – Apple also has begun promoting the Mac as a computer for businesses, which once mostly used competitors’ PCs running Microsoft’s Windows software. Microsoft, meanwhile, has begun selling its own line of high-end Surface laptops and this week introduced its first Surface desktop PC. Analysts say the new Surface Studio has a premium price and features that will most likely appeal to visual designers and other creative professionals – an area that has been Apple’s strength. Microsoft has boasted about modern controls with touch screens; the Touch Bar is Apple’s answer to that, placed near the keyboard where people’s fingers are already. For Apple, the Mac line has been eclipsed financially by other products — first the iPod and now the iPhone — that have made far more money in recent years. But the Mac has been important for Apple since co-founder Steve Jobs introduced the first model in 1984. It commands intense loyalty from fans. “The Mac is more than a product to us. It’s a testament to everything we do and everything we create at Apple,” CEO Tim Cook said Thursday. Baby steps in TV Cook also used the event to promote a newer endeavor, Apple TV, and a new unified menu feature that shows recommendations and new episodes of recently watched shows, so viewers don’t have to search through different apps to find them. Amazon’s Fire TV is taking a similar approach with a software update, though the unified experience will be part of the home screen, not an app. Apple’s app, though, is short of a full-fledged streaming-TV service, which reports say Apple has been pursuing. Rather, it brings together TV shows and movies viewers already get through individual subscriptions. The TV app, coming in December, will be synced with iPhones and iPads, so viewers can catch the next episode regardless of device. Apple said its Siri voice assistant will also direct viewers to live events, such as streaming sports. Apple said Apple TV already has 8,000 apps, including more than 2,000 games. The addictive building game “Minecraft” will come later this year. In a minor setback, meanwhile, Apple said Wednesday that it’s delaying shipment of its new wireless earphones, called AirPods, which had been scheduled for late October. In a statement, the company said, “We don’t believe in shipping a product before it’s ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.” Apple didn’t elaborate. — AP SOURCEAP TAGS Apple Apps Laptops Macbook Pro tablets SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleWhy do some Saudi students abroad act recklessly?

The Californian tech giant sold 45.51 million iPhones in the three months to September 24, down five per cent from the 48 million sold a year ago. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus went on sale from September 16, so the results only account for eight days of sales. Apple’s revenue was down nine per cent year-on-year to $46.85 billion, while net income also fell from $11.1 billion to $9 billion. Gross margin was 39.9 per cent compared to 38 per cent. Perhaps significantly though, revenue in Greater China declined by 30 per cent to $8.8 billion However, the manufacturer posted record revenue in services of $6.3 billion – up by almost a quarter (24 per cent) – which includes its contactless payments service Apple Pay. Elsewhere, iPad sales continued to fall, down by six per cent in the quarter to 9.27 million tablets. “Very successful” Apple CEO Tim Cook said: “Our strong September quarter results cap a very successful fiscal 2016 for Apple. “We’re thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and Apple Watch Series 2, as well as the incredible momentum of our Services business, where revenue grew 24 percent to set another all-time record.” Looking forward to its Q1 2017, Apple is predicting revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion with it’s gross margin between 38 per sent and 38.5 per cent. Both predictions are less than the figures achieved in the first quarter of 2016.

The idea is that Apple wants to make it easier to find and watch video content without requiring users to sift through a bunch of apps. Instead, Apple’s guide will aggregate and show content that’s available and then send users directly to that content via deep links. The feature is supposed to work on the Apple TV streaming box as well as on other iOS devices like iPhones. Not all video providers are participating, says Recode. For example, Netflix will not be a launch partner, according to sources. The service will let users sign in with their TV subscription credentials to access content in any app that supports the feature. This is seen an an incremental step for Apple's TV ambitions. The company has been trying to create its own pay TV service but has been unable to strike the deals need to make its service happen. We'll be covering tomorrows event live.

The Touch Bar replaces the keyboard’s traditional function row with a brilliant, Retina-quality Multi-Touch display that dynamically adapts to Final Cut Pro X by putting intuitive, context-sensitive controls right at the user’s fingertips. Apple also released updates to Motion and Compressor. “This is our biggest update to Final Cut Pro X since we completely redesigned it five years ago,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Apps Product Marketing. “The new version features a sleek interface and adds powerful new editing features that go far beyond what’s possible with traditional, track-based video editing apps; and integration with the revolutionary Touch Bar gives professional video editors a whole new way to interact with Final Cut Pro X.” With the new Magnetic Timeline in Final Cut Pro X, users can understand their film at a glance with customizable arrangement and color coding of audio clips based on type or “role” — such as dialogue, music and effects. It’s simple to create and assign roles, and give each one a unique color. And in a first for pro video software, users can simply drag to instantly rearrange the vertical layout of their timeline or highlight specific audio roles while editing. Integration with the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro boosts creativity and productivity by dynamically adapting to each task and presenting intuitive controls exactly when and where users need them. While using Final Cut Pro X the Touch Bar lets users instantly switch between editing tools, adjust audio levels and tap into useful commands for trimming and playback. It will even display a color-coded, interactive overview of the entire timeline so users can navigate their project with the touch of a finger. A redesigned interface streamlines the layout of Final Cut Pro X to optimize screen space for MacBook Pro users, while a darker, flat look puts the focus on the content. Customizable workspaces let users adjust window arrangements for different tasks such as organizing, editing and color grading — even across multiple monitors. Full support for wide color workflows allows users to import, edit and deliver video in standard Rec. 601 and Rec. 709 color spaces or in wide gamut Rec. 2020 color space. Additional features in Final Cut Pro 10.3: ● Flow transition creates invisibly smooth jump cuts; ● Remove Attributes allows users to easily delete or reuse select effects across multiple clips; ● Timecode overlay effect and generator allow users to edit with a large view of source timecode; ● Support for ProRes MXF, Panasonic V-Log and export of AVC-Intra; ● Direct video output via Thunderbolt 3 enables high-quality video monitoring on an external display with a single cable. Motion 5.3 features a sleek new interface with support for wide color workflows and 3D text enhancements that improve the performance and realism of 3D titles. The new Align To behavior lets users easily connect separate objects to create advanced animations, and Touch Bar support provides easy access to a wide range of interactive tools on the new MacBook Pro. Compressor 4.3 has a new dark look to match Final Cut Pro X and Motion. Enhancements to iTunes Store Package creation let users easily browse, verify and compress packages so they can be delivered to the iTunes Store faster and fully compliant. Wide color support ensures end-to-end color fidelity when delivering files in standard and wide color spaces, and Touch Bar support simplifies common tasks like setting up batches and adding markers on the new MacBook Pro. Pricing and Availability Final Cut Pro X 10.3 Free update today for existing users; $299.99 for new users. Available on the Mac App Store. Motion 5.3 and Compressor 4.3 Free update today for existing users; $49.99 each for new users. Available on the Mac App Store.

Here's a roundup of all adapters, dongles, and cables you'll need for the new MacBook Pro. Griffin 'MagSafe' USB-C Power Cable: $34.99 Apple's MagSafe connector has saved many laptops from destruction caused by tripping over one's power cord. But with the introduction of USB-C on new MacBooks, this safety feature is absent. BreakSafe brings the safety and convenience back to newer MacBooks and other laptops with USB-C type connectors. The quick-release magnetic connector plugs into your laptop’s USB-C port and safely disconnects from the rest of the cable when under stress or strain, like tripping over the power cord.

Too bad, because I like it otherwise, but I have a desktop monitor that uses HDMI, my wide field webcam uses USB and I have a boatload of old chargers from my previous MB Pros. I've gotten used to carrying around my lightning to VGA for presentations, but it's easy to forget it, so why would I want to have any more dongles that can easily be forgotten or lost. Truly dumb, Apple. I don't mind you bringing in new standards, but give us more time to phase out the old ones by leaving at least one USB port and one HDMI.

With the launch of a new app called ResyOS, the Apple Watch will make its first foray into the restaurant business. The app is hoping to improve customer services by being able to alert restaurant staff when a VIP guest arrives, when a meal is taking too long to be served and when diners are ready to leave. Famed chef and restauranteur Danny Meyer has partnered with Resy to debut the new app sometime this month when the iconic Union Square Cafe in New York City reopens. All managers and sommeliers at the restaurant will be wearing Apple Watches during services to better listen and respond to guest needs. The app will alert staff through a light vibration on their wrist when a customer is in need of service. The control center of all of the alerts will be an iPad at the restaurant’s host stand which will send information from the back-end system out to the watches. It is important to note that the Apple Watches will not replace communication between servers and management. Union Square Cafe servers will not be wearing the watches, so guests don’t have to worry about their server being distracted while taking orders. On the diner side, ResyOS will enable guests to invite other members of their group into the reservation so that the restaurant can know all of the names in a given party. Also, if a diner is running late for their reservation they will be able to text information to ResyOS and the restaurant will be alerted. Union Square Cafe will also be taking advantage of Resy Pay when it opens which will allow members of a party to easily split the check and pay individually on their phones. ResyOS, which was designed in partnership with the Union Square Hospitality Group (USHG), will have leadership from the USGH on their Hospitality Board to provide ongoing product feedback. If successful, the app and Apple Watches could be implemented into other USHG restaurants.

BUSINESS Once again, Apple's new design won't accommodate your old cords Tim Cook Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press Apple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook speaks about MacBook computers during an announcement of new products on Thursday. Apple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook speaks about MacBook computers during an announcement of new products on Thursday. (Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press) Samantha MasunagaContact Reporter Not everyone was happy when Apple removed the headphone jack from its new line of iPhones, forcing customers to go wireless or use an adapter. And, unsurprisingly, not everyone was happy Thursday when owners of Apple’s new iPhones realized they won’t be able to charge them using the latest MacBook Pro models without using a different adapter.  The revelation came as the tech giant unveiled new MacBook Pro laptops featuring a touch-sensitive bar atop the keyboard. But it was the USB ports — or lack thereof — that were the center of attention for some users.  The iPhone 7 will no longer plug directly into Apple’s premier laptops because the smartphone comes with a Lightning cable that fits into a standard USB port. The new laptops use different USB-C ports — and they don’t ship with cords that match an iPhone.  To make them compatible, Apple customers will have to buy a $19 adapter, more commonly known in the tech world as a “dongle.” Or they could buy a $25 charger cable that directly connects the USB-C port to their phone.  The future’s tangle of cords and dongles elicited some heated tweets from users. Apple is known for its proprietary cords and it’s willingness to frequently change them.  This latest shift is part of Apple’s move toward a wireless future — meaning the company may be hoping that customers don’t wind up using dongles. “Going forward, wireless will be the more convenient thing,” said Werner Goertz, research director of personal technologies at research firm Gartner. “It offers all the bandwidth things need to communicate with each other.” Apple wants iPhone users to rely on iCloud, its data storage service, to transfer files between devices, leaving the cord only for charging. On its laptops, the smaller size of the USB-C port — which is becoming more common in personal devices — helps keeps the device slim.  “I would say that’s very much a part of Apple’s DNA — ‘ever thinner,’ and sometimes that means making sacrifices,” said Tom Mainelli, vice president for devices at market research firm IDC. But, if you’re someone who likes to plug in your devices to your laptop, “you’re going to use a lot of dongles to get your stuff plugged in,” he said. And if you want those dongles, you’re going to have to pay for them.  While the cords are much less expensive than the company’s laptops, forcing customers to buy them could provide a bit of extra revenue as its computer line faces increased competition.  In its fourth quarter report released this month, Apple said many of its rivals have broader product lines and cheaper prices, meaning the Mac has to “maintain its functional and design advantages.” Apple sold about 18.4 million Mac computers in 2016, compared to about 20.5 million in 2015. samantha.masunaga@latimes.com Twitter: @smasunaga ALSO: AT&T and Time Warner hope to break the cycle of failed mergers What your boss can and can't do when it comes to politics at work Column: Who oversees data brokers selling your personal info?

According to Apple Insider's inside source, Apple will stick with just two sizes for its next flagship devices. But the 4.7-inch size wouldn't really make sense if the iPhone's design is evolving as it's expected to. Credit: Jerermy Lips/Tom's GuideMore Credit: Jerermy Lips/Tom's Guide The initial Nikkei report said that Apple was working on a 4.7-inch, 5-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 8, with the 5-incher being the new, tweener model in the mix. All three models were also said to sport glass backs, which lines up with previous reports of a radical redesign. But Apple Insider knocked that speculation down, asserting via its source that Apple will continue to focus on its 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models — the same size as the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. MORE: This Futuristic All-Screen Phone Just Beat iPhone 8 to Punch Avi Greengart, an analyst for Current Analysis, doesn't give much credence to the supply chain rumors thus far, but he does find it "extraordinarily unlikely that Apple would launch both a 4.7-inch and a 5-inch phone. It'll be one or the other, along with a model to update the 5.5-inch iPhone Plus." If Apple is indeed moving toward a near bezel-free front for the iPhone 8, which almost certainly feature an AMOLED display, opting for a 4.7-inch screen size would be a wasted opportunity. Why not try to squeeze a bigger screen into the same size chassis? Dell did it for the XPS 13 laptop, cramming a 13-inch panel into a 11-inch chassis. And the new Xiaomi Mi Mix phone sports an edge-to-edge display that's 6.4 inches in size that you can use (fairly) comfortably with one hand. "If Apple can shrink or eliminate the side bezels, 5 inches would be pretty great," Greengart added. The 5.5-inch screen size for the iPhone 8 still seems just right, as there's way too much bezel around the iPhone 7 Plus. In fact, I found that when sitting down with the Plus in my front pocket, it digs into my thigh. That likely won't happen if the front of the iPhone 8 has an edge-to-edge display. According to IDC, shipments of phones sizes 5.5 inches and up accounted for 27.1 percent of all handsets sold as of Q2 2016. That was up from 18 percent the year before. MORE: iPhone 8 Rumors: What to Expect from the 10th Anniversary iPhone Still, even as Apple struggles to keep up with demand for the larger 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus, it may keep the relatively small 4.7-inch size around instead of opting for a roomier 5-inch panel. "Obviously, the old adage bigger is better isn't necessarily so," said Ramon Llamas, research manager at IDC. "I'm among those people who enjoy watching Netflix on bigger screens, but not everyone has a demand for a big device." Llamas also doesn't necessarily buy that Apple is opting for an edge-to-edge design with the iPhone 8. "Samsung has gone Edge because they can do all sorts of applications. Could [Apple] do it? Yeah. Do consumers need it? That's an open question." But assuming Apple will find a way to make the front of the iPhone 8 all screen, I wouldn't buy a 4.7-inch model. Bigger phones are the future, and Apple should go 5 inches and up from here on in.

One thing Apple did not introduce, however, is a stand-alone Apple-branded display. Instead, the company introduced a new monitor developed alongside LG, creating some doubt about the future of Apple’s display business, according to MacRumors reports. Rumors have circulated for a while that there might be a new Thunderbolt display coming with its own built-in GPU, but according to The Verge, that and any other new displays from Apple may have gone the way of the dodo bird. Heading to the Apple Store’s display section seems to confirm this, as the previous Apple displays are no longer listed. Related: Apple introduces 5K display developed by LG at October 27 event LG’s 27-inch 5K UltraFine display looks like an excellent monitor, and so perhaps those hoping for an Apple-branded 5K display might be able to take some solace. While the new monitor might carry LG’s logo instead of Apple’s icon, it looks like Apple’s involvement in its design could have some benefits. Various settings are configurable from a connected MacOS device, meaning that there might not be any functional difference between it and any potential monitor made by Apple. The LG 5K monitor is priced at $1,300, and it requires a machine running MacOS Sierra and sporting a Thunderbolt 3 connection. That makes it perfectly suited for the new MacBook Pro machines, which include two or four Thunderbolt 3-enabled USB Type-C ports depending on the model. The LG display will also work with other Macs that support Thunderbolt 3, whenever they arrive. The monitor itself will be available in December and cannot yet be ordered. LG is also rolling out a smaller, 21.5-inch 4K UltraFine monitor for $700, and that one is more universally compatible. It doesn’t require a Thunderbolt 3 but still uses USB Type-C . The LG 4K UltraFine display will ship in five to six weeks, but can be ordered today. Also watch: Apple OS X El Capitan – Hands On Please enable Javascript to watch this video

Brad Bourque Digital TrendsOctober 28, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Microsoft hasn’t been in the laptop game very long. In fact, the Surface Book launched in the fall of 2015, and in October of 2016, a year later, it’s receiving its first update in the form of an improved dock with a bigger battery and better GPU. The very next day, Apple fired right back with an update to its long-suffering MacBook Pro line, which brought newer processors and a touch-enabled OLED keyboard row into the fold. Are the mid-range updates going to take the high-end laptop world by storm, or are they just another step on the road to greatness?

The Surface Book has a bulge around the keyboard now, although we haven’t had hands-on time with it yet, so we’re not sure how that affects the keyboard feel or system ergonomics. The MacBook Pro, on the other hand, is slimmer and lighter than it was before, but it’s still heavier than the Surface Book with Performance Base, and slightly thicker than the thinnest point on the Microsoft option. Apple MacBook Pro OLED with Touch BarMore Malarie Gokey/Digital Trends Both laptops feel just as good as they look. Both are sturdy machines without panel gaps or worryingly flexible points on their respective chassis. Of course, the Surface Book’s removable keyboard lends it a versatility of use cases not available to the Apple side of the equation, but there are many out there who find the MacBook Pro’s look among the most attractive on the market. Apple’s improvements to the keyboard and input methods on the MacBook Pro are a mixed bag. We were a big fan of the old keyboard, but weren’t so hot on the Butterfly key switches found in the new MacBook, which have now made their way to the MacBook Pro. The current Surface Book’s keyboard is less compelling, but not detrimental to the experience, particularly with such a solid touchscreen. The added bulk also gives Microsoft some room to expand the keyboard, although without having spent time with it, we can’t speak to whether that happened or not. surface book 2More As expected, the new MacBook Pro features four Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports and a single 3.5-millimeter headphone jack. Until Type-C support grows, a lot of users may still be put off by the lack of standard ports. The Surface Book’s pair of USB 3.0 ports, on the other hand, will please existing users, but it isn’t very forward-looking. A new base would’ve been a good opportunity to add support, but its connectivity is exactly the same. Read More At the end of the day, it’s hard to argue that aesthetic appeal is more important than actual, usable functionality, so the Surface Book gets the nod. Winner: Surface Book Performance While so some of us have been waiting patiently for Apple to update the CPUs in the MacBook lineup, we had to settle for the older Skylake chips, instead of the more modern Kaby Lake offerings. The reasoning, or so we’ve heard, is that at release there are no Kaby Lake mobile chips with Iris Pro graphics, which help power the high-resolution display. As the Surface Book’s internals haven’t changed up top, the processor offerings are also still Skylake generation, but the Surface Book with Performance Base only includes the Core i7 option. It’s a lower wattage version of the chip found in the MacBook Pro, which affects comparative performance more so than real-world responsiveness. The performance back and forth carries over to memory and storage. The MacBook Pro 15 only comes in a 16GB model, while the base Surface Book with Performance Base has only 8GB. It can be upgraded to 16GB, however. The MacBook Pro also offers a 2TB PCIe SSD option, where the Surface Book maxes out at 1TB. Both systems also feature dedicated graphics options. The MacBook Pro has Radeon RX 400 Series graphics, where the Surface Book with Performance Base packs in a GTX 965M. Which one of those takes a lead over the other is hard to say for sure without benchmarking, but the specifications such the GTX 965M is substanially quicker. It quotes almost 2 TFlops of floating-point performance. Apple’s MacBook Pro 15-inch only comes close to that with the Radeon Pro 460 GPU — the most expensive option — which quotes 1.86 TFlops. The base-level Radeon Pro 450 GPU quotes 1 TFlop. Winner: Tie No new displays Both the MacBook Pro 15 and Surface Book boast excellent displays, with high resolutions and sharp contrast, but there’s a clear winner. Microsoft Surface BookMore Bill Roberson/Digital Trends The Surface Book’s 3,000 x 2,000 PixelSense display not only beats out the Apple option in terms of resolution, but also in terms of capability. With a full 1,024 pressure sensitivity levels and stylus support, it’s great for writing, drawing, and taking notes. It also detaches completely from the keyboard, allowing you to use it as a standalone tablet. Not that the MacBook’s screen is a bad option. The 2,880 x 1,800 panel boasts an extremely high maximum brightness, and great color gamut. However, Apple’s refusal to embrace touchscreens has begun to drag the older panels out of favor, and the OLED Touch Bar isn’t much of a consolation. Winner: Surface Book Portability Unfortunately, we don’t have any recent battery tests to reference from the 15-inch MacBook Pro, and as we often mention, manufacturer quoted battery times aren’t often indicative of real-world performance. However, we would conjecture that the MacBook Pro’s 76 watt-hour battery is a fairly sizable one for the internals, and it should result in satisfyingly long runs. The previously tested Surface Book with the Core i7 and older dedicated GPU ran for just under seven hours before it collapsed from exhaustion, but there’s a larger battery under the hood of the new model, though we’re not sure exactly how big it is. Microsoft’s own estimates moved from 12 hours on the older model to 16 on the new one, which should give you an idea of how much bigger the battery is. Apple MacBook Pro OLED with Touch BarMore Malarie Gokey/Digital Trends Users won’t have much to complain about when it comes to size on either side of the aisle. The MacBook Pro is slightly thicker than the thinnest point on the Surface Book, but when closed, the Microsoft system is just under an inch thick at the hinge. Despite the MacBook Pro’s weight loss, the Surface Book with Performance Base is still almost half a pound lighter. With almost identical sizes, the bigger question is definitely battery life, but without having both products in hand, there’s no way of knowing which lasts longer. Winner: Tie A victory as slim as the Surface Clearly there’s no obvious choice between the two systems, and the biggest dividing factor is going to be operating system preference. That being said, there are a few reasons you might lean towards the Surface Book with Performance Base, assuming you have no loyalty to MacOS or Windows. Performance, battery life, and portability are basically too close to call, which makes recommending one system over the other based on that too speculative. Pricing is very similar as well, albeit with the concession that the MacBook Pro 15’s base model offers a slightly better value than the Surface Book with Performance Base in its most basic configuration. Ultimately, the Surface Book’s touchscreen and form factor versatility offer up a set of use cases that simply aren’t possible with the MacBook Pro. Not everyone is going to make use of them all the time, or maybe even at all, but wouldn’t you rather have the option? Can Apple’s new MacBook Pro 13 keep pace with Dell’s XPS 13?

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive log in Regis College in Weston named Apple Distinguished School Friday Oct 28, 2016 at 6:36 PM Oct 28, 2016 at 6:36 PM Michael Wyner Staff Writer Regis College in Weston has been recognized as an Apple Distinguished School for 2016-18 for implementing its iPad initiative. “I am thrilled that Regis is recognized for the second consecutive time,” said Regis president Antoinette M. Hays of Wayland. “Faculty and staff are creating the classroom without walls to enhance learning and our students are reaping the benefits.” The Apple Distinguished School designation is for programs that meet criteria for innovation, leadership and educational excellence. Regis has maintained its 1:1 iPad distribution and institutional support for faculty engagement since the program inception in 2012. “We started providing iPads to all students four years ago but quickly learned that’s not enough,” said Malcolm Asadoorian, vice president of academic affairs. “The key is how we as educators use this tool to enhance learning through extensive training where faculty are challenged to become learners themselves.” Students in public health use digital storytelling and iMovie to create online public service announcements on topics such as mental health awareness. During summer orientation, incoming freshmen experience their first challenge-based learning experience during a digital scavenger race around campus using their iPads. Regis faculty recently participated in an Apple Accessibility event to leverage technology to create customizations for individual needs and learning styles. During the university’s Founder’s Day celebration, faculty participated in a digital service learning workshop, which combined Regis’ mission of service and dedication to digital pedagogy. “The social justice aspect of this initiative is consistent with our mission as it allows access to the same technology regardless of socioeconomic background,” said Hays. “It erases the stress and financial obstacles many students face.” About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Communities Work for Us Milford Daily News Ads Find your Wicked Local town Ashland Framingham Shrewsbury Holliston Hopkinton Hudson Marlborough Westborough More Communities Natick Northborough Southborough Sudbury Wayland Weston Wicked Local Site Services Subscribe E-Edition Submit Your News Find Us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Advertise With Us Contact us See us on Instagram Find us on Tumblr Market Place Classifieds Find Framingham Jobs Real Estate © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Shares iOS 10 only recently landed in its finished form, but you can be sure that Apple is already hard at work on iOS 11, ready for a mid-2017 unveiling.  So far little is known about the next version of Apple’s mobile operating system, but there are a few rumored features and plenty more things we’re hoping to see.  With that in mind we’ve collected all the news and rumors below, along with a wish list of what we’d hope are Apple’s top priorities. Cut to the chase What is it? The next version of iOS When is it out? Probably a June announcement and a September launch What will it cost? Nothing! iOS 11 release date iOS 11 is likely quite a long way off, with an announcement at WWDC in June 2017 looking all but set in stone, given that it’s during this event that Apple typically unveils new versions of iOS. However, it’s unlikely that iOS 11 will be finished by then, with betas (including a public one) likely to be made available soon after, and a final release probably in September 2017, alongside the iPhone 8. Again, this is all based on past iOS releases rather than any news or rumors, but there’s no reason to think Apple will change its schedule. iOS 11 news and rumors One thing we’re expecting to see soon from iOS is a ‘Dark Mode’, which would make backgrounds black, so you don’t strain your eyes when using an iOS device at night or in other dim environments. The real question is whether Dark Mode will arrive with iOS 11, or as part of an iOS 10 update, as resources for the feature have already been found within iOS 10, so it’s probably something that Apple plans to add imminently. Of course, there’s already a Night Shift mode, but that’s a bit different, as it reduces the amount of blue light rather than making the display darker. Apple is also said to be working on a new video sharing and editing app, similar to Snapchat. Supposedly this would include filters and the ability to draw on videos, and it may launch as a standalone app, rather than as an update to the camera app. This wouldn’t necessarily be a part of iOS 11, but Apple is supposedly shooting for a 2017 launch, so it’s possible. Apple is also apparently working on enhanced social features, according to sources speaking to Bloomberg. The company's tipped to make sharing and connectivity with contacts a system-wide feature as well, and may consolidate communications, so you can see all your SMS messages, emails and social network interactions with a given person on a single screen. What we want to see We don’t know much about iOS 11 yet, but we know what we want from it. Check out our wish list below and let us know if there’s anything you really want to see. 1. Customizable Control Center  Control Center is a handy shortcut to a number of toggles, but it’s not customizable, meaning that for certain options, such as music controls, you must swipe to the second tab – an annoying extra step for anyone who listens to a lot of music on their device. Worse, some actions, such as GPS, don’t have Control Center toggles at all, so we’d like to see the ability to customize both what options are displayed and which tab they appear on. 2. Always-on display  Samsung impressed us with the always-on display of phones like the Galaxy S7 – giving you a constant clock and a window onto your notifications, and we’d like to see a similar option built into iOS 11. Raise to wake makes it quicker than ever to view the lock screen, but if we just want to check the time we'd rather not have to even raise the phone, and an always-on display would be a solution. 3. Home screen widgets Apple’s lock screen widgets are handy, and help stop the home screen getting too cluttered, but we’d still like the option to put widgets on our home screens. It’s not just about having quick access to apps and information, but also about customizing devices to make them our own, whether that means having a big custom clock and weather forecast on our main home screen, an overview of upcoming calendar events, or whatever else. 4. Smarter Siri Siri is getting better all the time, but there’s still room for improvement, especially as in many ways Google Assistant has it beat. We’d especially like to see improvements to Siri’s context awareness – so for example reliably being able to answer follow-up questions without you having to clarify the subject again. 5. Grouped notifications Everyone likes to be loved, and there's nothing better than your WhatsApp blowing up - until that is, you take a gander at your lock screen or notification bar.  Currently, iOS seems unable to group messages from the same contact, or message group, together, giving you an almost never-ending stream of notifications.  Come on Apple, give us "19 new messages from 2 chats" and the ability to expand to see more if we so desire. Pleeaassssseeeeee. 6. Clear all background apps Being able to hop quickly between different apps is handy, but sometimes we like to clean up the multi-tasking panel and start fresh. Thing is, on iOS 10 that involves swiping each individual app to close it. For iOS 11 we'd love to have a "clear all" option, allowing us to shut all the background apps with a simple tap of an icon. 7. Easy video resolution changes iOS is often thought of as simple and intuitive, and for the most part it is, but glaring usability issues sometimes emerge, and one of those is the inability to change video resolution from the camera app. Instead you have to dig down into the main settings screen, which takes time, isn’t intuitive at all and could leave some users unaware that it’s even an option. This should be an easy fix, so hopefully with iOS 11 Apple will add a video resolution toggle to the camera app itself. 8. Improved Mail app Apple's Mail app got a bit of love in the iOS 10 upgrade, but the new look isn't overly slick. Scrolling through an email conversation feels clunky, and rival apps such as Gmail feel better put together overall. In iOS 11 we'd like to see a cleaner, slicker and more user friendly Mail app, and if Apple wants to take a few pointers from Google's Gmail offering we won't complain. After a new tablet?

By Brad Bourque — October 28, 2016 2:38 PM Subscribe to this topic Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Get our daily Tech News recap Mentioned here Dell XPS 13 (Skylake) MSRP $1,399.00 DT Editors' Choice Learn More Microsoft hasn’t been in the laptop game very long. In fact, the Surface Book launched in the fall of 2015, and in October of 2016, a year later, it’s receiving its first update in the form of an improved dock with a bigger battery and better GPU. The very next day, Apple fired right back with an update to its long-suffering MacBook Pro line, which brought newer processors and a touch-enabled OLED keyboard row into the fold. Are the mid-range updates going to take the high-end laptop world by storm, or are they just another step on the road to greatness? Related: Apple’s new MacBook Pro doesn’t outrun competitors, but the Touch Bar is special MacBook Pro 15-inch Surface Book with Performance Base Dimensions  13.75 x 9.48 x .61 (in) 12.3 x 9.14 x .51-.9 (in) Weight  4.02 pounds 3.63 pounds Processor  6th Generation Intel Core i7 6th Generation Intel Core i7 RAM  16GB LPDDR3 8, or 16GB LPDDR3 Display  15.4-inch IPS display 13.5-inch PixelSense Display Resolution  2,880 x 1,800 3,000 x 2,000 Storage  256GB, 512GB, 1TB, 2TB PCIe SSD 256GB, 512GB, 1TB PCIe SSD Networking  802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.0 Ports 4 x Thunderbolt 3, 3.5mm USB 3.0, Mini DisplayPort, 3.5mm, SDXC Webcam  720p FaceTime HD 5MP front-facing, 8MP rear-facing Operating System  MacOS Sierra Windows 10 Battery  76 watt-hours Quoted 16 hours Price  $2,399+ $2,399+ Availability Available Available for pre-order Review Hands-on 4.5 out of 5 stars Design These are both updates to existing machines, so there are no real surprises on either side design-wise. The Surface Book has a bulge around the keyboard now, although we haven’t had hands-on time with it yet, so we’re not sure how that affects the keyboard feel or system ergonomics. The MacBook Pro, on the other hand, is slimmer and lighter than it was before, but it’s still heavier than the Surface Book with Performance Base, and slightly thicker than the thinnest point on the Microsoft option. Malarie Gokey/Digital Trends Both laptops feel just as good as they look. Both are sturdy machines without panel gaps or worryingly flexible points on their respective chassis. Of course, the Surface Book’s removable keyboard lends it a versatility of use cases not available to the Apple side of the equation, but there are many out there who find the MacBook Pro’s look among the most attractive on the market. Apple’s improvements to the keyboard and input methods on the MacBook Pro are a mixed bag. We were a big fan of the old keyboard, but weren’t so hot on the Butterfly key switches found in the new MacBook, which have now made their way to the MacBook Pro. The current Surface Book’s keyboard is less compelling, but not detrimental to the experience, particularly with such a solid touchscreen. The added bulk also gives Microsoft some room to expand the keyboard, although without having spent time with it, we can’t speak to whether that happened or not. As expected, the new MacBook Pro features four Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports and a single 3.5-millimeter headphone jack. Until Type-C support grows, a lot of users may still be put off by the lack of standard ports. The Surface Book’s pair of USB 3.0 ports, on the other hand, will please existing users, but it isn’t very forward-looking. A new base would’ve been a good opportunity to add support, but its connectivity is exactly the same. At the end of the day, it’s hard to argue that aesthetic appeal is more important than actual, usable functionality, so the Surface Book gets the nod. Winner: Surface Book Performance While so some of us have been waiting patiently for Apple to update the CPUs in the MacBook lineup, we had to settle for the older Skylake chips, instead of the more modern Kaby Lake offerings. The reasoning, or so we’ve heard, is that at release there are no Kaby Lake mobile chips with Iris Pro graphics, which help power the high-resolution display. As the Surface Book’s internals haven’t changed up top, the processor offerings are also still Skylake generation, but the Surface Book with Performance Base only includes the Core i7 option. It’s a lower wattage version of the chip found in the MacBook Pro, which affects comparative performance more so than real-world responsiveness. The performance back and forth carries over to memory and storage. The MacBook Pro 15 only comes in a 16GB model, while the base Surface Book with Performance Base has only 8GB. It can be upgraded to 16GB, however. The MacBook Pro also offers a 2TB PCIe SSD option, where the Surface Book maxes out at 1TB. Both systems also feature dedicated graphics options. The MacBook Pro has Radeon RX 400 Series graphics, where the Surface Book with Performance Base packs in a GTX 965M. Which one of those takes a lead over the other is hard to say for sure without benchmarking, but the specifications such the GTX 965M is substanially quicker. It quotes almost 2 TFlops of floating-point performance. Apple’s MacBook Pro 15-inch only comes close to that with the Radeon Pro 460 GPU — the most expensive option — which quotes 1.86 TFlops. The base-level Radeon Pro 450 GPU quotes 1 TFlop. Winner: Tie No new displays Both the MacBook Pro 15 and Surface Book boast excellent displays, with high resolutions and sharp contrast, but there’s a clear winner. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends The Surface Book’s 3,000 x 2,000 PixelSense display not only beats out the Apple option in terms of resolution, but also in terms of capability. With a full 1,024 pressure sensitivity levels and stylus support, it’s great for writing, drawing, and taking notes. It also detaches completely from the keyboard, allowing you to use it as a standalone tablet. Not that the MacBook’s screen is a bad option. The 2,880 x 1,800 panel boasts an extremely high maximum brightness, and great color gamut. However, Apple’s refusal to embrace touchscreens has begun to drag the older panels out of favor, and the OLED Touch Bar isn’t much of a consolation. Winner: Surface Book Portability Unfortunately, we don’t have any recent battery tests to reference from the 15-inch MacBook Pro, and as we often mention, manufacturer quoted battery times aren’t often indicative of real-world performance. However, we would conjecture that the MacBook Pro’s 76 watt-hour battery is a fairly sizable one for the internals, and it should result in satisfyingly long runs. The previously tested Surface Book with the Core i7 and older dedicated GPU ran for just under seven hours before it collapsed from exhaustion, but there’s a larger battery under the hood of the new model, though we’re not sure exactly how big it is. Microsoft’s own estimates moved from 12 hours on the older model to 16 on the new one, which should give you an idea of how much bigger the battery is. Malarie Gokey/Digital Trends Users won’t have much to complain about when it comes to size on either side of the aisle. The MacBook Pro is slightly thicker than the thinnest point on the Surface Book, but when closed, the Microsoft system is just under an inch thick at the hinge. Despite the MacBook Pro’s weight loss, the Surface Book with Performance Base is still almost half a pound lighter. With almost identical sizes, the bigger question is definitely battery life, but without having both products in hand, there’s no way of knowing which lasts longer. Winner: Tie A victory as slim as the Surface Clearly there’s no obvious choice between the two systems, and the biggest dividing factor is going to be operating system preference. That being said, there are a few reasons you might lean towards the Surface Book with Performance Base, assuming you have no loyalty to MacOS or Windows. Performance, battery life, and portability are basically too close to call, which makes recommending one system over the other based on that too speculative. Pricing is very similar as well, albeit with the concession that the MacBook Pro 15’s base model offers a slightly better value than the Surface Book with Performance Base in its most basic configuration. Ultimately, the Surface Book’s touchscreen and form factor versatility offer up a set of use cases that simply aren’t possible with the MacBook Pro. Not everyone is going to make use of them all the time, or maybe even at all, but wouldn’t you rather have the option?

According to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, 18-year-old Meetkumar ("Meet") Hiteshbhai Desai found a vulnerability in Apple's mobile operating system and crafted a proof-of-concept exploit to prove it. However, that tool wound up flooding an emergency call center with more than 100 hang-up calls within a "matter of minutes" earlier this week, it is alleged. It all started when Desai and a friend found a way to remotely spawn pop-up alerts, open installed applications, or start a phone call on a victim's iThing, it is claimed. Hoping to cash in on Apple's bug bounty program, the pair set up a webpage that exploits the flaw as their proof-of-concept, we're told. They then directed Desai's Twitter followers to click on a link to that booby-trapped page and, according to the police, launch the exploit from Desai's own website, meetdesai.com, which has since been taken down. Desai also, apparently, spread the link via his YouTube channel, "The Hackspot." It's alleged that Desai's webpage caused phones to dial emergency numbers that the callers couldn't hang up. As a result, police say, those who clicked on the links unintentionally ended up flooding 911 centers in and around the Phoenix, Arizona, area with calls. Apparently, Desai meant to upload a script that simply opened a pop-up alert on the handhelds. Desai describes himself as an iOS developer and a jailbreak theme tweaker. "Meet stated that although he did add that feature to the bug he had no intention of pushing it out to the public, because he knew it was illegal and people would 'freak out'," the office said. "Meet stated that he may have accidentally pushed the harmful version of the (911) bug out to the Twitter link instead of the less-annoying bug that only caused pop-ups, dialing to make peoples' devices freeze up and reboot." The flood of calls from smartphones and tablets was eventually traced to Desai's personal site hosted in San Francisco, California; the cops managed to get the plug pulled on the site. The teen was arrested, taken to jail, and booked on three charges of computer tampering. A search warrant was also carried out at his home.

Apple tells us that it has a built-in image signal processor (ISP) related to the ones Apple uses in iPhone and iPad SoCs, something which Troughton-Smith suggests could protect the camera from malware hijacking. And its Secure Enclave handles the encryption and storage of fingerprint data and protects it from the rest of the operating system and its apps, much as it does in iOS. When you interact with the Touch Bar, Apple tells us that the majority of the processing is being done by the Intel CPU, although the T1 also appears to do some processing in specific situations for security’s sake, as when Apple Pay is used. But to keep the Touch Bar from counting toward the number of external monitors you can use (Intel’s GPUs support a total of three separate displays, AMD’s support six), the T1 is used to drive the Touch Bar’s screen. From what Apple told me, it sounds like the image you’re seeing is actually being drawn by the main system GPU but is being output to the display by T1, not unlike the way other hybrid graphics implementations work. Between A-series chips, the W1, and the T1, Apple's most fascinating work is happening in the custom silicon space. The whole T1-Touch Bar deal is extremely intriguing.

Apple has steadfastly resisted adding touchscreens to the Mac, and when you ask the company’s executives why, they have been remarkably consistent on this point for the past few years. What defines a computer, they’ll say, is that it’s made up of two perpendicular surfaces. There’s a vertical display surface, more or less up and down, right in front of you. And there’s a horizontal control surface—a table or desk or the base of a laptop—that you use for input and control. If you want a Mac, that’s what you get. If you want a touch-based device, get an iPad. Seen through this philosophy, the new MacBook Pro and its Touch Bar interface fit perfectly. The Touch Bar brings the things Apple loves about touchscreen interfaces—customizability and support for multitouch—and adds it to the control surface of the Mac, right above the keyboard. It doesn’t break Apple’s definition of a computer at all, because it’s a new sort of touchscreen, and it’s part of the keyboard area, not the display area. I don't use a Mac as my daily computer anymore, and I don't plan to switch from my iPad Pro, but the Touch Bar is the first change to the Mac line to pique my curiosity in years. Probably because it borrows from what makes iOS great.

Club MacStoriesBecome a Member MENU ABOUT CONTACT NEWSLETTER ADVERTISE SECTIONS APP REVIEWS LINKED STORIES iOS 10 WWDC 2016 My New iPad Pro Keyboard: The Razer Mechanical Keyboard Case Why I’m Considering Bear as a Notes App Replacement The New MacBook Pro: Our Complete Overview This week's sponsor Secrets a beautifully simple password manager, now Free on the App Store The New MacBook Pro: Our Complete Overview By Alex Guyot At yesterday morning's Hello Again keynote event, Apple announced the long-awaited update to their professional laptop line. The new MacBook Pro comes in two sizes and features a thinner body and upgraded internals. It also comes equipped with Apple's brand new Touch Bar, a Retina touchscreen display which replaces the row of function keys atop the keyboard, and a Touch ID sensor. These new machines mark the first significant spec advancements for the MacBook Pro since they moved to Haswell processors in 2014, and the first notable hardware changes since going Retina in 2012. As such, it's no surprise that the new MacBook Pro is an improvement in nearly every way over previous models. This is truly the next generation of Apple's flagship laptops. Touch Bar Apple's new Touch Bar is a slim multitouch display located above the keyboard where the function keys used to be. At 2070px wide by 60px high (equivalent to 1085pt by 30pt), the display has Apple's official blessing as "Retina". The Touch Bar provides a programmable interface which developers can take advantage of to expose controls specific to their apps directly on the keyboard. When developers are not controlling the display, Touch Bar will show a system interface of buttons and controls which users can customize to their liking from System Preferences. The beauty of the Touch Bar is this: by placing the display directly on the keyboard, the controls are located in the most convenient place possible for laptop users. What has always bothered me about the shift toward Windows laptops with touchscreen displays (and, for that matter, using an iPad with a keyboard), is that you constantly have to lift your entire arm and stab at the screen. It's imprecise and tiring over time, and in general just not the best experience. Of course, it very much remains to be seen whether the Touch Bar is truly a better solution for bringing the power of multitouch displays to the laptop paradigm, but on paper it certainly seems like an idea with great potential. To demonstrate this, Apple demoed several apps on stage which already make use of the new Touch Bar. Final Cut Pro will show an interactive display of an active project's timeline in the Touch Bar. Swiping across this timeline allows for quick navigation through the project, and buttons on either side of it may provide other functions depending on what you're doing in the app. Another demo was from an Adobe employee, and showed off the way an upcoming update to Photoshop will allow interaction through the Touch Bar. In this case, the touch interface allowed for quick changing of brush size with one hand as the other hand used the trackpad to edit a photo. Microsoft has also announced an update to its Office suite to work with the Touch Bar. The Word update enables a mode where everything is hidden other than the document and the toolbars are relocated into the Touch Bar. The PowerPoint update is geared toward making graphics manipulation easier by changing layer positions and rotating objects with slides of a finger across the Touch Bar. Excel moves function suggestions and other common tools down to the keyboard layer. Microsoft's take on this strikes me as the most common approach we'll see from developers, but I'll be interested to watch trends as more apps release Touch Bar support. Will they all just converge around the same tropes, or are there more innovative uses for the new interface that Apple hasn't yet thought of? One of the uses of the Touch Bar that I'm most excited about is using it as an emoji picker. The current macOS emoji picker is slow to load and only lets me use one emoji at a time before being automatically dismissed (yes, I know I can drag it away to keep it open permanently, but I don't want that either). To open up a nice view of emoji right on the Touch Bar and be able to use as many as I want to before dismissing them will be great. Touch ID On the far right side of the Touch Bar is a small black square which is not part of the display. This square is the new MacBook Touch ID sensor. The sensor, which is actually a clickable button, has three main functions at this time. First off is the obvious: the new MacBook Pro can be unlocked using the Touch ID sensor instead of having to type in your password. I'm sure this will be a much faster and more reliable method of auto unlock than the Apple Watch Unlock method introduced with macOS Sierra earlier this year. The second function of the Touch ID button is making a payment with Apple Pay in Safari. This feature was made available in macOS Sierra by kicking the payment to an iPhone with Touch ID to authenticate it. Now the entire process can occur directly on the Mac. Finally, the Touch ID sensor can store and differentiate the fingerprints of different users on the computer. If one user is logged in and another comes by to use the Mac, they can simply place their finger on the Touch ID sensor and the MacBook Pro will automatically transition into their user account – no logout/login necessary. I'm sure it won't be long until the rest of the features we're used to from Touch ID on iOS (I think it's only missing native in-app payments) come to the Mac as well. With all of these great functions, Touch ID is an incredibly strong addition to the MacBook Pro. Design The new MacBook Pro comes in the same two sizes as before, with both a 13-inch and a 15-inch model. The 13-inch model weighs in at a mere 3 pounds, and is 14.9 mm thick. The 15-inch model is 4 pounds and 15.5 mm thick, making both machines quite a bit thinner than the 13-inch MacBook Air (which is 17 mm thick). The general exterior design of the machines has remained relatively unchanged. Despite some rumors to the contrary, the MacBook Pro has not transitioned to a tapered design akin to the MacBook Air. Rather, it just looks like a thinner version of the same MacBook Pro design that we're used to. The Pro also didn't receive the options for Gold and Rose Gold colors like the standard MacBook line, but it did get the option for Space Gray. That's right, you heard me, we can finally purchase MacBook Pros in a color other than silver. This will be the same Space Gray that standard MacBooks have been available in since 2015, and it looks great. 1 Display The Retina display on the new MacBook Pro has been updated to support the wide color gamut previously seen on the iMac, 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and iPhone 7. The display also sports brighter LED backlighting and an increased contrast ratio. Drawing inspiration from the iPad Pro, the new MacBook Pro display supports a variable refresh rate, letting it conserve more energy by refreshing non-changing pixels less often. Audio The new MacBook Pro has an all new speaker design with double the dynamic range and 58% more volume. Apple is also boasting 2.5x louder bass on the speakers. The edges of the computer to the left and right of the trackpad seem to now have speaker grills to aid in the dispersal of the improved sound. Keyboard and Trackpad The keyboard on the new machine has been updated to include the second generation of the butterfly switches which Apple debuted on the first version of the current MacBook in 2015. The mechanism creates a uniform downward movement even when pressing keys on the edges. Apple did mention in the keynote that the MacBook Pro version has more key travel than that of the standard MacBook. The new trackpad is 2 times larger than the trackpad on the previous MacBook Pro for the 15-inch machine. It's slightly less than 2x larger for the 13-inch. Other than the increased size this is the same Force Touch trackpad that has been shipping on MacBook Pros since last year. Ports The ports on the new machine are perhaps the greatest caveat about it. All ports that existed on the previous MacBook Pro generation (except, ironically, the headphone jack) are gone. In their place are four Thunderbolt 3 ports. Since Thunderbolt 3 uses the same connector as USB-C, these ports all function as USB-C ports as well. Sadly, this change spells the end of MagSafe on Apple's MacBook Pro line. No longer are MacBooks safe from people tripping over power cords while they are charging. On the bright side, though, the new MacBook Pros can be charged from any of the four Thunderbolt 3 ports. Thunderbolt 3 may not yet be as universal on external devices as the ports that it is replacing, but it is more capable than all of them combined. Thunderbolt 3 can connect to displays via HDMI, VGA, DisplayPort, or Thunderbolt. It can input and output power for charging, and work with any peripherals that are compatible with USB-A, and Micro or Mini USB. It's also blazingly fast and powerful with up to 40-Gbps data transfer and support for pushing up to two 5K displays. Sadly, Apple did not announce a new Apple-branded 5K display to use with these ports, but it did recommend a new LG display, which the two companies collaborated on. Performance The new MacBook Pro massively outperforms the previous generation. The 15-inch model features a Radeon Pro discrete GPU which delivers up to 130% faster graphics. The 13-inch model packs an Intel Iris Graphics 540 with up to 103% faster graphics than the previous 13-inch model. All new MacBook Pros come with solid-state drives, the performance of which have improved to 3.1 GB/s read speeds and 2.1 GB/s write speeds (2.2 for the 15-inch). The 13-inch comes with 256 GB of storage baseline, and can be updated to up to 1 TB. The 15-inch model also comes with 256 GB baseline storage, but it includes the option to upgrade to a 2 TB SSD, the first time such a huge solid-state drive has been available on a Mac. For processors, the 13-inch model can be purchased at the baseline with a 2.9GHz dual core and 3.3GHz Turbo Boost Intel Core i5. This can be upgraded at checkout to an up to 3.3GHz dual core and 3.6GHz Turbo Boost Intel Core i7 processor. The 15-inch model can be purchased at the baseline with a 2.6GHz quad core and 3.5GHz Turbo Boost Intel Core i7. This can be upgraded at checkout to an up to 2.9GHz quad core and 3.8GHz Turbo Boost Intel Core i7. Both sizes provide 10 hours of battery life. Conclusion and Pricing Through this new generation of MacBook Pros, Apple has rocketed its aging flagship laptop line back to the forefront. With greatly improved performance, refreshed hardware design, and innovative additions like the Touch Bar and Touch ID, Apple is delivering what looks to be an extraordinary new line of products. The Touch Bar in particular is a possibly game-changing feature. We'll have to wait for reviews to see how well it works in practice, but the idea of putting a multitouch display directly under your fingertips on a laptop has strong potential. I can't wait to see what developers start cooking up to make use of the new interface. The last thing to talk about here is pricing. Unfortunately, Apple has increased the base prices across all models of the new MacBook Pros. The starting price of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and Touch ID is $1,799, a significant increase over the starting price of the previous MacBook Pro generation, which started at $1,299. To fill this gap, Apple is also offering another 13-inch model, available at $1,499. However, this lower priced model does not include the Touch Bar, nor Touch ID. Instead, the top keyboard row is reverted back to the standard function keys that we are used to. This model also has lower powered specs than the others in the lineup. On the 15-inch side, Apple is only offering models which include the Touch Bar and Touch ID. The starting price here is $2,399. You can compare all models of Apple's new MacBook Pro lineup here. The MacBook Pro without Touch Bar or Touch ID is shipping already as of yesterday, and the MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar and Touch ID will start shipping in 2-3 weeks.

Side note: the new MacBook Pro's display maxes out at a brightness of 500 nits. That's half as bright as the 1,000 nit screen of the Apple Watch Series 2. ↩︎ Tags: mac, macbook pro, macOS, touch bar Join Now Like MacStories? Become a Member.

This lines up with what I heard ahead of the event – that Apple would embed a SoC reminiscent of the Apple Watch S1 in the new MacBook Pros – but the implications of what Apple did with the T1 chip and the Touch Bar run deeper than I expected. For one, macOS can now leverage years of security that went into honing the Secure Enclave and Touch ID on iOS – all while working with an ARM architecture inside the MacBook Pro instead of x86. And it even seems like the T1 is driving the iSight camera (for security purposes) and that it may render certain UI elements on the Touch Bar directly instead of delegating that to macOS (again, for security). And when macOS isn't running, watchOS alone can render UI on the Touch Bar (likely for Boot Camp). It's fascinating to think that part of watchOS (which has been optimized for low power consumption and lightweight touch UIs) is being used to power a marquee hardware feature of the new MacBook Pros. And even more intriguing is the idea of watchOS and years of investment in iOS security helping make Macs more secure – it's not too absurd to imagine that future T-series chips may drive security of other Mac input methods. I collected some of the most interesting tweets about this below, so you can read the technical bits for yourself. Touch Bar and T1 Chip Tags: mac, macbook pro Join Now Like MacStories?

Apple's CFO Luca Maestri stated during Apple's financial conference call that Apple would return to growth in China in the December quarter. But for now, the Chinese market is clearly changing and we'll have to see if Apple will be able to return to a top three position.     Due to the Note 7 Crisis, Samsung didn't make the top five list this quarter.   In April Patently Apple reported on Q1 2016 Global Smartphone stats and noticed then that Oppo came out of nowhere to take forth spot.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple thought about making Microsoft’s Surface Studio years ago Yoni Heisler BGR NewsOctober 28, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Microsoft's new Surface Studio is an intriguing, albeit incredibly expensive, new PC geared for creative professionals. Boasting an impressive 28-inch display, the Surface Studio's underlying appeal is a specialized hinge design that allows users to collapse the display to a 20-degree angle. In turn, users can more readily use the generously sized display for artistic endeavors like drawing or even seemingly mundane tasks like marking up documents. Given the Surface Studio's expensive price tag -- the entry level model starts at $2999 -- and the fact that quantities will be limited at launch, we're not really expecting the Surface Studio to take the computing world by storm. If anything, the product is seemingly geared towards a very niche subset of users: creative professionals. In fact, with many people arguing these days that Apple has been actively ignoring its user base of creatives, some have even said that the Surface Studio is a machine that Apple should have launched. In turn, some have gone so far as to claim that Apple has been busy resting on its laurels, its creative and innovative mojo seemingly usurped by Microsoft, of all companies. DON'T MISS: The iPhone 7 has an exciting new feature that Apple is keeping secret The funny thing is, Apple isn't just blindly sitting on the sidelines letting the tech industry pass them by. In fact, Apple not only considered releasing a Surface Studio type with a dual iOS/OS X interface, it had such a design on its radar six years ago. Exhibit A: An Apple patent filing from 2010 (via Patently Apple) lays out a touch-enabled desktop computer with a design that looks remarkably similar to what Microsoft introduced earlier this week. imac-touchMore As detailed in the patent, when the computer recognizes a shift in orientation, it shifts the OS from OS X (now macOS) to iOS. Apple of course has an official policy of filing patents for any and everything its R&D team comes up with, no matter how outlandish, but Apple executives strongly considered developing a machine capable of running both a desktop and mobile operating system. Touching on this in a must-read profile on the evolution of Apple's new MacBook Pro in CNET, Phil Schiller explains that leaning forward to touch your desktop screen just isn't a good idea. "We did spend a great deal of time looking at this a number of years ago and came to the conclusion that to make the best personal computer, you can’t try to turn MacOS into an iPhone,” Schiller said. “Conversely, you can’t turn iOS into a Mac…. So each one is best at what they’re meant to be — and we take what makes sense to add from each, but without fundamentally changing them so they’re compromised.”   You might also remember rumors circa 2010 that Apple was even planning to hold a special media event where it would unveil a brand new iMac with a hybrid OS. It's easy to critique Apple for not releasing every new product that comes to mind, but it's important to remember that Apple is so successful precisely because it carefully considers every new product it throws its weight and resources behind. And just because Apple doesn't release a product doesn't in any way shape or form suggest that said product wasn't thoroughly evaluated behind the scenes, as is the case with what people once called the iMac Touch. To this point, Jony Ive told CNET that "doing something that’s different is actually relatively easy and relatively fast, and that’s tempting." Still, Apple ultimately concluded that a touchscreen Mac wasn't "particularly useful." Incidentally, Apple CEO Tim Cook just last year same something similar in response to a question about a hybrid Mac/Tablet device. “We feel strongly that customers are not really looking for a converged Mac and iPad,” Cook explained. “Because what that would wind up doing, or what we’re worried would happen, is that neither experience would be as good as the customer wants. So we want to make the best tablet in the world and the best Mac in the world. And putting those two together would not achieve either. You’d begin to compromise in different ways.” Trending right now: These hidden iOS 10 features will change the way you use your iPhone MacBook Pro’s bleeding-edge graphics: Like a gaming PC from 2012 Developers and creative pros are blasting Apple’s new MacBook Pro See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next How Good Are the Walmart Black Friday TV Deals?

MacBook Pro 2016: Should You Upgrade? By Victoria Song October 28, 2016 12:58pm EST 10 Comments There's a shiny new MacBook Pro in town. But is it worth trading in last year's Pro or the MacBook Air? Another fall, another #AppleEvent, and another chance for the Cult of Apple to shake out their wallets and dive between the couch cushions to scrounge up the extra cash for a shiny new MacBook Pro. On the 25th anniversary of Apple unveiling its first laptop, Tim Cook took to the stage in Cupertino on Thursday to unveil a new MacBook Pro, which he said is the "thinnest and lightest MacBook Pro ever." That's par for the course at these events, though. The biggest announcement was the inclusion of the Touch Bar—a thin strip that replaces the function keys with multi-touch, app-specific gestures; it's a neat workaround for anyone put off by the idea of a touch-screen laptop. There's also a Touch ID power button on the MacBook Pro now, which will tap in to Apple Pay, of course. But are these additions a) what Apple fans really want, and b) a compelling enough reason to upgrade from your 13-inch MacBook Air or last year's MacBook Pro?

The 15-inch version comes in at 15.5mm thick, which is 14 percent thinner and 20 percent less volume than its predecessor. The new 13-inch is a mere 3 pounds—on par with the MacBook Air—while the 15-inch is 4 pounds. And while the Air is famous for its slim, tapered shape, the new 13-inch MacBook Pro still has it beat; it's 12 percent thinner and has 13 percent less volume than MacBook Air. The body is Apple's familiar sleek aluminum; get it in silver or space gray. The new MacBook Pro also sports a Retina display that's 67 percent brighter, has 67 percent more contrast ratio, and increases the color gamut by 25 percent. That translates to a 2,560-by-1,600 resolution on the 13-inch—the same as last year's Pro, but superior to the 1,920-by-1,080 resolution on the Air. The 15-inch comes in at 2,880-by-1,800 resolution. The keyboard also gets an update with second-generation butterfly switches, while the size of the Force Touch trackpad has been increased by 46 percent. At the risk of being called a gimmick, the Touch Bar was introduced as an "about time" update to the function keys. The Retina display technology replaces standard system functions, like brightness and volume control, and can adapt to whatever software you're currently using. So, if you're browsing in Safari, the Touch Bar will show you buttons for your favorite websites. If you're in Photos, you can straighten out your crooked photos with a swipe of a finger. When typing, it'll show you QuickType suggestions for frequently used words—much like an iPhone might. Professionally, Apple made an appeal to filmmakers, graphic artists, and musicians by demoing the Touch Bar's integration with popular programs like Final Cut Pro and Photoshop. But while the Touch Bar is new to the MacBook Pro, this isn't necessarily the first time we've seen something like it. The Lenovo X1 Carbon Touch also replaced the function keys with a similar touch strip called the Adaptive Function Row. Another more subtle update is the Touch ID power button. With the new MacBook Pro, you'll be able to login simply by pressing on the Power button. It features a second-generation sensor covered with sapphire crystal and is supported by the Apple T1 chip. Apple was quick to point out that this will make it easy to buy things through Apple Pay; if you share the MacBook Pro, you can switch between users with a tap of your finger. While Apple was keen to push these two updates as major reasons to upgrade, it's important to note that the MacBook Pros with Touch Bar and Touch ID opt for four Thunderbolt 3 ports, a headphone jack, and...that's it. A 13-inch version without Touch Bar/Touch ID has two Thunderbolt ports. By comparison, last year's MacBook Pro came complete with an HDMI port, two Thunderbolt 2 ports, an SDXC card reader, and two USB 3.0 ports. The 13-inch MacBook Air comes with a headset jack, two microphones, a MagSafe 2 power jack, two USB 3.0 ports, Thunderbolt 2 port, and an SDXC card reader. Anyone looking to upgrade should be comfortable buying a few extra dongles. The starting $1,799 configuration of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and Touch ID features a sixth-generation 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, Intel Iris Graphics 550, 8GB of memory, a 256GB PCIe-based solid-state drive, and up to 10 hours of battery life. While this is an improvement from the 2015 MacBook Pro, which had a fifth-generation Intel Core i5, and the Air, it's still not the most current seventh-generation Kaby Lake processor, a bit of a head scratcher considering the price. And even though we know it has a sixth-generation Intel chip, it's unclear what the exact Core i5 processor will be. At the end of the day, that's what it really comes down to. The 13-inch 2015 MacBook Pro started at $1,299, while the 13-inch Air starts at a neat $999. Does an extra $500-$800 for the Touch Bar, Touch ID, and four Thunderbolt ports merit an upgrade? (And don't forget to factor in those dongles!) For most people, probably not. Fans of ultraportability and port options can opt for another MacBook Air or stick with their current MacBook Pro. But if your MacBook is wheezing and on the verge of death, or you're super excited by Touch Bar and Touch ID, the new MacBook Pro might be the revolutionary high-end ultraportable of your dreams.

We used to use our home computers for everything from checking email, to surfing the web, to listening to music. Now we’re doing that with our smartphones, tablets, and even voice-controlled, Internet-connected speakers. These shifts in consumer behavior have thrown the PC market into free fall. Global shipments dropped 3.9% year-over-year this past quarter, according to research firm IDC. Computer makers like Lenovo and HP have responded by trying to make their PCs more like tablets. Their two-in-one “hybrid” devices can work as both a desktop and a tablet, powered by Microsoft’s touchscreen-friendly Windows 10. There’s evidence the market for these hybrids is is growing. But that hasn’t been enough to stop the bleeding. “The total available market for shipping PCs into the home is getting smaller and smaller,” says IDC analyst Linn Huang. Even in this grim environment, Apple and rival Microsoft aren’t giving up on PCs. Both companies this week unveiled new computers that, taken together, offer a glimpse of what the future holds for desktops and laptops. With Apple’s new MacBook Pro laptop, the standout feature is a touchscreen strip called the Touch Bar. It offers different functionality depending on what app the user has open. Launch iTunes, and you’ll see playback controls. Switch to Safari, and you’ll see a list of your open tabs. The Touch Bar also packs Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint scanner, enabling mobile payments and lightning-fast switching between user accounts. Microsoft’s new Surface Studio, meanwhile, is a behemoth desktop with a built-in hinge that allows it to lie nearly flat. When combined with the firm’s Surface Pen stylus and new Surface Dial control input, the Studio offers an experience more akin to using a drawing desk or an easel than a computer. It’s a bold effort for what is, believe it or not, the four-decade-old firm’s first desktop computer. Taken together, Apple’s new MacBook Pro and Microsoft’s Surface Studio are an acknowledgement of a reality facing PC vendors: Desktops and laptops are increasingly becoming more useful as professional tools than consumer gadgets. That explains the flashy new features: You and I probably don’t need a desktop that folds down to a 20-degree angle, but an architect or graphic artist might. It also justifies their sky-high cost. The MacBook Pros with the Touch Bar start at $1,799, while the Surface Studio will set you back at least $2,999. Those price tags are tough for an everyday user to justify, but professionals might see the machines as an investment if they’re making money by using them. Indeed, while unveiling the new MacBook Pro, Apple pitched its Touch Bar as a boon for video and photo editors, DJs, artists and other creatives. Microsoft’s Surface Studio reveal, meanwhile, was crafted to pitch the computer and Dial accessory as a content creators’ dream. Meanwhile, if you’re a student writing a term paper or a parent uploading pictures to Facebook, you’re probably fine with a tablet or hybrid like an iPad or Surface Pro, or an inexpensive computer like a Chromebook. To be sure, there are other computer makers out there offering mid-range desktops and laptops, mostly running Windows. But Apple and Microsoft at least appear convinced that the PC is for professionals, and speedier processors, sharper screens and better keyboards alone aren’t enough to entice them to buy new computers. (The situation is different for office workers, says IDC’s Huang, who will be long tied to the PC.) All this is important because of Apple and Microsoft’s stature in the technology world. Apple has long been a trendsetter in PCs — the first MacBook Air was a revelation, heralding the age of the ultrabook. Microsoft is a comparatively new player in hardware, but its bold efforts like the Surface Book are attracting well-deserved attention. That said, neither company makes much of their money from desktops and laptops, and that isn’t likely to change. But the computers these two firms produce could very well set the tone for the PCs of the future. That being true, expect plenty more high-powered, feature-packed, very expensive machines. The rest of us, meanwhile, will keep on swiping at our smartphones. Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Firmware Friday: iPhone 7 Plus portrait beta; updates for Sigma sd Quattro, MC-11 converter, 150-600 lens 150-600mm apple firmware firmware friday firmware update iphone 7 plus iphone 7 plus portrait mode mc-11 sd quattro sigma sigma sd quattro by Mike Tomkins posted Friday, October 28, 2016 at 3:19 PM EST     After a brief hiatus last week, Firmware Friday returns this week with news of updates from both Apple and Sigma. We've covered Apple's iOS 10.1 update, which includes a beta release of the Portrait Camera function for the iPhone 7 Plus, in an earlier article. Hence we'll focus on Sigma's news here. Sigma sd Quattro, MC-11 EF-E Mount Converter and 150-600mm F5-6.3 DG OS HSM | Sports / Contemporary lenses First up, we have firmware version 1.03 for the Sigma sd Quattro digital camera. This makes but one change: A fix for potential camera lockups when shooting via a tether from Sigma Capture Pro if the AF Capture, AF Drive Only or MF Capture buttons were pressed. If you've been troubled by this issue, you can download the Sigma sd Quattro firmware version 1.03 update here. Moving on to the MC-11 mount converter, there's an update to firmware version 1.02 for the Canon EF to Sony E-mount variant. This makes several changes: Firstly, support has been added for Sigma's 12-24mm F4 DG HSM | Art, 500mm F4 DG OS HSM | Sports and 85mm F1.4 DG HSM | Art lenses. Startup time has also been reduced by removing the focus cycle when the camera is powered on, and support for lens-based stabilization has been added when using lenses incompatible with body-based stabilization. Finally, AF accuracy has been improved for some Canon lenses, and distortion correction is now indicated correctly when using Sigma's 24-105mm F4 DG OS HSM | Art lens. You can download the MC-11 EF-E mount converter update here. Finally, we come to the closely-related Sigma 150-600mm F5-6.3 DG OS HSM | Sports and Contemporary lenses. Here, the changes are applicable only if you're shooting with the Canon or Sigma-mount versions, but not their Nikon-mount equivalents. The precise changes made vary depending upon your mount type. If you own a Sigma-mount variant of either lens, the only changes made are to improve AF accuracy when mounted on the Sigma sd Quattro camera body, or the MC-11 SA-E mount adapter. If you're shooting with the Canon-mount variants, you'll also get improved AF accuracy with the equivalent MC-11 EF-E mount adapter or when shooting unadapted in live view mode on an EOS camera body. This change will come accompanied by reduced aperture diaphragm noise when shooting movies using this adapter, or shooting on an unadapted EOS body. The degree of the improvements on EOS bodies will vary with the camera model. Finally, there's now compatibility with the Canon EOS C300 Mark II camera body as well. You can get the lens updates at the links below: Sigma 150-600mm F5-6.3 DG OS HSM | Sports firmware version 1.05 for Canon / version 1.02 for Sigma 150-600mm F5-6.3 DG OS HSM | Contemporary firmware version 1.03 for Canon / version 1.01 for Sigma And that's it for this week's roundup.

But don’t take our word for it! What follows are the greatest Vines of all time, as chosen by Select All editors and colleagues. They are in no particular order, and run the full gamut of Vine — from stupidly hilarious to hilariously stupid. Long may they loop in our memory. Apple Store Woman In many ways, the Apple Store woman was the quintessential Vine. She is at once both hilarious in her anger, and understandable. Anyone who owns an Apple product has had to endure the Apple Store. This woman is a monument to that experience. —Brian Feldman Squidward Hit the Dab The brevity of Vines and the easiness of recording them made them superb for capturing moments that nobody might believe otherwise, such as the Squidward dabbing. Nobody would believe that this happened were it not for Vine, and honestly, I still kinda don’t. —BF Why You Always Lying So many questions about this one, but the two I always think of are: (1) why wasn’t this released as a single, and (2) what’s up with the toilet? —BF Eyebrows on Fleek Vine, for as short-lived as it was, bore new additions to the cultural vocabulary that will outlast us all. Never forget “on fleek,” created by Peaches Monroee two years ago to describe the next-level flawlessness of her eyebrows. (Because “on point” just didn’t do them justice.) It has since been adapted (and appropriated) for those crucial “feeling myself” moments, no matter how uncool you still sound saying it out loud. —Dee Lockett Back at It Again Krispy Kreme This is the Vine that finally made me understand the hypnotizing power of the Loop. Every time I watch it, I think, “This is it. This time, the video will continue on and we’ll see the sign hit the ground.” But the sign never hits the ground and shatters, and it never will. —BF Do It for the Vine The sole purpose of Vine was to set aside all dignity in the name of internet fame. Grown folks knew this, teens knew this, but young children? They are mere pawns in the scheme, but dammit, if they haven’t been responsible for some of the best Vines. Just look at this little star-in the-making — she slyly pretends she won’t “do it for the Vine,” but you know she will. And when she does “it,” you’ll melt forever. —DL Duck Army We all know that the sound of one rubber duck toy honking is annoying. But who knew that the sound of a whole bin is (1) more like pained moaning, and (2) completely horrifying? What really gets me is the wide-eyed frozen expressions painted on the ducks’ faces, as if they’re trying to get somebody, anybody, to help free them from this miserable, loud, rubbery existence. I wonder how long it took for this hideous flock’s moans to die out after the Viner slinked away. Pour one out for all the toy-store employees who had to deal with teens re-creating this nightmare. —Marissa Cetin Hater Blockers Me. —BF Weed Crayon There are a million different things happening in this Vine. It’s like one of those hidden-image galleries in Highlights where you had to find the shoe hidden in the tree. Each time you watch it, something wrong — and yet, so right — will reveal itself. In the history of civilization, there has never been a joke funnier than dialing 911 into a microwave. —BF I Tapped the Breaks On a trip home from McDonald’s, after Vine star Lauren Lavoie executed one well-placed pump of the brakes, her sister Joanne gagged on a McFlurry spoon and emitted a guttural retch that would later become the audio centerpiece of a Vine that would reach 70 million users. The moment, the gag specifically, went onto become a favorite meme among power Vine users and was remixed countless times to great pop-cultural effect. — Kenny Wassus Broom Broom For whatever, tragic reason, the original Vine of Scottish teenager Trish Simmonds pretending to drive her mom’s car has been removed. But the short film loses none of its power as a YouTube that retains the full narrative arc: Trish is in the car, and then her mom tells her to get out of the car, and then Trish is sad. Poetry. — Max Read Jeb Bush Loves Technology This is probably Jeb! Bush’s most important contribution to this election, edited by Election Vine Hero Vic Berger IV from a campaign video of “Jeb[!]’s Silicon Valley Favorites,” in which Jeb! literally just names things. The *chef’s kiss* of the Vine is whatever that uncomfortable intake of breath and smile Jeb! is. Please clap! —MC Shovel Vine As lovely and warm and funny as Vine could be, it could also be a place of unspeakable (but still, honestly, funny) violence. Shovel girl — Miranda Fugate — is fine, by the way. —MR Hemtube Dance It isn’t what we say that defines us, but what we do when alone in our apartment. Korean Viner hemtube showed us how she celebrates new comfy pajamas with the help of her cat and a killer loop lifted from vaporwave artist HOME. —Byron Hulcher Ounces Unicorn The rhythmically perfect pairing of Migos’s “Ounces” and the floor routine of a person in a very elaborate unicorn costume, at what appears to be some sort of children’s assembly, makes this Vine transcendent. An added bonus are the two seated mascot types in the background at the very beginning of the clip, who play the perfect hypemen as our unicorn star begins its march into Vine infamy. — Andrew Leigh What Are Those In 2015, a year fraught with tension toward police and issues with filming them, Vine user A-RODney King added much-needed levity when he demanded an on-duty and unexpecting officer answer for his Frankenstein-esque combat boots. “WHAT ARE THOSE?” went onto garner nearly 40 million loops, and prompted thousands of users to create their own takes of the meme. —KW Do You Guys Even Listen to Drake? Canadian Vine star Jus Reign wants to know: Do these guys even listen to Drake? Reign, a breakout star for videos in which he plays himself and a stern father who calls him ugly, is a master of squeezing both a joke, and its surreal unraveling, into the short six seconds Vine allows. —MR Today’s Forecast TFW you hear Vine is getting shut down. —MR Nae Nae to Anything The best Vines surprised you with a new spin on a classic song. The best Viners were black high school students. Therefore, this is a perfect Vine. — Sarah Caldwell The Quiznos Sign Spinner The beauty of this Vine is that you think this prodigious Quiznos employee is nailing it with his sign twirls and flips … that is, until the narrator swoops in with a pithy observation. It’s rough out there for a sign spinner. — Christine Nguyen My Best Friend Whatever happened to the original “That’s My Best Friend” Vine seems to be about as much of a mystery as how Kendall Jenner and Young Thug also came to be credited for it. Still, there’s no question that rapper Toyko Vanity, in one tribute to her BFF, created an instant-classic meme beyond her own control. She even turned it into a full song and ringtone! We’ll always remember it as our best anthem for Shine Theory. —DL Post Up WorldStarHipHop used to be the place we all went to indulge our petty tendencies, but who knew the most scathing playground fight in middle-school history would live on Vine? There is no recovering from this level of poised character assassination. RIP to all her haters. —DL Who Is She? No one knows.

Let’s compare the specs of the new MacBook Pro against those of another powerful 13-inch notebook, the HP Spectre x360. Related: Apple’s new MacBook Pro doesn’t outrun competitors, but the Touch Bar is special Performance When you’re buying a 13-inch laptop, you’re going to sacrifice a little horsepower for portability, and it shows on the new MacBook Pro and the HP Spectre x360. Neither one is spectacularly powerful, but they can both be outfitted with increased storage space and RAM, though those options can get costly pretty quick. Comparing the base specs for both laptops, they’re on even footing. MacBook 13-inch (with Touch Bar) HP Spectre x360 Size 11.97 x 8.36 x 0.59 inches 12.03 x 8.58 x 0.54 inches Weight 3.02 pounds 2.85 pounds Display 13.3 inch Retina Display 13.3-inch touch display Resolution 2,560 x 1600 1,920 x 1080 Operating System MacOS Sierra Windows 10 Storage 256, 512GB, 1TB SSD 256, or 512GB SSD CPU Intel Core i5 Intel Core i5 / Intel Core i7 RAM 8GB or 16GB 8GB or 16GB Graphics Intel Iris Graphics 550 Intel HD Graphics 620 Camera Front 720p FaceTime camera Front 720p Connectivity  Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 4x USB-C Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 3x USB 3.0, HDMI, Mini DisplayPort Battery Up to 10 hours Up to 15 hours Price $1,800 base model $1,050 base model Availability 2-3 weeks Available now DT review Hands-on Hands-on The new MacBook Pro features a dual-core Intel Core i5 processor alongside 8GB of RAM, which is nearly identical to the base model HP Spectre x360. Though it’s worth pointing out that the Spectre’s CPU is a 7th-generation Kaby Lake model, while the MacBook’s is a 6th-generation Skylake model. Though similar in raw clock speed, you might get a little extra mileage out of the Spectre’s processor, plus it can be upgraded to an Intel Core i7 for a little extra cash. The Mac does have an advantage in maximum storage size though, not to mention that the onboard Intel Iris graphics chip will outperform the Intel HD graphics chip found in the x360. All-in-all though, they’re pretty evenly matched, with a slight edge going to the MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar. Display This one’s another area where the HP Spectre X360 and 13-inch MacBook Pro come to the table evenly matched, but they both have a couple tricks up their sleeves. The Spectre’s display is crisp, sharp, detailed, but not quite as high-resolution as the MacBook Pro. However, the Spectre x360 comes with a touchscreen, and the MacBook Pro does not. Remember, the Spectre x360 is a convertible 2-in-1 laptop, so it pulls double duty as a tablet. For that reason, it’s might look like the Spectre has a leg up on the MacBook Pro in this round, but there are a couple other factors to consider. Related: Fans of Apple’s cinema display may have to wait a while for an update. However, the MacBook Pro features a brand new Touch Bar where the function keys used to be, so you’ll be able to get a taste of a touchscreen experience. For the display category, the MacBook Pro comes out on top on account of its superior resolution. But if you’re a fan of tablets and you need your laptop to have a touchscreen, you might overlook those missing pixels on the HP Spectre x360. Portability Apple made a lot of noise about the latest MacBook Pro being the thinnest, lightest, Pro offering in their lineup, but the HP Spectre x360 is also remarkably thin, particularly for a 2-in-1. The Spectre made waves earlier this year as one of the thinnest 2-in-1 laptops available, weighing in at just over half an inch thick altogether. Similarly, the 13-inch MacBook Pro also comes in at just over half an inch thick. So, we’re going to have to take a closer look. The HP Spectre x360 has a minuscule advantage here, with a height of 0.54 inches, which is just a hair thinner than the MacBook Pro which is exactly 0.59 inches thick. The Spectre also weighs less, at 2.58 pounds to the MacBook’s 3.02 pounds. All right, that’s splitting hairs, so which one is going to be more comfortable to carry around? The HP Spectre x360 is actually lighter by a fair margin, certainly enough to feel when you heft both laptops. You’re not likely to notice much of a difference once you toss it in your bag, but it’s worth noting that the Spectre is significantly lighter and a little thinner. In fact, the HP Spectre x360 might come out further ahead since it’s capable of performing as a tablet, and offers a slightly more versatile user experience – and may have better battery life, at a quoted maximum of 15 hours against the Mac’s 10 hours. Manufacturer estimates can be unreliable, so you should take that with a grain of salt. But, the HP does actually have a bigger battery, at 57.8 watts against the MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar, which has a 49.2 watt-hour unit.  So there’s reason to think the HP may in fact be the winner. This round goes to the HP Spectre x360 hands-down, it’s thinner, lighter, has a bigger battery, and can pull double-duty as a tablet making it the all around winner when it comes to portability. Connectivity If you look at wireless connections like Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, the MacBook Pro and HP Spectre x360 have identical specs. Both support 802.11ac, and Bluetooth 4.0, the differences really come into sharp contrast when you have a look at those other ports. The USB ports. Malarie Gokey/Digital Trends Given Apple’s war on ports, it should come as little surprise that the 13-inch MacBook Pro has done away with the MagSafe port in favor of a streamlined design which features four identical USB-C ports, and a single headphone jack. The MacBook Pro does not support USB-A, the traditional USB plug you’ve probably got lying around your home or office, so you might have to invest in some adapters if you’ve been eyeing the MacBook Pro. That said, the HP Spectre x360 also features a streamlined design and foregoes connectivity in favor of simplicity. The Spectre features two USB-C ports, one USB-A port, and one headphone jack. So, if you’re keeping score, the HP Spectre has four ports to the MacBook Pro’s five. This round is a draw. The MacBook technically has one more port than the Spectre, but the Spectre has at least one traditional USB port, and while USB-C is definitely the future of the I/O standard, most of us still have USB-A peripherals lying around so that port is going to see some serious use. Design If there’s one thing that sets the HP Spectre x360 and the MacBook Pro apart, it’s design. One epitomizes a classic, tried and true design, while the other forges down a new path, offering a uniquely flexible user experience. The MacBook Pro is, like all other Apple computers, built to exacting specifications. The internals are fitted perfectly within the chassis, without a single wasted millimeter, and it shows. The new MacBook Pro is just as solid, beautiful and understated as it always has been. It’s an elevation of the typical laptop design, rather than a radical reinterpretation and just by looking at it you’ll be able to tell if it’s the choice for you. Related: Apple debuted more than just new MacBooks at today’s big event.  The HP Spectre x360 on the other hand applies similarly high-quality build standard to a new form factor. The HP attempts tp deliver on the same kind of experience you’d have with a MacBook Pro, with the added functionality you’d get out of a tablet, and it succeeds for the most part. We’re going to just barely give this round to the MacBook Pro. The Spectre is an admirable attempt to capture that premium feel, but it’s just a hair behind, we feel. This mostly has to do with looks. Both laptops are very solid, but we think the appearance of the Pro is just a bit more alluring, while the Spectre x360 comes off as overly formal and business-like. Pricing This one is about as objective as it gets. Which one is more affordable? Which one will cost me an arm and maybe a leg? We’ll let the numbers speak for themselves. The 13-inch MacBook Pro, with Touch Bar, starts at $1,800. The HP Spectre x360, with nearly identical internal specs, starts at $1,050. The Spectre wins this round handily. You could almost purchase two Spectres for the price of one MacBook Pro, or buy a Spectre now, and buy a new Spectre in a couple years. Conclusion This comparison certainly shows why some users aren’t that excited about the new MacBook Pro. In this comparison, the Pro does come out slightly ahead in performance, display quality, and design. But it also without question loses in portability, and it’s less versatile, since it doesn’t have a touchscreen. Then there’s the price. At $1,800, the least expensive MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar is several hundred more than the most expensive HP Spectre x360. Even the MacBook Pro 13 without Touch Bar is $1,500. That’s difficult to accept. Based on the numbers alone — with the caveat that we’ve only had hands-on time with these systems and our full reviews are pending — the HP seems the better buy.

So who came out on top? Was it Microsoft with their first-ever desktop PC, the futuristic Surface Studio, or Apple, with its toe-dip into touch computing with their all-new line MacBook Pro laptops? Cases can be made for both and we’ve got full coverage of both events including hands-on impressions and opinions on how the rise of touch and 3D technologies could change the way we compute – and create. Buh-bye Vine, it was nice looping you More bad news from Twitter as the social media company says they plan to shutter the Vine app, which while never a giant hit, is still beloved by its many enthusiastic users. Introduced three years ago, Vine let users produce six-second videos that endlessly looped, leading to some pretty creative productions that gave us a lot of laughs – or showed some critical slices of reality, such as clips from the Ferguson protests. Twitter says that while the ability to post new Vines will end in the coming months, clips already posted will live on for our collective enjoyment and will also be downloadable so you can save them. Why kill Vine? It wasn’t a moneymaker for Twitter, and since the company is essentially struggling to stay afloat, we’re not too surprised that it’s getting the ax. Tom Hanks is out to save the world for the 274th time It’s Friday and that means movie night for a lot of people, and the latest chapter in the Da Vinci Code series, called Inferno, opens tonight. DT cinephile Rich Marshall got an early look at the third installment of the Dan Brown trilogy, which stars Tom Hanks of course and is again directed by Ron Howard. Also starring in Inferno? Little-known actress Felicity Jones, who will head up some movie called Rogue One a few weeks from now. Heard of that one? Anyway, Hanks is on the hunt for clues using Dante’s famous Inferno that will hopefully lead him to the bad guys planning to release a terrible virus. Will he figure it all out in time, despite having ill-timed bouts of amnesia from a head injury? Wow, that really does sound like a movie plot. Be sure to leave your review in the comments section.

After months of speculation, Apple showed off the Touch Bar, a strip of touch-sensitive OLED screen that changes with the computing task at hand.  The screen is located where the function keys used to be. That’s a welcome addition if you’re a MacOS user who wants another way to control applications. But what if you’re a Windows user running the MacBook Pro using Apple’s Boot Camp dual-boot system? The answer is simple — the Touch Bar turns into a static row of virtual function keys, MacRumors reports. Related: Apple’s Boot Camp only supports Windows 10  The question was asked and answered via an email exchange between Apple user Abraham and Apple software engineer chief Craig Frederight. Abraham asked, “Craig, am I correct in assuming that the Touch Bar becomes a row of visual function keys when using Windows with Boot Camp?” Federight answered, “You are indeed!” Given the incredibly thin and light nature of the new MacBooks, their enhanced trackpads and keyboards, and the improvements in connectivity options, one can assume that the machines will be at least as popular among Windows users as past MacBooks have been. The Windows ecosystem is strong in its own right, with machines like Dell’s XPS 13 and HP’s latest Spectre x360 offering their own benefits to Windows users, but Apple’s options remain good ones as well. There’s no word yet if Boot Camp will ever support more advanced Touch Bar features with Windows. It’s possible they won’t because Touch Bar support might be baked into MacOS at a deeper level, and Apple may have no real desire to give up such a strong advantage of MacOS on its own hardware. Boot Camp has always provided decent Windows support, but nobody could ever call it equal to MacOS. Apple hasn’t confirmed the email exchange, and so the veracity of this information remains a bit uncertain. Nevertheless, the solution makes perfect sense as a way to maintain Boot Camp’s validity in light of such fundamental changes to the MacBook Pro line.

No. It's cloud infrastructure all the way down Gaming is not as addictive Exclusive Apple and its products prompted almost 500 complaints to the US Federal Trade Commission in the past 22 months – a number that suggests the iGiant has cut the rate at which consumers express dissatisfaction. That of course doesn't include social media ire about the new MacBook Pro. The Register sent a Freedom of Information Act request to the FTC seeking "complaints about Apple's iOS App Store developer rules, revenue sharing, or business practices since January 2015." The FTC received the request on October 20 and responded a week later, showing promptness that's unusual for a federal agency. The trade enforcement agency withheld eight complaints under a section of the FTC Act that allows the agency to not disclose material related to a consumer complaint from a foreign source if that source has requested confidentiality. A similar but not identical FOIA request covering the 17-month period between January 2009 and May 2010 produced 450 complaints. On a per month basis, FTC complaints about Apple have declined from 26.5 to 22.6. Though this is an inherently imprecise comparison due to the fact that the information requests were phrased differently, the fact that Apple sold almost 40 million iPhones in 2010 and 232 million in 2015 suggests complaints should scale with customers. The Register asked Apple whether it cared to provide any detail about whether product complaints have risen, fallen, or remained the same relative to unit sales. Apple has not responded. What people complained about The litany of dissatisfaction in the complaints seldom rises to the level of credibility. Many of those voicing their dissatisfaction to the government demonstrate little interest in communicating clearly or presenting an actionable claim. It's almost enough to elicit sympathy for government officials and Apple's customer service team. Some of the grievances involve Apple only tangentially. For example, several people recount being prompted to call Apple technical support using a phone number presented through a Safari popup window and then being told to pay a fee. This is a common scam and isn't exclusive to Apple products. Cord cutters Others have legitimate issues with Apple products that have failed or never worked properly, or with products sold as genuine Apple products that turn out to be something else. Product flaws of this sort affect every hardware maker. About two dozen of the complaints concern cables or cords. Apple has has some issues with these in the past. Battery-related problems and dissatisfaction with having to pay Apple's battery replacement price also come up among the complaints frequently. There are quite a few complaints about App Store charges made by minors without permission, something the FTC dealt with through a 2014 settlement with Apple that nonetheless appears to be an ongoing problem. One of the more substantive complaints involves a request for the FTC to push for a more standardized and transparent way for companies like Apple and Google to handle how apps get withdrawn from the market and how consumers get notified. Safeguards for personal information Another complaint seeks FTC help in reviewing Apple's rules for where it stores the data of its customers. Apple, the complainant wrote, forces US citizens to move data to Apple accounts outside the US when they reside abroad, a requirement that has some privacy and data security implications. The writer claims to be an airline industry worker who has been on a work visa in New Zealand. Apple, the person said, has stopped accepting payment from a Visa card issued through a US banking institution to cover the iCloud storage fee. The complainant faces the prospect of losing the data if the fee isn't paid. Apple customer service, the person said, has advised moving the data to a New Zealand-based account. "My reading suggests that Apple does this for its own convenience, tax purposes, and music copyright laws, and does not take into account how personal documents [of US citizens] stored in the cloud ... are handled in these offshore accounts," the person wrote. "In my view Apple is holding my personal data, documents, and photos hostage by refusing to accept my payment. They then suggest I fix it by 'voluntarily' moving my Apple account and personal data offshore, away from the country [in which] I opened the account and away from the country [where] I am a citizen." Bloated software Objecting to the iOS 8.2 update, one person said, "I believe that Apple is stealing iPhone data storage space with every update that it pushes out to its customers." The Apple Watch app, the person said, is unnecessary and only serves to take up space and advertise the Apple Watch. Another customer from Canada objected the iPhone 4s being advertised as having 16GB of memory when they only have 12.5GB of space available after the operating system and pre-installed apps are taken into consideration. This issue was partially resolved through the release of iOS 10, which allowed iPhone users for the first time to remove the apps that Apple ships with its iPhone. Moving beyond technical complaints, there are only a handful of objections to Apple's business practices. One person writing to the FTC asks the agency to investigate Apple rather than Google over antitrust issues. "Apple really is anti-competitive and exhibits all the behavior that Android is being considered to be anti-competitive for," a complaint says. "This does not make sense. Apple is the company that should be investigated here for making a closed system that competitors cannot touch, for not allowing anyone to sell anything in Apple's ecosystem of devices and software without Apple's consent, for behaving vindictively and using underhanded tactics to push other businesses out of existence …" Blocking repair work Another antitrust-oriented complaint objects to an issue in iOS 9 that prevented certain repairs if done by a non-authorized technician. "Apple has rolled out an updated operating system (iOS 9) that completely disables your device if it has been serviced by a technician not employed by Apple (Error 53)," a person wrote. Apple addressed this issue with a patch in iOS 9.3. Resentment of Apple's control over its software ecosystem comes up in the context of Apple's App Store. "I think it is ridiculous that I can only download and install apps by using Apple's App Store," a complaint says. "It's my phone and I should be able to choose what apps I want to install. "...It seems like those who own an iPhone are forced into a monopoly situation with purchasing apps. I recall a similar situation with Microsoft years ago when the courts ruled that Microsoft wasn't allowed to push Internet Explorer on the people who use the Windows operating system and I feel like this is very similar." Throwing older OS X under a bus Dissatisfaction with Apple's decision to stop supporting older macOS versions with security patches also elicited a complaint. One person objected to the fact that his or her OS X 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion) will not receive a patch for a security vulnerability (CVE-2015-1130). "According to the researcher who discovered and reported the issue, 'Apple indicated that this issue required a substantial amount of changes on their side, and that they will not back port the fix to 10.9.x and older,'" the complainant wrote. "I feel Apple deceived me when they claimed OS X 10.8 was the 'the safest and most secure.' … Apple is clearly deceiving us (the consumers), failing to meet its obligations to us (the consumers), and we (the consumers) need the FTC's help here. The remedy I demand is a patch for the defective operating system." Apple is not alone in its habit of leaving old software behind, unpatched and vulnerable. A recent complaint takes issue with the fact that Apple's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models are available with two different modems. "Apple sells two iPhone 7 variants," the person wrote. "One version has an Intel modem that only supports GSM networks (AT&T – T-Mobile) The other version has a QUALCOMM modem (sold to only Verizon and Sprint) that supports all US networks. Apple is forcing AT&T and T-Mobile customer to purchase an inferior phone." And finally... Perhaps the most provocative complaint comes from someone who wants Apple's policy on nudity changed. "I would like to ask that the Attorney General request or compel Apple to [reverse] its policies regarding adult content/pornography," the person wrote. "The reason I ask is because everything is constantly censored on my devices, which are my property. ... I have had images denied for having a slight bulge in the crotch of my pants. I find these policies harassive, repressive, and in violation of the Constitution's freedom of religion." ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 44 Comments More from The Register Analyst: iPhone 7 points to price jump It is all in the numbers 30 Comments Cheapest Apple iPhone 7's flash memory is waaaaay slower than pricier model Your donation is insufficient.

Specifically, Apple says that more than 16GB of RAM “at this time would require a memory system that consumes much more power and wouldn’t be efficient enough for a notebook.” To put more than 16GB of fast RAM into a notebook design at this time would require a memory system that consumes much more power and wouldn’t be efficient enough for a notebook. I hope you check out this new generation MacBook Pro, it really is an incredible system. 9to5Mac confirmed the email response, shared with us by a reader, was sent to a customer by Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller. The new MacBook Pro models for the most part get around 10-hours of battery life across the board, and it sounds like Apple didn’t want to compromise that all-important spec by offering a machine with a 32GB RAM option that might reduce that, as Schiller noted. The new 13-inch models come with 8GB of memory stock with the option to upgrade to 16GB, while the new 15-inch MacBook Pros all come with 16GB standard. Yesterday we gave you a rundown on the current MacBook lineup, comparing all the new models and built-to-order upgrades on offer.

[Photo: courtesy of Apple] Mark Sullivan 10.28.16 5:00 PM Yesterday's big Apple event to announce a long-awaited refresh to its Mac line—a couple of new MacBook Pro 13-inch models and new 15-inch model—prompted big headlines, but will the buzz last? You can think of the refresh in two ways: The new machines got the normal component upgrades (faster chip, better battery life, etc.) and a new shell design that’s thinner and smaller than the last generation. That stuff happens with every refresh of an Apple product. The thing that makes the refresh special is the addition of a new feature called the Touch Bar that replaces the row of function keys on the keyboard with a long, narrow OLED touchscreen. The Touch Bar contains a line of shortcuts and content keys that change depending on the program you’re using. (Apple also added a Touch ID button for easier login and for using Apple Pay.) The Touch Bar may be a first step into wider use of touch-screen technology in Macs, and it could lead one day to a MacBook Pro with a full touch-screen display. The Touch Bar can also be seen as the replacement of some physical, tactile controls (the function keys) with a digital interface like we have on our smartphones. But on the day after the announcement (that "ooh that’s cool" moment has worn off), I’m wondering if we’ll look back a year from now and see the Touch Bar as a landmark improvement to the user interface, or as a cool-looking feature that nobody uses that much. I do have my doubts about the Touch Bar's real usefulness. In apps that already rely heavily on shortcuts—like GarageBand and Photoshop—the Touch Bar might be very useful indeed. But in apps that have already evolved to work well with a pointer, I’m not sure people will be able to immediately integrate the Touch Bar options into their workflows. When you’re in the zone cruising around the screen with the touchpad or connected mouse, are you really going to break away from that flow, look down at the keyboard, move your hand away from the touchpad (which, by the way, is twice as big on the new MacBook Pros), and look for the right button on the Touch Bar? Maybe, depending on the app, but it would take some getting used to. People who use programs like Photoshop and Final Cut a lot might not need the Touch Bar controls, because they already have well-worn habits for completing tasks. The Touch Bar might be more helpful for people who are relatively new to those programs. The most useful Touch Bar tricks I saw yesterday fit into two types. The first are controls, such as in the Photoshop Touch Bar, that can be touched with the left hand to select modes and styles, allowing the right hand to go about its business on the touch pad. The second useful tool I saw lets you adjust things, like the angle of an image or the degree of image opacity, by moving a slider back and forth on the Touch Bar. That's something that can't be done as easily using the touch pad. Other Touch Bar uses I’m seeing today don’t look that useful. Microsoft has built Touch Bar integration for its Office apps, but many of them just replicate the function buttons in the apps' command bar. These are things like the bold, italic, and bullet point buttons. Do I really need a new button for those so badly that I'm willing to change my long-used workflows in those programs? I have my doubts. My colleague Harry McCracken points out that Apple did a smart thing opening up the Touch Bar to developers right out of the gate. The value of the Touch Bar could increase if developers begin getting really creative about Touch Bar tools that save clicks and make apps more enjoyable to use. "I think the TouchBar will offer some modest benefits to people—as long as enough application developers take advantage of it," says Technalysis president Bob O’Donnell, "because it keeps the screen clear of your hands, which can be difficult with a traditional touch screen." Without using the new MacBook Pros for a few weeks with my favorite programs, there’s no way of knowing for sure how useful the Touch Bar would really be. But lots of people who are coveting the new MacBook Pros today are in the same boat. My advice to new prospective buyers is this: If you’re going to lay the credit card down for one of the new MacBooks, and if the Touch Bar is a big part of why you’re buying, think hard about how the new feature will fit into your normal work (and play). If you’re simply due for a new MacBook Pro because yours is old, well, I’m not going to dispute that the new MacBooks are worth the money based on their power, design, functionality, and, yes, pure beauty. The new machines are a strong extension of a long tradition of laptop making at Apple, and they are as popular as they are for good reason. It’s interesting to me that Apple decided to offer one SKU of the new MacBook Pro without the Touch Pad. This means the company has identified a market segment that wants the design and component upgrades of the new MacBook Pro but doesn’t attach enough value to the Touch Bar and Touch ID button to pay another $300 for them. And these new machines aren’t cheap. Apple pushed up the prices on this year’s model significantly, relative to the last generation. The 13-inch version of the device with Touch Bar/Touch ID starts at $1,799 compared to the starting price of $1,299 for the 13-inch in the previous generation. The 15-inch model with Touch Bar/ID starts at $2,399. Not everybody is as skeptical as I am. Long-time Apple analyst Tim Bajarin (Creative Strategies) believes the Touch Bar is right in line with Apple’s approach to the user interface. "It reflects Steve Jobs design philosophy that with Macs and laptops it is much easier to use a mouse and keyboard to navigate through applications, and the Touch bar is the next logical implantation of his view on the role of touch," Bajarin says. "I think we will look back and see that the Touch Bar and supported apps will really enhance the laptop experience and be viewed as an important evolution of user interface design."

Oct 28th 2016, 9:45 PM 25,572 Views 24 Comments Share64 Tweet Email Jennifer Lawrence (left) and Kate Upton Source: PA AN AMERICAN MAN has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for hacking the accounts of Hollywood stars, which led to the online release of private nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton and other celebrities. Ryan Collins, 36, was sentenced in a US District Court in Pennsylvania for a felony violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The computer hacking charges were related to illegally accessing “over 100 Apple and Google email accounts, including those belonging to members of the entertainment industry in Los Angeles”, the US Justice Department said. The “Celebgate” hack led to the online publication in 2014 of hundreds of nude photos of celebrities including Rihanna, Avril Lavigne and Gabrielle Union. The statement did not refer to the victims by name, but several of the victims spoke publicly about the pictures. In May, Collins entered a guilty plea in connection with the hack, and admitted to a “phishing” scheme to obtain passwords, in order to then get nude pictures from the victims’ cloud online storage accounts. No evidence However, officials said there was no evidence that Collins published the pictures online. “Hackers violate federal law whenever they access private information stored online and in digital devices,” said Eileen Decker, US attorney for the central district of California. Decker said that her office will hold hackers accountable “even when they do not sell or distribute the stolen data”. By gaining illegal access to the email accounts, “Collins accessed at least 50 iCloud accounts and 72 Gmail accounts, many of which belonged to female celebrities”. Collins would sometimes also download the entire contents of the victims’ Apple iCloud backups. Collins also “ran a modelling scam in which he tricked his victims into sending him nude photographs”. In September, Edward Majerczyk agreed under a deal with federal authorities to plead guilty to one felony count of unauthorised access to a protected computer in the same “Celebgate” case. © – AFP, 2016 Read: The FBI is re-opening the investigation into the Hillary Clinton email saga Read: Fighter jets escort plane to Scottish airport after communications fail Get breaking news from TheJournal.ie via Facebook.
