Apple.Com/Mac Apple launched its newly revamped MacBook Pro during a company event in California last month. The flagship laptop underwent a large-scale upgrade for the first time in four years and now features a new OLED touchscreen panel situated above the keyboard called the Touch Bar. But is the new feature really worth buying the new Apple laptop? Thankfully, owners of old MacBook Pro models can try out the new Touch Bar feature on their current laptops by using a new app called Touché. The app is currently made available to download and it is not complicated to install. It can be launched and shut down easily just like any regular app. Users can also produce screenshots of the Touch Bar and what it displays. The Touché app was created by Daniel Jalkut, who has also developed other apps like the blogging utility MarsEdit. He founded Red Sweater Software after leaving his job as a software engineer at Apple. The Touché app is free to download and use. A number of Apple apps have Touch Bar support with the most recent macOS version. According to 9To5Mac, The 1Password app and similar third party utilities have also added Touch Bar support. The Touché app allows users to detect exactly how macOS and certain apps shall handle the Touch Bar without the need for a new MacBook Pro to adequately visualise it. While the app is free, it requires the latest macOS Sierra version 10.12.1, specifically build 16B2657. Users can update to the required version at Apple’s official support site. The new MacBook Pro model’s Touch Bar has several functional capabilities that enable a variety of commands on certain apps, but it doesn’t quite captivate users that long for full touchscreen displays. Those who have pre-ordered the latest Apple laptop may see their new Macs arrive soon as initial shipments were made on Saturday.

Apple Pay support for charitable donations kicked off on Tuesday with nonprofits ranging from global organisations such as Unicef and WWF. "We're making it incredibly easy to give back with Apple Pay," said Apple Pay's Vice President Jennifer Bailey. "We think offering such a simple and secure way to support the incredible work nonprofits will have a significant impact on the communities they serve," Bailey added. More nonprofits will offer Apple Pay over the coming months so their supporters can make easy, secure and private payments, the Cupertino-based company said in a statement. "We are thrilled that more people will help WWF tackle urgent conservation issues this holiday season and beyond with their donations via Apple Pay," said Senior Vice President Terry Macko of Marketing and Communications, WWF. David Miliband, President and CEO, International Rescue Committee, said: "Apple Pay gives supporters an easier way to help achieve our mission of helping the world's most vulnerable people."

Citing people familiar with the matter, the outlet says it’s still the exploration phase, but if the project is given the green light, the glasses could launch as early as 2018. The glasses would connect wirelessly to iPhones, and project images and other information into the wearer’s field of vision. Sources say it’s possible that they could utilize augmented reality, and it seems likely given Apple’s public interest in the tech. Apple has talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers, according to people familiar with those discussions. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing, the people said. Apple hasn’t ordered enough components so far to indicate imminent mass-production, one of the people added. Should Apple ultimately decide to proceed with the device, it would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, another person said. The Cupertino, California-based company tests many different products and is known to pivot, pause, or cancel projects without disclosing them. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. With iPhone sales stagnating, Apple is under pressure to find success in new product categories. The wearables space is particularly hot right now, and several tech companies are exploring digital glasses, but the jury is still out on growth potential.

Reuters/Stefan Wermuth The iOS 10 jailbreak tool is still elusive and fans, who look up to Chinese hacking group Pangu for regular jailbreak tools, are frustrated. The hacking group has not released anything since September when Apple first launched its operating system. Many believe that Apple’s regular updates on its operating system are the primary reason for the delay. Fans are still waiting for the iOS 10.0.1 jailbreak tool. Meanwhile, known hacker Luca Todesco has claimed that he has a jailbreak ready. pic.twitter.com/7AaG3ZyVkB &mdash; qwertyoruiop (@qwertyoruiopz) November 6, 2016 “Updated my stuff so it works on 10.1 too now,” Todesco wrote on a Twitter post. Updated my stuff so it works on 10.1 too now. &mdash; qwertyoruiop (@qwertyoruiopz) November 6, 2016 Numerous followers of the hacker want him to help out Pangu in releasing a mass jailbreak tool for the people. However, such a partnership seems unlikely. Todesco has earlier come up with jailbreak tools but never offered help to Pangu. However, the hacker’s Twitter posts do prove that an iOS 10 jailbreak is very much possible. Other groups have also claimed to have jailbroken the iOS 10 operating system though Todesco claims they are all fake claims. If at all there is any truth behind these claims, hacking groups need to release the iOS 10 jailbreak tool quickly as Apple could be working on a beta test of iOS 10.2 already. Only registered beta users will have access to this. Many however believe that it is impossible this time to jailbreak Apple’s new operating system and that finally the Cupertino-based tech giant has been able to stump hacking teams. Hackers have also claimed that they can’t promise an iOS 10 jailbreak tool as the tool is still unstable. In fact, there may not be any public release. As per The Bitbag, a team named Unlock-Jailbreak has claimed to have cracked open Apple’s iOS 10 though they have not posted any details on how to download it. Thus, jailbreak hunters can do nothing but wait for a foolproof tool.

TOUCH. A guest checks the Touch Bar on a MacBook computer shown in a demo room. (AP PHOTO) The new Touch Bar, which is both a narrow display and a control panel, replaces the old physical function keys on a traditional laptop. It will offer a variety of controls that change according to the app or website that’s open. It also has functions that will be familiar to many iPhone users — showing word suggestions as you type, for example, or letting you scroll through a library of emojis. New features, higher price The company unveiled the laptops at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, where executives showed how the Touch Bar works with a variety of apps and software — providing playback and editing controls for videos or music, for example, and search functions for Apple’s maps and photos apps. Apple is also opening the Touch Bar to work with outside software, including Adobe’s Photoshop editing program and Microsoft’s Word, PowerPoint and Skype. Along with faster processors and brighter screens, two of Apple’s new laptops will also get a fingerprint sensor, similar to the one on iPhones. The sensor can unlock the device, authorize software installations or recognize a different user and quickly switch to that person’s settings. It works with Apple Pay, so users can authorize an electronic payment for online purchases. At least for now, the new Touch Bar and Touch ID features will be available only on higher-end models — a 13-inch MacBook Pro that starts at about $1,800 and a 15-inch MacBook Pro at about $2,400. Both ship in a few weeks. Apple is also selling a 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar or Touch ID, but with other improvements, for about $1,500. DEMO. An experienced design manager at Adobe Photoshop gives a demonstration of using Touch Bar during an announcement of new Apple products. (AP PHOTO) Baby steps in TV Cook also used the event to promote a newer endeavor, Apple TV, and a new unified menu feature that shows recommendations and new episodes of recently watched shows, so viewers don’t have to search through different apps to find them. Apple’s app, though, is short of a full-fledged streaming-TV service, which reports say Apple has been pursuing. Rather, it brings together TV shows and movies viewers already get through individual subscriptions. The TV app, coming in December, will be synced with iPhones and iPads, so viewers can catch the next episode regardless of device. Apple said its Siri voice assistant will also direct viewers to live events, such as streaming sports. Apple said Apple TV already has 8,000 apps, including more than 2,000 games.

By Tony Park - 14 Nov '16 23:17PM (Photo : Stephen Lam/Getty Images) Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller introduces the all-new MacBook Pro during a product launch event on October 27, 2016 in Cupertino, California. Apple Inc. is expected to unveil the latest iterations of its MacBook line of laptops. The mid-level 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro offers a new experience for Mac aficionados - a Touch Bar with Touch ID- which gives users another way to interact with the laptop's programs and data. Some find the new function's usefulness obvious and immediate while others see it as overly complicated and unnecessary. Overall, the Touch Bar is a useful and versatile function. Advertisement Priced at $1,799, the Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is probably among the best ultraportable laptops available in the market right now, says PC Magazine, which describes the 13-inch MacBook Pro as thinner, lighter, and more powerful MacBook Pro. The magazine highlights the MacBook Pro's compact and sturdy chassis. The Touch Bar is an additional innovation to the well-designed and powerful 13-inch MacBook Pro. It replaces the useful function keys which include brightness up and down, volume up and down, and mute. A set of always-present buttons allows users to use those controls on the right hand side of the Touch Bar. According to The Verge, the MacBook Pro' Touch Bar can be customized by developers with their apps. There will future support for Photoshop, Office, Pixelmator, and DaVinci Resolve. The website finds the Touch Bar's simplest uses as often its best such as having a button in Photos that allows users to flip back and forth between edited and original picture. As for the MacBook Pro 13-inch's hardware, the laptop comes with an Intel i5-6267U processor with Intel Iris 550 graphics, four USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB solid-state drive. An option of up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of SSD space at purchase is also available at purchase. Advertisement The MacBook Pro 13-inch with Touch Bar is designed for interoperability with iOS, Apple TV, and watchOS. Battery life will last all day. The Touch Bar adds some genuine innovation, but adapters and all-new peripherals are required as with all new Apple laptops.

For the most part, the 13-inch MacBook Air is internally competing with the MacBook Pro without Touch Bar. Find out which laptop is better in this comparison review.More Apple dropped a bombshell last October when it announced three new MacBook Pros and not a single upgrade for its MacBook Air line. In addition, it decided to end the 11-inch MacBook Air series and to simply move forward with the unchanged 13-inch MacBook Air. What’s worse is that the 13-inch Air now internally competes with the MacBook Pro without Touch Bar for market attention. If you are wondering which Apple laptop is better between the two, this comparison review can help you decide. Performance On paper, the 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar easily trumps the 13-inch MacBook Air because the former comes with either a 2.0GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor or a 2.4GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost technology that can speed up the cores for up to 3.4GHz. On the other hand, the the 13-inch MacBook Air only comes with either a 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor or a 2.2GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor. When Turbo Boost kicks in, the Air’s cores can speed up to 3.2GHz. Both have 8GB of RAM, so the two devices are expected to do well in handling multiple tasks. When it comes to their tested performance, their Geekbench ratings also show the significant difference on the performance they can deliver. The Core i5 MacBook Air has a single-core score of 2624 and a multi-core score of 5210, while the Core i7 got 3019 and 6320, respectively. Contrariwise, the new MacBook Pro with Core i5 processor has a 3600 single-core score and a 6998 multi-core score. The Core i7 variant, meanwhile, scored 3817 and 7501 for the single-core and multi-core benchmarking tests. In spite of its impressive scores, however, 9To5Mac says those who are planning to buy the MacBook Pro sans Touch Bar should not expect for it to impeccably perform at high speeds for an extended amount of time because of its power-sipping 15W TDP. Display The Cupertino giant is clearly stepping up its display game with its new laptops. Apple lists on its official site the differences between the display technology present on the two laptops. The 13-inch MacBook Air continues to sport the relatively dated LED-backlit Widescreen display with 1440 x 900 screen resolution. It has 300 nits brightness and standard color gamut. On the contrary, the MacBook Pro comes with Retina display that has 2560 x 1600 screen resolution, 500 nits brightness and wide color gamut.  Notebook Check confirmed early November that the new MacBook Pro does have improved brightness. The computer review site even pointed out that the results of its tests showed that the new laptop has over 600 nits brightness at the center of the display panel, but the luminance slightly dropped toward the edges of the screen. Nevertheless, the distribution of brightness is considered remarkable at 89 percent. Notebook Check also claimed that the luminance of the new MacBook Pro’s display stands out among many other devices on the market, with the Dell XPS 13 9360 being the only one to beat the MacBook Pro in terms of contrast ratio.  According to 9To5Mac, the 2016 MacBook Pro is the first laptop from the Cupertino giant to feature wide color display, which it first introduced on the 5K iMac. This advanced display technology is said to give off more vibrant greens and reds, so images appear more real. This is very evident when the new MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air are placed side by side. Without a high-resolution display, the MacBook Air readily falls behind the new MacBook Pro.  Design Just like what previous rumors claimed before Apple’s Oct. 27 launch event, the new MacBooks are redesigned iterations of the Cupertino giant’s famous laptop series. The MacBook Pro without Touch Bar is no exception, since it sports a thinner body and a smaller form. Its chassis even looks like a combination of the 12-inch Retina MacBook and the previous version of the MacBook Pro. It does not have the tapered front like the Air series, so it’s thicker at the front. But at their thickest points, it’s easy to see that the new MacBook Air is the thinner device.  Although both laptops sport 13-inch screens, the MacBook Pro manages to afford a smaller form factor because of the thinner bezels surrounding its display. The commendable thing about the smaller frame of the device is it still managed to feature a full-size keyboard and loud speakers on either side. Speaking of keyboard, it is important to note that the new MacBook Pro comes with Apple’s improved butterfly switches, so the typing experience is improved and more satisfying than with the 12-inch MacBook that debuted with the original butterfly key switches. Each key in the new MacBook Pro also has its own LED, so backlight bleeds are very minimal. Read More The new MacBook Pro sports a larger Force Touch trackpad. Force Touch means the trackpad does not function through a mechanical button anymore. It simply has this force-sensitive technology to identify touch commands and it utilizes haptics and sound to produce clicks that may seem real to the user. Unfortunately, the MacBook Air still has a Multi-Touch trackpad, so clicking anywhere on the trackpad does not feel the same as when pressing the Force Touch trackpad. The main advantage of the latter — aside from saving component space underneath — is how clicks feel the same throughout the entire trackpad. This then allows users to register clicks on any part of the trackpad.  Special Features The new MacBook Pro comes with Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports. These ports are fast, reliable and quite versatile. They can be used for data transfer, charging, video output and other functions for different peripherals. Because the Thunderbolt 3 port is highly versatile, Apple designed its new MacBook Pro to come with only this type of port. Thus, users would need to buy dongles if they need to connect their laptop to monitors, or use external storage and flash memory cards. For consumers who still prefer the traditional ports, the MacBook Air features two USB 3 ports, two Thunderbolt 2 ports, a MagSafe 2 power port and an SDXC card slot.  To state the obvious, the MacBook Air has a glowing Apple logo — the one that was considered the trademark of previous-generation MacBook devices. Given that the new MacBook Pro is excessively thin, it wasn’t possible for Apple to include the glowing Apple logo on its back. Instead, the new MacBooks sport a color-matched inset logo. Since it lacks the trademark glowing logo, however, Apple decided to give the new MacBook Pro a new color variant. So instead of just seeing Silver MacBook Pros in Apple stores, there will be Space Gray units for those who want a premium Apple laptop with a different color. Miscellaneous  Storage space for the 13-inch MacBook Air starts at 128GB and can go up to 512GB SSD. As for the MacBook Pro without Touch Bar, its storage option starts at 256GB and can go as high as 1TB of SSD. At this point, it is important to note that the SSD module of the new MacBook Pro is removable, so users can still upgrade it after purchase. MacRumors pointed out in late October that with the smaller form factor of the new MacBook Pro, it seemed impossible for it to come with removable SSD just like the previous models.  The 13-inch MacBook Air is powered by a 54 watt-hour lithium-polymer battery that lasts up to 12 hours of iTunes movie playback on paper. The MacBook Pro, on the contrary, has an 54.5 watt-hour lithium polymer battery that is expected to last for up to 10 hours of iTunes movie playback. However, The Verge’s executive editor Walt Mossberg claims there really isn’t an accurate estimate to go by when it comes to the longevity of both laptops. In fact, when he tested the new MacBook Pro, it only managed to stay on for 8 hours and 22 minutes before totally running out of battery.  In terms of pricing, the 13-inch MacBook Air with 128GB SSD sells for $999, while the 256GB SSD variant is priced at $1,199. The new MacBook Pro without Touch Bar, on the other hand, comes with a $1,499 price tag — more affordable than the base model of the Touch Bar version that starts at $1,799. For Mashable, however, the price of the MacBook Pro sans Touch Bar is too much considering it does not feature the advanced OLED strip, has less processing power than the Touch Bar variant and it doesn’t have Touch ID as well.  Which do you think is the better Apple laptop between the 13-inch MacBook Air and the new MacBook Pro without Touch Bar?

With specs for both laptops closely similar to one another, which laptop is the better option?  ( Andrew Burton | Getty Images ) Advertisement There is no denying Microsoft and Apple have been rivals for at least the past three decades. This year is no exception: both companies revealed their new flagship laptops just a few hours apart, with the hope of tempting customers away from the other. Microsoft unveiled the Surface Book i7, a revamped version from last year's flexible laptop with a funny hinge, on Oct. 26. Representing Apple, on the other hand, is the latest MacBook Pro variant complete with a new Touch Bar display right above the keyboard. But which is the better option? Design Microsoft has not changed the physical appearance of the Surface Book i7 model. It still has the matte gray color and dynamic hinge, a spring-like system that folds into itself, leaving a noticeable gap between screen and keyboard when closing the laptop, in which the tech giant takes pride. More importantly, users can completely detach the screen from the keyboard, leaving a 13.5-inch tablet to use, something that the MacBook Pro 2016 does not offer. Meanwhile, Apple slimmed and lightened the MacBook Pro 2016 and added a new Touch Bar feature above the keyboard that changes the controls it shows according to the application currently in use. For example, bookmarks and favorites appear when opening the Safari browser, while editing tools show up when viewing photos. It can also display emoji suggestions or predicted words when typing out sentences. In terms of size, the MacBook Pro is available in 13-inch or 15-inch variants whereas the Surface Book i7 only has the 13.3-inch model. As for the resolution, the former can render up to 2,880 x 1,800 pixels while the latter has 3,000 x 2,000 pixels. Specs and Battery Life Both laptops use Intel's latest 6th generation i7 and i5 chipsets. Both devices use SSD drives and dedicated graphics cards for gaming and video rendering: NVIDIA GTX 965M for Microsoft and Radeon Pro 455 for Apple. In fact, both devices are so alike that it is difficult to exactly pinpoint which performs better straight out. One thing the Surface Book i7 has an advantage over the MacBook Pro is battery life: the former reportedly lasts up to 16 hours while the latter only promises 10 hours of laptop usage. Price To put it mildly, pricing for both laptops is quite expensive. The entry level Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch with Touch Bar display costs $1,799 while the 15-inch variant costs $2,399. A 13-inch MacBook Pro sans the feature retails for $1,499. Microsoft's Surface Book i7 starts at $1,899 for the 8 GB RAM and 256 GB storage option, while the higher 16 GB RAM and 1 TB variant retails for a whopping $2,999 thanks to a $200 discount. Conclusion Microsoft clearly edges out Apple in terms of pricing. As regards specs too, it would appear that the Surface Book i7 is slightly better with its superior battery life and screen resolution than the MacBook Pro 2016. Of course, there are other things to consider such as software, operating system, and compatibility with other devices. Apple's MacBook Pro would work better with an iPhone or iPad. For those who want more customizability and compatibility options, Microsoft's Surface Book i7 could be a better choice.

By John Gruber Archive The Talk Show Projects Contact Colophon RSS Feed Twitter Sponsorship The New Touch-Bar-Equipped MacBook Pros and the State of the Mac Monday, 14 November 2016 I think there’s been a lot of confusion over the nomenclatural transition Apple is going through in its MacBook lineup. Back in 1998, Steve Jobs presented a simple four-quadrant lineup for Apple’s entire Mac line: a consumer notebook (iBook), pro notebook (PowerBook), consumer desktop (iMac), and pro desktop (Power Mac). No one could be confused by the difference between an iBook and a PowerBook. The PowerBook was more expensive, faster, had a better display, and even used more “serious” design language — iBooks were candy-colored and the PowerBooks were matte black. Much has changed since then, including all those product names (except for the iMac). About midway between then and now, Apple introduced what I believe to be the best-selling Mac notebook in history: the MacBook Air. At the time the Air was introduced in 2008, Apple’s other notebooks were the “regular” MacBook and the MacBook Pro. Sound familiar? The MacBook and MacBook Pro played the exact same roles as the iBook and the PowerBook. One was significantly less expensive, and accordingly, not as nice. Plastic vs. aluminum, slower vs. faster. I used a white iBook for several years. My wife used a white MacBook for several years about a decade ago. These were good notebooks and I remember them both fondly. But the only reason we bought those machines was that we couldn’t or didn’t want to spend the money for a PowerBook or MacBook Pro. The PowerBook “pro” alternative to my old white iBook was one of the most ahead-of-its-time designs Apple has ever made: the 12-inch PowerBook G4. Just look at it. It’s thick and heavy by today’s standards, but it foretold much of Apple’s aluminum-era design language. I wanted one badly, but couldn’t justify the price difference compared to the iBook, especially for what was going to be a secondary machine. One notebook that was slower but cheaper. One notebook that was faster and more expensive. The MacBook Air didn’t fit into this matrix at all. It was slower than the regular MacBook but as expensive as a MacBook Pro. What you were paying for wasn’t “power” but instead right there in the (then utterly perfect, today somewhat confusing) name “Air”: remarkable thinness and lightness. Apple moved from the names PowerBook and Power Mac to MacBook Pro and Mac Pro when they shifted from PowerPC to Intel processors. At the time, I chalked this up entirely to wanting to distinguish the Intel-based machines from the “Power” in “PowerPC”. In hindsight, though, I think it also signified a subtle shift in Apple’s design priorities for its very best computers. For decades, computers were starved for raw performance. CPUs were slow, RAM was scarce, disks were slow (and unreliable), graphics were slow. Printing was slow. Networking was slow. Everything was slow. And the more money you spent, the more you could alleviate these problems with faster components, and more ports and peripherals. Just about everyone agreed the original MacBook Air was beautiful to behold and that something so light and thin would be nicer to carry around than something thicker and heavier. But many critics thought Apple had lost its goddamn collective mind by breaking the rule that you spend more money on “faster”. From EveryMac’s page describing the differences between the original MacBook Air and the then-current regular MacBook: Upon viewing the respective specifications pages for the original MacBook Air and a “regular” MacBook at the time the original MacBook Air was introduced — the MacBook “Core 2 Duo” 2.4 13” (Black- Early 2008), for example — two users might come to very different conclusions. A style-conscious user might view the MacBook Air as sleek and beautiful and the “regular” MacBook as comparatively clunky. A cynical user might instead view the MacBook Air as half the system for twice the price. Both of these viewpoints could be legitimate. Most would agree that the MacBook does look rather “clunky” compared to the MacBook Air. Likewise, there is no denying that the MacBook Air does have substantial limitations compared to the “regular” MacBook in performance (it’s slower and uses the same lackluster integrated graphics), connectivity (it only has one USB 2.0 port and no onboard Ethernet, compared to the “regular” MacBook with two USB 2.0 ports, a Firewire “400” port, Gigabit Ethernet, and optical digital audio in/out), and expansion (no swappable battery or upgradable RAM and it is a pain to upgrade the hard drive, compared to the “regular” MacBook which has a swappable battery, upgradable RAM, and it is relatively simple to upgrade the hard drive). The “regular” MacBook also has a convenient internal optical drive whereas the MacBook Air requires the usage of an external one or software workarounds. Costs more. Not faster. Fewer ports. Fewer user-replaceable components. Sound familiar? MacBook Air buyers were paying a premium not for performance (or to use the old word, power) but instead for niceness. Apple effectively bifurcated the premium side of the MacBook lineup: Air for niceness, Pro for performance. But then a funny thing happened. MacBook Airs got steadily faster and cheaper. Moore’s Law at work. The regular MacBooks went away, and eventually the 11-inch MacBook Air dropped to $899, and the more popular 13-inch Air to $999. The MacBook Air transitioned — not in one fell swoop, but slowly and steadily, year after year — from being a premium product to being Apple’s most decidedly consumer-oriented Mac. The go-to Mac for students, casual users, and the budget-conscious. Last year Apple reintroduced the no-adjective MacBook brand for a device that was thinner, lighter, had a better display, one single expansion port that doubles for charging — and came at a premium price. Oh, and it’s quite arguably slower not just than the old MacBook Airs that are still sitting there in Apple’s lineup, but also slower than an iPhone. The regular MacBook’s value proposition today is exactly what the Air’s was in 2008. The MacBook Air’s value proposition today is exactly what the MacBook’s was in 2008. They’ve flipped. But the Air is the device whose name implies “thin and light”. Here’s what I wrote back in May: The outrage is coming from people who want Apple to update the MacBook Airs with retina displays. That’s not going to happen. The Airs are now Apple’s low-priced models. The Pros will get thinner (and thus more Air-like) and the new MacBook will get faster (and thus more Air-like). But the MacBook Air as we know it serves only one purpose: to hit the $899/999 price points. Back in March 2015, after the debut of the current one-port MacBook, I wrote: The key to understanding the new MacBook is that it didn’t replace any existing models in Apple’s lineup. In fact, the 11- and 13-inch Airs and the 13-inch MacBook Pro all got speed bump updates last week. If you need more ports or better performance, or if you frequently need to work while your MacBook is plugged into a power outlet, this machine is not for you, today. That’s why it didn’t (yet) replace anything in the lineup. The original 2008 MacBook Air was slow, expensive (based on specs), lacked storage, only had one USB port, was the first Apple notebook without an optical drive, etc. It was not for everyone. It was not for most people, in fact. But some people loved it. The new 2015 MacBook is the same thing — some people will love it today, and it shows us Apple’s vision for the future of the notebook form factor. So forget about the word Air. Apple’s vision for computers — notebooks, phones, tablets, even desktops — is thinner and lighter. Everything Apple makes today is an Air model in spirit. The name “Air” is no longer meaningful. My Thoughts on the New MacBook Pros I’ve spent almost three weeks testing a few models of the new MacBook Pros: the 13-inch model that lacks the Touch Bar, a mid-range (Core i5) 13-inch with the Touch Bar, and a 15-inch model with the Touch Bar. By way of comparison, my personal MacBook is a top-of-the-line 13-inch MacBook Pro that I bought just about exactly two years ago. As I’ve used these new models, the thought I keep turning back to is this: What Apple means by “pro” is tied very much to being nicer. A rundown of details and observations: The build quality is decidedly nicer. This is particularly noticeable with the display hinge. It feels better when you open it, it moves smoother as you adjust it to your preferred angle, and it closes with a more satisfying snap. iFixit’s teardown contains some interesting observations about how Apple achieved these improvements. Space gray looks amazing. I wish it were even a little darker, but it’s very cool. In very bright light, it doesn’t look that different from the traditional silver finish. In darker lighting, though, the difference is very noticeable. The trackpad is excellent. I enjoy that it’s bigger, and Apple’s palm detection has worked perfectly. Not once has it gotten in the way. The reduction in bezel area surrounding the display is noticeable. The combination of device thinness, bezel reduction, and the space gray finish all serve to make my previous MacBook Pro look old. The keyboard is, for me, a mixed bag, and it’s probably the one thing that many people will like least about these machines. I find less key travel to be less pleasant while typing. But I’m so far out there on this issue that I use a 20-year-old Apple Extended Keyboard II, with mechanical key switches, at my desk. I’ve never liked any notebook keyboard compared to an actual mechanical keyboard. But every time Apple makes its keyboards thinner, I get used to it. I always do, and I’m already pretty used to these new ones. And here’s the mixed bag part: the new MacBook Pro key switches do have a premium feel to them. I now can’t stop noticing how much the key caps on my old MacBook Pro jiggle around when I’m just resting my fingers on the keys. The new keys don’t do that. It feels like a premium keyboard — just one with incredibly short key travel, alas. [Update: Is the new MacBook keyboard too loud?] The keyboard change I’m having the most trouble with is the arrow key arrangement. Starting with the 2015 new MacBook, Apple has made the left and right arrow keys full-height; previously all four arrow keys were half-height, in an upside-down T arrangement. I’m having a devil of a time getting used to this. I use those keys frequently and do so without looking at them, and my fingers just can’t find what they’re feeling for. I’ll get used to it, I suspect, but this is one of the few things I’d change if I could. I like the Touch Bar a lot, especially Touch ID. It also feels like the right way to do a keyboard for the emoji age.1 I’m still not entirely used to it, and I’m unsure how best to use it to suit my needs. What I’m sure of is that the wrong way to think about the Touch Bar is to expect it be to be a game-changing input method. It’s just a modern, dynamic replacement for a fiddly, static set of cryptic buttons. And it’s really nicely done. It looks less like a screen and more like a button bar with dynamically changing labels. It took about three days using Touch ID on this review unit before I instinctively tried to use it to unlock my old MacBook. Typing my login password now feels archaic. The Esc is the one button in the classic function key row that some people really use a lot. I’ve heard from them. “How’s the Esc key?” is the number one question I’ve gotten from readers about the Touch Bar. For some reason, the Esc key doesn’t sit flush with the left edge of the Touch Bar. It’s inset by about the width of a key. (My best guess is that it is inset for visual symmetry with the Touch ID sensor on the other side, but it’s possible there were engineering constraints.) But about half of the blank area at the left edge is touch sensitive, even though there is no display under that part of the bar. I made a brief video about this that shows it better than I can explain it. The bottom line is that it’s pretty easy to hit Esc accurately without looking — the team that made the Touch Bar was clearly aware that some people really do use the Esc key a lot. My main wish for the next-generation Touch Bar: Taptic Engine support. Fake clicks like those on the Magic Trackpad, or even like the iPhone 7’s 3D Touch haptics, would be great. This might be trickier for Apple to pull off than I’m imagining, though. The trackpad has better haptics and works with much less pressure from your fingers, but the trackpad doesn’t have a display. The iPhone has a display, but 3D Touch on the iPhone takes more pressure to activate than I think a keyboard button should. This might take a few years. I miss MagSafe. I think what it gets down to is that Apple sees the future as being battery only while using it. Charge it like your phone — overnight — and then just go all day. And I also see the beauty in having just four USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports that all work the same way. But boy, MagSafe sure was a great idea, and it will be missed. (Even leaving aside the “trip over the cable accidentally scenario”, MagSafe is great on a daily basis just because it’s so effortless to connect. It feels like a cable that connects itself.) Speaking of battery life, it has been amazing. I watched Game 7 of the World Series with the 13-inch Touch Bar-equipped model open on my lap, for following Twitter and messaging a few friends about the game. It was a long game, over four hours, and I had the brightness on the display set as high as I wanted. (Maximum brightness would have been way too bright.) When the game ended the MacBook Pro still had 70 percent of its battery remaining. That’s probably the definition of “light use”, but my two-year-old MacBook Pro never got that much battery life under similar conditions. It is almost criminal that the extended power cord is now a $19 peripheral, and not included in the box. These machines cost upwards of $4,000 and they’re going to nickel-and-dime you over a power cord? Nickel-and-dime move number two: Not including a USB-C to Lightning cable with the iPhone 7. You can walk into an Apple Store today and drop thousands of dollars on a new MacBook and iPhone, but you can’t connect the two without a $19 cable (which will cost $25 again come January). I don’t know if this is a nickel-and-dime move or just a design decision, but the wall charger no longer has flip-out arms for wrapping the cable. That was a great little thoughtful detail, and I miss it. As promised, sound is way better from the built-in speakers. There’s almost no comparison. Where the Mac Stands Within Apple To me, an iPad in notebook mode — connected to a keyboard cover — is so much less nice than a real notebook. And the difference is more stark when compared to a great notebook, like these MacBook Pros. There are advantages to the tablet form factor, but no tablet will ever be as nice as a notebook as these MacBook Pros. I also prefer MacOS over iOS for, well, “doing work”. I think I’m more productive on a Mac than I am on an iPad. I can’t prove it, but even if I’m wrong, the fact that I feel like it’s true matters. I always feel slightly hamstrung working on an iPad. I never do on a Mac (at least once I’ve got it configured with all the apps and little shortcuts, scripts, and utilities I use). There are a lot of Mac users who feel the same way I do, and these new MacBook Pros have debuted at a time when many of these users look at Apple’s laggardly update pace for new Mac hardware (including the 1,000-plus day-old Mac Pros) and have come to the conclusion that Apple is sunsetting the Mac. They think Tim Cook really does want them to switch to an iPad. I think these new MacBook Pros, and the Touch Bar in particular, stand as refutation to that. These are very nice machines, designed and made with great care. And the Touch Bar is clearly no afterthought. A lot of teams from across the company worked for a long time on this. It’s an embedded iOS device, with the accompanying characteristics you’d expect: 60 FPS animation, seemingly instantaneous touch latency, well-done animation as things like the Control Strip expand and retract, and more. The Touch Bar is also, clearly, a costly component, making the Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pros more expensive. Price aside, the new MacBook Pro with the old-school function keys shouldn’t exist. But the Touch Bar won’t be expensive forever. It’s just so clear to me that these machines share the design ethos of the original MacBook Air. They’re designed for the future — the near future, I think — but until then, we’ll buy compatibility dongles and wait another year to see versions that support more than 16 GB of RAM. There’s much griping about these machines now, just like there was much griping about the original Air then, but these are exactly the MacBooks I want Apple to be making — ones that show that the company is putting very hard work into every aspect of them. I’d be more worried about Apple’s commitment to the Mac if they did the easy thing — easier both technically and in terms of initial critical response — and just stuck a retina display in a MacBook Air and called it a day. I do wish my most-used emoji characters synced across my various devices through iCloud, the way my keyboard text substitutions do. It seems weird that every device I use has a different set of most-used emoji. ↩︎ Previous: On Hiding vs. Encapsulating Complexity, in the Context of Twitter’s Experimental Reply Interface Display Preferences Copyright © 2002–2016 The Daring Fireball Company LLC.

Different continuation patents for Apple’s future head mounted display device cover a different set of specifics that Apple wants protected,” Purcher reports. “The original patent was first published in 2010, yet filed in 2008, is the master invention that goes deeper into the details of the invention including device’s face plate, its camera possibilities, exterior controls, its use of haptics and more. Apple’s invention was granted a patent back in February 2015.” Purcher reports, “Then in March 2016 Apple began to tweak the patent claims of this future device and today Apple is seen once again further tweaking their patent claims as detailed below providing us with a glimpse of what’s on their engineer team’s mind as well as their legal team.” Read more in the full article here.

Comment Feed One Comment Xennex1170 Thursday, November 10, 2016 - 5:55 pm · Reply Two highlighted items in the source article sound very close to some things Google has already done in placing a button on the device to control the inserted smartphone (e.g. Google Cardboard) and the touch area on the support structure (e.g. Google Glass). Though for the latter they seem to specify a wheel control so if they stay within that it seems to be covered. The design described in the patent seems interesting but I wonder how well they’ll be able to spread the weight that seems to be placed primarily on the bridge of the nose when used with the inserted smartphone. This is in contrast to current offerings by Google, Sony, Occulus, etc. that seem to distribute the weight to the entire area under the eyes including the nose. Perhaps indication that iPhones will get lighter still? Add Your Feedback Name (required) Email (required) Web cancel reply Notify me of new comments via email. Notify me of new posts via email.

Even though it’s still too early to predict what the 2017 iPhone will be like, many can’t help but speculate the new changes Apple has in store for their iPhone 8 smartphone. One of the biggest rumors is that the iPhone 8 will be equipped with a major redesign; something that was promised when Apple released this year’s model. According to the rumors, Apple is currently working on a bezel-less design and a larger screen size for its coming devices. This leads to some speculation that Apple will be releasing a 5-inch screen for the iPhone 8 and a 5.8-inch screen for the iPhone 8 Plus models. And although Android smartphone manufacturers have been trying hard to come up with less bezel displays, no one has successfully unveiled a real ‘bezel-less’ device. This might change once Apple unveils the iPhone 8 model. These reports come from Barclays Research analysts, who claim that the iPhone 8 design is not ‘100 percent locked down.’ Apart from Barclays, other analysts have noted that Apple’s next device could have a major chassis change. After all, Apple retained the iPhone 6 design on the iPhone 7 model even if it was introduced in 2014. Supporting this claim, KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has mentioned that the next iPhone could have an all-glass design along with an AMOLED screen.  There have been plenty of other sources that believe the iPhone 8 will have a 0.3-inch increase on its screen. Apart from a bezel-less display, Apple is expected to start its mass production for the AirPods by December. According to reports, Apple will be producing 10 million units of the truly-wireless earbuds initially. There is no word on whether Apple intends to launch the AirPods in December but a supply chain report said that these will make a debut in January 2017. Originally, Apple planned to launch the earbuds in late October. Due to hardware and software bugs, however, the company had to delay the release. If Apple pushes through with its major redesign for the iPhone 8, analysts expect that next year will have a significant impact on Apple’s growth as a company. Let’s just wait and see if the iPhone 8 will truly have a bezel-less design.

Apple Watch bands are divided into two collections, Utility and Artisan. Utility bands, priced at $49, come in Light Blue Stripe, Black, and Olive for 42mm Apple Watch models, and Dusty Pink, Light Blue Stripe, and Clay for 38mm Apple Watch models. Artisan bands, priced at $75, feature a full leather backing on the band and are more expensive than Utility bands. Artisan bands come in Black Diamond (38mm and 42mm), Royal Blue Diamond (38mm), and Red Diamond (42mm). All of TOMS Apple Watch bands feature stainless steel lugs and buckles, which match the stainless steel Apple Watch models. GIVE TIME is etched on each buckle with gold TOMS embossing on the band itself. Each TOMS Apple Watch band purchase provides one year of solar light to families who lack access to reliable electricity.

Lame Rating: 9 Votes stiligFox 14 hours ago at 07:56 pm All these people complaining about Watch bands, but it's nice to actually see more name brand third party bands coming along even a couple years after the initial release. Isn't that one of the biggest things about watches? That they are customizable and can be tailored to the users tastes? Now all we need is a watch face App Store so devs can design custom style watch faces a la Pebble. Rating: 4 Votes wemclaughlins 14 hours ago at 07:47 pm Are these made out of recycled fish nets and unicorn fur, like their ridiculously goofy shoes? And +1 on the watch band comments. If I ever DID bring myself to buy an Apple watch (likelihood=not) it would be a basic sport band and bands would never even be an afterthought. Why Apple thinks so highly of the watch band concept is beyond me. Rating: 4 Votes krause734 14 hours ago at 07:39 pm It's about time!

These are some very nice watch straps for their prices (coming from a name brand and one that donates to charity as well). NATO and Zulu style watch straps are quite popular, and these do well to bring the typically cheap nylon construction of common NATO bands up to par with more quality offerings. The only thing I can find objectionable about these is the obnoxious "Artisan" branding of the full backed models, which is just a bit too self-congratulatory for my liking.

This is something being sold to people with money to burn......fleece them for more and give more to charity.

By: Bloomberg | Published:November 15, 2016 9:42 am Apple CEO Tim Cook is under pressure to deliver new products amid slowing sales of the iPhone, which accounts for two-thirds of Apple’s revenue. Apple Inc. is weighing an expansion into digital glasses, a risky but potentially lucrative area of wearable computing, according to people familiar with the matter. While still in an exploration phase, the device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and may use augmented reality, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a secret project. Apple has talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers, according to people familiar with those discussions. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing, the people said. Apple hasn’t ordered enough components so far to indicate imminent mass-production, one of the people added. Should Apple ultimately decide to proceed with the device, it would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, another person said. The Cupertino, California-based company tests many different products and is known to pivot, pause, or cancel projects without disclosing them. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is under pressure to deliver new products amid slowing sales of the iPhone, which accounts for two-thirds of Apple’s revenue. In July, he expressed enthusiasm for augmented reality after the rise of Pokemon Go, a location-based game that uses the technology. AR, as it’s known, adds images and other digital information to people’s view of the real world, while virtual reality completely surrounds them with a computer-generated environment. The glasses may be Apple’s first hardware product targeted directly at AR, one of the people said. Cook has beefed up AR capabilities through acquisitions. In 2013, Apple bought PrimeSense, which developed motion-sensing technology in Microsoft Corp.’s Kinect gaming system. Purchases of software startups in the field, Metaio Inc. and Flyby Media Inc., followed in 2015 and 2016. “AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this,” Cook said in a July 26 conference call with analysts. “We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.” Apple has AR patents for things like street view in mapping apps. It was also awarded patents for smart glasses that make use of full-fledged virtual reality. Apple is unlikely to leverage VR in a mass-consumer product, Cook suggested in October. “I can’t imagine everyone in here getting in an enclosed VR experience while you’re sitting in here with me, but I could imagine everyone in here in an AR experience right now,” he said during an onstage discussion in Utah. Apple’s challenge is fitting all the technology needed into a useful pair of internet-connected glasses that are small and sleek enough for regular people to wear. Google’s attempt to develop internet-connected eye wear flopped in part because its tiny battery ran out quickly. Google Glass, as it was called, also suffered a privacy backlash and poor public perception of its external design. After that disappointment, technology companies largely turned their immediate focus to VR and away from AR. Google recently introduced a VR headset alongside its Pixel smartphone, and Facebook Inc.’s Oculus VR unit has teamed up with Samsung Electronics Co. on a similar headset. Microsoft has the most public AR offering. Its HoloLens product shows holographic images in a user’s field of vision. Apple’s effort may be more difficult because the chips, batteries and other components that will be available in a year or two may still not be small enough and powerful enough to build slim glasses capable of handling compelling AR experiences. However, given time, technical challenges may play to Apple’s strengths. The company specializes in turning technology that others have struggled with into easy-to-use devices for the masses. For example, Apple simplified fingerprint technology into an unlocking mechanism for the iPhone and took touch screens mainstream with the original iPhone.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « MacBook Pro Reviews fly in while Apostle Schiller continues to Warns us of the Evils of a Touch Display on Macs | Main | Apple Granted a Patent for a Sports Version of Apple EarPods » November 14, 2016 Apple Reportedly working on Digital Glasses Supporting Telephony and Augmented Reality   Last Thursday Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Refines their Head-Mounted Display Device for a Second Time this Year." The report covered Apple updating their patent to include possible touch sensor on the headset to control various functions be it volume or perhaps answering an incoming phone call and beyond. Tonight Bloomberg is reporting that Apple's experimental prototype "would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer's field of vision, and may use augmented reality." Apple getting serious about a future headset was covered in our January report titled "Apple's 'Secret' VR Team isn't that Secret Anymore," that touched on the Financial Times that broke that story.   Bloomberg's speculative report hints that the project is still well in the distance and could make it's way to market in a few years. Apple has ordered some materials to support prototypes but it hasn't progressed far beyond that at this point in time.   Bloomberg further noted that "Apple's challenge is fitting all the technology needed into a useful pair of internet-connected glasses that are small and sleek enough for regular people to wear. Google's attempt to develop internet-connected eye wear flopped in part because its tiny battery ran out quickly. Google Glass, as it was called, also suffered a privacy backlash and poor public perception of its external design."   The Bloomberg report is so vague that it's not really of much value at this point in time as it brings little to nothing to the table. Though if Apple is hoping for this headset or glasses to be of value, they're likely going to wait for 5G networks to arrive and that should be around 2020.   Realtime Augmented Reality is going to require networks that are much faster than they are today and that will give Apple the time needed to have a revolutionary device ready for that timeline.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The high-tech glasses that work with both Android and iOS devices records 10-second video clips that can be uploaded into Snapchat story. Since the $130 device is making waves and getting attention from the techie community, could Apple be also planning to release its own version of the Spectacles? On Monday, unnamed sources told Bloomberg that Apple is planning to expand into digital glasses for its next endeavor in the wearable market. The Cupertino giant’s glasses project is said to be in the exploration phase for now, but the company could already have the fixed goal of producing glasses that would show images and other real-time data in the wearer’s field of vision. The glasses are also expected to connect wirelessly to Apple’s iPhones and work using augmented reality.  Given that the product is not going to focus on recording short video clips, the device couldn’t technically be considered as Apple’s direct competitor to Snapchat’s Spectacles. Instead, this could be Apple’s attempt at capturing the market that showed interest in Google’s dormant Google Glass wearables. Should this project progress, the tech community could expect Apple’s digital glasses to arrive possibly in 2018.  Related Stories Snapchat Spectacles Release Date: Buy Them From Snapbot Mobile Vending Machines Facebook Flash Unveiled For Developing Countries: Report New Snapchat Update For iOS Adds Support For Spectacle Glasses But When Will They Release? Per the leaksters who shared the information about Apple’s next wearable, a clear sign that Apple is serious about the project is how CEO Tim Cook has been acquiring projects and teams of developers to beef up the company’s AR technologies. Also, Cook, himself, has been quite vocal about his interest in AR, as per AppleInsider.  The Google Glass was introduced as an advanced head-mounted display that utilized augmented reality to display weather information directly in the user’s field of vision. It also allowed users to make calls and take photos. Unfortunately, privacy concerns caused a huge blow to the project, such that it was eventually stopped in January 2015. However, on the project’s official website, it is stated there that the journey of Google Glass has not ended yet. Google also stated that consumers will see the future versions of the smart glasses when they are ready.  Since the Google Glass is not an active product for the time being, this could be the perfect timing for Apple to introduce its own smart glasses, which are now believed to be part of the augmented reality projects of the tech giant. Another project that is making headlines recently pertains to the rumored full VR headset that the company could be launching in the near future.

Kantipur The Kathmandu Post saptahik Nepal Nari Radio Kantipur Kantipur TV 0Shares Share on facebookShare on twitter Entertainment Mi Mix: A vision into the future of smartphones Mi Max is not a perfect phone, but does bring a lot of innovation that could drive smartphone design in the days to come - Prajesh SJB Rana The Mi Mix’s true allure lies in the display of the phone. The device features a 6.4 inch IPS LCD display at a resolution on 1080 x 2040 pixels in a form-factor as big as the iPhone 7 Plus which features a smaller 5.5-inch display Nov 15, 2016- In 2016, we’ve seen a lot of innovative products that have pushed the boundaries of the tech industry. We’ve seen VR technology turn into a reality and we’ve even seen high-quality camera drones that have made aerial shots commonplace in low-budget music videos and films. We’ve also seen Microsoft’s innovative Surface Pro that redesigns how professional content creators work with a computer. While, unfortunately, Google modular phone design concept, Project Ara, was cancelled earlier this year; we got to see their Pixel line of phones which hints at a truly Google phone. Apple, however, disappointed most of their customer base with mediocre improvements to the iPhone line and the MacBook line. In the growing area of consumer technology, Apple seems to be slowly losing their innovative edge. Apple played it safe with both the iPhone 7 and 2016 MacBook Pro releases and while Apple had hinted at a bezel-less iPhone 8, where the company’s true innovation would start. Unfortunately, however, for the Cupertino company, their hopes of awing their consumer-base with a truly innovative device has been cut-short by the Chinese company Xiaomi. The recently released Xiaomi Mi Mix is a technological marvel to behold because of the device’s bezel-less edge-to-edge display. But no matter how innovative Xiaomi’s bezel-less device is, they weren’t the first company to dabble in a phone with a bezel-less display. The first phone to feature a bezel-less display would be the Sharp Aquos Crystal, a phone Sharp released in 2014. While the Aquos Crystal did feature a beautiful bezel-less screen that awed consumers, the phone suffered because of sub-par hardware and a notoriously thick chin at the bottom that worked against the overall aesthetic of the device. The phone also had horrible call-quality issues because of the technology used by Sharp. Sharp used a technology called Direct Wave Condenser, which vibrated the whole screen to produce sound waves that entered the user’s ear. This, which looked great in theory, did not work well in practical use since a lot of the Aquos Crystal users complained of horrible call-quality. The second version of the Aquos Crystal, released in 2015, suffered from similar issues which hindered the overall adoption-rate of the phone. As a result, the Sharp Aquos Crystal phones did not do well commercially and seemed more like a concept phone rather than a phone ready for consumer use. While the Mi Mix is also a concept phone at this point, the true innovation of the Chinese company comes forward in the different ways that Xiaomi has managed to overcome all of Sharp’s initial shortcomings. The Mi Mix has exceptional hardware since it comes equipped with top-of-the line Snapdragon 821 SOC, four or six GB of RAM depending on the model. The device is also equipped with a massive 4400 mAh battery that ensures exceptional battery life. The phone performs exceptionally well on benchmark tests where the Mi Mix beat both the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and Google Pixel. While the Mi Mix performs better than the Sharp Aquos Crystal phones, the phone also implements better technology to ensure better call-quality. While Sharp’s Direct Wave Condenser failed in delivering good call-quality, Xiaomi’s Peizoelectric Ceramic Actuator works exceptionally well. While the technology works by converting electric energy to mechanical energy, slightly similar to the technology used by Sharp, call-quality on the Mi Mix feels natural and easy on the ears. While these specifications and technology might be impressive, the Mi Mix’s true allure lies in the display of the phone. The device features a 6.4 inch IPS LCD display at a resolution on 1080 x 2040 pixels in a form-factor as big as the iPhone 7 Plus which features a smaller 5.5-inch display. The device is a tad bit on the heavier side, weighing at 209g, and is even a bit thicker at 7.9 mm. While I could argue that for such a premium device, Xiaomi should have opted for a QHD display, the display on the Mi Mix actually performs really well. The screen itself is sharp, the colours vibrant and the great brightness at 783 Lux. Watching videos or playing games on the bezel-less 6.4-inch screen is a pleasure. When taking a photo, the way the screen blends in with the real-world is astonishing. But as much as I’ve been advocating the device’s bezel-less screen, it’s not completely bezel-less since there is a visible bezel next to the display but this is so minimal that it can easily be ignored. But taking into account how well the screen looks and performs, the Mi Mix’s screen can be touted as a natural evolution to the Sharp Aquos Crystal displays. But, to utilise a bezel-less display, a lot of compromises have to be made. Since the top chin of any phone contains essential parts such as light-sensors, proximity-sensors and the front-facing camera, having a bezel-less display without the top chin would expose the company to some extremely specific problems. Sharp handled these issues by moving all of the top-chin components to the bottom-chin which is the reason why the Sharp phones featured such a large chin, but the Mi Mix’s bottom chin is thin too. For Xiaomi to reduce the size of the bottom chin, they had to get rid of some essential features like the earpiece and the proximity sensor. Instead of the proximity sensor, the Mi Mix comes with an ultrasound technology that determines proximity with the use of algorithms and software. Without these two components to hog space on the chin of the phone, Xiaomi has managed to considerably reduce the size of the bottom chin; but the smaller front-facing camera and the ambient light sensors have been moved to the bottom. The front-facing selfie camera suffers because of this. Every time you’re taking a selfie, the camera is bound to be obstructed by your finger. Palm rejection technology also needs to be on point on a bezel-less display because while grabbing the phone, your palms are bound to rest on the screen. The Mi Mix is also made out of ceramic which adds to the premium look and feel of the phone. The device is also the first phone to use Zirconia ceramic and the glass feel of the ceramic body makes touch input of both the body and the screen feel seamless. But the main concern here would be durability. By the looks of it, the Mi Mix is not very durable. Accounting how the screen does not have a bezel to protect the screen during an accidental fall or even how ceramic, even though it’s a durable material, is weak on the corners which would be fatal should the phone fall on one of its corners. But the phone looks good enough to turn heads when you use it in front of other people. The Mi Mix also comes in an 18k model, which features the eight GB RAM module that comes equipped with real 18 karat gold rings around the fingerprint reader and the rear camera modules. The use of ceramic also makes the phone slippery and more prone to drops but thankfully, Xiaomi includes a decent leather case for the phone in the box. The Mi Mix is currently marketed as a concept product which is why it has been produced in limited qualities and is available only in China. But even though Xiaomi has labelled the Mi Mix as a concept, it does bring new technology to the field of smartphones. While earlier Xiaomi had been criticised as blatantly copying Apple’s design aesthetics, the Mi Mix is a phone concept that looks original and innovative. There are a lot of flaws on the Mi Mix phones, like how poorly the camera performs on the device or even how the design aesthetics leaves the phone more vulnerable to accidental drops. The Mi Max is not a perfect phone as of right now, but does bring a lot of innovation that could drive smartphone design in the days to come, especially since smartphone designs have been stagnating for a long time. The Mi Mix brings a lot to the table and compromises very little, an effort for which Xiaomi should be lauded. All in all, Xiaomi has managed to create a truly beautiful phone and even though the Mi Mix is not being mass marketed, it is one of the most innovative products to come out this year.

Reuters/Jason Reed The iPhone 7 Plus is Apple’s highest-end offering in the current market. While the device looks largely like its predecessor, the iPhone 6S Plus, the Cupertino-based company did make meaningful changes as well. READ: Apple iPhone 8 release date, news & update: Both iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus to become larger and have no bezel Apple’s dual lens camera debuted in the iPhone 7 Plus, and the technology definitely shows. The photo-quality is notably better than any of its predecessors especially when taking low-light images. The new camera system also allows users to zoom in to images twice as much, which is more significant in terms of quality rather than actual distance. The iPhone 7 Plus also improves from its predecessors in terms of battery life. In addition, the new A10 processor from Apple and the 3GB of RAM allow it to work quicker than the iPhone 6S Plus. The Cupertino-based company also made improvements to the home button, which provides better feedback, is more responsive and is generally easier to use in the current Apple flagship. Water resistancy was also included into the iPhone 7 Plus, which has an IP67 rating. This technically means that the device can be submerged only until a meter of water for a maximum of 30 minutes. It has been speculated that the infamously missing 3.5mm audio jack is a reason for this new feature. READ: Apple iPhone 8: Why Samsung will benefit from the future iPhone For individuals with Optus, C|Net previously reported that the best deal is to purchase the 128GB model, which requires $107 per month. In the span of two years, the entire payout is $2,568.  Then there is Vodafone’s deal for the same variant at $113 per month, which will equate to $2,712 at the end of 24 months. On the other hand, Telstra offers the same model at $122 per month, which will set the user back by $2,928 at the end of the contract.

This round of updates target developers and users enrolled in the Apple Beta Software Program, although a public beta could arrive soon.  ( Sean Gallup | Getty Images ) Advertisement Apple seeded another round of beta versions for the macOS 10.12.2 Sierra, tvOS 10.1, and iOS 10.2. The news comes a week after the most previous beta versions were offered. macOS 10.12.2 The third beta update for the macOS Sierra 10.12.2 was released to developers right before the final version comes out to the public, merely a few days after the Cupertino company outed the second 10.12.2 beta for the macOS and three weeks after the public release of the final macOS 10.12.1 version. macOS Sierra is the latest Mac operating system available since September. It includes support for Siri, which is Apple's dedicated artificial intelligence assistant that was present only in the iPhone and iPad until recently; Apple Pay for the web; Apple Watch auto-unlocking; Universal Clipboard; Picture-in-Picture multitasking; improved iCloud Drive integration, and other small features. Users can download the third beta update via the Apple Developer Center and through the software update mechanism in the Mac App Store despite the latter reportedly having issues updating apps for some users at the time of writing. maOS Sierra 10.12.2 beta 3 includes new emoji and introduces new Unicode 9 characters such as the face palm, selfie, clown face, shark, owl, fox face, butterfly, pancakes, avocado, bacon, croissant, and many more. Additionally, there are new emoji based on professions in both male and female genders. Furthermore, Apple has updated the artwork of various existing emoji by adding more detail to make them look more realistic and less cartoonish. Apart from the addition of new emoji, a few other changes could be seen, which include bug fixes and performance enhancements that address issues since the release of macOS Sierra 10.12.1. No watchOS Update? What is noticeably missing from the current set of beta updates was watchOS 3.1.1, which was not totally surprising since the version numbers would imply that iOS, tvOS and macOS beta 3 were minor updates targeting smaller bug fixes, without any eye-catching features. iOS 10.2 And tvOS 10.1 Meanwhile, the most notable change from this current lineup of builds is the TV app running on tvOS 10.1, which arrived last week to devices running iOS 10 but took another whole week before arriving to Apple TV devices. Thus far, no significant changes can be found in the iOS 10.2 beta 3 build except that the new TV app would entirely replace Videos. Luckily for users who prefer retaining the Videos app on their iPhone or iPad, they can still download the app back via the App Store. Additionally, Apple returned the Feedback app in iOS 10.2 beta 3. For now, all the major and minor changes for the third set of betas have yet to be discovered.

These glasses may be some type of Apple-edition Google Glass with finalizations and features that’ll patch up all the flaws and caveats of Glass and other smart glasses that have attempted to make it on the market. In other words, Apple wants to try to be Apple. Apple Inc. is weighing an expansion into digital glasses, a risky but potentially lucrative area of wearable computing, according to people familiar with the matter. The way these glasses would work is by connecting to your iPhone wirelessly to display images and information in the field view of the wearable. Personalized content would likely be displayed in order for users to enjoy a more immersive experience, while there’s also a possibility that some type of AR may also be used to show users more content. While still in an exploration phase, the device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and may use augmented reality, the people said. It wouldn’t come as a shock if Apple chose to use AR in these glasses since the company has expressed plenty of interest in the technology. CEO Tim Cook has brought up the subject many a time in various interviews, while the tech giant has acquired many AR startups and companies alongside experts in the field and those familiar with the technology. Therefore, a pair of glasses may be the first place where we see the company’s efforts in the field of AR. Of course, you should always take reports like this with a grain of salt. Even though there’s quite a lot of information shared here, you have to keep in mind that Apple is still “considering” further development of their possibly next wearable. With the failure of Google Glass and other smart glasses not performing fairly so far amongst the public, Apple’s ultimate decision may be negative toward the project. On the other hand, if Apple were to go ahead with the new device, it wouldn’t launch at least until 2018. This would be the minimum time required in order to get the design just right and production partners bonded, however it’s likely we’d have to wait longer than this somewhat short time span. Nevertheless, the question now rises: would you use a pair of smart glasses built by Apple? Let us know in the comments!

The product would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing an unnamed source. The project is advanced enough to be in talks with suppliers, the report said. The smart glasses would be Apple's first in a category of product that was originally pioneered by Google with its Google Glass product. Like Google Glass, Apple's smart-glasses product would be geared toward information conveyance instead of immersive augmented-reality experiences like the products that Magic Leap is developing and Microsoft's HoloLens. Bloomberg cited sources saying the glasses "may use augmented reality." The project is in "early product testing," the Bloomberg report said. The smart glasses would be designed to connect to an iPhone for processing to keep their weight down and keep the design of the frames stylish without adding too many additional electronics. A main component of any pair of Apple smart glasses would be the lenses. Last week, Upload VR entrepreneur-in-residence Robert Scoble wrote in a Facebook post that Apple's optics partner was Carl Zeiss, which produces a lens called Zeiss Smart Optics. Thomas Alt, who joined Apple after the company bought Metaio, an AR company he was the CEO of, is listed as an inventor on a glasses patent assigned to Carl Zeiss. His LinkedIn profile lists him as "Director of Procurement, Strategic Deals Team" at Apple. A Zeiss representative declined to comment on any partnership with Apple. "I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day, it will become that much a part of you," Apple CEO Tim Cook said last month in Utah. Apple develops many projects internally, and those efforts often do not ultimately result in a full product that goes on sale. Apple is working on integrating augmented reality into its software, and the glasses would most likely be its first hardware product targeted the AR market.

And now Apple may be planning a similar device. Apple is looking at introducing smart glasses that would show images and information into the wearer’s field of view, say sources speaking to Bloomberg. The device would connect wirelessly to the wearer’s iPhone and could also use augmented reality. The glasses are said to still in the early stages at Apple, with the company only ordering a small number of near-eye displays from one supplier for its internal testing. If Apple does decide to launch these glasses to the public, the release wouldn’t happen until 2018 at the earliest, says a source. Apple hasn’t made any official announcements about these digital glasses, and it’s possible that this product will be killed off and never see any kind of public reveal. Apple is a huge company, and so it makes sense that it would regularly investigate new products but ultimately decide to scrap them if it can’t build those products exactly how it wants. All that said, Apple CEO Tim Cook has expressed interest in augmented reality in the past, saying things like “AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this” and “We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.” While Google Glass ultimately failed, Apple could learn from Glass’s mistakes and use improved technology to release headwear that fares better than Google’s effort. What do you think of today’s report? Would Apple have success with its own pair of digital glasses?

A total of 19 organizations are already on board, with more to follow in the coming months.  ( Apple ) Advertisement Tis' the season of giving, and Apple wants to make it easier by allowing users to donate to nonprofit organizations via Apple Pay. Starting today, nonprofits in the United States can accept donations made using Apple Pay, while donors can save time by sending money to a number of charities quickly and easily. "Apple Pay is making it easier and more secure to donate to your favorite nonprofit organizations with just a touch," says Apple. Nonprofits Supporting Apple Pay Apple Pay users can now donate to a wide range of nonprofits, 19 in total, from global organizations such as UNICEF to startups such as "charity: water" and more. The American Red Cross, World Wildlife Fund, Save the Children, Doctors Without Borders and more are already accepting donations via Apple Pay. More nonprofits such as CARE, American Cancer Society, DonorsChoose.org and others will start supporting Apple Pay donations in the following months, making it easier for their supporters to make private and secure investments quickly and hassle-free. How It Works Charitable organizations can use Apple Pay for the web to accept Apple Pay donations on their websites, but users will also be able to make financial contributions using specific charity apps that accept Apple Pay donations. Donating through Apple Pay doesn't require users to enter contact and billing information, make an account or fill out forms to check out. With Apple Pay, users can make instant donations and save time. "We're making it incredibly easy to give back with Apple Pay," says Apple Pay vice president Jennifer Bailey. Apple Pay Leads The Way Moreover, Bailey says that Apple learned from apps and websites that twice as many users complete purchases with Apple Pay than with any other payment method. "We think offering such a simple and secure way to support the incredible work nonprofits do will have a significant impact on the communities they serve," Bailey adds. The Season Of Giving With Apple Pay making the whole donation process easier and more secure, many charitable organizations may see more contributions from supporters this holiday season after supporting the mobile payments system. Until now, nonprofit organizations had been unable to support Apple Pay because the rules would not allow iOS apps to power fundraisers for charity using Apple Pay. Charities had to collect funds outside of their apps, which made things complicated. With Apple's support, however, nonprofits can now add built-in donate buttons.

With the holiday season, #GivingTuesday, and goodwill all right around the corner, Apple has announced that its mobile payments platform now supports instant donations to nonprofits. So now, in addition to buying yourself that new winter coat, you can help keep someone else warm this holiday season, too. “Apple Pay is making it easier and more secure to donate to your favorite nonprofit organizations with just a touch,” Apple announced on Monday. “Apple Pay support for charitable donations kicks off today with nonprofits ranging from global organizations such as UNICEF to startups … more nonprofits will offer Apple Pay over the coming months so their supporters can make easy, secure, and private payments.” This could be huge news for nonprofits, as recent figures suggest that just 10 percent of donations to charities currently come from mobile. But as Apple Pay makes giving easier, it may become a more frequent activity for the generous souls of the world. More: Here are all the places that support Apple Pay, now in Japan and 10 other countries “We’re making it incredibly easy to give back with Apple Pay,” said Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay. “Websites and apps tell us they see twice as many people actually completing a purchase with Apple Pay than with other payment methods. We think offering such a simple and secure way to support the incredible work nonprofits do will have a significant impact on the communities they serve.” This is a considerable change from Apple’s previous policy, which forced charities to take donations outside the Apple Pay app. But now they can embed “donate” buttons directly into their own apps and process gifts through the mobile platform. For a full list of nonprofits that now support Apple Pay, check out Apple’s official announcement here.

The Touch Bar provides the distinct advantage of being programmable, both by MacOS itself and by applications, to provide an optimized input experience. In order for the Touch Bar to achieve its true potential, that means that developers need to write support for the innovative new input method into their applications. Because finding apps of any kind, and particularly those that support a new feature like the Touch Bar, can be a challenge, Apple has started highlighting them in the Mac App Store, as MacRumors reports. More: Apple’s Touch Bar like having an iPhone built into your MacBook Pro If you open the App Store on a MacOS machine, you’ll find a highlighted section titled “Our Top Picks for MacBook Pro.” Clicking on it takes you to section that includes “Enhanced for Touch Bar” apps, of which currently 15 are listed: Final Cut Pro Motion Compressor Djay Pro 1Password Day One Mail Designer Pro 3 OmniGraffle 7 Drop — Color Picker Focus PicFram Live Desktop Artistry Photo Pro PocketCAS Mathematics Toolkit QuickQuad Each app varies in how significantly it uses the Touch Bar, but you can expect at least a selection of settings and shortcuts that might be otherwise buried behind a menu or using physical function keys on non-Touch Bar MacOS machines. Whether users can more easily search and add passwords in 1Password or scrub through a video in Final Cut Pro, the Touch Bar should make using each app more efficient to one degree or another. As is always the case with new technology, users can be impatient to see its full capabilities make their way to applications and the operating system. Time will tell just how much support the Touch Bar will receive, but with major developers like Microsoft bringing support to important applications like the Office suite of productivity apps, the MacBook Pro’s shiny new tool should be of ever-increasing value as the machines start rolling out to early buyers.

The MacBook Pro's touch bar is one thing, but adding touch to a 27-inch iMac would be absurd and it's not going to happen, says Apple's Phil Schiller.  ( Stephen Lam | Getty Images ) Advertisement Apple tried enabling touch screen support on its desktops and laptops, but the result was disastrous, according to Phil Schiller, Apple SVP of Worldwide Marketing. The MacBook Pro 2016 drew lots of attention with its new Touch Bar, which adds somewhat of a part-time touch experience without going full on as a touchpad. Nevertheless, some saw the Touch Bar as a stepping stone toward real touch screens adorning Macs and MacBooks sometime in the future, but that's not the case. As Schiller explains to Backchannel, a multi-touch display on a MacBook would not work out and would not be enough, as it would start a divide between the iMac and MacBook. Implementing a full-on touch display on an iMac all-in-one PC would be "absurd," Schiller says, because it would make it really cumbersome to interact with the screen rather than the traditional keyboard and mouse. It Would Be A Disaster, Absurd Despite its instincts, however, Apple decided to try it out just in case it was wrong. To ensure it's not missing out on anything, Apple tested touch screen technology on the Mac and it bolstered its belief that it would be a "disaster." "Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? That becomes absurd," Schiller explains. He further points out that adding multi-touch would imply a complete redesign of the menu bar for touch, which would in turn mar the experience for users who continue to rely on more standard pointer devices such as a mouse. "You can't optimize for both," adds Schiller. "It's the lowest common denominator thinking." MacBook Pro Touch Bar Is As Close As It Gets Over the years, Apple has revisited the idea several times and tested touch screens on a Mac, only to be more convinced that it wouldn't work well. It would be cumbersome and inconvenient, quite the opposite of what Apple is trying to achieve with its devices. When asked whether the MacBook Pro Touch Bar was the start of a larger bid to bring iOS influences to the macOS platform, Schiller assured that it's not the case. The idea behind the Touch Bar gracing the latest MacBook Pro was not to port iOS to the Mac, but rather to tap iOS technology to improve the Mac experience. What About The MacBook Pro Ports? The MacBook Pro also raised a bit of controversy over its port situation, adding only USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports. This drew plenty of criticism from Apple fans who didn't want to be forced into purchasing additional adapters, cables and dongles to connect other Apple devices to their MacBook Pro. In this respect, Schiller stands by the company's decision to redesign ports and says that Apple is "absolutely more sure than ever" that it was the right thing to do because USB-C will become the standard. MacBook Pro 2016: Love It Or Hate It Lastly, according to Schiller, the most major difference between MacBook Pro fans and critics comes down to one thing: those who have interacted with the MacBook Pro and those who haven't. For the latter category, things would perhaps change soon since the first batch of MacBook Pro 2016 laptops has started shipping out to preorder customers.

Yesterday AAPL: 105.71 -2.72 TOMS reveals line of Apple Watch bands, each purchase gives 1yr of solar light to a person in need Chance Miller - 15 hours ago @ChanceHMiller Apple Watch View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Popular charitable shoe and clothing company TOMS has today announced its own lineup of Apple Watch bands. While the company has yet to formally reveal the effort, the bands are live on TOMS.com, as is the new One-to-One initiative to go alongside the accessories… TOMS says that every time an Apple Watch band is purchased, it will provide one year of solar light to a person in need, continuing the matching charitable component of its products that have been a staple for the company: A classic look designed for travel and adventure. TOMS for Apple Watch bands do more than just make a personal style statement; they make a difference by helping bring solar lights to people who need them the most. When individuals have access to safe, reliable light sources, one more child will have the TIME to study into the night, one more person will have the TIME to work after dark and earn extra income, and one more family will stay healthy and safe. As for the bands themselves, TOMS is offering a handful of different options for both 38mm and 42mm Apple Watch wearers. There are two different tiers of bands, $49 and $75. The former offers a light blue stripe option, a black option, a clay option, an olive option, and a dusty pink option. These bands are made out of a “durable grosgrain fabric” with leather detailing: Designed for the Apple Watch Durable grosgrain fabric Genuine leather detailing, stainless steel buckle with black finish GIVE TIME etching on buckle, gold TOMS emboss Apple Watch sold separately The $75 tier offers a black diamond design, a royal blue diamond design, and a red diamond design. These bands feature: Designed for the Apple Watch Woven fabric with genuine leather backing Stainless steel detailing with silver finish GIVE TIME etching on buckle, gold TOMS emboss Apple Watch sold separately TOMS got its popularity largely due to the charitable efforts that see it donate one pair of shoes to a person in need every time a pair of shoes is purchased, and the company is keeping those efforts in place with its Apple Watch accessories. The new TOMS Apple Watch bands are available now from TOMS’ website.

It's 1999, the turn of the millennium, quality online gaming is a thing of the future, Limp Bizkit are still in the charts and flip phones are all the rage. A dark, dark time. Or at least it was, until Apple released the iBook G3, a quirky, fun take on laptop design with an... interesting look to entice the artiste and the average Joe alike. Its rounded, plasticky design makes it look more like a cheap children's toy than a top of the range computer nowadays, especially when compared with Apple's more recent models, but in 1999, the iBook was pretty cool. Join us as we take a trip down memory lane and see why the Apple iBook G3 was so chic: APPLE IBOOK G3 - WHAT'S THE STORY? More than a decade ago, Apple had yet to unleash its iPod, and the only people that used its computers were creative types with angular haircuts. Then, in 1999, came the “toilet seat” iBook. With its eye-catching trim it dropped a splash of colour into a dreary world of grey slabs designed for dreary boardroom meetings, and suddenly made laptops desirable. Even if it did look like a lavatory after a visit from the Changing Rooms team. WHY SHOULD I WANT ONE? Because the iBook G3 introduced some features that we take for granted these days – and some we kinda miss too. It had a built-in handle (useful as it weighed about the same as a small dog) and was the first mainstream laptop to come with Wi-Fi. However, with a maximum 6GB hard drive and 366Mhz processor, these days the specs look about as up-to- date as Gandhi riding a penny-farthing. WHAT SHOULD I LOOK FOR? The few iBooks up for sale on eBay seem to be reluctant listings, which says a lot about why they’re so scarce. As with any second hand laptop, chances are its life on the road will have taken its toll but aside from a few bumps and scrapes, iBooks seem to age fairly well – even the battery charge tends to hold strong. The hardest bit, in fact, will be convincing someone to sell one.

Reuters/Sergei Karpukhin A report has revealed that the Apple iPhone 8 could come with a never-seen-before wireless charging technology. It is believed that the 10th anniversary smartphone from Apple would come with a receiver inside. When the device needs to be charged, the receiver would connect to a transmitter plugged into wall socket. The flagship from Apple is said to have a radical new design. As per latest reports, Apple is working with Energous to introduce the wireless-charging technology for iPhone 8. If rumours are to be believed, the iPhone owner has to be within 15 feet of the transmitter for successful charging, writes BGR. Neither Energous nor Apple has confirmed this for iPhone 8 though the very concept of wireless charging has been on the cards for some time. Samsung introduced dual wireless charging for its Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge devices. The circular pads charge the device without the need to connect the device to a cable. Charging pads and stands are available that can support up to three devices though the wireless charging devices available currently require connecting to a socket with a cable. The technology being developed by Apple with Energous for iPhone 8 is new and eliminates all use of cables. As per The Indian Express, the Apple iPhone 8 could feature an OLED display and a glass back. The 2017 iPhone may not sport an aluminium back. A Nikkei report has also stated that Apple could release an additional screen size for iPhone 8. The 5-inch variant may have a 2.5D glass. Other reports have revealed that the Apple iPhone 8 will remove the physical Home button. A bezel-free curved design is also on the cards. The handset may also have an edgeless design. Moving towards a curved design seems like a strong possibility as talks have been there for quite some time now. An edgeless display in the Apple iPhone 8 is also more efficient as it offers quick access to various features. The world is waiting for the iPhone 8 and the wait is worth it.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News TVC Mall Now Sells Samsung and Apple Phone Accessories on Both Wholesale and Retail Basis Shenzhen, China — (SBWIRE) — 11/14/2016 — TVC Mall, an ecommerce store that is in itself a one-stop store for gadgets and accessories, recently announced that they are now selling both Samsung and Apple phone accessories on wholesale and retail basis. The e-store now sells accessories for iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6 and all other Apple phones as well as of Samsung and many other brands. The owners of the e-store said that selling the phone accessories on wholesale and retail basis would help them in reaching out to more customers, both the individuals as well as B2B buyers. “We have also launched a range of Android phone accessories for Samsung and other brands only this month. We hope that our exhaustive collection of phone accessories would put a stop to the frantic search that many retailers and ordinary and individual customers undertake while they are in a need of quality and compatible phone accessories for their gadgets”, said the sales and marketing head of TVC Mall during a recent trade fair. The trade fair, which was held in Shanghai, was also the platform for TVC Mall to launch a series of mobile phone accessories which has just arrived. The owners said that the newly launched Samsung phone accessories and other sorts of accessories have generated investor interest and they have received a slew of trading proposals from prospective investors over the past one week.

The CEO of TVC Mall led the team there himself, he said that they are optimistic about further growth and presence in the wholesale market, each trade fair meant a fresh new opportunities for their business.  He thought the only weakness that may hold back the growth speed of TVC Mall would be their supply chain and logistic system.

We know many of the accessories we sell are not available in the aftermarkets as these are all quality Samsung and Apple phone accessories that made by branded manufacturers.

The emphasis was intentional. Samsung’s target customers are carmakers who’d love to give their vehicles smartphone-like capabilities but are leery of surrendering unfettered access to their dashboards. They’ve largely kept a distance from Google, which could mine driver data for its own uses, or Apple Inc, which until recently had designs on building its own car. Samsung wants to marry its consumer electronics expertise and the fast 5G cellular network it’s developing with Harman’s presence in dashboards all over the world. If it works, they can offer carmakers a lightning-quick connected system for infotainment, mapping, concierge services and autonomous driving — and all without the worry that the automakers would be helping a future competitor. “This is not about building a car,” Young said in an interview. Several automakers “came to us and asked us to help with technologies like 5G, or artificial intelligence or memory. We can harness technologies to provide a better experience to automakers.” Samsung offered US$112 a share in cash for Harman, which was 28 per cent above the Stamford, Connecticut-based company’s closing price of US$87.65 in New York on Friday. The stock closed up 22 per cent to US$109.72, the biggest gain since its 1986 initial public offering. Samsung’s own shares rose on the deal, which was announced after the market closed yesterday. The stock climbed as much as 1.8 per cent as of 9:45am in Seoul. The acquisition reverberated through the car business, with Wells Fargo analyst David Lim saying in a research note that the deal could “ignite additional mergers and acquisitions of higher technology auto suppliers.” The shares of automotive electronics maker Visteon Corp. jumped 9.6 per cent — the most since August 2012 — and larger rival Delphi Automotive Plc gained 2.2 per cent. Deals like Samsung’s for Harman could be welcome by automakers, who want to control the revenue from connected car services and the customer data it generates as much as possible, said Jim Hines, a research director at Gartner. ‘Competitive dynamic’ “There is definitely a competitive dynamic that has emerged between the established automotive industry and these large tech companies that are looking to get a piece of that market opportunity,” Hines said. As automakers have rolled out connected services in their cars, they have been very careful in how they work with Google and Apple. General Motors Co allows its customers to connect their smartphones into the dashboard through Apple’s Car Play and Google’s Android Auto — but only with selected apps, and the phones cannot access a car’s data. Toyota Motor Corp. doesn’t allow its cars to connect to either system. The fear among carmakers is that Apple and Google could either mine the data inside the car, tracking everything from driving patterns to engine performance, to either become a new face to the consumer or to help them build cars. The fact that Harman is already a supplier and that Samsung doesn’t have a system that competes with the in-car connected services sold by carmakers could make them a more attractive partner, Hines said. Partner or threat? “They might be viewed as less of a threat in terms of tech partner for some of these leading automotive brands,” Hines said. Samsung wants to become a high-tech supplier capable of building connected systems. Its expertise is making the hardware, like microprocessing units, and a faster 5G network to deliver more data to cars faster. Harman sells — among other technologies — 3D navigation, apps for integrating other devices into the car, active safety systems and audio systems that can access the cloud. There are a lot of opportunities once the companies combine, Harman Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dinesh Paliwal said in a phone interview. Imagine a car that that can read a driver’s daily schedule and automatically dial into a conference call, Paliwal said. Autonomous driving will only give drivers access to more connected capabilities for work or entertainment, he said. “We’ll be in the best possible position because we have all the capabilities,” Paliwal said. Overcoming weaknesses Assuming the merger goes through, Samsung will need to develop other capabilities, especially in software, said Cyrus Mewawalla, lead analyst at CM Research. Like Google and Apple, Samsung wants to own and provide the servers, the hardware that’s doing all the computing and the memory storage for connected cars. They also want to own the platform that runs the apps, in the way that Apple’s iOS and Android do now. While they have expertise in some things like microprocessors, they don’t have all of those capabilities, Mewawalla said. “They’d need more than just this acquisition,” he said. “The two key weaknesses Samsung has is the software ecosystem and cloud infrastructure, and that’s where it needs to be acquiring.” Artificial intelligence, in which Samsung has recently made a deal, should be a particular area of focus in the near future, he added. If it chooses, the company could also have the resources to develop such capabilities on its own once Harman’s 8,000 software engineers and join Samsung, which spends US$13 billion a year on research and development and US$23 billion in capital expenditures. “Imagine the scale of our R&D,” Paliwal said. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Nepal PM phones India’s Modi over rupee chaos Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year United to delay taking Boeing jets in US$4.8b savings push Bursa Malaysia ends higher on window-dressing, higher oil prices Macau sets US$25b gaming target for 2017 below estimates Oil slumps as prospect of Trump victory roils global markets Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Malaysia growth push stymied by banks cautious on loans US stocks decline after rally as election takes centre stage BNM: Ringgit fell against most world currencies in third quarter Most Watched Now Week MMOTV: Time to show up with daughter, Indira tells ex-husband NYT Video: ScienceTake — how dolphins know who’s who Reuters Video: Groin-flashing frog discovered in Australia Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Related Articles US stocks mixed as Samsung announces US$8b Harman deal (VIDEO) Samsung seeks redemption with AI-infused Galaxy S8 phone Samsung Electronics to invest more than US$1b in US chip production Samsung Electronics’ third quarter profit guidance beats estimates despite Note 7 woes Samsung targeted by activist investors to restructure company Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The wearable headset would show images, along with other information and may use augmented reality, according to the report. Chief Executive Tim Cook, who has been struggling with a slowdown in iPhone sales in recent quarters, said earlier this year that the company would continue to invest a lot into augmented reality. Apple, the world’s largest technology company, has ordered a small number of near-eye displays for testing but has not obtained enough for production on a larger scale, the report added. Apple declined to comment. The move would make Apple the latest tech company to venture into wearable glasses. Alphabet Inc’s discontinued its own wearable glass headset, Google Glass, and closed the social media account linked to the device earlier this year, ending its attempt to popularize the expensive devices with consumers. The device received plenty of attention when it was launched in 2012, but quickly ran into problems with its awkward appearance and privacy concerns over video recording.

While still in an exploration phase, the device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer's field of vision, and may use augmented reality, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a secret project.

Apple has talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers, according to people familiar with those discussions. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing, the people said. Apple hasn't ordered enough components so far to indicate imminent mass-production, one of the people added. Should Apple ultimately decide to proceed with the device, it would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, another person said. The California-based company tests many different products and is known to pivot, pause, or cancel projects without disclosing them. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Apple CEO Tim Cook has talked up the benefits of augmented reality in the past. Photo: Bloomberg CEO Tim Cook is under pressure to deliver new products amid slowing sales of the iPhone, which accounts for two-thirds of Apple's revenue. In July, he expressed enthusiasm for augmented reality after the rise of Pokemon Go, a location-based game that uses the technology. AR, as it's known, adds images and other digital information to people's view of the real world, while virtual reality completely surrounds them with a computer-generated environment. The glasses may be Apple's first hardware product targeted directly at AR, one of the people said. Cook has beefed up AR capabilities through acquisitions. In 2013, Apple bought PrimeSense, which developed motion-sensing technology in Microsoft Kinect gaming system. Purchases of software start-ups in the field, Metaio and Flyby Media, followed in 2015 and 2016. Advertisement "AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this," Cook said in a July 26 conference call with analysts. "We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity." Apple has AR patents for things like street view in mapping apps. It was also awarded patents for smart glasses that make use of full-fledged virtual reality. Apple is unlikely to leverage VR in a mass-consumer product, Cook suggested in October. Google Glass was widely criticised.  "I can't imagine everyone in here getting in an enclosed VR experience while you're sitting in here with me, but I could imagine everyone in here in an AR experience right now," he said during an onstage discussion in Utah. Apple's challenge is fitting all the technology needed into a useful pair of internet-connected glasses that are small and sleek enough for regular people to wear. Google's attempt to develop internet-connected eyewear flopped in part because its tiny battery ran out quickly. Google Glass, as it was called, also suffered a privacy backlash and poor public perception of its external design. Bloomberg Advertisement 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Apple Pay Can Now Be Used For Donations Posted: Nov 14 2016, 4:56pm CST | by Noel Diem, in News | Apple   Photo Credit: Getty Images   Apple has announced that they will work with nonprofits, allowing them to take donations using Apple Pay. This will include Apple Pay on the internet as well as on mobile apps. There are hopes that it will increase charitable giving. Don't Miss: Best Amazon Black Friday 2016 Deals Apple previously had a rule that iOS apps couldn't collect funds for charities or fundraisers using Apple Pay. It means that if they collected funds, they'd have to go through Safari or SMS. Now they will be able to go straight through the app. On mobile, users will be able to use TouchID. Online, users can click the Apple Pay button and confirm using iPhone or Apple Watch. Already, online stores that take Apple Pay have said that conversion rates are up and customers check out faster, according to TechCrunch. The reason that this system works is because everything is streamlined. Apple Pay has millions and millions of customers, and will add more each and every week. The technology is integrated into many iOS apps. In fact, Apple Pay transactions have increased by nearly 500% and more were made in one month this year than in all of last year. Many nonprofits are launching Apple Pay, including the following: American Red Cross, American Heart Association, charity: water, Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, COPD Foundation, Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA), Doctors Without Borders, Feeding America, GlobalGiving, International Rescue Committee, Red, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, The Nature Conservancy, Save the Children, The Water Project, UNICEF, United Way, WNET, World Vision and WWF (World Wildlife Federation). A few others will join soon.

While still in an exploration phase, the device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and may use augmented reality, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a secret project. Apple has reportedly discussed the project with potential suppliers and has ordered a small quantity of 'near-eye displays' for testing. So far the company hasn't ordered enough components to suggest it will enter production. It's likely that if Apple decides to pursue the project it would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company is investing a lot in AR and is 'high on AR for the long run'. Augmented reality "is going to take a while, because there are some really hard technology challenges there, but it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it," Cook said last month. "Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today." Notably, a recent report from Robert Scoble predicts that the next iPhone will be a clear piece of glass that can be inserted into a headset which has eye sensors on it. The iPhone would be able to put holograms on top of the real world. Another report from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claims that Apple is working on augmented reality technology for use in key products and autonomous driving.

New York, NY (Top40 Charts / Beijing TaiHe Music Culture Development) Chinese Star Kris Wu (Yifan Wu)'s new single "July" was released on Apple Music + iTunes yesterday, announcing his return as a singer. The new single of Kris draws huge public attention immediately by its strong beat, quality production and advancing "Future Bass" style. Several hours after the debut on Apple Music and iTunes on November 3rd, "July" has become the second single by a Chinese artist to enter the Top 50 iTunes charts in the US, ranking No.1 in its own genre. Aside from iTunes, it will be available on other international digital platforms, including Spotify, KKBOX, Omusic and Deezer. "July" has quickly swept the entire Asia-Pacific region by leading the popular song list in many countries. According to Kris studio, Kris participated the composing and writing for the new single "July". By mixing electro R&B and EDM elements alongside with the popular "Future Bass" style, produced by world class producer, "July" was recorded in the same studio where Michael Jackson recorded "Bad". About Kris Wu Kris is an actor, singer and fashion icon. Kris has appeared in multiple box office movies, and he will be in Galaxy Agent and Triple X3. On October 14, 2007, Kris auditioned for S.M. Entertainment's Canadian Global Auditions, which were held in Vancouver. After passing the auditions, he moved to South Korea in January 2008 and became a trainee for the company. Kris debuted as one of the members of EXO on April 8, 2012 with MAMA. The group quickly rose to fame only a year after their debut and Kris became one of the most popular members and the captain of the group. Music is the best birthday gift Kris released the single "Bad girl" on his birthday last year, which caused a huge reaction from his fans. Kris said that he would keep releasing a new song on every birthday as a tradition, because he wanted to make his birthday a carnival, and he wished to have special gift for everybody on his birthday.

Is The New MacBook Pro With TouchBar A Good Computer? Nov 14 2016, 3:32 PM 32 diggs Save Share Tweet 'nana Blacklist story Blacklist domain Today, the brand new MacBook Pro with TouchBar, which was unveiled just a few weeks ago, arrives in the hands of the consumer. It's also the day that, evidently, the review embargo was lifted. So, is a computer with a touchscreen worth $1,799? Here's what the reviews say. Is The TouchBar Actually Useful? As its name suggests, the MacBook Pro with TouchBar comes with a thin multi-touch LED screen where the function keys used to be. Gimmick or not, the TouchBar's ability to display context-sensitive actions for whatever application you're using is one of the few hardware interface experiments in the PC industry. But does it actually work? According to The Verge's Jacob Kastrenakes it does... almost: The Touch Bar is often used like a menu, rather than a quick set of controls. Having those menu options exposed so clearly can be helpful at times — I’m bad at finding formulas in Keynote, for instance, and the Touch Bar makes them easy to access — but mostly it’s not. These apps don’t need more menus; they need better context for people just starting out in them, and a streamlined way for experienced users to get stuff done. [The Verge] Ars Technica's Andrew Cunningham points out that the utility of the TouchBar lies squarely in the hands of the developers. Sure, it works in Apple's own apps, but outside of that you're likely to forget the TouchBar even exists: The ultimate utility of the Touch Bar is going to depend entirely on the apps you use and, to a lesser extent, how you use your computer. If it’s being used as a desktop with an external keyboard a significant amount of the time, the Touch Bar does nothing for you. When I went out of my way to use Apple’s apps, I liked the Touch Bar a lot. It just takes one or two useful buttons—creating a new tab in Safari, looking up a main page in Terminal, changing font sizes or creating checklists in Notes—to make you glad the Touch Bar is there. However, a typical day for me is spent mostly in Word, Outlook, Slack, Tweetbot, and Chrome. Microsoft is bringing Touch Bar support to Office, but if other app makers don’t start adding in support, a big chunk of that bar is going to end up sitting empty most of the time. [Ars Technica] Based on the impressions of CNET's Dan Ackerman, who seems to really enjoy the TouchBar, at best it'll make your life a little easier here and there but won't totally change the way you use a computer: Having spent some serious hands-on time with the Touch Bar version of the new 13-inch MacBook Pro, and testing its capabilities with a wide range of apps, it feels like a tool that can enhance your computing experience, but won't revolutionize it. It does less than a full touchscreen might, but Apple has found a way to use it to cut down on keystrokes, streamline tasks and add additional levels of fine control. [CNET] The Port Situation Is A Hassle Perhaps you've heard some frustrated criticisms of Apple's Decision to equip the MacBook Pro with just four USB-C ports. There is no MagSafe charging port. There is no DisplayPort. There is, as the gaming bros over at Razer pointed out, no SD card slot. Just four USB-C slots and a whole mess of dongles. The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern explains, like the loss of the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, the switch to USB-C is necessary in the long run, but annoying today: USB-C is a wonderful port. A faster, single type of port for connecting chargers, hard drives, phones, monitors? It’s the dream. Today, though, it’s a dongle nightmare. Until the entire tech industry catches up, you’re stuck dragging around pricey, flimsy adapters to connect everything. Apple has slashed USB-C adapter pricing for now, but it should have included that $9 USB-C to USB adapter in the box [The Wall Street Journal] The Keyboard Is A Bit Odd But The Speakers Are Good Apple completely redesigned the MacBook Pro to be both thinner and lighter. This quest for doing more with less has it's winners and losers, however. To save space, Apple opted for its shorter-travel butterfly key design, originally found on the MacBook. For Endgadget's Dana Wollman, who was very familiar with the older, softer keys, they new butterfly design took a few weeks to stick: Though Apple claims the butterfly mechanism allows for more even button presses, my key strikes would sometimes fail to register, leading me to make typos and forcing me to go back and reenter my long password a second or even third time. By now, though, after some two-odd weeks of testing, I'm typing at a faster clip. I still sometimes screw up my passwords, but my emails and first drafts (including this review!) are mostly clean. I've gone from merely tolerating the new keyboard to actually appreciating it. [Endgadget] Somehow, the thinner design brought us better speakers? According to Macworld's Susie Ochs, they're on-par with a Bluetooth speaker: What isn’t a bummer are the new speakers, my favorite non-Touch Bar feature of the new machines. Apple explained that since they are connected right to the battery with no transformer between them, the speakers can get twice the peak power—and you can really hear the difference. Music sounds great when you turn the volume all the way up, and the speakers are powerful enough to provide satisfying sound while watching movies, TV, and sports. The 15-inch model’s speakers seem to have more oomph than the 13-incher’s, but both can ably fill a hotel room with music, if you should want to leave your portable Bluetooth speaker at home. [Macworld] It's Powerful Enough A major gripe within those who have an eye for hardware specs is that Apple neglected to include Intel's newest processor, their fifth-generation Broadwell CPU, and instead opted for the fourth-gen Haswell. A curious omission for what Apple calls it's most powerful MacBook yet. Still, practically speaking, not being on the bleeding edge doesn't seems okay? It's fine, says Fast Company's Harry McCracken: Given that some of Apple's most demanding professional users are fretting about these machines' processors and RAM capacities, should those of us who don't need tippy-top-of-the-line performance be concerned? I'll leave benchmarking to experts such as the folks at AnandTech, but these Macs have more than enough horsepower for non-superhuman computing tasks; even though Apple didn't use Intel's latest processors, it called on technologies such as high-speed solid-state storage to keep things fast. [Fast Company] Ultimately, It Might Be Good To Just Wait A TouchBar developers have yet to quite figure out, an I/O port standard that's still in its infancy, a slightly underwhelming choice of processor — there are a few teething issues with the new MacBrook Pro. And for a minimum $1,799 entry fee, well, that's an iffy proposition. WIRED's David Pierce suggests that, like the original iPhone, it might be better to just wait for the second go-round: Do you desperately need a new laptop right this second? If not, wait. Run your current (and probably still excellent) machine into the ground, then buy a new one. In a year or two USB-C accessories will be everywhere, developers will have figured out what the Touch Bar is good for, and Apple may even give the Pro spec bump.

Firefighters responded to a structure fire at 13663 Navajo Road a little before 1:15 a.m. and found heavy smoke coming from one of the units of a strip mall with threat of spreading through the entire structure. The fire district responded with three engines, a chief officer and fire investigator, with assistance from San Bernardino County Fire Department and Cal Fire. Firefighters attacked with “swift and aggressive ventilation” and contained the fire to the single unit. Fire officials said explosions were heard during the fire fight. The entire unit was damaged from heavy smoke and fire. The cause of the blaze was unknown and under investigation, fire officials said Monday afternoon. “Investigators are in the process of reviewing surveillance video and interviewing witnesses,” fire officials said. The investigation is ongoing and anyone with information is asked to call the AVFPD at 760-247-7618.

Apple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now. The American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. Apple said that websites and apps accepting Apple Pay report seeing twice as many people complete transactions, compared with other payment methods. Separately, Samsung said a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent. They will be redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products. Americans are just starting to warm up to mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. Although usage is growing, mobile payments are still a small portion of overall sales.

By Asha McLean | November 15, 2016 -- 00:12 GMT (16:12 PST) | Topic: Banking CUA has announced the launch of Apple Pay, allowing customers of the member-owned financial organisation to use their CUA Visa Debit card through the iPhone maker's digital wallet. In a statement, CUA said the launch of Apple Pay feeds into the institution's focus on digital capability and investing in digital channels. Latest Australian news ​Department of Finance to rebuild two-year-old IT system Telstra launches Smart Home devices and pricing ​Turnbull's DTA to establish a whole-of-government program management office Vodafone continues losing customers as Telstra, Optus, Amaysim gain: Kantar Australian banks dismiss Android NFC past in Apple Pay negotiations "CUA members have been asking when we'd be rolling out Apple Pay and we are excited that they can now enjoy the benefits and convenience of making payments using their Apple devices," said CUA chief operating officer for member services Andy Rigg. Apple Pay was launched in Australia in November, with American Express the only financial institution partner joining the iPhone maker's near-field communication (NFC) payments at the time. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) was then the first bank in the country to integrate Apple Pay, with ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott admitting in April that the launch was in direct response to the "hounding" he received from customers on Twitter and via email. ANZ is the only member of Australia's big four to embrace Apple Pay by leaving the group of banks requesting collective bargaining rights with Apple. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank, Westpac Bank, and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank have been seeking regulatory approval to collectively negotiate with third-party mobile providers such as Apple on conditions relating to competition, best practice standards, and efficiency. Specifically, they want non-exclusive access to the NFC chip, standardised security for all mobile payments systems, and price transparency on transaction costs within Australia. "Collective negotiation is necessary in a context where Apple has the ability and incentive to lock competitors out of the iPhone's NFC technology needed to make integrated mobile payments," the banks said in their joint response to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) last month. According to a list published last week by Australian independent payment solutions provider Cuscal, 31 financial institutions will be soon joining ANZ and CUA in offering Apple Pay in Australia. The list includes: Bank Australia, Catalyst Money, Credit Union SA, Defence Bank, My State Bank, People's Choice Credit Union, Police Bank, Customs Bank, QT Mutual Bank, Teachers Mutual Bank, UniBank, and Woolworths Employees' Credit Union. CUA announced its partnership with Android Pay in August, allowing CUA Visa debit card and CUA credit card customers to pay with the digital wallet. "The way our members choose to pay is changing with a rapid increase in contactless payments over the past year. The launch of Android Pay is the next stage of the exciting evolution of banking in Australia," Rigg said at the time. "CUA has a track record of working with third parties to leverage external expertise to make us a leader in providing mobile payment technologies to our members." CUA was also the first financial institution in the Asia Pacific to launch a mobile tap-and-pay app, with its with redi2PAY platform that turns any NFC-enabled smartphone running the latest Andorid operating system into a contactless payment device.

Brian McDonagh has brought a challenge against Bord Pleanála’s decision last August to allow Apple build the data centre, which is one of eight such proposed developments, at lands at Toberroe, Palmerstown, Derrydonnell at Athenry in Co Galway. Mr McDonagh, who was previously given permission to have the board’s decision judicially reviewed, wants the decision quashed on grounds including it breaches EU directives on forestry. At yesterday’s sitting of the commercial court, Apple Distribution International, the entity which seeks to develop the data centre and a notice party to Mr McDonagh’s action, applied to have the case admitted to the fast-track court list. READ NEXT Tullow Uganda may be delayed Representing himself, Mr McDonagh of Unit 1, Ballymount Cross Business Park, Dublin 24 said he “did not oppose Apple coming to Athenry” but wanted to ensure they “comply with proper planning procedures”.  He said he wanted the case heard by the High Court or in Europe. Seeking to have the matter fast-tracked, Rory Mulcahy SC for Apple, said that Mr McDonagh had been refused permission by the High Court to include the argument about an alleged breach of the forestry directive in his action. He has appealed that ruling to the Court of Appeal, counsel added. Counsel said Mr McDonagh did not make any submissions to Galway Co Council in respect of the original planning application, nor did he appeal to the board. Mr McDonagh “only came on the field after the board made its decision”, counsel said.  Having considered the submissions, Mr Justice Brian McGovern said he would admit what was an appropriate case to the list. The court heard that last week a separate action was brought by Sinead Fitzpatrick and Allan Daly who are also challenging Bord Pleanála’s decision.  Ms Fitzpatrick and Mr Daly of Lisheenkyle, Athenry, which is close to the proposed centre claim the decision to grant permission to Apple is invalid on grounds including that the board failed to carry out a proper assessment of the effects the proposed development will have on the environment. The judge also ruled that the two cases are to be heard together next March. Apple says the proposed centre is a critical piece of infrastructure.

The wearable headset would connect wirelessly to iPhones and show information that is superimposed onto a user's view of the real world. The firm has talked about the project with potential suppliers for Google Glass-style headsets. It is unclear when a finished product will be unveiled, but the earliest time frame for a reveal is 2018. Scroll down for video  Apple looks like it may be moving into the world of augmented reality, by considering expanding into wearable glass headsets. Chief Executive Tim Cook, said earlier this year that the company would continue to invest a lot into augmented reality THE END OF GOOGLE GLASS  Alphabet discontinued its own wearable glass headset, Google Glass, and closed the social media account linked to the device earlier this year. This ends its attempt to popularise the expensive devices with consumers. The device received plenty of attention when it was launched in 2012, but quickly ran into problems with its awkward appearance and privacy concerns over video recording.  A report by Bloomberg cites 'people familiar with the issue' who asked not to be identified.  . Chief Executive Tim Cook, who has been struggling with a slowdown in iPhone sales in recent quarters, said earlier this year that the company would continue to invest a lot into augmented reality (AR). Augmented reality is a tool that overlays digital information with the user's environment in real-time.  The glasses would be Apple's first product targeted directly at AR, according to the report.  The firm has built up its AR research through the acquisition of several firms, including PrimeSense, which developed motion-sensing technology in Microsoft's Kinect Gaming syste. 'AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this,' Mr Cook said in a conference call with analysts.  'We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.' RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next From your travels to your diet, the molecules left on your...

The company is still exploring the smart glasses market, the report states, so it’s unclear when a finished product will materialize. The earliest time frame for a product reveal is 2018, yet Apple could sit on the project for much longer or change its direction as it has with its automotive ambitions. Apple is exploring both AR and VR It’s been well known for months now that Apple has been collecting AR talent and putting minds to work in secret on some type of consumer product. CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly answered AR-related questions on quarterly earnings calls, saying he thinks the technology has more potential than its virtual reality counterpart and coyly hinting at Apple’s plans to enter the space. However, as of September of this year, Apple continues to hire both AR and VR experts, leaving open the possibility that it could develop products in both categories. According to Bloomberg, Apple has already had talks with potential suppliers for components like near-eye displays. It also has the expertise behind companies like PrimeSense, Metaio, and Flyby, all startups that were focused on AR software, 3D mapping, and computer vision before Apple acquired them over the course of the last three years. The goal is to develop a pair of glasses that could connect wirelessly to an iPhone and overlay information on the wearer’s field of vision. Apple has acquired a number of startups specializing in AR software AR is not without its hurdles. Google Glass was a massive flop, giving AR a sour public image and showing just how far the technology needs to go before it can be worn on our face. The most capable headset available to the public right now is the developer version of Microsoft’s HoloLens, which costs $3,000. Another startup, Magic Leap, continues to work in secret on AR technology it will not discuss in detail. Meanwhile, the rest of the tech community has turned its focus to VR. Google has its Daydream platform and new View headsets, while Facebook-owned Oculus VR and Samsung are working on all manner of high-end and mobile headsets. It’s unclear where Apple will fall on the spectrum, but Cook remains bullish on AR. “There are some really hard technology challenges there, but it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it,” he said of AR last month. - Source: Bloomberg News Next Up In Circuit Breaker Toms-branded Apple Watch bands are for when you want to look like a woke bae Aiaiai’s modular headphones can be upgraded to Bluetooth with this swappable headband Roccat's new over-ear headphones let you switch mics for mobile gaming Nokia's canceled smartwatch appears in leaked video Lyft is replacing the pink mustache with a psychedelic dash display that knows your name Some 'Enhanced' games are having frame rate issues on the PS4 Pro Now Trending MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review: a touch of the future WhatsApp opens up video calling to everyone The Walking Dead Redemption Club season 7, episode 4: Service This Article has a component height of 10.

For the ECB, the issue is what to do about its bond-buying program, which pumps new money into Europe's struggling economy each month to try to accelerate growth and inflation. The Fed and the ECB two of the world's most important central banks will be making its policy decisions before Trump is inaugurated Jan. 20, while still weighing what he might do as president. ___ Trump set to roll back Obama policies on energy, environment WASHINGTON President-elect Donald Trump is considering an oil billionaire and a North Dakota lawmaker for top posts as he moves to roll back President Barack Obama's environmental and energy policies and allow unfettered production of oil, coal and natural gas. Trump pledges to sharply increase oil and gas drilling on federal lands while opening up offshore drilling in the Atlantic Ocean and other areas where it is blocked. Topping Trump's to-do list is repealing the Clean Power Plan, Obama's signature effort to limit carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. ___ Siemens to buy Oregon-based Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion FRANKFURT, Germany German industrial equipment maker Siemens AG says it has agreed to buy U.S.-based software firm Mentor Graphics Corp. for $4.5 billion, broadening Siemens digital capabilities. Siemens said it would pay $37.25 a share in cash, or 21 percent more than Mentor's closing price on Friday. Mentor, based in Wilsonville, Oregon, specializes in software used to design computer chips, technology with broad potential applications to smart and connected devices such as autonomous vehicles. It has customers in industries ranging from aerospace to consumer electronics and 5,700 employees in 32 countries. ___ American Apparel files for bankruptcy protection, again WASHINGTON American Apparel is seeking bankruptcy protection for the second time in just over a year, unable to find its footing in a shifting retail landscape and after a fight for control with its founder Dov Charney. Canada's Gildan Activewear is buying the American Apparel brand for $66 million. The retailer first filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2015, about a year after it fired Charney for violating its sexual harassment policy. Charney's lengthy legal campaign to retake control of the company was rejected by a bankruptcy court judge in January. ___ US stocks finish level as tech losses cancel out bank gains NEW YORK U.S. stocks came back from an early loss and finished almost unchanged Monday. Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week's election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump's policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. ___ Vroom: Gov't to require hybrid, electric cars to make noise WASHINGTON New hybrid and electric cars are required to make noise when traveling at low speeds so that pedestrians, especially those who are blind or have poor eyesight, will hear them coming, under a new rule released Monday by the Obama administration. The new rule could help prevent about 2,400 pedestrian injuries a year, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The rule requires hybrid and electric vehicles to make audible noise when traveling in reverse or forward at speeds up to about 19 mph. The sound alert isn't required at higher speeds because other factors, such as tire and wind noise, provide warning. ___ Samsung's $8B ticket into the red-hot automotive tech race SEOUL, South Korea Samsung Electronics' $8 billion acquisition of the U.S. auto electronics company Harman will instantly transform the tech company into a major player in the highly competitive market for auto infotainment, software and connected car technology. Samsung announced Monday that it would pay $112 per share in cash for the company, its largest acquisition by far. Harman International Industries Inc. makes touch screens that control vehicle functions and infotainment systems, and it's dominant in automotive sound systems with brands such as Harman Kardon, JBL, Infinity and Mark Levinson. ___ Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay to offer rewards NEW YORK Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. Apple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services until now. The American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. ___ Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway invests in major airlines NEW YORK Warren Buffett is changing his mind about airlines and buying stakes in several major carriers including American Air Lines and Delta Air Lines. The billionaire investor has famously avoided the sector in the past, although his Berkshire Hathaway does own NetJets, which sells partial ownership interests in business jets. Buffett disclosed the new investments, which also include United Continental Holdings, Monday in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ___ SEC Chair White leaving at end of Obama administration WASHINGTON The Securities and Exchange Commission says the agency's head, Mary Jo White, will leave office at the end of the Obama administration. White, a former federal prosecutor and private securities lawyer, was appointed by President Barack Obama in February 2013. Her term doesn't end until 2019. President-elect Donald Trump is due to take office Jan. 20 and likely will name his own choice to head the market watchdog agency in the near future. ___ PetSmart fined for not reporting injury-causing fish bowls NEW YORK PetSmart will pay a $4.25 million civil fine for not quickly reporting defective fish bowls that caused serious injuries at least a dozen times. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday that injuries included deep cuts requiring stitches and severed tendons that required surgery after bowls cracked or shattered. The pet products retailer sold the bowls under the "Grreat Choice" and "Top Fin" brands from March 2010 through September 2013. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,868.69. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 0.25 points to 2,164.20. The Nasdaq composite slid 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped 9 cents to $43.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 32 cents to $44.43 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.28 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.39 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 13 cents, or 5 percent, to $2.75 per 1,000 cubic feet. Copyright 2016 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Yesterday AAPL: 105.71 -2.72 Report: Apple exploring digital glasses, could release its offering as early as 2018 Chance Miller - 18 hours ago @ChanceHMiller AAPL View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit According to a new report from Bloomberg, Apple is currently weighing the possibility of expanding into the field of digital glasses. While the report is sparse on details, it notes that the market could be particularly lucrative for Apple. Apple is weighing an expansion into digital glasses, a risky but potentially lucrative area of wearable computing, according to people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg News reports. The report goes on to explain that the idea is still in the “exploration phase,” but that digital glasses would connect wirelessly to a user’s iPhone and present media such as images in the user’s field of vision. The glasses may also take advantage of augmented reality, an area that Tim Cook has been very vocal about in the past. Apple has reportedly already reached out to potential suppliers about the idea, ordering small quantities of near-eye displays “from one supplier for testing.” The company, however, hasn’t ordered enough components to indicate a mass-production launch anytime soon. In fact, today’s report notes that should Apple decide to move forward with its digital glasses initiative, it won’t be until 2018 at the earliest that they’re released. Apple, however, is known to test many products and cancel them before they see the light of day, and that’s still a very real possibility with the digital glasses. Apple has acquired a handful of companies with expertise in augmented reality over recent years, including Metaio and several top experts in the field. When it comes to hardware for digital glasses, however, Apple will face many challenges. Fitting the necessary components for the device in a form factor that’s comfortable enough for 24/7 wearing is a problem that has plagued earlier offerings in this market. Though, as Apple has proved in the past, it doesn’t let the efforts of other companies dictate what it attempts to do. The news of Apple’s interest in digital glasses comes as Snapchat is experimenting with its own offering in the market. While they’re hard to come by and in the early stages of their lifecycle, the Spectacles have been met with mixed reactions from early reviewers but allow users to easily record and upload first-person video content.

USB Type-C: What You Need to Know Consumer Reports 18 hrs ago © Provided by Consumer Reports Smartphone and computer connectors have come in all shapes and sizes over the years. But now, a new connector called USB Type-C is emerging as the standard that all of your electronics devices may someday use. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 106.48 +0.77 +0.73% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 58.64 +0.52 +0.89% Bank of America Corporation BAC ▼ 19.88 -0.21 -1.02% Cisco Systems Inc CSCO ▲ 31.70 +0.33 +1.05% The USB Type-C got a lot of attention recently after Apple unveiled new MacBook Pro laptops that had ports only for the new connector (along with a 3.5mm port for audio, unlike new iPhones). Many consumers complained, so Apple recently slashed the prices of adapters needed to connect your old devices to the new laptops.  A lot of consumers are still confused about Type-C connectors and how they differ from all the other connectors out there. And, ready or not, USB Type-C devices, cables, and chargers will be all over electronics stores this holiday season. So here's what you need to know about Type-C connectors to avoid gadget confusion: What Is a USB Connector? USB stands for Universal Serial Bus. First introduced more than 20 years ago, USB has become the standard way to connect printers, scanners, storage devices, smartphones, and other gizmos to your computer and AC outlets. If you plug a keyboard into a computer, you're using a USB port. USB connectors come in all shapes and sizes. The largest, Type-A, is the flat rectangular plug that most people are familiar with (and are always plugging in upside down). The smallest is the 5-pin Micro-B.  What Is a Type-C Connector? Type-C simply refers to the shape and size of the connector. It is the newest USB and is much smaller and shorter than the traditional Type-A connector that most people still use. USB Type-C was introduced in 2014, but it really began to take off this year. It is now in Apple laptops, Google’s Pixel C tablet and Pixel phones, HTC and LG smartphones, and a handful of laptops from Dell and HP. Why Could It Beat Out Type-A? The problem with Type-A connectors is that they are too big and cumbersome for many new devices, especially smartphones. Type-C attempts to resolve that. What Are the Benefits of Type-C? Type-C plugs can do the work of any other USB connector, but they are small enough to fit into phones as well as computers. They’re about the same size as Micro-B and just half of the height of Type-A ports. That means electronics makers won't need to use the Micro, Mini, and other types of USB ports anymore. Ultimately, you should be able to pack fewer cables into your travel bag, leaving more room for snacks and cheap paperbacks. Here's another benefit: USB Type-C plugs are reversible—there's no upside down, so they'll work no matter how you plug them in. Do All Type-C Devices Work the Same? No. There's a lot of variety in how fast data can be transferred through a USB Type-C cable and how long it takes to charge your device. Type-C connectors will work with devices that support USB 2.0, USB 3.0, and USB 3.1, which are standards that control the speed at which data is transferred. The higher the number, the better the performance.  With USB 3.0, the maximum rate you can transfer data is 5 gigabits per second. The newest standard, USB 3.1, has a data rate up to twice as high, 10 gbps. Keep in mind that the slowest device controls the speed at which data moves. So if you're plugging your new laptop into a hard drive that follows USB 2.0, the max rate is just 480 megabits per second. Now, the truth is your files won’t move from one device to another quite as fast as the spec would suggest. So it’s best to consider these as relative numbers—USB 3.1 is up to twice as fast as USB 3.0, and up to 20 times as fast as USB 2.0. To add a big wrinkle to this discussion, the USB Type-C ports on new MacBook Pros double as Thunderbolt 3 ports. They support speeds of a whopping 40 gbps, and USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3 cables are interchangeable. You can usually identify USB 3.x devices by the blue plastic tabs inside the ports. What About Charging With Type-C? Like data, the amount of power that can flow through a Type-C connector depends on the device you're charging. The maximum is 100 watts—which is more than enough to charge most laptops. Other USB Type-C chargers may deliver less power, such as 45 or 60 watts. The power can flow in either direction, and data can flow right alongside it. Some USB ports and cables also support "alternate modes" that allow them to transmit data in other forms in addition to USB. That includes video and audio, which is why you can connect a DisplayPort monitor to the MacBook's Type-C port. And USB Type-C ports will soon be able to support a variation on the HDMI signals used to carry hi-def video. It’s called HDMI Alternate Mode (Alt Mode), and new devices that support it should be appearing next year. Are All Type-C Connectors the Same Quality? No. It depends on the manufacturer and whether the connectors comply with technical standards. Earlier this year there was a lot of buzz online about USB Type-C adapters wreaking havoc with people’s electronics. In those cases, the problem was poor product design and manufacturing, including cables that looked like USB Type-C but didn’t actually meet the standards. A Google engineer provided a public service by reviewing lots of different cables, and he’s still a great source of updates on USB Type-C news. Jeff Ravencraft, president and COO of USB-IF, says that sticking to well-known brands is probably a good idea, even if they cost a little more. "If you're buying your USB cable at a convenience store from a jar near the cash register and it costs less than the bottle of Coke you're also buying, you might want to think twice," he says.

"I smell a trade war. That is what I think this market has become all about," the "Mad Money" host said. Stocks initially rallied last week from the prospects of tax cuts and infrastructure and defense spending. On Monday, however, investors finally realized that President-elect Trump could crack down on trading partners who take advantage of the U.S. market without opening theirs, Cramer said. They are starting to see what it could mean if Trump does more than just talk tough about imports and dumping. Apple shares declined more than 2 percent on Monday, revealing the company's vulnerability to a Trump regime. "Trump has stated repeatedly that Apple should make more products here. Apple might be caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place ... I know the Chinese picked the wrong day to single out Apple," Cramer said. Carlo Allegri | Reuters A ship is unloaded in Miami, Florida. Harman International Industries CEO Dinesh Paliwal told Cramer on Monday that he is thrilled that Samsung Electronics is acquiring the company for $8 billion. "Frankly when we see that the integration of these two companies, when we put it together, this is really dynamite because it's so complimentary," Paliwal said. Shares of Harman skyrocketed 25 percent on the news that Samsung is acquiring the company for $112 per share, a nearly 28 percent premium over where it traded on Friday. It signaled a major push for Samsung into auto-related technology. Moving forward, Paliwal added that he plans to double down in cybersecurity. He believes that the threat has now extended into individuals homes, cars and personal devices. Cyberark Software's CEO Udi Mokady echoed the same sentiment to Cramer on Monday, stating that anything connected to the internet can be hacked. Cyberark is the Israeli cybersecurity company that helps companies to protect administrator and privileged accounts. These are the accounts frequently targeted by hackers with the aim of getting the "keys to the kingdom." Mokady commented on the changing landscape of the cybersecurity industry. "I think in the last couple of years we have seen a change. It's called the post-breach proactive security measure," Mokady said. "We are coming in ahead of time to help secure against these advanced attacks, but we are seeing that the modern day customer is thinking 'OK we will be breached, let's make sure it's contained.'" Ashlee Espinal | CNBC Dinesh Paliwal, Harman International CEO Bank stocks have also rebounded since the presidential election. Cramer noted that all of the signals were there for investors to buy the banks, starting when JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon purchased 500,000 shares in the open market for $26.6 million on Feb. 11. With JPMorgan closing at $79 on Monday, those shares are worth nearly $40 million. "Maybe Dimon was lucky. Maybe he's just good. Either way, he's obviously still optimistic about JPMorgan, or else he would have taken up Trump on his offer to be Treasury secretary," Cramer said. After years of outperformance, the stock of CVS Health suffered a 10-point straight decline last week, leading Jim Cramer to wonder if it is a broken company or merely a broken stock. "CVS has gone from a market darling to a total dog, as its once-vaunted pharmacy benefit manager business has become an albatross around its neck and the company loses share to its rivals," Cramer said. Shares of CVS tripled from the summer of 2011 to the summer of 2015, but then fell into free-fall. They closed at $76 on Monday. The business includes both its 7,800 retail pharmacies, and its pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) segments. "Maybe they can turn things around, but for now, CVS remains in the penalty box until we see them take concrete steps to lessen their dependence on what was once the golden goose, now just a turkey headed for a carving," Cramer said. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few caller favorite stocks: American Tower: "There was a piece out today that Sprint might merge with T-Mobile and everybody decided to dump on American Tower. My thinking is when you get this kind of a move, you've got to wait until tomorrow mid-day because there are so many sellers out there." AmSurg Corp: "This group is under pressure. Everything is so in flux in healthcare because of the new President that we just have to be on the sidelines. It's tough, because it looks so inexpensive. But sidelines is where we have to be."

If you are running Windows on your Mac - like I'm doing on my 2015 retina MacBook Pro because macOS is far too unoptimised to run on it - and it's using an Intel graphics chip, be sure to replace Apple's own Boot Camp graphics drivers with Intel's own latest drivers. The reason why you should do this is kind of fascinating. I noticed that while Windows as a whole ran quite fast and snappy - much more so than macOS with its crappy responsiveness, FPS drops, and hangs, even after reinstallations - two applications had responsiveness issues: Chrome and Microsoft Office. With Chrome, I chalked it up to #justchromethings and moved on. With Office though, I was perplexed. The past few versions of Office, including the current one, are fast, snappy, and instant. The days where Office applications were slow and cumbersome are long gone, even on lower-end hardware like the 2015 retina MacBook Pro. However, Office applications were slow, rendering was terrible, and things like dragging and resizing Office windows was literally a slide show - and I wanted to know why. I found out that on Windows, Microsoft Office uses its own rendering pipeline (framework? I'm not really sure what the accurate terminology is here), different from both Win32 and Metro applications. As it turns out, Office does its own check of the video card and driver to determine if hardware acceleration for Office should be disabled or not. By default, hardware acceleration is automatically disabled in Office programs if certain video card and video card driver combinations are detected when you start an Office program. If hardware acceleration is automatically disabled by the program, nothing indicates that this change occurred. Well, except that Office now runs like a total dog, of course. Apparently, the Office team maintains its own list of video card/driver combinations and keeps this list a secret. The list of video card/video driver combinations that trigger this automatic disabling of hardware graphics acceleration is not documented because the list is hard-coded in the Office programs and will be constantly changing as we discover additional video combinations that cause problems in Office programs. When I ran the Intel Driver Update Utility on my retina MacBook Pro to determine if the Apple-provided Intel graphics driver was up-to-date, the tool found a newer driver, but warned me that my OEM (Apple) had modified the already-installed driver, and that I would lose those customisations. I proceeded to download the new driver anyway, only to be hit by a very peculiar dialog upon trying to install the driver Intel told me was newer than what I had installed: the installer warned my I was installing an older driver than what I had installed. So, I decided to download the latest driver (the latest beta) manually, installed it, and this fixed not just Office, but also Chrome - which I find particularly baffling (maybe Chrome maintains a similar list?). The list that the Office team maintains is not of good drivers, but of bad drivers. For Office's hardware acceleration to fail, the driver needs to be on the list. This means that the combination "Apple-modified Intel graphics driver/Iris 6100" was, at some point, added to the list, triggering the disabling of hardware acceleration for Office. The combination "Intel's own graphics driver/Iris 6100" is not on the list. There's a number of possible explanations here, and I'm not really sure which one makes the most sense. Apple cares too little about Boot Camp users to intentionally cripple the Apple-supplied Intel drivers, so that's definitely not the cause. I also don't think the Intel driver magically improved a ton in the span of just a few weeks (there's only a few weeks of difference between the two versions, but I'm not trusting version numbers here) - but maybe it did? I honestly don't know. It's Intel's beta driver that isn't even signed by Microsoft, but somehow, the Office team tested it and removed it from their list? My first instinct was to think that because Apple had modified the driver, it wasn't on Microsoft's list - but since the list is for bad drivers, that makes no sense. The most logical explanation I have right now - suggested by Steven Troughton-Smith - is that Apple changes a few things in the Intel driver to optimise Windows' battery life, which in turn tune down the performance, causing the Office team to add this specific driver/video card combination to the list. I've been keeping an eye on battery life since installing the driver, but haven't noticed much of a difference. I don't think this little tip will be useful for a lot of people, but I really enjoyed trying to figure out what was going on.

Apple's AR smart glass can connect wirelessly to an iPhone to show notifications and also act as AR head-gear while playing games Rohit KVN   November 15, 2016 11:28 IST 1 Shares 1 Shares [Representational Image] Apple working on Snapchat’s rival smart eye-gear with AR capability; will it be launched with iPhone 8? In Picture: A woman looks at the screen of her mobile phone in front of an Apple logo outside its store in downtown Shanghai September 10, 2013.REUTERS After having reaped huge success in Apple Watch, Cupertino-based technology giant Apple has reportedly commenced work on a new smart wearable project with AR (Augmented Reality) feature. Apple has ordered limited quantities of near-eye displays from a supplier probably for development and evaluation purposes, Bloomberg reported citing people with insider knowledge. Why advertise with us? Related Apple iPhone 8 to come with drastically changed display panel Apple AirPods set to hit stores next week Also read:  Google Pixel can be hacked in under 60 seconds; should device owners be worried? The company plans to develop the smart glass that can connect wirelessly to an iPhone to show notifications and also act as AR head-gear while playing games. If launched, it will directly compete with Snapchat's glass dubbed as the Spectacles. It houses built-in camera with the ability to record 10-second videos and share them on social media sites. The news comes in the wake of stagnation of iPhone sales in developed markets of America and China. Earlier in July, Tim Cook, Apple CEO, during quarterly investors' meet had expressed interest in AR technology and possible funding of the project, after noticing the Pokemon Go's phenomenal response from public across the world. [Note: Pokemon Go is an AR game that makes use of the smartphone's camera and GPS location feature to project virtual Pokemon animals on the screen and the user have to collect these creatures by tossing a virtual Pokeball at them.] Furthermore, the year-2017 will mark Apple's 10th anniversary of the company's first iPhone. Reports have emerged that the company is leaving no stone unturned to make the iPhone 8's launch epic. With the new revelation, many believe Apple's secret smart glass project might figure in Tim Cook's keynote speech's last-announcement feature—"But there's one more thing" –made popular by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Will Apple smart glass really be the part of the "One more thing.." in iPhone 8 launch? Market analysts suggest, we should not keep our hopes up on Apple AR smart glass, just yet, because, Apple, in the past, has worked on many similar projects, but dumped them citing technical limitations and other reasons. For instance, Apple had reportedly set-up a huge team of highly qualified automobile experts to manufacture driver-less car under "Project Titan" banner. But, for reasons unknown, it has been kept under a back burner and has initiated work on automated driver software for cars. Read more: Apple puts the brakes on Project Titan car plans Even if Apple finds the smart glass worth releasing to the market, it will take its own sweet time, at least two years, to fine tune the features. So, we can expect the device to break cover only around 2018 or in the following year. It remains to be seen if Apple smart glass meets similar fate or not. Watch this space for more updates.

Photo: Reuters/Mike Segar/File Photo Reuters, San Francisco Apple's (AAPL.O) stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China. Apple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Facebook (FB.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), selling off since Tuesday's election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. In a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company's stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday's election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500's .SPX 1.16 percent advance. Adding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of "tit-for-tat" retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. "A batch of Boeing (BA.N) orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted," the op-ed said. China has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. Revenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple's September quarter, worse than the Americas' 7 percent decline. Apple's China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country's weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. Synovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump's campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Wednesday November 16, 2016 News Local News Larger / SmallerNight Mode Woman burned by charging iPhone 7 as she slept​ Tim Biggs 15 Nov 2016, 3:31 p.m. Woman warns others to keep their phones well away from their beds. A western Sydney woman says she has suffered severe burns after falling asleep on her charging iPhone 7. In a Facebook post, Melanie Tan Pelaez posted a picture of her red, blistered arm and issued a warning to others to keep their phones well away from their beds. "I recently purchased an Apple iPhone 7 and accidentally fell asleep with my arm on my phone whilst it was charging. I was woken up by sudden pain, pins and needles, numbness and shortness of breath" reads the post. "I have been an iPhone user since the beginning and have never had an issue or concern, so it's really scary and disappointing that something like this happened and can happen to someone else". Fortunately, she was apparently otherwise unharmed. Speaking to news.com.au, Pelaez explained that she had fallen asleep watching movies on her phone, and when she first woke up she wasn't sure what had caused the injury. "The hospital did a number of tests and told me the mark was a burn from a foreign object and told me to check around my bed to see what could be the cause of the injury", she said. "We matched the markings on my arm to the phone and charger". Pelaez acknowldeges that it could have been worse, but the painful injury has prompted multiple trips to the emergency room and she has met with a plastic surgeon to discuss options to deal with the scar. While handling or sleeping with a charging phone is not generally advisable — in fact Apple says so explicitly in its iPhone user guide— no reasonable user would expect the device to get so hot as to burn them. iPhones — and other smartphones besides — will shut off automatically if they overheat, due to being confined or being exposed to direct sunlight or another heat source. Apple's advice in its iPhone user guide. It's clear the company knows prolonged contact with a charging iPhone is a danger. If the iPhone was to blame for Pelaez's injury, it's unclear whether or not there was some kind of malfunction or other factors. While Apple has not made an official statement on the matter, Fairfax Media understands the company is in regular contact with Pelaez and is working directly with her to resolve the matter. Pelaez told news.com.au that Apple doesn't think the phone was to blame but has offered her a replacement, which she refused.  "I don't trust the device anymore," she said. Pelaez has been contacted, and this article will be updated if Fairfax Media receives further comment. smh.com.au The story Woman burned by charging iPhone 7 as she slept​ first appeared on Illawarra Mercury (Business).

Photo: Reuters Apple Inc.’s next hot product category may be...Google’s failed Glass project from 2013. The company is considering glasses that could combine digital information with what a person sees, my Bloomberg News colleagues reported late Monday. If the idea sounds familiar, it’s because of the similarity to technology behind Pokemon Go, the hit smartphone game of 2016. It was also the aim of Google Glass, before the company now called Alphabet Inc. put that project on hold for reprogramming. Apple’s possible foray into a similar field isn’t immediately inspiring. That’s not to say the company needs to be first in digital glasses or augmented reality—a catch-all term for technology that mixes real-world images with computerized information or digital images—to be the best. Apple has a track record of taking not-entirely-original and niche ideas and transforming them into something grander. Apple cribbed the idea for the Macintosh from unused research at Xerox. There were digital music players before the iPod. There were smartphones before the iPhone. Tablet computers preceded the iPad. In each case, however, Apple made technology that was better, easier to use—even magical. That Apple magic turned fringe products into mainstream ones, and reshaped the trajectory of the technology industry. That was the Steve Jobs version of Apple. After more than five years with Tim Cook at the helm, we’re still not sure if this Apple can make the leap from niche idea to world-changing technology. The first major product debut under Cook, the Apple Watch, hasn’t yet become an obvious hit. (To be fair, no other companies have found major success with wearable computers.) More ominously for Apple, it’s no longer the technology trendsetter. Yes, Apple has brought us better smartphone cameras and fingerprint sensors, but there are more areas where it has whiffed. Cook has been saying for five years that the TV industry is broken and needs an overhaul. He was right. Now the way people watch television is being upended by Netflix Inc., by “cord cutting” and by video on smartphones. Apple is barely a participant in that transformation. Apple is developing technology that could some day become the operating system for driverless cars, but it’s not obvious that the company has a clearer vision than Google, Baidu Inc., Uber Technologies Inc., Tesla Motors Inc. or other companies that are further ahead on autonomous driving. Apple bought Siri more than six years ago to bring voice-activated digital helpers to smartphones. Since then, Amazon.com Inc., Google and Microsoft Corp. have surged ahead. Apple may never make digital glasses, and if it does, it won’t happen before 2018. But the technology will progress anyway. Augmented reality is what Microsoft is doing with its HoloLens headset, and that product exists. So does Pokemon Go. The parent company of Snapchat created a specialized camera built into glasses that lets people record snippets of video from what they see. Snap Inc.’s Spectacles are no doubt less ambitious than any Apple plan for wearable computers on the face, but the point is that companies other than Apple are illuminating the path for the rest of the industry. Cook has said that the doubling of Apple’s research-and-development spending in the past three years was in part devoted to cooking up Apple’s next big product. It certainly could use a dose of inspiration. The company just closed its first fiscal year of declining revenue since 2001. Its major products—the iPhone, iPad and Mac computers—may never return to the growth they once had. We might look back at 2016 as a lull before a storm of ground-breaking product categories. More likely, though, Apple’s days as technology’s unrivaled innovation factory are over. Bloomberg Gadfly’s Tim Culpan contributed to this column.

Home News Reviews iPhone Apps Android Apps Windows Apps Top Mobiles Latest Mobiles Upcoming Mobiles PhoneRadar Explains Search PHONE FINDER COMPARE PHONES Phone News Apple explores the idea of Wearable Glass for iPhone like the Google Glass Google Glass was one of the most ambitious projects from Google back in the day. It surely did have some nifty little features that would make you go WOW on them! However, in reality, not many were interested in buying them and wearing them as a regular wearable. This started changing thereon, and the Google Glass project which was one of the most talked about device soon became dead. It is still a great concept to behold, but the not people were happy with the fact that a Glass is constantly seeing what you are doing. With that being said, it looks like Apple is going to work on something similar. We don’t have any confirmation on this. However, it does look like Apple is trying to enter the race which was once lead by Google. According to the new reports which we have here, it appears that the Cupertino Giant has purchased some of the components for testing purposes. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier. Do make a note here that, they haven’t purchased enough which indicates a mass-production yet. Hence our best guess is that they have done so for the sake of testing. Well, it is not a bad thing by any means. If the company is trying to test out something, then there is a huge potential for a possible success here, and maybe someday we will see a product from them. On the other hand, it is nothing new in the world of technology that every another day, some or the idea is explored. But that doesn’t mean that we will see a final product. In either case, don’t expect anything from the company anytime soon now. If at all the company decides to make these, we probably will not be seeing them until 2018 or even more. With that being said, let’s not speculate on this anymore since it is too early in the day to do that. If in case you remember, Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, stated that AR would take a while since there are lots of challenges on the way. However, once it happens, it will happen in a big way, and everyone will wonder how they lived without it all these years just the way you might think about smartphones now. Not the strongest of words here, but still it might give you a hint that Apple is indeed trying out their luck with the AR, etc. Who knows, maybe one day we will see a Google Glass type of product from them which will have some AR capabilities as well. Well, as mentioned earlier, it is still too early to speculate around this and hence let’s leave it here and continue speculating around something which is more likely to happen soon like the iPhone 8. We have already covered a bunch of rumors about the iPhone 8 like a bezel-less display. Stay tuned for more info on this and other news from Apple and more.

Listen Listening... / Donald Trump took direct shots at some of the biggest tech companies during the presidential campaign. When Apple wouldn't help the FBI unlock a phone used by a terrorist, he suggested boycotting the company. In a Fox News interview, he lashed out against Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. "The politicians in Washington don't tax Amazon like they should be taxed," Trump said. "He's got a huge antitrust problem because he's controlling so much." For his part, Bezos once tweeted he'd like to reserve Trump a seat on his commercial space rocket. Besides the direct attacks on tech companies — Trump's protectionist trade policies, threats to impose tariffs and deport millions of immigrants, and his affiliations with groups widely seen as racist all put him at odds with most tech company leaders. "We try as much as possible to embrace and take advantage of the fact that the diverse perspectives bring better innovation, better ideas, and this campaign very much has at times been against that set of principles," says Aaron Levie, the CEO of Box, a company that helps businesses securely share and store information. Levie supported Hillary Clinton, and he says he will continue to work and lobby for what he believes. "Whether that's LGBTQ rights, whether that's having fair immigration policies, whether that's racial or gender equality issues," he says, "all of these topics are incredibly pertinent and relevant to building out a technology company and those are the things that we want to ensure are protected and maintained going forward." Jason Johnson, the CEO of August Home, which develops technology for connected homes, was alarmed at Trump's stance against Apple. "To pressure those of us in technology to give away private information without, you know, proper process and proper procedures to get that information concerns me," Johnson says. "And we will certainly push back on anything that is shoved on us." Yet, Johnson and others in the tech community who did not vote for Trump are looking for common ground. "I really like how he is trying to increase jobs inside the country," says Ravi Puvvala, the CEO of Savari, a company that makes technology for driverless cars. Puvvala is aware that driverless cars are likely to put the millions of people who drive for a living out of work. But he hopes he and others in his industry can work with the new administration to create jobs. "If we actually change our lifestyle in terms of how to become the creators of the new technology we create a completely new workforce," he says. Puvvala says he actually admires Trump's smarts as an entrepreneur. And he isn't convinced Trump meant everything he said while he was running for office. "I think he is going to see more the practical approach of what it means to sustain the technology growth within the country," Puvvala says. There is one Silicon Valley voice that has President-elect Trump's ear — Peter Thiel, an early investor in Facebook and PayPal, was a vocal Trump supporter and he will be part of Trump's transition team. And there may be another way to get Trump's attention, Box CEO Levie says. "First, start by tweeting at him," Levie says. "That appears to be an open line of communication that he's supportive of." Twitter does seem to be one tech company that President-elect Trump likes. In a recent interview with 60 Minutes, he had nice words to say about it and other forms social media. Trump says it's how he won the election and he will continue to use it. Copyright 2016 NPR. To see more, visit NPR.

It’s pretty but can’t get any real work done. It’s incompatible with (fill in the blank). It’s overpriced. Apple’s gouging. You can buy a (PC/Android/whatever) for $500/$1500 less! Apple doesn’t care about professionals,” White writes. “Nobody’s going to buy this thing. Jony Ive has lost his mind. Apple’s CEO should be fired. And on and on and on it goes… The latest case of Apple-fueled angst of course is the recently-announced 2016 MacBook Pro.” “Why does this startling disconnect between the punditry and the actual behavior of most Apple customers remind me of another notable disconnect in the news lately? I’m talking, of course, about our recent U.S. presidential election,” White writes. “Listening to the pundits throughout the entire campaign season, over and over again we were assured Donald Trump had no chance of winning. He was a buffoon, an ignoramus, a total jerk. Maybe even Hitler. No way was he going to win the Republican primary. OK, well he just did that. But don’t worry folks, no way is he going to win the general election. OK, well he just did that. Oops.” Read more in the full article here.

Open Your Eyes Thursday, November 10, 2016 - 10:48 pm · Reply @penisblood72 All you have to do is look at AAPL. It’s low value is a harbinger of exactly where Apple stands today. They have an incompetent, greedy CEO, as well as unbuyable, underpowered yet overpriced products. This greedy c*cks*cker has the nerve to sell you a machine without a charging adapter… THAT’S EXTRA! The new MBP will sit and rot with the rest of incompetent Cook’s other worthless products. And if you got your mouth off Cook’s wrinkled sack long enough, you moron, you would already know this. peterblood71 Thursday, November 10, 2016 - 10:53 pm · Reply Your own hillbilly post indicts you as a complete homophobe low class moron with zero credibility.

I don’t have a problem with most of the changes and like a few of them. Not including at least one legacy USB type A connector means that 99+% of all USB devices will not work with it. Really Apple? All they had to do was include a single port for a couple years and then go all-in with USB3. Why can’t I buy a new MBP and a new iPhone and connect one to the other (out of the box)? beosjim Thursday, November 10, 2016 - 5:19 pm · Reply I guess I should have said that if I buy Apple’s newest computer, I cannot connect its newest iPhone to it (without an extra purchase). If I go buy the newest Dell, or whatever, I ~CAN~ connect Apple’s newest iPhone to it. chrish1961 Thursday, November 10, 2016 - 5:49 pm · Reply The iPhone has wifi. The MacBook Pro has wifi. Case closed. macnificentseven48 Thursday, November 10, 2016 - 6:51 pm · Reply I think they mean physically connect without the need for dongles. If it’s not the way they want it to be then Apple is said to be in the wrong. Some people are not even aware they can sync to iTunes over WiFi. Besides, it’s easier to slander Apple because everyone does it. I believe there’s a growing cottage industry of slamming Apple products. Youtube is filled with irate posters of Apple fail videos. I see far more Apple iPhone fail videos than Galaxy Note 7 fail videos. It’s possible there are simply a lot of people craving a need for attention and slamming a top company is a good way to get it. It would be interesting to find out if other companies’ products get such a huge amount of criticism. beosjim Thursday, November 10, 2016 - 8:43 pm · Reply Exactly. I once had to put my iPhone into Recovery Mode to use it again. That requires a cable. I also mass load photos from the iPhone via the cable and perform occasional local backups via the cable. It is set to sync via Wifi. I have jpg and RAW images from the phone, a good P&S and three DSLR cameras. My Pictures (for Photos and Lightroom) total 161 GB. I am not putting that in the cloud. Some photographs are way too valuable to not maintain some control over them. $$$ If they simply kept one legacy USB port, my phone would connect, my printer would connect, my Time Machine would connect, my external drive, flash drives, card reader, my iPad, the remote from my Apple TV (to charge), the Apple TV itself (if needed, to restore), my Superdrive, etc. Dongle needed. This is for a system with a 1 TB SSD, 1 TB carbon copy HDD and a 2.5 TB Time Machine. My data is important. Col. Panic Thursday, November 10, 2016 - 11:53 pm · Reply Wifi sync has been horrendously buggy. I’ve talked with AppleCare reps and Apple Geniuses who’ve said they gave up on it years ago and only back up via USB. They also say not to use iCloud for backups because lots of data is not actually backed up that way (and not just apps that can be re-downloaded). If you live much of your life on your iPhone, relying on the slimmed-down iCloud backup is not sufficient. listcatcher Friday, November 11, 2016 - 1:26 am · Reply They gave up on it years ago? In tech? Do you think it just might be time to revisit it these “years” later? Grrrilla Friday, November 11, 2016 - 8:55 am · Reply The new MacBook Pro can’t charge any iPhone on the planet without a dongle or a separately-purchased cable. Case closed. It wasn’t so much to ask for. Reality Check Thursday, November 10, 2016 - 7:43 pm · Reply If you don’t like WiFi then there is BlueTooth. I hardly ever connect my iPhone to my MBP. They both connect to the iCloud and are pretty much always in synch. Davewrite Thursday, November 10, 2016 - 5:34 pm · Reply like I said before: as an aapl investor I really hope MBP sells well. but we’ll never know if Apple had kept some feature, somehow enabled more than 16 GB RAM for those who want it whether it would have SOLD MORE… (or on the other hand if it cost more sold less) others have pointed out that some are upgrading from the MB AIR (critics saying the new MBP is a lux MB AIR) and MB (as they want more ports) to the MBP . So we have to look at quarterly reports on total sales and profits of all MacBooks together. I have 12.9 iPad Pro (besides an older MBP and Mac Pros), at that time of launch the iPad Pro was hit, backordered etc. yet at the end (unfortunately) the TOTAL iPad sales for several quarters DROPPED. because the other iPads weren’t updated. so I hope the new MBP does really really well but as usual I want Apple to focus more laser like on products, too many Macs like Pro, Mini , iMac need updates and better features (no soldered RAM in the Mini, upgradable GPUs in the pro , more power video in iMac so you can put a second monitor with better fps etc). Gaelic1 Thursday, November 10, 2016 - 5:44 pm · Reply I wonder just how many of those negative posts are from the competition? Anything to make the perception that Apple appears wrong would benefit them tremendously and of course the troll to be recognized. Just wondering…… jecastej Friday, November 11, 2016 - 1:58 pm · Reply If the MBP needs no more than 16GB of RAM I expect Apple to come forward publicly and explain how and why from an engineering perspective they did it and obviously I expect Apple or any other company with such a big claim to provide enough numbers and case scenarios where Pro users on mayor and most areas won’t benefit from having more than 16GB of memory in a mobile computer or on any other system designed for professional use. Also, if true why stop at 16GB and not at 8GB?. What justify 8 or 16 also justify 32 and more. The MBP has no a major new improvement or trick on memory use. Those swap tricks have been used in the pass and also on PCs but to this day no company says the computer world won’t need more than a certain amount of memory in the present or in the future. pbiphoto Thursday, November 10, 2016 - 6:01 pm · Reply Yep, they are among us… trondude Thursday, November 10, 2016 - 6:37 pm · Reply “Adapt with adapters” BillD Thursday, November 10, 2016 - 9:56 pm · Reply “Adaptors use adapters” yojimbo007 Thursday, November 10, 2016 - 9:26 pm · Reply If the author believes Apple has not ignored/abondoned their true Pro users… he lives somewhere in the lala land….. Herself Thursday, November 10, 2016 - 11:33 pm · Reply Apple has not abandoned or ignored their pro users, not quite. Far worse, they have insulted us by rolling out products they deem to be adequate for pro use, but which do not pass muster. They ought to have checked with us first before finalising the specs. That they did not, indicates that they do not value us, or trust us. Thus we have come to feel as though we were kicked to the curb. 7thheavenband Friday, November 11, 2016 - 1:43 am · Reply https://www.change.org/p/apple-board-of-directors-remove-tim-cook-as-ceo-of-apple yojimbo007 Friday, November 11, 2016 - 2:58 pm · Reply and replace him with who? when you find a more qualified and experienced and availible person ..please let me know.. 7thheavenband Friday, November 11, 2016 - 1:41 am · Reply I feel if we can remove Tim Cook from the leadership role, the company will thrive as a faster pace… at least maybe they will start to pay attention to their customers… their LOYAL long-term customers, who make a lot of their content they like to appease their eco-system.

If (and I repeat, IF), anybody needs to go it’s Ive. He had a home run with the original iMac and some of the later ones, but his obsession with ‘thin’ is ruining what was a good product. Try to use a current iMac for anything other than simple word processing or internet work and you run up against heat issues. Throw in the non-upgradeable form factor and the obsession with ‘thin’ laptops and for many people Macs are no longer a value proposition. In my view it’s only Win10s cavalier approach to individual privacy that keeps a lot of people from switching as there are plenty of decent quality reasonably priced machines around. Mark Ryder Friday, November 11, 2016 - 4:32 am · Reply I don’t have any problem with change I’m just waiting for it to happen in a substantial way so I can really get all i need done in one major purchase rather than the long gapes between slow and minor refinements and i don’t see enough improvement on the hardcore power processing. I know its not Apples fault but the mac pro could fill this gap easily if hey upgraded it. The mac pro could do massive processing leaps (if it was upgraded) where as the Macbook Pro as cool as it is, is at its design and processing limit right now and the thinning and the current refinements are just that ; refinements! Is it enough to upgrade? maybe for pre 2013 macbook pros users but next years Rev2 will have the ability (via the new processor) to take more ram and hopefully be more powerful for pro users that need it. The grape is updating the Mac Pro would fill the gap and allow Pro users to still buy and get on with serious work in one big purchase and still buy a more ramped up mac book pro when its actually more ramped up in the power department. my 2013 is not that different from this 2016 version its 1tb 16gb 15″ and so i need something like a Mac Pro that can blow away in processors and faster ram which you can not do on the current laptops. Shadowself Friday, November 11, 2016 - 9:21 am · Reply Yes, the new MBPs are selling well. There was pent up demand. Once that pent up demand is satisfied and sales have to rely on people who don’t *need* to upgrade a 2-5 year old Mac laptop what then? These people claiming that the new MBPs are great machines that everyone should buy and must be buying because first week sales are great don’t remember one simple thing: the Power Mac G4 Cube. That sold very well it’s first few weeks. Hell, it sold reasonably well its first month or so. Let us know what the sales figures are for the new MBPs next February after the rest of the personal computer community starts announcing their Kaby Lake based systems. mxnt41 Friday, November 11, 2016 - 10:30 am · Reply I have no problem with the new MacBook. They’re not a product I will buy, but they seem great. I’m not a Mac Pro customer either, and even if it is only a niche market there is a market for such a machine and those customers have to make a decision between sticking with outdated hardware to keep the MacOS environment or switching to Windows to get the latest specs. The longer it goes the harder it might be to justify staying with Mac for many of them. With all Apple’s resources it should be easy to put together a machine designed purely for being top spec. Those customer don’t need it to be the smallest, the lightest, they want it to be the most powerful AND they will pay for it.

It’s claimed that she used her position of confidence with Ms. Park to put pressure on major conglomerates like Samsung, SK group and Lotte to download millions of euro to foundations controlled by her,” SamMobile reports. “The police are now looking into claims made by local media last week that Samsung had transferred 2.8 million euro to Widec Sports in Germany which is controlled by Ms. Choi.” Read more in the full article here.

No seriously! I’ve been renovating one of my houses into a cafeteria + bookstore + gallery + AV theatre (and an Aerospace firm on the 3rd floor). Local Samsung group thought it best to provide me with a VRF based central AC solution for the entire building. My manager tried to dissuade them at the front gate by sharing how I felt about Samsung. The rep got curious as to why I don’t care for anything Samsung and requested for an audience. I felt he was earnest in his curiosity, so laid on him how I really felt about the Samsung world order. He came back the next day with two of his chief engineers (wonderfully jolly and competent folks them) and almost convinced me that they were a serious contender with a solid system for a somewhat reasonable price. Dagnabbit! This was on the same day as the Trump card victory and here I was set off to do some soul searching by Samsung reps of all folks. Last evening on a lovely dinner date at a Korean restaurant (completely coincidental), I dropped on my wife that I am considering Samsung for our central AC system. She seemed shocked and this morning after breakfast she told me that I shouldn’t waiver from my principles. Rest of my other houses we rely mostly Siemens but they don’t do central AC here. This is why one pays top dollars for a great wife . So, I asked Siri to find me a local Daikin rep. Had a chat with them and they told me that they don’t compete with Samsung pricing as per company policy. The local rep actually said, Samsung stole the VRV technology that they invented and call it VRF. They are but thieves and their product quality reflects that. Wow! So, I chuckled that they were preaching to the choir here. Anyway, we are meeting after lunch today and whether or not I can afford Daikin, I’ve made up my mind, I’m keeping my house Samsung and Google free. I can ill-afford this trade-off. chefpastry Friday, November 11, 2016 - 3:19 am · Reply Samsung steals tech from everyone.

Apple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com, Facebook and Alphabet, selling off since Tuesday’s election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. In a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company’s stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday’s election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500’s .SPX 1.16 percent advance. Adding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of “tit-for-tat” retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,” the op-ed said. China has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. Revenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple’s September quarter, worse than the Americas’ 7 percent decline. Apple’s China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country’s weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. Synovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump’s campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term. “You just don’t just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements,” Morgan said.

Photo: Reuters San Francisco: Apple Inc. is weighing an expansion into digital glasses, a risky but potentially lucrative area of wearable computing, according to people familiar with the matter. While still in an exploration phase, the device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and may use augmented reality, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a secret project. Apple has talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers, according to people familiar with those discussions. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing, the people said. Apple hasn’t ordered enough components so far to indicate imminent mass-production, one of the people added. Should Apple ultimately decide to proceed with the device, it would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, another person said. The Cupertino, California-based company tests many different products and is known to pivot, pause, or cancel projects without disclosing them. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. Chief executive officer Tim Cook is under pressure to deliver new products amid slowing sales of the iPhone, which accounts for two-thirds of Apple’s revenue. In July, he expressed enthusiasm for augmented reality after the rise of Pokemon Go, a location-based game that uses the technology. AR, as it’s known, adds images and other digital information to people’s view of the real world, while virtual reality completely surrounds them with a computer-generated environment. The glasses may be Apple’s first hardware product targeted directly at AR, one of the people said. Cook has beefed up AR capabilities through acquisitions. In 2013, Apple bought PrimeSense, which developed motion-sensing technology in Microsoft Corp.’s Kinect gaming system. Purchases of software start-ups in the field, Metaio Inc. and Flyby Media Inc., followed in 2015 and 2016. “AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this,” Cook said in a 26 July conference call with analysts. “We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.” Apple has AR patents for things like street view in mapping apps. It was also awarded patents for smart glasses that make use of full-fledged virtual reality. Apple is unlikely to leverage VR in a mass-consumer product, Cook suggested in October. “I can’t imagine everyone in here getting in an enclosed VR experience while you’re sitting in here with me, but I could imagine everyone in here in an AR experience right now,” he said during an onstage discussion in Utah. Apple’s challenge is fitting all the technology needed into a useful pair of internet-connected glasses that are small and sleek enough for regular people to wear. Google’s attempt to develop internet-connected eye wear flopped in part because its tiny battery ran out quickly. Google Glass, as it was called, also suffered a privacy backlash and poor public perception of its external design. After that disappointment, technology companies largely turned their immediate focus to VR and away from AR. Google recently introduced a VR headset alongside its Pixel smartphone, and Facebook Inc.’s Oculus VR unit has teamed up with Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd on a similar headset. Microsoft has the most public AR offering. Its HoloLens product shows holographic images in a user’s field of vision. Apple’s effort may be more difficult because the chips, batteries and other components that will be available in a year or two may still not be small enough and powerful enough to build slim glasses capable of handling compelling AR experiences. However, given time, technical challenges may play to Apple’s strengths. The company specializes in turning technology that others have struggled with into easy-to-use devices for the masses. For example, Apple simplified fingerprint technology into an unlocking mechanism for the iPhone and took touch screens mainstream with the original iPhone. Augmented reality “is going to take a while, because there are some really hard technology challenges there, but it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it,” Cook said last month. “Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today.” Bloomberg Mark GurmanAlex WebbIan King Topics: Applesmart glasseswearablesiPhonesTim Cook More from this Section Vivo to double India manufacturing capacity by next year Twitter to upgrade some features to thwart cyber-bullying Religare Enterprises to write-off Rs794 crore Gail India Q2 profit up 179% on cost savings, petrochem PNB Housing Finance Q2 profit up 78% at Rs137 crore Editor's Picks To curb conversion of black money into white, govt turns to indelible ink marks Tata Motors independent directors refuse to pick sides in Tata vs Cyrus Mistry fight Demonetization is a hollow move Reliance Jio’s entry a boost for Ericsson, Truecaller and Lava Mobiles A new economic paradigm is being fashioned First Published: Tue, Nov 15 2016. 09 01 AM IST Latest News Rahul Gandhi attacks Narendra Modi over long bank queues Press Council of India to ink alliance with South Asian media councils EC raises concerns about using indelible ink to track cash depositors Editor's Picks To curb conversion of black money into white, govt turns to indelible ink marks Tata Motors independent directors refuse to pick sides in Tata vs Cyrus Mistry fight Demonetization is a hollow move Latest News Rahul Gandhi attacks Narendra Modi over long bank queues Press Council of India to ink alliance with South Asian media councils EC raises concerns about using indelible ink to track cash depositors India to get 4 P-8I reconnaissance aircraft starting 2020 Parliament set to witness furore over demonetization drive Mint On Sunday The priceless legacy of P.L.

Chief Executive Tim Cook, who has been struggling with a slowdown in iPhone sales in recent quarters, said earlier this year that the company would continue to invest a lot into augmented reality. Apple, the world’s largest technology company, has ordered a small number of near-eye displays for testing but has not obtained enough for production on a larger scale, the report added. Apple declined to comment. The move would make Apple the latest tech company to venture into wearable glasses. Alphabet Inc’s discontinued its own wearable glass headset, Google Glass, and closed the social media account linked to the device earlier this year, ending its attempt to popularize the expensive devices with consumers. The device received plenty of attention when it was launched in 2012, but quickly ran into problems with its awkward appearance and privacy concerns over video recording. Snap, an $18 billion company which makes the popular messaging app Snapchat, also launched its own video-camera sunglasses last week.

The tech giant is believed to be in the final stages of negotiating a deal that will see it open a new $50 million megastore in Melbourne's iconic Federation Square, almost a decade after it first started looking for an appropriate central city site, industry sources say.

Apple has been in lengthy and secretive negotiations with Federation Square's management and the state government to take over and demolish the Yarra building in the square. The global tech heavyweight plans to replace the unique "deconstructivist" metal building with a new $50 million see-through glass structure that will house its first Asia Pacific stand-alone megastore. Apple has unsuccessfully been looking for a shop site in the central city for nearly a decade. Photo: AP Apple's plans for Federation Square may prove controversial. Various buildings in the Square are leased to different businesses, usually to public or cultural organisations in line with the Square's philosophy of being a government-owned public space. Advertisement One of the Square's major tenants is public broadcaster SBS, another is ACMI - the Australian Centre for Moving Image. One of its main drawcards is its giant screen which can beam live events to thousands of watchers.  Demolishing one of the existing buildings, originally designed by LAB Architecture Studio, is also likely to upset Melbourne's close-knit architecture community. State tourism and major events minister John Eren would not comment. Tenants in the Yarra building include the Koorie Heritage Trust, which still has four years to run on a five-year lease, and Italian restaurant Il Pom which runs a busy eatery on the ground floor. Federation Square's unique postmodern design and paved open spaces were highly controversial when first made public in 1997 after an international design competition. It has since proved extremely popular as a gathering place for major events, a meeting point for tourists and locals, and has a track record as one of the city's most loved public open spaces. Apple has unsuccessfully been looking for a shop site in the central city for nearly a decade. Its store requirements are so onerous that few buildings match. Apple has three existing Melbourne stores, but they are based in Chadstone, Doncaster and Southland shopping centres. None are in the central city shop like its flagship Sydney locations, one in George Street and the other at Bondi Junction. The company requires at least 1500 to 3000 square metres of floor space for its purpose-built shop fitouts which often cost up to $15 million. Apple's integrated selling approach with roving sales staff and stands displaying the latest technology must-haves, requires a minimum of 400 sq m of internal space free of any columns. A stand-alone glass structure in such a prominent location would prove a magnet for its customers. Apple declined to comment. Federation Square chief executive Jonathan Tribe was contacted for comment. Fed Square Pty Ltd is a company wholly owned by State Trustees Limited as custodian trustee on behalf of the State of Victoria. Its annual report shows it returned a net profit of $7.2 million to state government coffers in 2016. Advertisement 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

The glasses, the report says, would connect wirelessly to an iPhone, and would display images in the wearer's field of view. The glasses may use augmented reality technology to overlay digital imagery over real-world imagery. Such a product would be consistent with Tim Cook's statements about Apple's preference for a heads-up augmented reality experience. Bloomberg says Apple has already talked to potential suppliers about manufacturing the Apple-designed glasses, and has already ordered some test batches. But the orders aren't big enough to indicate an imminent mass market production.  If Apple decides to go ahead with the product, the glasses wouldn't appear until 2018, Bloomberg's sources say. And, of course, the glasses are just one of possibly hundreds of potential products Apple is experimenting with, and they may never see the marketplace. Apple declined to comment for Bloomberg's story. MS Apple 11.15.16 | 11:40 am Prosper CEO resigns, another sign of marketplace lending woes  This past spring, Prosper Marketplace CEO Aaron Vermut volunteered to forego his salary for a year, as the online lender, once valued at $1.9 billion, prepared to lay off 28% of its workforce. Investor demand for Prosper's loans had evaporated and losses were mounting.  But that sacrificial gesture wasn't enough. Vermut resigned as CEO last week, the company said Monday, and will be replaced by CFO David Kimball.  The news is yet another sign that online lending companies remain in turbulent waters following the scandal that engulfed market leader Lending Club in May.  AOC prosper Seize the day!

The battle cry seems to have resonated, as Bloomberg reports that news organizations are seeing a marked increase in contributions and subscriptions.  At the New York Times, reports Bloomberg, "subscriptions have risen at four times their normal rate since election day." More, traffic has been ballooning. The Wall Street Journal, too, has been seeing an influx in subscriptions. Meanwhile, the nonprofit ProPublica was flooded with donations Monday.  Since winning the election last week, Donald Trump has continued his attacks on the media, in particular the Times, which he criticized on Twitter.  Will the spiked interest in well-reported news continue or will the fad inevitably die down as people return to their Facebook-oriented lives? As a journalist, I certainly hope it continues, but who knows! CW john oliver 11.15.16 | 11:07 am Tech stocks rebound after post-election slump Shares of Apple and Microsoft are starting to climb again, reversing a days-long trend in declining share prices since Trump's election.

Tech shares rebound from a post-election slump to boost the Nasdaq 100 https://t.co/mT7LNmReJp pic.twitter.com/KY7JLZ341O— Bloomberg (@business) November 15, 2016 LD donald trump 11.15.16 | 10:38 am Analysts discover backdoor in some U.S. phones that sent texts, call logs to China According to a report by the New York Times, a security firm called Kryptowire has discovered preinstalled software on some Android phones that sent data such as text messages, call logs, contacts, and geo-location to a Chinese server. The developer of the software, Shanghai Adups Technology, says the program runs on more than 700 million devices, from phones, cars, and other hardware. As of now the most affected are international consumers and owners of disposable and prepaid phones, but one Miami-based phone manufacturer, BLU Products, says at least 120,000 of its phones contained the bug, which it has fixed via software update. Adups apparently designed the backdoor to help an undisclosed Chinese phone manufacturer monitor user behavior, but the program ended up on American phones anyway. The Times points out that Adups lists two China-based largest phone makers, ZTE and Huawei, as distribution partners–both of which have been trying to make inroads in the U.S., and would likely see those efforts scrutinized if either is linked to the backdoor revelation. JJM 11.15.16 | 10:35 am Average monthly earnings for gig economy workers are in decline  Sharing economy platforms like TaskRabbit and Uber are struggling to retain their workers—and now, we have a better idea as to why. Average monthly earnings for labor platform contractors have fallen 6% since June 2014, according to a new analysis by the JPMorgan Chase Institute.  The declining wages are due in part to increased competition, which has led to lower prices. (No wonder over half of Uber drivers quit within a year.) However, the change in wages differs dramatically from city to city. In Atlanta, for example, average monthly earnings dropped 10% between June 2016 and June 2015, landing at $647. But in Los Angeles, over the same period, earnings rose 14% to $960.  [Photo: Flickr user Renate Dodell] AOC airbnb 11.15.16 | 10:09 am Verizon continues IoT investment spree, buying LQD WiFi  IoT has become a major priority for Verizon, which sees potential for growth in layering services for connected devices over its network infrastructure. To that end, the telecom giant yesterday acquired LQD WiFi, a New York-based startup that makes kiosk systems for "smart" cities.  Kiosks providing Wi-Fi and neighborhood information have become popular with city planners, who see the systems as a way to provide internet access and engage with residents. Verizon's other investments in urban IoT infrastructure include devices and services for lighting, security, and traffic management.  AOC verizon 11.15.16 | 9:00 am Morning intel: Tinder adds non-binary gender options, Twitter expands “mute” and hateful conduct reporting  • Google, Facebook, Facebook, Amazon, and other Silicon Valley companies have written a letter to President-elect Trump asking that he support encryption and immigration reform.  • Twitter just rolled out an update to its mute feature and improved on its reporting tools for hateful conduct, as part of the company's continued efforts to make Twitter a safer space.  • In a similar vein, Tinder tweaked its app to better address the needs of transgender users. The "gender" field in the app will now include non-binary gender identification terms, as well as a write-in option; users can also opt to keep their gender private.  • Both Google and Facebook have taken steps to combat fake news following the election, by barring fake news sites from using AdSense and The Facebook Audience Network, their respective advertising businesses.  • Apple is reportedly looking into creating digital glasses with augmented reality tech, according to Bloomberg.  PM 11.15.16 | 7:54 am Google, Facebook, and others ask Trump to support encryption and immigration reform The Internet Association, which has more than 40 members including Google, Twitter, Facebook, and Amazon, has penned a letter urging President-elect Trump to implement stronger reforms on government surveillance programs, support net neutrality, and "expand and improve the green card program" for immigrants, reports the Verge. Trump was particularly harsh on tech companies on the campaign trail, notably calling out Apple for not helping the government unlock iPhones in specific law enforcement cases. The letter ends stating, "The internet industry looks forward to engaging in an open and productive dialogue" with the president-elect. That's a more congenial tone than what most of the tech leaders had for Trump before the election, when 100 of them signed a letter saying a Trump presidency would be a "disaster for innovation." MG donald trump 11.15.16 | 6:02 am Smugglers are using Facebook to sell ivory A report from the Wildlife Justice Commission (WJC) shows that smugglers in Vietnam are using Facebook groups to illegally sell ivory, rhino horn, and tiger parts, reports the Guardian. The animal parts are being sold in private Facebook groups that require approval from a group admin before a member can join. In all, $53.1-million worth of ivory and other animal parts have been sold in the last 18 months.  MG Facebook 11.15.16 | 1:30 am WhatsApp adds a feature: video calling Facebook owns two messaging services. One, Facebook Messenger, does a ton of stuff. The other, WhatsApp, is famous for sticking to the basics—which, rather than hurting it, has helped it rack up more than a billion active users. But now WhatsApp is adding something: the ability to make video calls. The feature is especially logical given that the app is widely used by folks to stay in touch with distant friends and family in other countries. (The app introduced voice calls last year.) Video calling is rolling out "in the coming weeks" and will be available in WhatsApp's versions for iOS, Android, and Windows.   HM Whatsapp 11.14.16 | 11:27 pm Following Google, Facebook also moves to ban fake news sites from using its ad network In the face of widespread criticism that the proliferation of fake news posts on Facebook played a role in misleading voters and impacting the presidential election, on Monday evening the company banned fake news from using its ad network. The Facebook Audience Network is used by third-party sites and apps to display ads to users, with Facebook getting a portion of the ad revenue. With today's move, Facebook is adding such fake news sites to its blacklist of misleading and illegal sites that aren't allowed to use the ad network. The step follows Google, which earlier today banned fake news sites from using its AdSense ad-selling software. "Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance," a company spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal.  MB Facebook 11.14.16 | 9:34 pm Google will prohibit fake news sites from using AdSense Fake news sites are about to run into trouble with Google. Alphabet, Google's parent company has announced plans to prohibit fake news sites from using the company's ad-selling software, AdSense, which is how many of those sites make revenue. According to the Wall Street Journal, Google is updating its policies to prohibit its ads from being displayed "on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose," as well as those that distribute fake news. While preventing those sites from using AdSense will not necessarily curb the sharing of misinformation, the move will hurt those site's ability to make money, possibly forcing them to close. The spread of fake news has become a huge post-election topic, with Facebook, in particular, coming under fire for spreading fake information during the months leading up to the presidential election. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has previously said that the idea the fake news influenced the election is "crazy." However, BuzzFeed reports that a group of Facebook employees have reportedly created a secret internal task force to investigate and perhaps offer a solution to the issue.

Apple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Facebook (FB.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), selling off since Tuesday's election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. In a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company's stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday's election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500's (.SPX) 1.16 percent advance. Adding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of "tit-for-tat" retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. "A batch of Boeing (BA.N) orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted," the op-ed said. Revenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple's September quarter, worse than the Americas' 7 percent decline. Apple's China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country's weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. Synovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump's campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term. "You just don't just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements," Morgan said. | PRINT | RSS Add Comment SINA English is the English-language destination for news and information about China.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The stock market’s post-election bifurcation sharpened Monday as technology shares extended their worst performance since the start of the bull market on speculation Donald Trump’s trade and immigration policies will translate into lower earnings. Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. led the S&P 500 Information Technology Index down 1.7 percent for the biggest retreat since September. The group stands out as the only industry that normally benefits from a rising economy not to rally on speculation Trump’s policies will stoke domestic growth. Tech stocks in the benchmark equity gauge have slumped 3.1 percent over four days, trailing the S&P 500 Index by 4.2 percentage points, the most since May 2009. Small caps in the Russell 2000 Index surged 1.2 percent to an all-time high. No single fact explains the tech rout though everything from trade and immigration policy to industry rotation to flat-out campaign retaliation have been cited. Technology is the biggest group in the S&P 500 by far and one of the only ones to consistently post earnings growth over the last 18 months. “Technology provides the productivity gains for the global economy and many of the large-cap names like Apple and Amazon were carrying the torch for the market,” Channing Smith, a managing director at Capital Advisors Inc. in Tulsa, Oklahoma, said by phone. The firm oversees about $1.8 billion. “Without their participating, that’s definitely going to create a headwind for the market.” The S&P 500 slipped less than one point for a second day of losses, with tech giants bearing the worst of the rout. The FANG block of Facebook, Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google parent Alphabet each fell more than 2.4 percent. The group has dropped every day since Trump’s victory, sinking 8 percent for the worst retreat since February amid concern about the impact of Trump’s policies on trade overseas, where U.S. technology companies thrive. The industry, which largely supported Hillary Clinton during her presidential campaign, may also face higher hurdles for expanding their footprints after some high-profile business leaders including Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos clashed with Trump during the election. Trump, responding to negative coverage in the Washington Post, which is owned by Bezos, maintained Bezos purchased the news organization to gain political influence and avoid antitrust scrutiny. Shares of the online retailer have lost more than $30 billion in value since Tuesday’s vote. “It’s a big deal with what potentially Trump could do,” said Blake Harper, an analyst that covers internet stocks at Loop Capital Markets LLC in Chicago. “If you look at investors in Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon, they’re stacking some type of operationality for them to continue to expand internationally and also expand into other different categories outside their core markets,” he said. “He definitely indicated he would pursue antitrust measures against companies like Amazon. You’d have more restrictive policies to prohibit expansion.” Any slowdown in tech earnings may deal a blow to a market that just emerged from a five-quarter profit slump, the longest since the global financial crisis. While S&P 500 income rose 2.7 percent in the third quarter, profit at tech firms expanded almost 8 percent, actual results and analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. The decline in tech shares came after they extended their leadership at the fastest rate in four years, raising their representation in the S&P 500 by more than 1 percentage point to a 15-year high of 21.4 percent in the third quarter. From Apple to Facebook, mega techs now occupy half of the top 10 spots in ranks of the most valuable American companies, matching the number at the peak of internet mania. For now, the market seems to be holding up, with S&P 500 trading within 1.2 percent of an all-time high, as the retreat in tech stocks has been countered by rallies in financial and industrial companies, shares expected to benefit from Trump’s plans to boost fiscal spending and ease regulations. Banks climbed 2.3 percent Monday, extending their gains since Trump’s victory to 11 percent, while industrial stocks have added 5.2 percent in that time. “The market is getting ahead of itself here and selling off and being hard on tech,” said Timothy Ghriskey, who helps manage $1.5 billion as chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management LLC in New York. “Tech is where a lot of gains were, so as money gets shifted around to different sectors, meaning into financials and into health care and industrials, it has to come out of somewhere and a lot of it has come out of tech.”   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News.

Kim Harrison Wow I just switched to Public Mobile and this would be awesome timing ???? Syaz This would be amazing… Jason van de Laar Another awesome Giveaway! andrew konken I’ve been a long time Telus customer and this is the only device I would even consider upgrading to. Everything about the phone just looks absolutely amazing. I finally got a chance to see one in the mall last week and I couldn’t help but find my fingers fondling it’s screen and touching the fingerprint sensor. Plus it would be nice to have a phone with a half decent camera. Each time I’ve gotten a new phone in the last 6-7 years the devices I’ve picked have been plagued by camera issues. Unfortunately I’m on an old grandfathered 6GB data plan and it would cost me more in plan fees over the 2 years than the device is worth, and I just don’t have the coin to pony up for one. Mobilesyrup would make my Christmas/Year if I won this. danhenny_76 its too bad telus has ‘minimum monthly contracts’ now -id love to get this phone but will i give up my $65/m with 5gig data plan? never vn33 With the in-market plans these days, I may as well stay with the best data plan I can get (such as yours) and buy my own phone. I will still come out ahead! Uberman X Love to try the Pixel XL Mr K Looks awesome! My iPhone 6 just died on me and I’m very tempted to return to the Android world.

Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week’s election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump’s policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. “The market is sniffing out the belief that some of these Trump policies may drive some better economic growth but also may in fact be somewhat inflationary,” said PNC Chief Investment Strategist Bill Stone. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Technology companies fell sharply. Apple gave up $2.72, or 2.5 percent, to $105.71 while Facebook declined $3.94, or 3.3 percent, to $115.08 and Microsoft slid 90 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $58.12. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $18.53, or 2.4 percent, to $753.22. Bond prices fell and yields jumped as investors anticipated that Trump’s spending plans would lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed to 2.25 percent from 2.14 percent late Thursday. Bond trading was closed Friday for the Veterans’ Day holiday. The day before the Nov. 8 election, the yield was 1.83 percent. Goldman Sachs rose $5.24 percent, to 2.6 percent, to $209.18 and Bank of America rose $1.06, or 5.6 percent, to $20.08. JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.82, or 3.7 percent, to $79.51. Oil prices bounced back from a big loss early on. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped just 9 cents to $43.32 a barrel in New York.

Most Popular Google last month quietly bought Undecidable Labs, a startup founded by a former Apple director that focused on turning online searches into purchases, according to a person familiar with the deal. The acquisition suggests that Google, the largest unit of Alphabet, is making further moves to tie its massive library of online image links with a revenue stream. Earlier efforts around online commerce have delivered mixed results at Google. The company's mobile payments have yet to see significant pickup. Its comparison shopping service, which facilitates online purchases within search results, has growing traction with advertisers, according to external estimates. Cathy Edwards, founder of Undecidable Labs, now oversees engineering and product development for image search at Google, a spokeswoman for the internet giant said on Monday. The representative declined to comment further. Undecidable Labs, based in San Francisco, had raised less than $1 million in financing, according to a person with knowledge of the startup. They asked not to be identified talking about private matters. Related Stories Alphabet Drops Starbucks Partnership, Slows Drone Project to Rein in Spending Rich Gets Richer: Google Parent Alphabet Reports Higher-Than-Expected Ad Sales Google Moves to Own More of the Online Shopping Experience Ms. Edwards spent two years as an engineering director at Apple, after the iPhone maker purchased her app search engine, Chomp, in 2012. She formed Undecidable Labs in early 2015. The company had yet to release a product. Stefanie Kraus, a designer listed as an employee of the startup, described its effort on her website as creating a "purchase research tool" for online shoppers. "By introducing a filtering system that takes `nice to have' and `ideal' into consideration, we make sure that the products are presented in a meaningful way," Ms. Kraus wrote on her website. Li Fan, who previously led engineering efforts for Google image search, left the company in September. She moved to Pinterest, the online discovery site that some analysts see as a viable contender for e-commerce spending and search advertising dollars now flowing to Google. -- Bloomberg News In this article: Digital Online Publishing Search Shopper Marketing Technology Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2016 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17 x Scroll to Continue

Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week’s election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump’s policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Apple gave up $2.72, or 2.5 percent, to $105.71 while Facebook declined $3.94, or 3.3 percent, to $115.08 and Microsoft slid 90 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $58.12. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $18.53, or 2.4 percent, to $753.22. Bond prices fell and yields jumped as investors anticipated that Trump’s spending plans would lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed to 2.25 percent from 2.14 percent late Thursday. Bond trading was closed Friday for the Veterans’ Day holiday. The day before the Nov. 8 election, the yield was 1.83 percent. That’s a huge move for that benchmark rate. Goldman Sachs rose $5.24 percent, to 2.6 percent, to $209.18 and Bank of America rose $1.06, or 5.6 percent, to $20.08. JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.82, or 3.7 percent, to $79.51. South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes electronics for cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.07, or 25.2 percent, to $109.72. German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor’s stock rose $5.61, or 18.3 percent, to $36.29. The dollar rose against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.51 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0726 from $1.0845. Oil prices bounced back from a big loss early on. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped just 9 cents to $43.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 32 cents to $44.43 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.28 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.39 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 13 cents, or 5 percent, to $2.75 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $2.60 to $1,221.70 an ounce. Silver lost 49 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $16.89 an ounce. Copper picked up 1 cent to $2.52 a pound. France’s CAC 40 rose 0.4 percent and Germany’s DAX added 0.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed 0.3 percent higher. In Japan the Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 percent after a strong reading on Japan’s economic growth. The Kospi in South Korea lost 0.5 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 1.4 percent.

But, have you ever looked beyond your favorite fast food restaurant’s menu and order something a little unconventional? GOBankingRates.com scoured the web and food blogs to see which “secret” items or hacks you can order from popular fast food joints, such as McDonald’s, Taco Bell, Burger King and Starbucks. Then, we tried them out ourselves to see if they live up to the hype. We weren’t disappointed. Check out these $10-and-under “secret” menu hacks, and stretch your dollar even further the next time you get your fast food fix. 1. Taco Bell: “Incredible Hulk” Order this instead of: the Beefy 5 Layer Burrito Price: $2.17 Taco Bell, known for having one of the best dollar menus around, offers up a variety of burritos ranging from chicken to beef. And if you’ve ever ordered the Beefy 5 Layer Burrito, you know it typically comes with seasoned beef, cheese, sour cream, beans and nacho cheese. But the next time you go to the restaurant, order “The Incredible Hulk.” If the server has no idea what you’re talking about, just tell them you want the Beefy 5 Layer Burrito with guacamole instead of nacho cheese. There might be an extra charge, but if you’re an avocado lover, it’s worth it. And if you’re worried about your calorie intake, just get rid of the inner tortilla shell and sour cream. 2. In-N-Out Burger: Animal Style® Fries Order this instead of: regular fries  Price: $6.81 When you order this “secret” fast food menu item, you don’t need to tell the servers what to do — they know exactly what you’re talking about. Residents in a handful of states, including folks who live in California and Arizona, will argue In-N-Out has the best burger and fries in the country. But before you roll your eyes and dispute this belief, answer this: Have you ever ordered the fast food restaurant’s Animal Style® fries? Animal Style® isn’t that big of a secret — it’s even on In-N-Out’s not-so-secret menu. However, it takes the fresh-cut french fries, which are cooked in 100 percent vegetable oil, to a new level. When you order Animal Style®  fries, they come with cheese sauce, grilled onions and the restaurant’s secret spread. And get this: You can even order your burger Animal Style®, as well. 3. McDonald’s: “Monster Mac”  Order this instead of: the Big Mac® Price: $8.56 Just in case McDonald’s Big Mac® wasn’t enough to fill you up — is that even possible? — here’s a menu hack to make your Big Mac® even bigger. The ordinary Big Mac® has just two beef patties, American cheese, lettuce, onions, pickles and special sauce in a sesame bun. But a “Monster Mac” has more patties. In fact, we ordered six patties but got seven. Find Out: 10 Things You Didn’t Know About McDonald’s If you ask the drive-thru “server” to get you a “Monster Mac,” they might not know what you’re talking about. If that happens, just tell them you want extra patties. Keep in mind you’ll be charged for each additional patty. And sure, the staff might think you’re crazy for ordering this monstrosity of a burger. But at least you won’t be hungry…and probably not for several days. 4. McDonald’s: “Apple Pie McFlurry” Order this instead of: the basic McFlurry® Price: $3.79 Ready for dessert after you devoured your “Monster Mac?” If so, first a congratulations is in order — if you have room in your stomach after devouring that giant burger, your stomach probably belongs in the Guinness World Records. Now, see if you can stomach an “Apple Pie McFlurry.” Again, the server might’ve never heard of this “secret” menu hack. But, ask them to blend an apple pie with a McFlurry® of your choice. We recommend the McFlurry® with Oreo® cookies. But be prepared: The staff might say no to your request. If so, no problem. Just order a McFlurry® and an apple pie. If you order through the drive-thru and choose to eat at home, warm up your apple pie first before breaking it and mixing it into your shake. Trust us, it just tastes better. 5. Starbucks: “Butterbeer” Iced Latte Order this instead of: your daily latte  Price: $5.25 Ok, so Starbucks isn’t technically categorized as fast food. But it serves food, and it’s fast. And if you’re a Harry Potter fan, you’ll appreciate this magical concoction the staff can quickly whip up. The next time you need your $5 latte fix, ask the barista for a “Butterbeer” Iced Latte. Just order: an iced latte two pumps caramel two pumps toffee nut two pumps cinnamon dolce whipped cream caramel bits If you need an extra jolt of caffeine, add a shot of espresso. It might not be true Butterbeer™ that you can order at the The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. But when you take your first sip, you’ll feel like you’re really in Hogsmeade™. See: Your Ultimate Guide to Saving Money at Starbucks 6. Chipotle: Quesadilla Order this instead of: a burrito Price: $6.32 Everyone loves Chipotle’s famous tacos, burritos and burrito bowls. But did you know the Mexican grill also serves quesadillas? You just have to ask. And don’t worry — the staff won’t hesitate to cook this “secret” menu item. It’s really simple to make, so you won’t hold up the line. The Chipotle quesadilla is similar to a burrito, but without the rice (but you can still get rice if you prefer). So, it’s the perfect choice if you want something a little lighter than than a stuffed burrito. And you can still get some of your favorite mix-ins, including chicken or beef. Just don’t forget to also ask for a side of sour cream, guacamole and/or salsa. Save More: 9 Secret Ways to Save Money at Chipotle 7. Burger King: “The Burger King Club” Order this instead of: the Original Chicken Sandwich Price: $7.29  Last but not least is a “secret” menu item all the bacon lovers can appreciate: The Burger King Club at, well, Burger King. Yes, this fast food restaurant does boast a ton of bacon burgers on its regular menu: the Bacon King®, Bacon and Cheese Whopper®, Bacon Double Cheeseburger® and Bacon Cheeseburger®. But a favorite menu item for many is the Original Chicken Sandwich, which, sadly, doesn’t come with bacon. If Burger King’s traditional chicken sandwich is just a little too plain for you, ask for tomatoes, cheese and bacon. Again, the staff might not recognize the phrase “Burger King Club,” but they can easily add all of the extras to your chicken sandwich at a small price.

Follow TechnoBuffalo One of the biggest rumors leading up to Apple’s October event was the possibility of new Cinema Displays. The event came and went and there were no Cinema Displays in sight, but Apple did team up with LG to create two external displays: the UltraFine 4K and 5K Displays. Both displays come equipped with USB-C ports and make it an easy fusion with Apple’s new MacBook Pros. We got the 4K version in the office to see if it’s worth the price, or if you’re better off looking elsewhere. Right off the bat, let me state that this monitor is not pretty. From the inconsequential base to the boring black color, the design is incredibly bland. Second to its boring looks is its size. The UltraFine 4K display is only 21.5-inches, which is tiny. For all of its shortcoming, the new display is still beautiful. Sure, the casing is boring and is quite small, but the colors pop and the pixels are non-existent. If you choose to pick one of these up, it will compliment the MacBook Pro’s Retina Display quite well. Check out the video above to see a breakdown of the LG UltraFine 4K Display. UPDATE: The display has four USB-C ports, one specifically for charging, and are not Thunderbolt 3 compatible. This was corrected in the post.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 15 November 2016 | MYT 8:27 AM Apple stock extends losses after China warning about Trump Challenging outlook: An analyst says Apple's China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country's weakening currency. — Reuters SAN FRANCISCO: Apple's stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China. Apple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com, Facebook and Alphabet , selling off since Tuesday's election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. In a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company's stock fell 2.5% on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday's election to almost 5%, compared to the S&P 500's 1.16% advance. Adding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of "tit-for-tat" retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45% tariffs on all imports from China. "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted," the op-ed said. China has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. Revenue from China slumped 30% in Apple's September quarter, worse than the Americas' 7% decline. Apple's China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country's weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. Synovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns US$33mil (RM142mil) worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump's campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term. "You just don't just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements," Morgan said. —  Reuters You May Be Interested Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Best smartphones for the holidays Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Project promoting a healthy diet in its fifth year Cyclist has grand tales to tell after going through 22 countries MRT fare starts at RM1 advertisement Latest News Lenovo unveils the IdeaCentre Y710 Cube gaming PC Facebook lets Messenger 'bots' tap analytic smarts Xiaomi opens its Mi Store on Lazada Western Digital redesigns its external drives WhatsApp adds secure video calling Most Viewed in Tech Best smartphones for the holidays Sex hook-up websites' login credentials hacked WhatsApp adds secure video calling Xiaomi opens its Mi Store on Lazada Lenovo unveils the IdeaCentre Y710 Cube gaming PC Twitter gets new 'Sun and Moon' Pokemon stickers Snowden warns of increase in US domestic spying after Trump victory Nintendo Wii at 10: the iconic games Western Digital redesigns its external drives Facebook lets Messenger 'bots' tap analytic smarts Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Citing sources familiar with Apple's plans, the site says the smart glasses would connect wirelessly to the iPhone, much like the Apple Watch, and would display "images and other information" to the wearer. Apple has contacted potential suppliers about its glasses project and has ordered "small quantities" of near-eye displays, suggesting the project is in the exploratory prototyping phase of development. If work on the glasses progresses, they could be released in 2018. Google Glass Apple's glasses sound similar to Google Glass, the head-mounted display that Google first introduced in 2013. Google Glass used augmented reality and voice commands to allow users to do things like check the weather, make phone calls, and capture photographs. Apple's product could be similar in functionality. The glasses may be Apple's first hardware product targeted directly at AR, one of the people said. Cook has beefed up AR capabilities through acquisitions. In 2013, Apple bought PrimeSense, which developed motion-sensing technology in Microsoft Corp.'s Kinect gaming system. Purchases of software startups in the field, Metaio Inc. and Flyby Media Inc., followed in 2015 and 2016.Google Glass was highly criticized because of privacy concerns, and as a result, it never really caught on with consumers. Google eventually stopped developing Google Glass in January of 2015. It is not clear how Apple would overcome the privacy and safety issues that Google faced, nor if the project will progress, but Apple CEO Tim Cook has expressed Apple's deep interest in augmented reality multiple times over the last few months, suggesting something big is in the works. "AR can be really great," he said in July. "We have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We're high on AR in the long run." Past rumors have also indicated Apple is exploring a number of virtual and augmented reality projects, including a full VR headset. Apple has a full team dedicated to AR and VR research and how the technologies can be incorporated into future Apple products. Cook recently said that he believes augmented reality would be more useful and interesting to people than virtual reality.

They were intrusive, instead of pushing technology to the background, as we’ve always believed.” He went on, “We always thought it would flop, and, you know, so far it has.” ????

 Microsoft accidentally reveals that its flagship tool for programmers is coming to the Mac Matt Weinberger Nov. 14, 2016, 7:37 PM 11,289 facebook linkedin twitter email print Xamarin co-founder Miguel de Icaza on stage at Microsoft Build in 2014Xamarin Microsoft is bringing Visual Studio, its widely used tool for writing software, to Apple's Macs. The news will be announced at Microsoft's Connect conference later this week, but it was revealed early when the official blog entry went live a few days before. The blog has since been taken down, but a cached version remains via Google. Visual Studio is how a lot of programmers get work done, particularly those building software for Microsoft Windows or the web. Bringing Visual Studio to Apple MacOS, the operating system preferred by many programmers, is going to turn a lot of heads. It's just the latest way Microsoft is reaching across the aisle to former rivals to win over programmers. There's a catch: As Ars Technica points out in more technical detail, Visual Studio for Mac may share a name and aesthetic with its PC counterpart, but it won't be exactly the same as Visual Studio for Windows. Under the hood, the Mac version of Visual Studio mainly functions as an update to Xamarin Studio, a tool for quickly and easily building apps that can run on Windows, iPhone, Android, Mac, the web, or anywhere else. Microsoft got Xamarin Studio, alongside the rest of Xamarin's technology, in a big buy earlier in 2016.Visual Studio for MacMicrosoft In the same way that Microsoft's excellent Outlook apps for iPhone and Android are a direct successor to Acompli, a startup Microsoft bought in 2014, this new Visual Studio for Mac looks to be a new name and face for Xamarin's technology. Lots of programmers love Xamarin in its own right, though. So while Visual Studio for Windows may be more powerful on paper, there are still lots of developers who will still be able to do what they need to do on the Mac version, too. And it's a big flag in the ground for Microsoft — Xamarin Studio, and now Visual Studio for Mac, are designed to make it really easy for programmers to build their apps to the Microsoft Azure cloud, which is a big focus for Microsoft. By bringing a flagship brand to Mac, Microsoft is hoping to give that business a leg up.

AWS instances just got cheaper China says the rhetoric of US President-elect Donald Trump could lead it to block the sale of products by Apple and other US tech companies. An editorial from the state-run Global Times news outlet suggests that, should Trump make good on his campaign promise to declare China a currency manipulator and raise tariffs on imported goods, China's government could respond by blocking the import of US goods to the mainland, with the Apple iPhone in particular getting special mention. "China will take a tit-for-tat approach then," the article promises. "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted." The paper goes on to urge Trump to back off from any planned sanctions on China, and instead keep the current trade scenario, which it calls a "win-win" for the two countries. "If Trump wrecks Sino-US trade, a number of US industries will be impaired," the editorial promises. "Finally the new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences." Not that China has been doing Apple many favors as of late, anyway. The last quarterly numbers to come out of Cupertino showed that revenues from China fell by 30 per cent from the prior year, and globally iPhone shipments were down 13 per cent. Still, CEO Tim Cook has to be wondering just what he did to end up in the middle of a Sino-Trumpian war of words, particularly when he recently issued a letter to employees in an effort to ease anxiety over the election. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 91 Comments More from The Register Tech Trump: Silicon Valley steps into the valley of unhappiness It's a long litany of problematic positions 61 Comments Donald Trump running insecure email servers But he's got a yuge firewall, folks... the best kind of firewall 85 Comments Criticize Donald Trump, get your site smashed offline from Russia Newsweek Cuban connection story enrages miscreants 128 Comments You think Donald Trump is insecure?

 Apple is working on smart glasses Kif Leswing Nov. 14, 2016, 7:00 PM 9,809 facebook linkedin twitter email print Not a real photo of Tim Cook. AP / Matthew Sumner for Getty Images Apple is working on a pair of smart glasses. The product would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing an unnamed source. The project is advanced enough to be in talks with suppliers, the report said. The smart glasses would be Apple's first in a category of product that was originally pioneered by Google with its Google Glass product. Like Google Glass, Apple's smart-glasses product would be geared toward information conveyance instead of immersive augmented-reality experiences like the products that Magic Leap is developing and Microsoft's HoloLens. Bloomberg cited sources saying the glasses "may use augmented reality." The project is in "early product testing," the Bloomberg report said. The smart glasses would be designed to connect to an iPhone for processing to keep their weight down and keep the design of the frames stylish without adding too many additional electronics. A main component of any pair of Apple smart glasses would be the lenses. Last week, Upload VR entrepreneur-in-residence Robert Scoble wrote in a Facebook post that Apple's optics partner was Carl Zeiss, which produces a lens called Zeiss Smart Optics. Thomas Alt, who joined Apple after the company bought Metaio, an AR company he was the CEO of, is listed as an inventor on a glasses patent assigned to Carl Zeiss. His LinkedIn profile lists him as "Director of Procurement, Strategic Deals Team" at Apple. A Zeiss representative declined to comment on any partnership with Apple. "I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day, it will become that much a part of you," Apple CEO Tim Cook said last month in Utah. Apple develops many projects internally, and those efforts often do not ultimately result in a full product that goes on sale. Apple is working on integrating augmented reality into its software, and the glasses would most likely be its first hardware product targeted the AR market.

Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week's election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump's policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. "The market is sniffing out the belief that some of these Trump policies may drive some better economic growth but also may in fact be somewhat inflationary," said PNC Chief Investment Strategist Bill Stone. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Apple gave up $2.72, or 2.5 percent, to $105.71 while Facebook declined $3.94, or 3.3 percent, to $115.08 and Microsoft slid 90 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $58.12. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $18.53, or 2.4 percent, to $753.22. Bond prices fell and yields jumped as investors anticipated that Trump's spending plans would lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed to 2.25 percent from 2.14 percent late Thursday. Bond trading was closed Friday for the Veterans' Day holiday. The day before the Nov. 8 election, the yield was 1.83 percent. That's a huge move for that benchmark rate. Goldman Sachs rose $5.24 percent, to 2.6 percent, to $209.18 and Bank of America rose $1.06, or 5.6 percent, to $20.08. JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.82, or 3.7 percent, to $79.51.

Close share panel Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Heart disease and strokes kill around 14 million people a year worldwide It was when Vic Gundotra's father suffered serious heart problems and nearly died that the former Google executive decided to move into healthcare tech. He now runs a firm called AliveCor that has developed a heart-monitoring device causing excitement in medical circles. AliveCor's recently launched Kardia Band, which integrates with Apple's smart watch, takes an electrocardiogram (ECG) of your heart, measuring its electrical activity as it pumps away. Medical experts believe it could potentially save thousands of lives. It can spot atrial fibrillation (AF) - one of the most common forms of abnormal heart rhythm and a major cause of stroke. You place your thumb on the metal sensor in the watchband to complete an electrical circuit and it can take a reading in 30 seconds, sending the data to the watch over high-frequency audio rather than Bluetooth or wi-fi. Image copyright AliveCor Image caption AliveCor's Kardia Band version of the heart monitor links to Apple's smart watch Kardia Band can spot other problems, too, but currently only has regulatory approval for AF. If it spots anything else unusual it suggests you go and see your doctor. "The problem with atrial fibrillation is that it's asymptomatic, which means it can come and go and often isn't diagnosed," says Mr Gundotra. For example, Ron Grant, 70, told the BBC: "At the age of 55, I had a massive heart attack - flatlined - had a bypass. It was some years after that we discovered I had AF - a funny heart rhythm to put it simply - which could lead to stroke". Mr Grant now uses the smartphone compatible version of the AliveCor device to keep tabs on his ticker. "People start modifying their behaviour once they begin monitoring their own health," says Mr Gundotra. "No-one's more interested in heart health than the owner of the heart." Biggest killers Heart disease and stroke are the biggest killers in the world, accounting for about 14 million deaths a year. If technology can give us a warning that things are going wrong before it's too late, many lives could be saved. And health budgets could be applied more effectively elsewhere. In the US, around 130,000 people die a year directly or indirectly from AF, while more than 750,000 have to go to hospital, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Former Bolton Wanderers footballer Fabrice Muamba survived a cardiac arrest during a game And it costs about $6bn (£4.8bn) a year to treat the condition in the US. In the UK, around 100,000 people suffer sudden cardiac death each year, to which AF is a contributor. According to NHS England, AF is responsible for a third of all strokes and costs the NHS more than £2.2bn a year to treat. So it's easy to see why health authorities are interested in simple wearable devices that could significantly increase early diagnosis of such heart problems before they become life-threatening - and more costly to treat. In the summer, Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, said such innovations would be "fast-tracked" so they can be adopted within the English health system much more quickly. Clinically proven There are scores of fitness trackers on the market these days, most of them wristbands, and while they may be useful motivational tools, most of them don't yet have regulatory approval. "Fitness trackers are all very well, but doctors want clinically proven products whose data they can use to make clinical decisions," says Mr Gundotra. But going through the rigorous testing process required for a health product to receive regulatory approval can take years, so it's no wonder most consumer tech companies don't bother. Image copyright AliveCor Image caption AliveCor's smartphone compatible heart monitor, Kardia Mobile, has regulatory approval Confusingly, AliveCor's smartphone compatible sensor, Kardia Mobile, has received regulatory approval in the US and Europe, whereas the Kardia Band smart watch version is currently approved only for Europe. "We hope to get US approval soon," says Mr Gundotra. Collating and studying millions of ECGs AliveCor's sensors have taken, and applying machine learning to the data, is also promising to reap rewards - although these are early days for the research. Image copyright AliveCor Image caption The software interprets the electrical pattern your heart makes, looking for abnormalities AliveCor is collaborating with the Mayo Clinic in the US to see if other useful indicators can be discerned from the electrical pulse patterns generated by our hearts. For example, they may be able to detect whether you have too much or too little potassium in your system, a mineral that plays a key role in keeping your heart beating in a normal rhythm. Potassium also helps your nerves to function, your muscles to work, and your kidneys to filter blood. At the moment we can only find out potassium levels from a blood test, so if this information could be gleaned from a quick ECG instead, the medical benefits could be huge. Wearables that work So what other clinically proven apps and gadgets are causing a stir? Remote monitoring is a big area of research, with companies like Preventice Solutions and Biotricity offering heart monitoring kit that records and sends ECG data wirelessly to a smartphone app or to the cloud, allowing doctors to be alerted immediately of any heart abnormalities in their patients. Preventice's BodyGuardian has received approval by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA), but just the software element of Biotricity's Bioflux product has so far been approved. Image copyright Dexcom Image caption Dexcom's blood sugar monitor sends data wirelessly to a smartphone "Remote monitoring could save a lot of money - hundreds of thousands of dollars a year - because people have to go into hospital much less often," says Annette Zimmermann, research director at Gartner. And Dexcom has recently had its continuous glucose monitoring system approved by the FDA, enabling people with Type 1 or 2 diabetes to measure their blood sugar levels automatically every five minutes and see the trends displayed on a smartphone. A growing number of advice apps are winning approval, too, from myCOPD, which enables patients to manage Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD), to BlueStar, an app helping people with Type 2 diabetes manage their condition. Fitness wearables may be more fashionable, but it's the clinically proven gadgets and apps that could end up saving the most lives.

Technology iOS and Android updates are 'sapping your storage and draining your battery life' Operating system updates don't just take up space, they could be affecting the performance of your gadgets  Share  Comments BySophie Curtis 13:27, 15 NOV 2016 Updated13:27, 15 NOV 2016 Technology  Share  Comments Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Every year it comes around - the iOS update that means you have to delete half of the photos and songs on your iPhone to make room for the new operating system. But Apple isn't the only company guilty of issuing hefty software updates that can adversely affect the performance of your gadgets. Earlier this year, Microsoft issued an "Anniversary Update" to Windows 10 that cause thousands of customers' devices to freeze or crash, rendering them unusable. (Photo: Getty) In the wake of these issues, consumer watchdog Which? has conducted an investigation into how some mobiles and tablets perform after receiving operating system updates. While updates are promoted as a means to boost the performance of your device, Which? found that a number of devices were adversely affected after an update. Read More EE takes drastic measures to improve customer service after being named one of UK's worst mobile operators For example, upgrading a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 tablet from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, results in the device losing 30GB of storage – enough for an entire family photo album. (Photo: Getty) A Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 9.7 also loses 3GB of storage after updating from Android 5.0 Lollipop to Android 6.0 Marshmallow. But it's not just storage that's an issue. Which? found that operating system updates can also adversely affect the battery life of some devices. Read More How much mobile data does Pokemon Go use? Battery saver tips if it's draining your phone On a Google Nexus 6P, for example, web browsing time decreases from 716 minutes to 535 minutes - roughly 3 hours – after updating from Android 6.0 Marshmallow to 7.0 Nougat. (Photo: Getty) Meanwhile the battery life of an Apple iPhone 6 decreases by 38 minutes - from 702.5 minutes to 664.5 minutes - when upgrading from iOS 8 to iOS 10. Despite the potential risks, operating system updates usually include enhancements - such as security patches. Which? recommends it is often best to wait a few weeks before you update, to allow for any teething problems to be resolved. (Photo: Getty) The watchdog also said that companies should do more to explain the possible effects of updates on device performance, and explore ways of allowing their customers to revert to the previous software if they don't like the new version. Read More Uninstalling this one app will boost your iPhone battery by 15% "Our latest research shows that, while upgrades are meant to boost the performance of our phones and tablets, the opposite can actually prove to be true," said Richard Headland, editor of Which? magazine. "Given how much we rely on mobile devices, companies should do more to tell us about the possible downsides of updates, as well as the benefits."

"The teams are working very well together."   The current plan is to launch new desktop and mobile apps in the first half of 2017, and then ramp up to complete the deployment through the rest of the year.   Bhise stressed that the overall financial expectation of the AT&T contract is “very much on track,” reiterating that the annual revenue run-rate from the project is still targeted for about $100 million once full deployment is reached.   “We remain pleased with our progress to date,” he said.     On that point, he noted that AT&T and Synacor have already introduced a beta of the new AT&T Live 2.0 mobile app for Android. The beta app, last updated on November 9, provides a curated news feed, breaking news alerts, and trending videos, among other features. So far, the beta app has received a consumer rating of 4.1 out of 5.   Synacor has also adjusted its Q4 guidance to reflect the revised timing of the contribution from the AT&T contract. The vendor, which specializes in customized portals, advertising, video streaming and TV Everywhere authentication technologies, current expects Q4 revenues of $34 million to $38 million, and EBITDA of up to $1 million.   For Q3, Synacor posted revenues of $31.7 million, up 20%, and above guidance of $29 million to $31 million. Advertising revenues rose 38% year-over year. The company also posted a net loss of $3.4 million due to product development investment for the AT&T project.   On the TVE front, Synacor said its Cloud ID business won deals with an SVOD service from a public telecom company and with an also yet-to-be-named regional cable provider.   Synacor also noted that it’s supporting the deployment of Apple’s Single Sign-On platform for video apps and cited its ongoing work for industry-wide standards with CTAM and the OATC (Open Authentication Technology Committee).   RELATED: Synacor: Our TVE Authentication Angle ‘In Alignment’ with CTAM Guidelines   In an interview, Bhise said “several” Synacor MVPD customers are now live with SSO on the Apple platform. “Our job is to make it easier for those operators that decide they want to participate on the Apple platform.”   Synacor also announced it had filed a shelf registration statement aimed at providing the company “with flexibility to access the capital markets in a timely manner.”  Per the shelf registration statement, once declared effective by the SEC, Synacor may from time to time issue common stock up to an aggregate amount of $40 million.   “As we continue to accelerate our growth strategy and identify opportunities for expansion, we recognize that potential access to additional capital and the ability to provide opportunities for institutional investors to access Synacor stock could be beneficial, and we have filed this shelf registration to give us that optionality,” Bhise said in a statement.   “As one can surmise from our current financial performance, we do not have any present plans to issue securities under this registration statement,” he added on the Q3 call.   Synacor ended Q3 with $15.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, versus $16.3 million at the end of the prior quarter.   Synacor also said an initiative called “3/30/300” -- with a goal of generating $300 million in revenues and $30 million in EBIDTA in three years – is also on track.   Want to read more stories like this?

WhatsApp launches video calling for everyone Posted 12 hours ago by Josh Constine (@joshconstine), Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Zuora latest cloud company to launch predictive data product WhatsApp wants to be international cross-platform FaceTime. Today, the Facebook-owned chat service WhatsApp is officially launching video calling for its over 1 billion users worldwide on iOS, Android and Windows Phone. Its debut follows a series of reports from people who recently found the feature had been enabled in beta versions of WhatsApp on Android and on Windows Phone – an indication that a public debut was on the horizon. To use the new feature, WhatsApp users can hit the call button in the top right corner of a conversation, which will bring up an overlaid interstitial asking if you want to voice or video call the friend or family member you’re chatting with. To kick off the video call, you simply select the “video call” option from this screen. During the call itself, you can switch between the forward-facing and rear camera, mute the call or press the red button to hang up. It seems the user interface varies slightly on Android and iPhone in terms of where the picture-in-picture video feed is displayed, as well as the buttons’ size, lineup and placement. (See images and video below.) WhatsApp already supports a number of standard features for communications apps, including group texting and voice calling. But the company says that video calling has remained one of its top feature requests from users. video-calling-android-2 video-calling-iphone-2 video-calling-iphone video-calling-android  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit With video calling, WhatsApp is belatedly catching up with a number of rivals, including Facebook’s own Messenger app, for example, as well as Skype, Apple’s FaceTime, Viber, LINE and Google’s recently launched Duo, to name a few. Though a late entrant, WhatsApp still has a massive user base and the addition of the feature could help them from fleeing to other messaging and calling platforms. In addition, WhatsApp touts its cross-platform support as one of the reasons to use video calling in its app, instead of elsewhere. “…we want to make these features available to everyone, not just those who can afford the most expensive new phones or live in countries with the best cellular networks,” the company said in its announcement, published today. That’s a direct shot at things like FaceTime, which only works on Apple devices, as well as newer arrivals, like Google Duo, which only runs on later versions of iOS and Android (Jelly Bean and up, or iOS 9 and up). You may not immediately see video calling in WhatsApp today, however. The rollout is staged, meaning it will arrive over the days ahead as it reaches the entire WhatsApp user base. Video calling isn’t the only new addition to arrive recently. The company also rolled out two-factor authentication in some of its beta versions, hinting that its next big release could be a security-focused upgrade. By retaining its simple interface but embracing more vivid connections beyond texting, WhatsApp could flourish with users no matter how they want to communicate 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase WhatsApp Founded 2009 Overview WhatsApp Messenger is a cross-platform mobile messaging app which allows you to exchange messages without having to pay for SMS.

Tech-Recipes: A Cookbook Full of Tech Tutorials Tech-Recipes: A Cookbook Full of Tech Tutorials Contact Us About Us Advertise Android Apple Windows Internet Database Programming Apps How to Activate Night Shift Mode on iPhone Posted November 11, 2016 by Leomar Umpad in Uncategorized As the sun sets, Night Shift Mode on iPhone will gradually adjust your phone’s screen to yellowish hues instead of the usual bright blue. Studies have shown that exposure to blue light at night time is disruptive to your circadian rhythm and is bad for your health. Incidentally, most of our phones, tablets, and laptops emit blue light. Blue light boosts our attention during the day, but it interferes with our ability to wind down and get ready for sleep at night. This is the reason why Apple introduced Night Shift Mode on iPhone. This tutorial explains how to use this feature on your iOS device. How to Enable Night Shift Mode on iPhone and iPad Night Shift will switch the color of your iPhone’s screen to a warm shade of yellow. To use Night Shift on your device, follow these steps: 1.Open your iPhone’s Settings. 2.Tap on the Display and Brightness option. 3.Open Night Shift. 4.You can tap on the switch to Manually Enable Until Tomorrow. This will enable night shift for one night. 5.Tap on the switch next to Scheduled to schedule Night Shift activation. 6.Tap on the From and To option to choose a start and end time for Night Shift. 7.Choose what time Night Shift turns ON. 8.Choose what time Night Shift turns OFF. 9.Slide the temperature adjuster to adjust the screen’s color temperature. Slide to the left make the screen color less warm while sliding to the right makes the color temperature warmer. It is important to note that warmer settings may affect the appearance of some on-screen motion. 10.Go back to the Display and Brightness page to see that Night Shift is now enabled on your iPhone. You are done.   Though there is no substitute for totally putting down your gadgets before going to bed, Night Shift Mode on iPhone ensures that you at least get a better sleep than you usually would with the typical phone screen lighting. If you have some more questions about iPhone’s Night Shift feature, let us know in the comments section. Bedtime for iPhone will also help you get a better night’s sleep.

WhatsApp was one of the last major messaging services to offer voice-calling, and is now catching up with Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat and Snap Inc. as well as Google and Apple. “We’re introducing this feature because we know that sometimes voice and text just aren’t enough,” it said in an e-mailed statement. Facebook bought WhatsApp in 2014 for $22 billion and the chat app has since focused mainly on expanding its audience, not making money. Still, WhatsApp has evolved from its roots as a bare-bones texting platform, and video-calling could increase the loyalty of its user base until Facebook works out a business plan.

The EcoSport’s styling changes are focused at the front end, introducing larger headlights and the latest iteration of Ford’s evolving grille design in place of the stacked look of the outgoing model. Large triangular fog lights, a new bumper and new wheel designs round out the changes. The little EcoSport is otherwise unchanged on the outside, with profile and rear styling largely untouched. Moving into the cabin, the changes are more dramatic. Gone is the current car’s centre stack which shares much of its design with the Ford Fiesta. In its place is a new centre stack and floating tablet-style 8.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system that looks pretty similar to the unit seen in the new Hyundai i30. Running the company’s latest Sync 3 software, the new media unit features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, along with access to Sync Connect and FordPass app-based technologies. Under the bonnet for US-bound models is the choice of a 1.0-litre Ecoboost three-cylinder turbo petrol or a 2.0-litre naturally-aspirated petrol unit. Both come standard with a six-speed automatic transmission (the Ecoboost is currently only available with a five-speed manual here) while the 2.0-litre also comes standard with all-wheel drive. The Titanium variant in the States also comes standard with a 10-speaker B&O Play audio system, along with satellite radio. 10 exterior colour choices are on offer, along with seven ambient lighting options.   Australia The facelifted EcoSport is confirmed for an Australian debut sometime in 2017, with a more specific window to be confirmed closer to launch. Although the EcoSport has failed to have much of an impact here, Ford Australia product communications manager Damion Smy told CarAdvice today the company is betting big on this update. “The EcoSport will play a crucial role in our growing SUV line-up, which we have more than doubled since 2012 and will see the locally-engineered Everest 4×2, five-seat Everest and the new Ford Escape arriving in showrooms in 2017,” Smy said. “This will allow us to offer consumers more choice as Australia’s appetite for SUVs continues unabated.” The EcoSport managed only 98 sales last month and 1530 year-to-date, well behind competitors like the Mazda CX-3 (1176/15,493) and the Mitsubishi ASX (1650/15,112).

The two lines are the Utility Collection and the Artisan Collection, and are priced at $50 and $75 respectively. Utility bands come in 6 colorways and feature premium, durable grosgrain fabric and genuine leather detailing. The Artisan bands come in just 4 colors and feature woven fabric and genuine leather backing. As with other TOMS products, there’s a cool social responsibility focus with these bands. The company says that purchases will help support its partners SolarAir and Solar Sister, leaders in ending light poverty. All TOMS for Apple Watch bands feature a “GIVE TIME” etching and a gold “TOMS” emboss, as well as genuine leather and stainless steel details for a timeless finish. About 1.2 billion people lack access to safe, reliable electricity. Each band purchase will roughly translate into providing 1 year of solar light. Research suggests that having a solar light at home allows children to study for an average of 1 extra hour per night. If you’re interested, the new Utility and Artisan Apple Watch bands are available on the TOMS website.

The exciting play spanned 61 yards and have OHS a 14-7 lead. By JON WEISBROD jweisbrod@owatonna.com Owatonna running back Jason Williamson (22) pushes forward for extra yards against Apple Valley. LAKEVILLE — In a game that sent blood-pressures soaring and brought tears to the eyes of both teams, Owatonna punched its ticket to U.S. Bank Stadium with an improbable 28-24 victory over Apple Valley in the Class 5A state quarterfinals on Saturday. The pendulum swung back and forth as the action on the field twisted and turned like a roller-coaster with both teams riding in the front seat. It was not the perfect game for the Huskies, but in the end, there were no culprits, just heroes. “I am just so happy for the kids,” Owatonna coach Jeff Williams said. “I am just so happy we don’t have to talk about the mistakes that could have been devastating.” In the final act of what was a 48-minute drama on turf, Alex Raichle hauled in a 44-yard touchdown pass from Abe Havelka on fourth down to score the game-winning touchdown with 17.6 seconds left in the fourth quarter. “It’s so awesome,” Raichle said. “I can’t wait until The Bank. But I don’t ever want to leave this field right now.” Raichle will no doubt go down as the shining star, but he was far from the only performer than beamed brightly under the lights at Lakeville North High School. Jay Sullivan — who re-joined football for his senior year after only playing as a freshman — snared a 61-yard Hail Mary touchdown on the final play of the first half to help give Owatonna a 14-7 lead. As the high-arching pass descended toward a mass of bodies around the 15-yard line, an Apple Valley defensive back was the first player to get his hands on the ball. Sullivan, though, was in perfect position to instantly rip it from his grasp before being escorted into the end zone by three jubilant teammates as time expired. “It was the craziest moment of my life,” Sullivan said. “Honestly it seemed like in half a second I was taking off from the line of scrimmage and all the sudden I was in the end zone with the ball. It was insane.” As the second half unfolded, the OHS defense, which had played with a nasty edge for 90 percent of the first half, began to bend as the talented and sizable Eagles found traction on offense and scored 17 points in the game’s final 24 minutes. Putting together back-to-back time-consuming drives to take a 21-14 lead with 4.1 seconds left in the third quarter, Apple Valley was playing like a train running downhill. But Owatonna never flinched. When the Huskies took possession to start the final stanza, Jason Williamson and the offensive line put the team on their backs, generating an 18-play, 77-yard drive that featured 17 runs and two fourth-down conversions, the second of which found the end zone when Abe Havelka swung a pass to Mitch Wiese for a 4-yard touchdown with 5 minutes, 20 seconds on the clock. “Us five up front, the lineman, we locked arms when we were down 21-14,” guard Nate Deason said. “We went out after [Apple Valley scored] and did it together, play after play. We played our hearts out. I’m proud of the guys.” Roughly four minutes after celebrating with his teammates, Wiese found himself squarely on the other end of the spectrum, lying flat on the turf as Apple Valley recovered his fumble with just less than two minutes left in the game. The Eagles took possession at the Owatonna 11-yard line after the turnover and lost five yards against the suddenly motivated Huskies’ defense. “They bent and bent and bent, but they never broke,” Williams said. “They hunkered down and made a huge stop.” Apple Valley, though, had the wind at its back and confidently sent Ford Friedel onto the field to attempt a 33-yard field goal. Without any hesitation, the Eagles’ senior placekicker drilled the kick from the left hash to send the Apple Valley fans into a frenzy and give his team a 24-21 lead with 1:05 left in the fourth quarter. Owatonna took possession at the 40-yard line and all the Eagles needed to do was keep the Huskies out of the end zone to earn their spot in the Class 5A final four at U.S. Bank Stadium. With just enough magic left in their spikes to push the ball across the 50-yard line on a 16-yard Havelka-to-Noah Budach completion, Owatonna faced a fourth down following a spike and two consecutive incomplete passes. And that’s when it happened. Taking the shotgun snap and comfortably shifting to the right to avoid the oncoming pass-rush, Havelka heaved the ball in the air in the direction of Williamson. But instead of hitting his running back streaking down the field, the ball flew into the leaping arms of Raichle, who safely hauled it in and rolled on his back into the end zone for the incredible touchdown. “That was just everyone go,” Havelka said. “And then Jason [Williamson] went up the middle and I was honestly throwing it to him, but A-Raichle made the play. That’s storybook stuff right there. It was crazy.” Added Raichle: “It was a corner route for me and Abe was scrambling out and I knew that I had to make something out of it so I ran toward the end zone and Abe chucked it up and I just had to go get the ball.” The Huskies’ next stop will be at U.S. Bank Stadium for the Class 5A semifinals where they will face top-ranked Elk River on Friday at 2 p.m. “I might enjoy this one for a few more minutes than usual,” Williams said. “But we owe it to the kids to be as prepared as we possibly can for Elk River.” The top-ranked Elks defeated Alexandria 60-36. After a scoreless first quarter in which the Owatonna defense allowed just 16 total yards, the Huskies got on the board first in the second quarter when Williamson capped an 8-play 76-yard drive with a 7-yard touchdown. The possession included an Apple Valley pass interference penalty and a 40-yard catch-and-run by Noah Budach. The Eagles, who simply couldn’t establish any offensive rhythm through the first 22 minutes of the game, took possession late in the second quarter and promptly marched 93 yards for a touchdown. Apple Valley generated four plays of 15-plus yards on the drive and drew within 14-6 after Noah Sanders hit Mohamed Kone for a 15-yard touchdown with 11 seconds on the clock. Apple Valley scored two touchdowns in the third quarter on a pair of offensive possessions that lasted at least 11 plays. Mario Lewis, who has been held in check the entire game, showed off lethal power, footwork and speed in the third quarter, racking up more than 100 yards in the period. As much momentum as Apple Valley possessed, it needed a trick play reverse and a fourth down run just to find the end zone. The Eagles were given new life on their second scoring drive when Owatonna was whistled for a personal foul on fourth down several yards deep in the backfield.

market in 2015 experienced ups and downs, but, overall, the market continues to be promising, with fitness trackers and smart watches being the main drivers of volume and growth. The wearables market experienced higher than expected growth in 2015, especially in fitness trackers, for which unit sales have doubled since 2014. Tractica's 1Q 2016 update has forecasts based on actual 2015 shipment data, vendor activity, innovation over the past 12 months, and, notably, the consumer response to wearables during 2015. 2015 was the biggest year for wearables so far, with fitness trackers outperforming industry expectations, and smart watches coming out strong. While the Apple Watch performed lower than expectations in unit sales, in terms of dollars it is the largest revenue generator in the wearables market with an estimated $5.5 billion in revenue, outperforming even some smartphone device vendors. Meanwhile, whereas fitness is the overwhelming driver for wearables today, there are a number of micro-segments emerging from kids watches, to smart footwear, to elderly fall detectors, that will drive this market forward. Overall, wearables are part of a macro trend where computing is diverging from the smartphone and moving onto the body, driven by sensors, machine learning, big data analytics, and the need for more efficient user interfaces that can allow technology to fade into the background. This Tractica report examines the market trends for wearable devices and presents 6-year market data and forecasts for wearable device shipments and revenue during the period from 2015 through 2021. The extensive and granular market data model covers a number of wearable device types including smart watches, fitness trackers, smart glasses, smart clothing, body sensors, wearable cameras, and other wearables like location trackers, smart jewelry, and gesture control devices. New categories of devices have also been added to this edition including smart footwear, smart headphones, and elderly fall detectors. The forecasts for each device type are segmented by world region, application market, and connectivity technology.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Wearable Device Market Forecasts: Smart Watches, Fitness Trackers, Smart Glasses, Smart Clothing, Body Sensors, Wearable Cameras, and Other Wearable Devices for Consumer, Enterprise, Healthcare, Industrial, Public Safety, Sports, and Other Markets LONDON, Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — The wearables market in 2015 experienced ups and downs, but, overall, the market continues to be promising, with fitness trackers and smart watches being the main drivers of volume and growth. The wearables market experienced higher than expected growth in 2015, especially in fitness trackers, for which unit sales have doubled since 2014. Tractica’s 1Q 2016 update has forecasts based on actual 2015 shipment data, vendor activity, innovation over the past 12 months, and, notably, the consumer response to wearables during 2015. 2015 was the biggest year for wearables so far, with fitness trackers outperforming industry expectations, and smart watches coming out strong. While the Apple Watch performed lower than expectations in unit sales, in terms of dollars it is the largest revenue generator in the wearables market with an estimated $5.5 billion in revenue, outperforming even some smartphone device vendors. Meanwhile, whereas fitness is the overwhelming driver for wearables today, there are a number of micro-segments emerging from kids watches, to smart footwear, to elderly fall detectors, that will drive this market forward. Overall, wearables are part of a macro trend where computing is diverging from the smartphone and moving onto the body, driven by sensors, machine learning, big data analytics, and the need for more efficient user interfaces that can allow technology to fade into the background. This Tractica report examines the market trends for wearable devices and presents 6-year market data and forecasts for wearable device shipments and revenue during the period from 2015 through 2021. The extensive and granular market data model covers a number of wearable device types including smart watches, fitness trackers, smart glasses, smart clothing, body sensors, wearable cameras, and other wearables like location trackers, smart jewelry, and gesture control devices. New categories of devices have also been added to this edition including smart footwear, smart headphones, and elderly fall detectors. The forecasts for each device type are segmented by world region, application market, and connectivity technology.

Actress Lucy Hale has landed a new role as Creative Director of tech accessories brand Casetify. The Pretty Little Liars star has already gotten down to work, designing a 34-piece capsule collection for the company. The range includes colourful Apple watch bands and clutches, but consists primarily of different iPhone cases, with one even featuring images of her white maltipoo, Elvis. Lucy reveals she signed on for the gig because she loves showing off her personality through her accessories. "Most people don't think twice about tech accessories, but really, they should be an extension of who you are and what you wear," she explained. "Choosing your phone case should be a part of picking your everyday wardrobe, like the way you decide what shoes to wear." Meanwhile, Lucy is also showing off her style by fronting the new #HolidayHowTo campaign for online shopping site Shopbop. The actress is sharing her tips on how to dress for the festive party season for the first run of advertisements, while Kate Bosworth will soon offer up tips on how to relax at home. Model Nina Agdal will show fans how to stay fit throughout the season of indulgence. Bosworth and Adgal's promos will roll out in the coming weeks. "We are extremely excited to be launching our global #HolidayHowTo campaign with such a strong talent line-up," Shopbop CEO Darcy Penick states about the new project. "We feel we have cohesively chosen the perfect mix of influencers to both represent and inspire our customers, no matter where they live in the world. We love the idea of our brand ambassadors sharing their own take on how to holiday with SHOPBOP. The campaign captures and reflects what we at SHOPBOP do best - provide our customer with the strongest assortment of curated brands and products, shared through compelling, beautiful content with unrivalled service." © Cover Media Group 2016 Previous: Love vintage fashion?

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ US stocks closed little changed on Monday after rising dramatically the week before and a decline in the technology sector offset a steep rise in financial stocks as investors bet on higher interest rates. After choppy trading late in the session, the Dow ended at a record high while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite dipped. "I think all we're doing is trimming our sails a little from the violently positive rally we had post-election results last week," said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has been under pressure since the Nov. 8 election as investors poured money into sectors such as financials, industrials and energy, which are seen benefiting from President-elect Donald Trump's policies. The financial index rose 2.3 per cent, with banks including Bank of America JPMorgan providing the biggest boost. The index has risen 10.8 per cent since the election on hopes of deregulation and higher interest rates. While the financial rally gained steam, the S&P technology index closed down 1.7 per cent, leading the decliners. The index has fallen 3 per cent since the election. Apple fell 2.5 per cent and weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, followed by Facebook and Microsoft. Since technology valuations have soared in recent years, investors are switching money to sectors such as banks, which has been relatively cheaper but should now benefit from rising interest rates, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Investors have been betting technology will look relatively less attractive if Trump lives up to his promise to review regulation in healthcare and financial sectors and to increase government spending on infrastructure to boost economic growth. "If growth becomes more even and available, we may see a continuation of rotation into lower-valuation, more cyclical businesses and out of high-valuation growth stocks like technology," said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 21.03 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 18,868.69, the S&P 500 lost 0.25 points, or 0.01 per cent, to 2,164.2 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 18.72 points, or 0.36 per cent, to 5,218.40. The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at its December meeting, with traders pricing in a 91-per cent chance, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The industrial index finished up 0.4 per cent, buoyed by prospects for increased infrastructure outlays. Harman International rose 25.2 per cent to $109.72 after Samsung Electronics announced an $8 billion deal to buy the company. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.44-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 82 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 423 new highs and 31 new lows. About 10 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges on Monday, far above the 7.7 billion average for the previous 20 sessions.

Close 2018 Ford EcoSport unveiled at 2016 Los Angeles auto show Nelson Ireson Nov 14, 2016 Follow Nelson Add to circle Like most things at Ford that don't have GT or RS in their name these days, the new Ford EcoSport is about 90 percent hype and 10 percent car. Fortunately, underneath all that ad-speak, the new subcompact crossover utility vehicle is a cute little thing, with some cool features. If Ford can deliver it with the right driving experience, for the right price, those in the market for a fun and functional pint-sized crossover will likely have another great option. If you think the EcoSport looks familiar, you may be well-traveled; Ford has sold the EcoSport in markets outside the U.S. since 2003, launching the current, second-generation vehicle in 2013. In fact, we've even driven it. Ford EcoSport subcompact crossover first drive reviewEnlarge Photo We're getting an updated version for the U.S. launch. However, the EcoSport won't hit the market until early 2018, so details like prices and specifics on options packages, features, technology, and driver assistance systems are still undecided—or at least unannounced. What we can tell you is that it looks pretty good, it has a nice interior, and it ticks the major boxes most small crossover buyers will want to have ticked. Primary among those boxes is Ford's SYNC 3 system, complete with an 8.0-inch floating touch screen, bringing with it Android Auto and Apple Car Play. While Ford is eager to play this up as "living big" despite "going small," the truth is, the availability of a proper smartphone-integrated entertainment system is nearly a prerequisite for relevance today—let alone in early 2018. 2018 Ford EcoSportEnlarge Photo Still, Ford's SYNC 3 system is quite good, and with the major phone-system integration bases covered, you'll get all the features Google and Apple see fit to bake into their hardware and software as well. The other key to the EcoSport is the combination of a ride height that matches some light trucks and an available all-wheel drive system. Yes, Ford calls it "Intelligent 4WD," but there is no low-range function—or any other function that's driver-controlled—and you can't even make it operate all the time in inclement conditions. Under normal driving, the "intelligent" part of the system disengages the rear wheels for better fuel economy; when the system detects wheel slip, yaw, or other metrics that fall within its pre-determined grid, it will activate the all-wheel-drive system, sending an unspecified amount of power rearward. Despite the murky marketing message, the package is about on par with other compact crossovers, and should be serviceable in snow and light mud when equipped with the right tires. 2018 Ford EcoSportEnlarge Photo The name, by the way, is pronounced "echo-sport," differing from the "eek-o-boost" engine that's offered in the base configuration. Just two engine options are offered for North American versions of the EcoSport, and both share a 6-speed automatic transmission. The base engine, which comes only in front-wheel drive, is the 1.0-liter three-cylinder used in several other Ford vehicles. The upgrade option is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, which brings with it your only route to all-wheel drive. Horsepower, torque, and gas mileage figures are still forthcoming, and should be released closer to the vehicle's on-sale date in early 2018. On the tech front, aside from the SYNC 3 system, the EcoSport will also offer an available B&O PLAY (yes, as in Bang & Olufsen) stereo system, featuring 10 speakers (six of them B&O PLAY-branded) and 675 watts of output.

BRINGING INNOVATION TO MARKET If You Want Mainstream Success You Must Be an Underground Hit First Why focusing on fans is essential to making it big. By Mikael Cho Mikael Cho is the founder of Crew, an online marketplace that connects top designers and developers with curated projects. Cho and Crew also created Unsplash, the second fastest-growing photography website ever, behind only Instagram. Unsplash offers free, high-quality images that can be used for anything. @mikaelcho Founder, Crew@mikaelcho WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Volkan Olmen | Unsplash Advertisement As I researched the history of today's most successful creators, I found a pattern. Creators may have different amounts of luck, talent, and hard work. But one thing they all tend to have in common is a fan following before they make it big. Even if it's small, they at least have a lot of attention from a few people. Before Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook, he built a 'reputation as a programming prodigy' at Harvard. His apps were featured in his school newspaper, including one that Microsoft tried to buy. Before comedian Louis C.K. won Emmy Awards and became 'America's Undisputed King of Comedy,' he built an audience doing stand-up comedy in Boston. That led to Louis writing for comedy shows including the Late Show with David Letterman and the Chris Rock Show. Louis then turned a Chris Rock Show skit into Pootie Tang, a film that had poor reviews but became a cult classic. Even Apple, one of the most valuable companies ever, started out with a small, devoted fan base of early computer lovers in the 1970s before anyone had a computer in their home. Market size won't matter without fans To make it big, you'd think it'd be best to please many types of people. But in reality, it's the opposite. Attention spans are shrinking. Competition is a click away. As Kevin Kelly, founder of Wired, wrote the best way to escape today's 'massive competition and endless downward pressure on prices' is to focus on fans. Rushing to please the masses right away may get a little of everyone's attention, but you won't get a lot of anyone's. 3 simple ways to create fans Just like success, having devoted fans won't happen overnight. But you can accelerate the process. Building a fan base isn't complicated. You don't need a degree or a fan-building guru. As a CEO of an online community, I've researched successful audience builders for years. Here's 3 simple things top creators do to build their audiences. 1. Involve people in your process. By involving people in your process and challenges, you become relatable. Your followers develop a deeper connection with you. Trust builds. Louis C.K. shared his bank account when he sold his comedy special directly to his fans on his website for $5. Louis took over the internet for a few days. Blogs and mainstream media picked up his story. And Louis' sales topped $1 million. At our company, we've shared everything from choosing our company name to our investor updates. Let people see behind your curtain. 2. Write like a friend. Just because you're a business doesn't mean you need to sound like one. Words like 'synergy' and 'initiatives' don't connect well with people. Write like you'd write to a friend. Louis C.K. does this with his email newsletter. When he writes, you know it's him. He even has typos which make me connect even more. I don't open many emails but I open every one of Louis'. 3. Share things other than your work. It's not a waste of time to share something interesting that's not your work. It's another way to connect. Mark Zuckerberg's picture of his family dressed up for Halloween got ten times more likes than his post about Facebook two days later. Building a following is a necessary precursor for whatever amount of success you want. Once you have even a few thousand fans, you will be hard to stop. Your fans will handle your marketing. And they will create more fans. Don't worry about being a mainstream success right away. Be an underground hit first.

For the ECB, the issue is what to do about its bond-buying program, which pumps new money into Europe’s struggling economy to try to accelerate growth and inflation. The Fed and the ECB — two of the world’s most important central banks — will be making its policy decisions before Trump is inaugurated Jan. 20. Trump Set to Roll Back Obama Policies on Energy, Environment WASHINGTON (AP) – President-elect Donald Trump is considering an oil billionaire and a North Dakota lawmaker for top posts as he moves to roll back President Barack Obama’s environmental and energy policies. Trump pledges to sharply increase oil and gas drilling on federal lands while opening up offshore drilling in the Atlantic Ocean and other areas where it is blocked. Topping Trump’s to-do list is repealing the Clean Power Plan, Obama’s signature effort to limit carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. Siemens to Buy Oregon-Based Mentor Graphics for $4.5 Billion FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) – German industrial equipment maker Siemens AG says it has agreed to buy U.S.-based software firm Mentor Graphics Corp. for $4.5 billion, broadening Siemens digital capabilities. Siemens said it would pay $37.25 a share in cash, or 21 percent more than Mentor’s closing price on Friday. Mentor, based in Wilsonville, Oregon, specializes in software used to design computer chips, technology with broad potential applications to smart and connected devices such as autonomous vehicles. It has customers in industries ranging from aerospace to consumer electronics and 5,700 employees in 32 countries.  Apple Pay Expands to Charities, Samsung Pay to Offer Rewards NEW YORK (AP) – Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. Apple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now. The American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Invests in Major Airlines NEW YORK (AP) – Warren Buffett is changing his mind about airlines and buying stakes in several major carriers including American Air Lines and Delta Air Lines. The billionaire investor has famously avoided the sector in the past, although his Berkshire Hathaway does own NetJets, which sells partial ownership interests in business jets.

DeStefano  anthony.destefano@newsday.com Reprints + - An NYPD officer leans on a barricade Monday, Nov. 14, 2016, near President-elect Donald Trump's NYC home, the Trump Tower in Manhattan. An NYPD briefing Monday focused on securing the highrise. Photo Credit: Charles Eckert advertisement | advertise on newsday HIGHLIGHTS Highrise’s midtown location presents NYPD with fresh challenges Briefing held to discuss protecting structure from attack With Donald Trump as the next president of the United States, life for New Yorkers is not going to be the same — at least from a security standpoint. The NYPD and U.S. Secret Service are coming to grips with the reality of protecting Trump and his family when they stay in the Big Apple at the president-elect’s glitzy Trump Tower at 725 Fifth Ave. Most Popular Cops: Parade will be safe, despite ISIS threat Cops: Protesters occupy Schumer's D.C. office Officials: LI man kills NYPD cop from Huntington Trump protesters in NYC: 'Immigrants are welcome here' AG: 14 arrested in 'sophisticated' cocaine ring Police held an internal briefing Monday on the types of security challenges they may face and cops will be meeting with the Secret Service later this week, an NYPD spokesman said. See alsoWho else voted for Trump like LI did?See alsoVoters guide resultsSee alsoMap: See how America voted Protecting Trump when he stays at his Manhattan residence “will have a big impact on us, bigger than we may know,” said Robert Strang, head of the Investigative Management Group, an international security firm with offices in Manhattan and Miami. “We have had visits quite often from Obama and Bush, and it is disruptive, no questions. Streets are closed and traffic is jammed and people detoured blocks away. I have a feeling this will be part of our city life.” The 58-story Trump Tower, built in 1983 with a glass facade, is an added security burden because the building will likely need structural retrofitting and reinforcement to withstand a blast, whether from a small package explosive or a car or truck bomb, security officials said. Built nearly two decades before the Sept 11, 2001, terror attacks, the structure didn’t have to conform to the stricter city building codes of today. Already, the city has installed sand-filled sanitation trucks in front of the building as a temporary measure to block any vehicles attempting to ram it. Fifty-sixth Street between Fifth and Madison avenues is likely to be closed to all traffic whenever Trump is in town, said NYPD spokesman Stephen Davis. Fifth Avenue, said Davis, is likely to have two lanes closest to the tower blocked off as well, perhaps on a permanent basis. That would leave three lanes for traffic. advertisement | advertise on newsday The tower’s glass facade, common on many Fifth Avenue buildings, could sustain damage in an explosion, sending shards over a wide distance. Some experts said that as much as 50 percent of injuries to civilians in previous terrorist explosions were caused by flying glass. Car bombs against buildings can also cause a complete or partial collapse, said Israeli security expert Arye Kasten of MIP Security. Kasten said one way of remedying that would be to increase the distance between a potential explosion and the building by putting up barriers such bollards — thick posts, usually made of concrete or steel. Strang said any costs would ultimately be borne by the federal government. PoliticsPhotos: Election Day on LI Police officials said that a blast assessment, a common study done by many building owners, was likely done on Trump Tower years ago but may have to be re-examined. These studies take into consideration intelligence information, known threats and a structure’s vulnerability, said Prof. Ted Krauthammer, head of the Center For Infrastructure Protection and Physical Security at the University of Florida.

Now, a new rumor is going around claiming that Samsung is planning to include a pressure-sensitive display on the Galaxy S8. “Samsung is mulling to adopt the force touch technology partially from the S8 but the full adoption will come in one or two years. It is a matter of time before other major Android smartphone makers deploy the technology that will help enhance user interface,” an anonymous official form a Samsung supplier told The Investor. The technology is pretty similar to Apple’s 3D Touch and Force Touch technologies that are found on the iPhone display and the MacBook trackpads. On the iPhone, 3D Touch allows users to bring up shortcuts for apps, activating a live photo and some other useful features depending on how hard a user presses the display. On MacBook trackpads, Force Touch relies on how hard a user presses down on the trackpad to determine different types of clicks. Related Stories Samsung Galaxy S8 Rumors: Latest Iteration Might Have Much Larger Display Will Samsung Do Away With The Home Button? What remains a mystery for everyone is how exactly Samsung wants to implement 3D/Force Touch on the Galaxy S8. The anonymous Samsung supplier stated that the phone maker is only considering to add the technology “partially” instead of fully adopting it. The problem with the supplier's statement is that no one knows exactly what the difference is between a partial adoption and full adoption of force touch technology. It’s possible that software integration of the tech will be limited, as pointed out by Android Authority. If that’s the case, the force touch technology on the Galaxy S8 may not come with a lot of features. This isn’t the first time that Samsung is rumored to be adding a pressure-sensitive display on one of its smartphones. Last year, the Samsung Galaxy S7 was rumored to come with that same technology, as pointed out by CNET. However, that never happened to the Galaxy 7, which ended up with a normal screen. Samsung has already made large investments in research and development for pressure-sensitive displays this year, so adopting the technology for the Galaxy S8, albeit partially, is a huge possibility.

According to a report in Bloomberg, Apple is currently testing a pair of smart glasses that displays “images and other information” and seamlessly connects to your iPhone, which is much like how the Watch operates. This wearable sounds similar to Google Glass, which was released in 2013 and later shelved. Apple is reportedly in the “exploration phase” and has ordered a small amount of near-eye displays from one of its suppliers. Apple tests several new product ideas and many do not make it to market. However, if this product does come to life the earliest release date will apparently be in 2018. Apple declined to comment on the report. Apple’s CEO Tim Cook has been hinting the company might make a push into augmented reality and this might be its product. In July, Cook noted, “AR can be really great. We have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We’re high on AR in the long run.” Source Bloomberg The Iceman Cometh This has been done already and Microsoft will be leaps and bounds ahead of them early next year with their VR offerings and the W10 Creators Edition upgrade Marc Palumbo I think that this will be a lot simpler than what Microsoft is planning. I would imagine this will be closer to the original Google Glass project. They’ll want it to be fashionable on your face. Also, I can’t see it having a small form factor without sacrificing hardware. Just comparing it to HoloLens, I don’t think they would want to compete with that just yet. But then again, Apple may give you some cheap piece of hardware (which they are not known for).

The Xiaomi MI MIX has set a new record on the Chinese market by selling all of its units in just 10 seconds. The only device that came close to their record was another Xiaomi device, the MI Note 2 which was sold out in less than 50 seconds. To keep customers on their toes if they want to buy one of their device, only 10.000 units of their devices are going to be released each month. The secret behind Xiaomi’s success is that they are copying their competitors ideas. Everybody knows that their devices are copying features that Apple and Samsung use for their own devices. Even the OS used for their system is similar to Apple’s iOS, but slowly and surely they are moving away from that in order to create their own Xiaomi OS. Xiaomi has gotten the idea to use frame less screen displays for their devices from Sharp’s Aquos Crystal. Sharp’s device was released during 2015 but it did not manage to cause as much hype as Xiaomi did. What makes the Mi MIX special is its display, it has 91.3% ratio on its surface and rounded display corners. Because the display occupied the upper part of the device Xiaomi had to find a new place to position their front camera, and they put the camera on the bottom side, the same way Sharp did with their device. Because of the display ratio, the proximity sensor had to be removed as well. The Chinese manufactures decided to install in its place a gesture recognition sensor that was created by Elliptic Lab, it uses ultrasounds to appreciate the distance between itself and other objects, so the display turns on when you approach your hand to it.

By Corinne Reichert | November 15, 2016 -- 00:28 GMT (16:28 PST) | Topic: Telcos Market research company Kantar has published the latest statistics on mobile market share in Australia, revealing that Telstra, Optus, Amaysim, Aldi Mobile, and Boost grew their total market share, while Vodafone Hutchison Australia (VHA), Virgin Mobile, TPG, and other mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) dropped customers. Overall, the no-contract sector now makes up 15.4 percent of the mobile market, up from 11.9 percent last year, while post-paid was down from 55.6 percent to 53.4 percent and prepaid from 32.6 percent to 31.2 percent. Latest Australian news ​Department of Finance to rebuild two-year-old IT system Telstra launches Smart Home devices and pricing ​Turnbull's DTA to establish a whole-of-government program management office Vodafone continues losing customers as Telstra, Optus, Amaysim gain: Kantar Australian banks dismiss Android NFC past in Apple Pay negotiations The Australian mobile market remained fairly stagnant; the strongest growth was from Optus, which clocked a rise in total mobile market share of just under 1 percentage point over the year -- from 21.4 percent in September 2015 to 22.3 percent in September 2016. Kantar attributed this to "strong promotional campaigns between Apple and Optus", noting that 40 percent of Optus' new customers came from Telstra. Optus' growth was driven by its gains in both post-paid and no contract: In the former, it rose by almost 2 percentage points, from 22.6 to 24.3 percent market share; and in the latter, it held 19.5 percent market share, up from 17.7 percent last year. In prepaid, Optus remained fairly stable, from 20.9 percent down to 20.2 percent market share. Aldi Mobile grew by the second-highest amount -- 0.8 percentage points -- up from 2.2 percent to 3 percent of the total mobile market share. This was mostly due to its jump from 4.5 percent to 7.3 percent market share in the prepaid sector, although it also grew by 0.1 percentage point to make up 1.4 percent of the no-contract market. Kantar said 37 percent of Aldi's new customers came from Optus, which it attributed to "the offer of cheaper calls". Aldi fell by 0.2 percentage points in post-paid, down to 0.9 percent market share, however. Telstra also made slight gains despite its seven outages during the year, with a total market share of 39.9 percent, up 0.2 percentage points year on year from the 39.7 percent reported at the end of September 2015. For the prepaid sector, Telstra rose from 39.9 percent market share up to 41.5 percent over the year, while it fell by just 0.1 percentage point down to 41.2 percent of the post-paid market share. For the no-contract segment, Telstra remained stable, at 31.9 percent. Despite Amaysim's AU$70 million acquisition of Vaya in January, its total mobile market share rose by just 0.3 percentage points over the year, up to 4.9 percent. Across prepaid, it rose by 0.2 percentage points to hold 6.1 percent of the market; in post-paid, it grew by 0.2 percentage points up to 2.1 percent of the market; and in no contract, it decreased by 0.4 percentage points down to 12.4 percent. Boost rose by just 0.1 percentage point to hold 0.7 percent of total mobile market share thanks to gains across both prepaid and post-paid, partially offset by a loss in no contract. As of September 30, it held 1.9 percent of the prepaid market; 0.2 percent of post-paid; and 0.3 percent of no contract. VHA -- which includes numbers from Vodafone, Three, and Crazy John's -- fell by 0.2 percentage points in total market share, down to holding just 14.9 percent of the Australian mobile market. In prepaid, VHA accounted for 14.6 percent of the market as of September 30, down from 15.3 percent; and in post-paid, it remained stable, at 16.1 percent. The no-contract market segment was the one area where VHA saw growth, rising from 9.9 percent a year ago to 11.2 percent. Virgin Mobile also fell across most categories, down by 0.5 percentage points from 5.7 percent to 5.2 percent total mobile market share. It dropped by 1.8 percentage points to hold 3 percent of the prepaid market; rose by 0.5 percentage points to hold 6.6 percent of the post-paid market; and lost 0.5 percentage points to hold 4.9 percent of the no-contract market. TPG and iiNet accounted for just 2.7 percent of the total mobile market, down from 3.1 percent this time last year. Its prepaid customer base fell from 1.4 percent to 0.8 percent of the market; its post-paid customers accounted for 1.9 percent of the market, down from 2.8 percent; and its no-contract customers amounted to 9.4 percent of the market, down from 9.6 percent. Other MVNOs also dropped customers across the board, from 7.5 percent down to 6.4 percent of the total mobile market, dropping customers across every category -- down by 0.9 percentage points in prepaid, to 4.5 percent market share; down by 1.1 percentage points in post-paid, to 6.8 percent market share; and down by 2 percentage points in no contract, to 9 percent market share. (Image: Screenshot by Corinne Reichert/ZDNet) According to Kantar, Telstra has the highest customer loyalty, at 94 percent, followed by Aldi Mobile, at 92 percent. In addition to Vodafone losing customers, the Australian Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) last month reported that consumer complaints about Vodafone increased substantially during July to September 2016 to 6.2 complaints per 10,000 services in operation (SIO) -- almost two-thirds more than last quarter's 3.8. Vodafone experienced a 4G mobile outage in September affecting data, voice, and text messages caused by a router issue, but attributed its rise in complaints to "administrative matters", pointing out that its complaints number remains "in line with the industry average". Over the quarter, complaints about all telcos numbered 6.2 per 10,000 SIO, up from last year's 5.5 but down slightly from last quarter's 6.4. Optus saw the most complaints last quarter, with 7.2 per 10,000 SIO, up from 6.7 last year; Telstra's complaints continued rising year on year, from 5.5 during the same quarter last year to 6 this year; and Amaysim's complaints also rose slightly, from 0.9 last year to 1.1 this quarter. The TIO is due to release its annual report later this week.

Mr Noonan will hold the meetings after talks with US treasury secretary Jacob Lew in Washington DC yesterday on Ireland’s tax system and he prepares to hold crunch negotiations directly with Irish-based multi-nationals under pressure to return jobs to the US. The meetings are part of a week-long US business visit which is officially about giving Mr Noonan an update briefing on the US, IMF and World Bank concerns over the Brexit fallout after he was unable to attend a previous meeting due to a scheduling clash with the Irish budget. However, the Department of Finance has confirmed the week-long visit is also focused on giving Mr Noonan a chance to press home Ireland’s desire for continued investment amid growing concerns multinationals will be forced to return to the US under Donald Trump’s presidency. READ NEXT Michael Conlon, former county manager dies, age 90 During his meeting with US treasury secretary Mr Lew yesterday, Mr Noonan is understood to have been quizzed over the Apple controversy and the ability of large American firms such as Google, Facebook and LinkedIn to avail of the 12.5% corporate tax rate in Ireland. In response, he stressed Ireland’s concerns over US president Donald Trump’s plans to slash America’s corporate tax rate to 15%, and said the fact Ireland is a key, English-speaking European Union member opens up opportunities in the wider EU market for firms in this country. Today, Mr Noonan will travel to California to hold similar meetings with IMF and World Bank officials over the need for ongoing investment if the Irish recovery is to continue. He will later attend several IDA-related engagements with US business leaders, before holding direct talks with leading Irish-based multi-national firms in the coming days in a bid to entice them to continue their operations in this country. The meetings took place as the chief executive of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland, Mark Redmond, rejected claims an exodus of Irish-based firms is imminent due to Mr Trump’s controversial tax plans. While urging people not to be “alarmist” about the future of 700 American companies in Ireland and the 140,000 jobs they provide as the Chamber is “constantly engaging” with US groups, Mr Redmond could not say if the Chamber is speaking directly with anyone in Mr Trump’s inner circle as “quite frankly the world doesn’t know” who they are. Meanwhile, EU foreign ministers met yesterday to agree new security strategies for the common market area in light of the US election. Officials agreed to improve supports for non-EU nations at risk of potential unrest in the east and to “tighten” legal oversight in other countries READ MORE Visit the section home page here KEYWORDS Michael Noonan, Donald Turmp, US firms, tax © Irish Examiner Ltd.

(Melanie Tan Pelaez/Facebook) A Sydney mother claims she suffered second-degree burns after falling asleep with her iPhone 7 charging while resting on her arm. Melanie Tan Pelaez said she fell asleep while watching movies on her phone and woke up with pins and needles down her arm on October 31. "I went to get dressed and realised my arm was very red, so I then went to the GP and they advised me I needed to go straight to the hospital," the pregnant mother told news.com.au. Ms Tan Pelaez was told to check around her bed for what could have burnt her and quickly identified her phone as the culprit, matching the device and charger with the marks on her arm. She said she took to the phone to an Apple store where staff initially said the device could not have burnt her because it did not have "a distinct smell". "I then got a call from a member of the executive team who told me they were now handing the matter and had sent the phone to a senior technician in California for testing," Ms Tan Pelaez said. She said she was offered a replacement phone but rejected the offer because she no longer trusted the device. Ms Tan Pelaez has also warned others about the phone on Facebook. She has since been to the emergency room twice and may need to undergo plastic surgery to heal the scars left on her arm.

Elyse Betters15 November 2016Phones Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Samsung is really trying to come up with new ways to lure in customers. Despite the major fiasco it caused with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and its faulty, exploding battery, which involved two major government recalls and a permanent end in production, Samsung is pushing forward with the next version of its flagship: the Galaxy S8. This smartphone is rumoured to feature many bells and whistles, including an edge display for both models, and according to a recent report, a Force Touch-like display. If true, the Galaxy S8 would be the first smartphone from Samsung to come with pressure-sensitive technology, which Apple refers to as "Force Touch" or sometimes "3D Touch" in its iPhones. An anonymous source told Korean news publication The Investor that Samsung is hoping to adopt Apple's Force Touch technology partially for the Galaxy S8, but full adoption in the range won't come for one or two more years, apparently. Force Touch-like technology is based entirely around a pressure-sensitive display, which enables an extra level of functionality based on how hard you press it. Press and hold on an app icon, for instance, and a menu will appear with options, such as compose a message or take a selfie or whatever is relevant. Apple has been using the feature since the launch of the iPhone 6S in 2015, as well as the Apple Watch and newer MacBooks. Other rumoured features for the Galaxy S8 include two cameras and a dual-curved screen. Check out Pocket-lint's rumour roundup for more details on what the upcoming flagship might feature.

The movie, produced by You Know Films in association with Atlantic Films, documents the story of how the drum machine became one of the most iconic musical instruments of the past 40 years despite only being in production from 1980 through 1983. 808 was written by Alexander Dunn and Luke Bainbridge and produced by Alex Noyer, who also serves as executive producer; Alexander Dunn, who directed the film; Atlantic Records chairman/co-CEO Craig Kallman; and Arthur Baker, also a co-executive producer.  Narrated by Beats 1's Zane Lowe, it includes wide-ranging interviews with the likes of Afrika Bambaataa, Questlove, Pharrell, Rick Rubin, David Guetta, Phil Collins and several more, each of which pay tribute to the over-arching influence of a machine that changed the sound of music. Read more: 'Ghost In The Shell' Trailer Leans Into Its Whitewashing Controversy "The 808 has left an impactful mark on my life; it's been the driving force for so may of my favorite records and I jumped at the chance to be involved," Lowe says. "I wanted to learn more about how this incredible drum machine came to exist and it's been exciting to hear other people's stories and what it means to them. It's the magic ingredient." At its SXSW premiere in March 2015, Billboard spoke to Noyer about developing the film based on "the cult of the 808." "In the beginning, we wanted to find out what this machine means to people -- their attachments, emotional memories, practical dependencies on it," Noyer said. "We wanted to illustrate its legacy in hip-hop and electronic music. So we spoke with musicians over the course of three years, and it was astonishing how deep the industry's relationship with the 808 goes. Fatboy Slim told us his whole career was impacted by it. By the time we were done shooting, Luke Bainbridge and Alex Dunn weaved all the little surprises and twists together into a story about how the sound traveled." The film will be preceded by its soundtrack, out Nov. 25 on all platforms via Big Beat Records, called 808: The Music, which will feature both old and new tracks, including Bambaataa's iconic "Planet Rock" as well as the soundtrack's first single "Nothing But Trouble" by Lil Wayne and Charlie Puth. Check out a new trailer for the film above and the official tracklist for the accompanying album below. 1. Afrika Bambaataa & The Soulsonic Force, "Planet Rock" 2. Beastie Boys, "Paul Revere" 3. Public Enemy, "Yo! Bum Rush the Show" 4. Man Parrish, "Hip Hop Be Bop (Don't Stop)" 5. Planet Patrol, "Play At Your Own Risk" 6. Shannon, "Let The Music Play" 7. Strafe, "Set It Off" 8. T La Rock / Jazzy J, "It's Yours" 9. 808 State, "Flow Coma" 10. Felix da Housecat, "Kickdrum" 11. Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz, "What U Gon' Do" (feat. Lil Scrappy) 12. Flux Pavilion, "Vibrate" 13. Jamie xx, "Gosh" 14. Lil Wayne & Charlie Puth, "Nothing But Trouble" This article first appeared on Billboard.com.

Yesterday AAPL: 105.71 -2.72 Review: CalDigit USB-C Dock – an okay solution for MacBook Pro owners, if you’re willing to make compromises [Video] Jeff Benjamin - 17 hours ago @JeffBenjam MacBook Pro USB-C View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit The Late 2016 MacBook Pro lacks many of the convenient ports that we’ve seen on previous MacBook releases. But if there’s a silver lining to be found, it’s that the USB-C ports featured on the new machines are super-versatile. With a single USB-C cable, for instance, you can tap into CalDigit’s USB-C Dock, which gains you instant access to multiple legacy USB-A ports, Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort 1.2, an extra USB-C port, and an additional 3.5mm headphone jack along with a microphone jack. In addition, the unit is able to charge a MacBook up to 60W. That means that the dock should do fine charging the smaller 13″ MacBook Pro at full speed, but will take a bit longer charging the 15″ MacBook Pro that ships with a larger power adapter. CalDigit’s USB-C Dock isn’t a perfect device, but it does a pretty good job of turning the new MacBook Pro into a desktop-worthy machine, if you can put up with the compromises you’ll have to make in order to use it. Have a look at our hands-on video walkthrough for the details. Design & Build Quality CalDigit’s USB-C Dock is fully comprised of aluminum, with an interesting texture ridge surface on the top and bottom. The dock is designed much in the same way as CalDigit’s Tuff line of USB-C portable drives. It’s nice that the unit is all aluminum and not plastic, but there is a certain hollowness to the dock that makes it seem a little more fragile than its build quality might initially suggest. For example, when you sit the dock down on a desk, you’ll hear a slight rattle from the parts within. The good thing about the aluminum design is that the casing works like a giant heat sink to help dissipate heat. That means that there’s no need for noisy fans. The USB-C Dock features four rubber feet on the bottom of the device to keep it from sliding around on your desk. That, combined with the unit’s substantial weight, should prevent it from sliding around while on your desk, even when it’s inundated with various cable connections. You’ll notice a small LED indicator light on the left side of the dock next to the CalDigit logo. When this light is green, it means that there’s a successful connection to your computer, with the dock providing full power. If the LED indicator is red it means that maximum power isn’t being supplied to the computer. Here is how CalDigit explains it on its FAQ: When laptop charging is down to 15W, the front LED indicator light will turn red. If your computer requires more than 15W to operate, it may not be enough power to sustain the battery and we recommend plugging in your OEM charging cable. This might happen when connecting to a Thunderbolt 3 laptop workstation such as MSI WT72 or any other high-power mobile computer. All functionality including video and USB data are still supported. Video review Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Mac-centric videos Connectivity I’ve been testing CalDigit’s dock with my 2016 MacBook Pro (without TouchBar). This machine features only two USB-C (Thunderbolt 3 ports), so it heavily benefits from a dock that expands its connectivity options. CalDigit includes a 0.5-meter USB-C cable in the box, which may be a little short for the needs of some. However, the company offers a slightly higher-priced SKU that includes a 1-meter cable as well. Either way, it shouldn’t be a big deal, as you can always use a third-party USB-C cable as long as it’s certified. For the record, CalDigit’s dock isn’t a Thunderbolt 3 dock, but it does work with the USB-C form factor, which is used by ThunderBolt 3. CalDigit’s dock supports USB 3.1 gen 1 (5Gbps), and allows users to connect external displays via its DisplayPort or HDMI port found on its rear. Although I knew going into this review that CalDigit’s dock only supported USB and not Thunderbolt, I was a little disappointed to learn that the dock is USB 3.1 gen 1-only. USB 3.1 gen 2, which is the real implementation of USB 3.1, affords much faster speeds — up to 10 Gbps. Admittedly, there aren’t many USB devices yet available that support this higher USB 3.1 gen 2 speed, and the legacy devices that the majority of people connect will be USB 3.0 or slower. With this in mind, I suppose it’s not a very big deal, but it does limit the growth potential of the dock. Ports As noted, CalDigit’s USB-C Dock makes it easy to quickly add a plethora of ports to the MacBook Pro. Here is a brief look at all of the connections that you’ll find on this dock. USB-A 3.0 CalDigit includes three legacy USB-A ports for connecting peripherals to your MacBook that have not yet been updated with USB-C cables. You’ll find two USB-A ports on the rear of the dock, and another USB-A port conveniently located on the front of the dock. The front-facing USB-A port supports faster charging (5V @ 2.1A), which will recharge an iPhone faster than the typical 5W power adapter that Apple includes with its phones. CalDigit includes a handy “Docking Station utility” that runs in your Mac’s menu bar. This utility allows users to quickly disconnect all USB storage devices safely in one fell swoop. USB-C You’ll find two USB-C ports on the rear of the CalDigit Dock. The first port is an uplink port that’s used to connect to your MacBook via the included USB-C cable. The second port is for connecting other USB-C-enabled devices to the dock. This second USB-C port features the ability to provide 15W of power to an iPad or other device. I found this port to be unreliable when it came to charging my iPad or iPhone. It appears that when a display is connected, even at a low resolution, the dock is only able to provide 2W of power instead of 10W for an iPhone (or 15W for an iPad). An iPad Pro won’t even charge when fed 2W. HDMI 2.0 A single HDMI 2.0 port is located on the rear of the CalDigit unit as well. This HDMI port lets users easily connect to external displays, although 4K displays will be capped at 30 Hz. DisplayPort 1.2 Along with HDMI, you’ll find a full-sized DisplayPort connection for connecting to external displays. The benefit of the DisplayPort connection is that it will support 4K @ 60 Hz, but you’ll need to make a pretty hefty compromise in order to do so. CalDigit ships its USB-C dock with firmware that keeps 4K @ 60 Hz disabled. Users will be able to update the dock’s firmware to enable 4K @ 60 Hz, but the update tool is only available for Windows machines at the moment. As someone who has a hard time handling 30 Hz refresh rates, I tried to install the updated firmware via a Windows 10 VMWare instance, but couldn’t get it working. Thus, I went ahead and installed Windows 10 on a Boot Camp partition, and was able to successfully install the updated firmware. CalDigit provides both the upgraded and stock firmware via a download. The process is fairly painless, but you’ll need to wait a few minutes before the installation completes. If you ever wish to downgrade back to stock firmware, the process is just as easy. Managing firmware via Windows 10 running on a Boot Camp partition After the firmware was installed, I was able to output full 4K resolution at a silky smooth 60 Hz on the AOC 32″ 4K monitor that I’m currently testing. I used SwitchResX to quickly change resolutions, and confirmed the refresh rate within the macOS System Information Utility. Needless to say, the firmware upgrade made a huge difference as far as usability is concerned. 1920 x 1080 in HiDPI (pixel-doubled retina mode) at 60 Hz. So what’s the compromise that I’ve been harping about? It’s not the fact that you’ll have to update the firmware using Windows, though that is annoying for sure. It’s the fact that upping the display output capabilities puts the kibosh on USB bandwidth for any devices connected to the dock’s four USB ports. Yes, bandwidth is outright reduced after updating the firmware, even if you’re not connected to a display running 4K @ 60 Hz. I also noticed that charging output for the 15W USB-C port was reduced as well. The CalDigit Tuff drive’s read and write speeds prior to firmware upgrade… By updating the firmware to lend more display bandwidth, you’re essentially downgrading the amount of available bandwidth for all USB devices. As a result, any device connected to the USB ports will slow down to USB 2.0 speeds. It’s similar to the situation that occurs with the LG USB-C 4K display that we reviewed earlier in the year. …and after the upgrade There’s currently no ETA as to when the firmware tool will be available to Mac users, but if you’re considering this dock for connecting to an external 4K display, and 60 Hz is a must, you’ll need to be aware of the substantial negative effect it will have on USB bandwidth. If you’re not someone who plans on running a 4K display, or simply don’t care about 60 Hz refresh rates, then you’ll be able to retain full USB bandwidth with no issues. Gigabit Ethernet If you prefer to connect your MacBook to your local network via Ethernet, then you’ll be happy to have a Gigabit Ethernet connection readily at your disposal. You will, however, need to install an Ethernet LAN driver provided by CalDigit. Headphone and microphone inputs Alongside the USB-A port on the front of the dock, you’ll find a pair of 3.5mm inputs for microphone and headphone connections. Surprisingly, the new MacBook Pro does retain its 3.5mm headphone port, but it’s nice to be able to use the dock’s port, which lets users maintain the clean look of a single cable connection. Conclusion It’s a great feeling to be able to connect a single cable and instantly have access to a display, external drives, my audio mixer and microphone, headphones, and even Gigabit Ethernet. What makes such a setup even better is that you don’t have to use the MacBook’s included 61W USB-C power adapter, or the 2-meter USB-C cable that comes with it. It means you can keep your MacBook charger in your laptop bag or plugged in to a wall for use while away from your desk. If there’s one major head-scratcher of an omission, it’s the lack of an SD Card reader. That seems like such an obvious thing to include on a dock that’s marketed at MacBook users. The lack of an SD Card slot has been the subject of some of the most vocal debates concerning the new MacBook Pro, so I feel like CalDigit missed a big opportunity here. But the biggest downside of the CalDigit USB-C Dock is the lack of Thunderbolt 3, which means that there’s a lack of 4K support at 60 Hz unless you’re willing to sacrifice USB bandwidth. And even if you’re willing to give up said bandwidth, you’d need access to a Windows machine to install the firmware that makes it possible. Personally speaking, I think that having 4K @ 60 Hz takes a bigger priority over USB bandwidth. If you own a MacBook with four USB-C ports, you can always use one of those extra ports for connecting devices like external drives. All of that said, there will be those who don’t plan on connecting to a 4K display, and/or those who are fine running 4K @ 30 Hz. For these ones, the CalDigit USB-C Dock is a flawed, but okay stop-gap solution until Thunderbolt 3 accessories and docks become more prevalent. You can find the CalDigit USB-C dock for around $150, or for slightly higher if you want the included 1-meter USB-C cable.

Samsung on Monday introduced a new rewards program for its mobile payments app that will allow consumers to "double-dip" by earning both credit card rewards and points to redeem for Samsung products. Called Samsung Rewards, the program combines elements of frequent flyer accounts and credit cards that offer miles or points for each dollar that you spend. There are different tiers that correspond to how many transactions you make, from 10 points per transaction for under 5 transactions per month, to 40 points each for 31 or more transactions per month. //Related Articles Samsung: Hacking Samsung Pay is Very Difficult The program launches in the US this week, and early adopters will be able to redeem points for Samsung products, vouchers for Samsung.com, or a prepaid Visa debit card. Redemptions will expand in the coming months to "exclusive events and experiences," Samsung wrote in a blog post. You'll have to visit an online rewards catalog to check how many points are required for redemptions; the terms and conditions state that Samsung can modify point values "at any time for any reason." Samsung is introducing its rewards program as it faces intense competition from other mobile payments providers. Archrivals Google and Apple have been introducing new features like ATM compatibility and public transit payments as they seek to capture a bigger portion of the nascent mobile payments market. One of Samsung Pay's main advantages is that it can be used with virtually any credit card reader, so merchants don't have to invest in new ones designed for wireless payments. The new rewards program, meanwhile, will appeal mostly to Samsung loyalists who already use Samsung Pay extensively and will jump at the chance to get free gear from the Korean tech giant for transactions they would make anyway.

Ken Sunny   November 15, 2016 10:48 IST 1 Shares 1 Shares 2017 Ford EcoSportFord American carmaker Ford unveiled the new EcoSport ahead of the Los Angeles Auto Show in USA. The model is India bound and, as expected, it features a design in line with Ford's bigger SUVs — the Kuga and the Edge. The face of the compact SUV sports one-piece hexagonal grille in place of the split grille in the current version. The new grille houses two horizontal chrome slats. The headlamps, fog lamps and the front bumper have been reworked at front. The side profile remains untouched barring new alloy wheels. The rear door mounted spare wheel, one of the highlights in the design of the current EcoSport, has been dropped in the US version. However, the Asia-bound version is expected to continue with rear-mounted wheels as it is a popular feature in the region. Why advertise with us?

Close Ford EcoSport subcompact SUV finally debuts in US Viknesh Vijayenthiran Nov 14, 2016 Follow Viknesh Add to circle The Ford Motor Company [NYSE:F] EcoSport is a subcompact SUV that's loosely based on the Fiesta and was shown for the first time in 2012. It’s Ford’s smallest SUV and was originally targeted at developing markets. However, the automaker has consistently hinted that it might end up in the United States—and now it has. Ford on Monday previewed a U.S.-spec EcoSport ahead of a formal debut on Wednesday at the 2016 Los Angeles auto show. We won’t see it in showrooms for over a year, though. Ford has confirmed that the market launch won’t take place until early 2018. The EcoSport is designed to take on vehicles like the Chevrolet Trax, Honda HR-V and Nissan Juke. In standard trim it will come with a turbocharged 1.0-liter inline-3 and front-wheel drive. A 2.0-liter model with standard all-wheel drive will be available, and a 6-speed automatic will be fitted across the range. 2018 Ford EcosportEnlarge Photo Rather than driving fun, Ford likes to tout the car’s connectivity features. That’s not surprising as the automaker is clearly targeting urban-dwelling millennials. The EcoSport will come with Ford’s Sync 3 infotainment system as standard, meaning it will have Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. The main interface will be an 8.0-inch touchscreen display. The EcoSport will also come with two fast-charging USB ports to ensure owners’ devices are always juiced. Plus, there’s a 12-volt power outlet. An available 110-volt outlet positioned behind the center console and another 12-volt outlet allow rear-seat passengers to stay plugged in, too. There will also be plenty of storage solutions to house devices. Ford says the EcoSport will come with as many as 30 stowage pockets, bins, hooks make efficient use of every interior inch. In addition, a cargo management system at the rear features a movable floor board and fold-away second-row seats to provide a flat area for transport larger items.

When we tested Ford's 2017 Escape earlier in the year, we were blasted with statistic after statistic that made evident just how enormous the SUV market was. Here at the LA Auto Show, Ford's wasting little time in giving those hungry SUV buyers yet another (albeit bantam) option: EcoSport. Driving away 2017 Ford Explorer road trip The EcoSport, which will hit North American dealer lots in early 2018, isn't yet priced. What is certain, however, is that this will become one of the most attainable new cars with loads of new tech onboard. Despite being small and almost certainly priced at entry-level, Ford's offering an optional 675-watt B&O Play premium sound system, HD Radio, SiriusXM, and even a dual FM antenna "that boosts the range and clarity of FM signals." Believe it or not, Intelligent 4WD is also an option (standard on the 2.0-liter engine), and the mini-ute is engineered for handsfree enjoyment when it comes to infotainment. There's a floating 8-inch high-resolution display that houses SYNC 3 as well as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. To boot, drivers have the ability to start, lock, unlock and locate their vehicle from almost anywhere using available SYNC Connect with FordPass. Open up! You'll also get a pair of fast-charging USB ports and a 12-volt power outlet; there's an available 110-volt outlet positioned behind the center console and another 12-volt outlet allow rear-seat passengers to stay plugged in, too. Interior of the Ford EcoSport Our guess is that Ford is positioning this for use by urban dwellers – the young folk who want things like CarPlay, but can't justify a full-size sedan. It's downright tiny for a four-door vehicle, but that back seat is more likely to be seen folded down (to increase cargo space) than folded up (toting humans).  Seating in the Ford EcoSport Unfortunately, the automaker isn't ready to talk price, but it'll probably be along the lines of the Fiat 500 and Smart Fortwo. The Escape is pretty tight as-is, so the only reasonable market here are those who want as little car as possible for commuting, but would jump at the chance to get a wee bit more space and technological elegance at the same relative price point. As for the electric version? Yeah, we're wondering as well.  Testing out the 2017 Ford Escape ABOUT THE AUTHOR Darren Murph Darren Murph has roamed the consumer electronics landscape for a decade, earning a Guinness World Record as the planet’s most prolific professional blogger along the way.

Although Ford says the model is all-new, it is essentially just a facelifted version of the EcoSport available elsewhere in the world. Nevertheless, it acts as an interesting addition to Ford’s North American range and according to the brand, “is a perfect companion for those who believe in going small and living big”. Customers of the 2018 EcoSport will be able to opt for either a 1.0-liter three-cylinder turbocharged engine or a larger 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Ford hasn’t released technical specifications of these engines just yet but has confirmed that the 2.0-liter unit will come paired with a four-wheel drive system as standard. Both will then be coupled with six-speed automatic transmissions. Despite the model’s small size, Ford has packed the cabin full with all of its latest technologies, including the new B&O Play audio system as standard on the EcoSport Titanium featuring 10 speakers and 675 watts of power. This audio system was developed in part by acoustic engineers from Harman and promises to provide an excellent listening environment. Elsewhere, the EcoSport includes SiriusXM satellite radio, a dual FM radio antenna and HD Radio technology incorporated into Ford’s SYNC 3 communications and entertainment system. The 8-inch system also supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Also found within the sub-compact SUV are two fast-charging USB ports, two 12-volt power outlets and a 110-volt outlet. In total, customers will be able to opt between four different trim levels, the S, SE, SES and Titanium. All are offered with the same palette of 10 exterior color options as well as seven ambient lighting options. While the Titanium is the range-topper, the SES is the sportiest of the four and includes four-wheel drive, sport-tuned suspension and steering as well as copper accents throughout the interior, including on the sport seats. Ford says the EcoSport will arrive in local dealerships in early 2018. Prices have yet to be released.

Auto Show Coverage SUVs continue to dominate the market in all shapes and sizes, and Ford is expanding its lineup of offerings with the 2018 EcoSport, which is making its North American debut at the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show. The smallest SUV that Ford has in its global showroom, the EcoSport has been on sale for almost a decade in other parts of the world, mostly developing markets such as Brazil, India and Eastern Europe. Now the company will be importing the subcompact SUV from a plant in Chennai, India. It will slot below the Escape and Edge, and compete with diminutive offerings such as the Honda HR-V, Chevrolet Trax, Mazda CX-3 and Nissan Juke. Exterior The resemblance to the rest of Ford's lineup is clear — the EcoSport features the same front-end shapes and style as the bigger Escape and Edge, with the trapezoidal grille that adorns just about everything else in the Ford lineup from the Focus to the Mustang. The rest of the EcoSport, from the A-pillar back, looks like a traditional "one box" design, with an upswept beltline and blacked-out wraparound rear glass that looks a lot like a Buick Encore. Four trim choices will be available: S, SE, SES and Titanium, with the SES designated as the "sporty" trim with unique styling elements. All models will feature a swing gate instead of a traditional upward opening hatch, hinged on the left side to allow for easier curb loading. Ten exterior color choices will be available. Interior Inside, the EcoSport features a unique floating display panel front and center to house the 8-inch touchscreen that uses Ford's latest Sync 3 multimedia system, standard on the Titanium models. Lesser trims get either a 4-inch or 6-inch screen mounted in the same location with Sync 3 an option. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto also will be offered, as will the FordPass app that allows connection and management of the car's systems via a smartphone. Audio supplier Harman has teamed up with B&O to offer B&O Play, standard on the Titanium model, a 675-watt premium audio system featuring 10 speakers, including a subwoofer. The interior is also designed for versatility, with as many as 30 cubbies, hooks and storage bins throughout the cabin. The second-row seats fold and stow for increased cargo room, and combine with a false floor board in the cargo area to create a flat area for larger items. The SES trim also features some special interior appointments, with sport seats and unique copper colored trim pieces to spice things up. The top trims feature two USB ports low in the console for charging personal electronics along with a 12-volt socket. Optional is a 110-volt household outlet, plus a second 12-volt socket for the backseat. Under the Hood Two engine choices will be available. First is a turbocharged three-cylinder EcoBoost engine like the one found in the Ford Focus and Fiesta, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission; it sends power to the front wheels only. The optional engine is a larger non-turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that will include all-wheel drive as standard. The 2.0-liter will be standard equipment on the SES model, in keeping with that trim's sportier demeanor, but the top Titanium can be had in either three-cylinder or four-cylinder guise. Ford did not provide horsepower or fuel economy ratings for the powertrains, and likely will not until closer to the car's on-sale date, more than a year away.

Crunch Network How auto unlock makes the Mac more accessible Posted Nov 10, 2016 by Steven Aquino (@steven_aquino) 0 SHARES Next Story A USB stick that can test HIV levels in under 30 minutes Steven Aquino Crunch Network Contributor Steven Aquino is a freelance tech writer and iOS accessibility expert. More posts by this contributor: Accessibility was all around this year’s WWDC When it comes to accessibility, Apple continues to lead in awareness and innovation How to join the network My workflow is predominantly iOS-centric, but, lately, I’ve been turning more to the Mac — my girlfriend’s 15” MacBook Pro — to get work done. I’ve enjoyed getting reacquainted with Apple’s desktop operating system. I like the Mac. While it’s true the 12.9” iPad Pro is generally more accessible than a laptop due to iOS’s touch-driven interface, it doesn’t mean using a Mac is impossible or that macOS is inaccessible. With the aid of tricks like dark mode, enlarging the cursor size, and the double-tap-to-zoom gesture on my old Magic Mouse, using macOS again has been fun. For as much I adore iOS, there’s no reason I should ignore the Mac. On the contrary, I see great value in being on, as Jason Snell wrote last February, “Team Both.” One reason for my renewed enthusiasm for the Mac is one of macOS Sierra’s banner features: Auto Unlock. Auto Unlock unlocks your Mac via Apple Watch instead of the user typing a password. It’s made possible by Apple’s Continuity framework, which works by using “time-of-flight networking” to detect when your Apple Watch is near your Mac. There’s something magical about signing in without touching the keyboard. Apple touts Auto Unlock as a quick and convenient way to unlock your Mac, and it is. But it’s something else too: It’s a great de-facto accessibility feature, particularly for those who, like me, have both visual and fine-motor impairments. Passwords Are a Pain, Sometimes Literally  Before delving into why Auto Unlock is useful as an accessibility tool, it’s important to explain why entering passwords can be a potential hindrance to accessibility. It’s about friction. The password screen on a Mac computer (or an iOS device) is a hurdle—a more secure one, but a hurdle nonetheless—that someone with certain disabilities has to clear in order to access their computer. In terms of accessibility, seeing where to type _and_ typing the password can be difficult because of possible visual and motor delays. For example, I have both low vision and a mild form of cerebral palsy (CP). Thus, entering passwords is troublesome in two ways. First, the password screen is tough to see because of its relatively small size; I have to lean into the MacBook’s display to see. Secondly, because of the partial paralysis caused by the CP, typing my password is hard. I have to slow down and look at the keyboard to ensure I’m hitting the right keys. Granted, the process isn’t _too_ long, but I do feel some anxiety signing in. It sounds trivial, but for a person with disabilities, these seemingly small details make a big difference in shaping a positive experience. Enter Auto Unlock Given the context of the previous section, it’s easy to see why I believe Auto Unlock is such a compelling feature. Auto Unlock not only is convenient and secure, it makes logging into a Mac a hands-free operation. This is a big deal for accessibility. In my case, no longer do I need to look at the screen or touch the keyboard. All I do is sit down, open the MacBook’s lid, and wait for the magic to happen. The end result (aside from instantly being logged in) is Auto Unlock saves me from the tedium of manually entering my password. Again, a big win for someone with disabilities like mine. In my initial tests, however, Auto Unlock wasn’t without its hiccups. After upgrading to Sierra, I found Auto Unlock worked flawlessly the first few times, but then it stopped. Whenever I tried signing in, the computer would tell me “Unlocking with Apple Watch,” but the progress spinner would go around for a minute before reverting to the standard password field. I tried troubleshooting the issue to no avail, so I was forced to go back to typing in my password the old-fashioned way. Then came good news. The recently released 10.12.1 update “improves [the] reliability of Auto Unlock with Apple Watch,” according to Apple, and I’ve had no problems since. The update has made Auto Unlock as fast and reliable as it was when I first tried it. Logging in feels like magic again. We’ve Seen This Before  The idea that Auto Unlock is a boon to accessibility isn’t a novel one. This concept applies to Touch ID as well. I first wrote about this three years ago, after the introduction of the iPhone 5S. The argument for Touch ID is exactly the same for Auto Unlock: Using one’s fingerprint to get into their iPhone makes it more accessible for people with vision and/or motor impairments. And like Auto Unlock, there’s no more eye strain or hunting and pecking at a password. Touch ID and Auto Unlock essentially do the same job: they open doors. The difference lies in how they open them. Where Touch ID requires physical contact with a sensor, Auto Unlock goes a step further by eliminating the need to touch anything. That’s even better. Bottom Line The best part about Auto Unlock is its egalitarianism. Just as Apple Pay makes mobile payments more accessible and Markdown makes writing on the Web more accessible, Auto Unlock makes logging into the Mac more accessible. They all share a common trait: good design. They’re so well made “out of the box” that anyone, regardless of ability, can use them without special modes or discrete accessibility software. Good design is hard, but good accessible design is harder. That Auto Unlock is inherently accessible says a lot about how it was engineered, and helps spur wider adoption. The fact that Auto Unlock, while obviously not created expressly for accessibility’s sake, works so well as an assistive technology is a tremendous ancillary benefit. I’m grateful for its existence, as the energy I save from not typing my password so often goes into getting my work done. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

Ryan Brooks reports. Video Transcript Samsung's biggest ever buy locked down on Monday. The South Korean tech giant, snapping up U.S. auto parts company Harman -for a cool 8 billion dollars. Harman's a top name in audio but it also ranks high for so-called connected cars - think computer dashboards and impact detection sensors. For Samsung, the move marks a major push into auto-related tech. And that may not be a surprising choice - Google and Apple are rapidly developing their own vehicle technology And Samsung's behind both when it comes to in-car entertainment and software. Then, of course, there's the fact that its mobile business is still suffering - after a disastrous recall of its fire-prone Note 7 smartphones. Positioning itself as a supplier- with the help of a proven brand name like Harman may help Samsung map out new territory - as auto makers increasingly rely on smart technology to stay ahead. It could also provide an avenue for selling sell its own memory chips. Part of the business behind it earlier, massive success in the mobile world. more from technology   telecommunications   Multimedia gallery The U.S.-Mexico border now gallery Supermoon of the century AUDIO Measuring HR effectiveness in the region AUDIO Brandy Scott's TED talk on happiness AUDIO How e-commerce will succeed in the Middle East AUDIO Why success is so closely tied to happiness Advertisement Most Popular Videos 'Supermoon' spectacle wows sky-watchers 1 day ago - Reuters Videos Samsung buys Harman in $8 bln smart car push 1 day ago - Reuters Videos Goldman Sachs considers Frankfurt move 11 Nov 2016 - Reuters Videos Advertisement About zawya Contact us Copyright © 2016 Zawya.

"Businesses bear the brunt of frequent load shedding, which hampers industrial output, while residents suffer from the scorching heat during the pre-monsoon season," MCCI said in its latest review. Unofficial estimate puts the current demand for electricity at around 10,000 megawatt as compared to the highest generation recorded on September 08 in 2016 at 8,890 mw.

The timing could hardly be better. According to Ford, there were about 70,000 subcompact 'utes sold in 2011, which makes the 276,000 sold in 2015 a four-fold increase. And by 2020, the Blue Oval expects 2015's total to double. Considering the Ford EcoSport is the best-selling compact SUV outside the United States, the automaker seems likely to become a segment leader in short order. The Ford EcoSport is nothing if not cute. The automaker's well-worn and angular fascia leads the way, followed by a steeply raked windshield. Upright sides and muscular wheel arches lead the eyes to a prominent C-pillar. Faux skid plates front and rear join lower-bodyside cladding to lend a modestly appropriate off-road look. Not that anyone will ever actually take an EcoSport very far off the beaten path, of course. Four trim levels will be available, starting with S, moving to SE, SES, and finally Titanium. Pricing has not yet been announced. Inside, the EcoSport can look mature or extroverted, with the SES model getting copper trim and seat accents. An eight-inch screen floats above the center stack and features Sync 3, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, all of which can send tunes through an optional 10-speaker, 675-watt B&O PLAY audio system from Harman. Power comes from either a 1.0-liter turbocharged EcoBoost three-cylinder for front-wheel-drive models or a 2.0-liter four-cylinder for buyers who opt for four-wheel drive. Horsepower and fuel efficiency aren't yet available, but both engines will be paired with a six-speed automatic transmission when the EcoSport goes on sale in early 2018. If you want to see the new EcoSport in person, you're in luck... assuming you live near Hollywood, that is. Register here for tickets to Ford's Go Small, Live Big experience, which runs on for two nights starting on Tuesday, November 15. There'll be plenty of live music and Snapchatting, along with lots of local food vendors, and, um... tiny houses. And even a bunch of tiny rescue animals – hedgehogs! – and exercise equipment.
