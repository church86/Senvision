The latest scheme is its own TV guide that would work across the existing Apple TV boxes and other devices such as iPhones. Recode says the universal EPG would allow users to see what was available across a range of video providers without the need to open individual apps. It’s effectively the next stage on from last year’s plan that would have seen the Cupertino company create its own pay-TV bouquet. That plan stalled over a reluctance from the broadcasters. Then, the plan was to reduce the cost of TV packages when compared to US cable companies with a package of popular channels for a monthly $40 – half that paid for a typical cable subscription. However, the networks that include NBC, CBS and Fox are seemingly unwilling to lower their prices. Arguably, the universal EPG would also be easier to implement internationally. Apple is not commenting on the report.

Photo: Jim Merithew/Cult of Mac Apple doesn’t sell iPhones directly in Russia, but it’s being investigated by the country’s federal Anti-Monopoly Service for colluding with resellers to fix the price on its devices. The government agency revealed today that it has opened a case against Apple and 16 major resellers that all had identical prices for the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models when they launched in Russia in October 2015. “The Anti-Monopoly Service sees signs of price-fixing violations in the Russian Federation at Apple iPhone resellers, which resulted in the same prices for these smartphones,” the agency said in a statement to Reuters. Apple has been accused of price-fixing in the past after the launch of the iBookstore. The iPhone-maker was found guilty of colluding with publishers to raise the price of e-books. Accusations of price-fixing hardware though is a new one for the company. The investigation into iPhone price-fixing in Russia supposedly found that resellers all set identical prices for a certain period of time. Russia’s largest carrier Euroset has denied the price fixing allegations while Apple has not yet responded to requests for comment.

Share this content: facebook twitter linkedin google Comments Print Apple's bug bounty program rolls out next month, only to selected researchers at first On Thursday, Apple announced at Black Hat that it will begin offering up to $200,000 to researchers reporting critical security vulnerabilities in certain Apple software, including its underlying operating system iOS. Ivan Krstic, head of security engineering at Apple, made the announcement of the Apple Security Bounty programme at a presentation at the cyber-security gathering in Las Vegas, now in its 19th year. He was presenting on three iOS security mechanisms – HomeKit, Auto Unlock and iCloud Keychain – technologies that handle sensitive user data. While Apple has been less of a target for hackers than systems based on Windows, primarily owing to the dominance of Windows systems in the workplace as well as Apple's more stealthy security, the bug bounty offering is seen as a strategic move by the company to dissuade the selling of vulnerabilities on the underground market – whether to competitors or nation-state actors – looking for a backdoor into its coding. Apple's bug categories and payouts: Secure boot firmware components: up to $200,000.  Extraction of confidential material protected by the Secure Enclave: up to $100,000.  Execution of arbitrary code with kernel privileges: up to $50,000. Unauthorized access to iCloud account data on Apple servers: up to $50,000.  Access from a sandboxed process to user data outside that sandbox: up to $25,000. When the bug bounty programme rolls out next month, only an invited list of around two dozen security researchers will be eligible. These individuals have worked with the company previously and are said to have not received financial reward for their disclosures. Others outside of this group who submit worthy flaws, will be considered as well, Apple said. The company said it would pay up to $200,000 (£150,000) for critical flaws in the secure boot firmware components, up to $100,000 for exploits that could extract confidential data from the Secure Enclave Processor – the secure chip that performs cryptographic tasks in its iPhone 5s and later – $50,000 for vulnerabilities that can result in arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges, $50,000 for ways to access iCloud account data on Apple's servers without authorisation and $25,000 for bugs that give bad actors access from inside a sandbox process to user data outside of that sandbox. Other major technology companies – including Microsoft, Facebook and Google – have long offered bug bounty programmes. (BugCrowd keeps a running tally of bug bounty and disclosure programmes.)  Google rewarded white hats last year with more than $2 million (£1.5m) for their discoveries, primarily for Android bugs. Facebook paid out more than $4 million (£3m) over the past five years. Up until yesterday's announcement, Apple relied instead on internal security teams, frustrating white hat hackers trying to help the company close off flaws and receive rewards. Researchers submitting to the programme will need to provide proof-of-concept on the latest versions of iOS and Apple's latest hardware. If the researcher donates their award to a charitable foundation, Apple will match that donation. Researchers might also be rewarded who share other exceptional critical vulnerabilities. Payment will be based on a number of factors, including the novelty of the bug disclosed, the chance of exposure and the extent of user interaction needed. "This is a good start," Rich Mogull, analyst and CEO at Securosis, wrote on a blog post. "Apple didn't need a program, but can certainly benefit from one. This won't motivate the masses or those with ulterior motives, but it will reward researchers interested in putting in the extremely difficult work to discover and work through engineering some of the really scary classes of exploitable vulnerabilities."

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. More like this Apple jumps the shark by removing the handgun emoji Apple leads fight to ban rifle emoji Does Apple support gay gun rights? Video 5 Weirdest iOS Keyboards Apple’s recent decision to substitute a squirt gun for the handgun emoji has caused an explosion of criticism. Many folks seem to think that Apple has jumped the shark in terms of being politically correct. But a recent post at Emojipedia.org points out that there is a real danger that comes from Apple’s decision. What looks like a squirt gun in iOS and macOS, appears as a real handgun emoji on other platforms such as Windows, Android or Linux. This has the potential to cause misunderstandings that could result in somebody thinking that they are actually being threatened by another person. And that could have disastrous consequences if action is taken based on such a misunderstanding. The solution being proposed by the writer at emojipedia.org is for Apple to simply hide the handgun emoji altogether: Apple: Don’t change the pistol emoji. Hide it. Hiding the gun emoji is a win-win situation which ticks many boxes for all of those with varied interests: For Apple: Regular users don’t see the pistol on the iOS emoji keyboard any more. For Backward Compatibility: Old messages with this emoji still show it. For Cross-Platform Compatibility: If someone sends you a gun emoji, you still see what they intended. For Gun Fans: If you really want this emoji, you can copy and paste it - the same way you would enter the ♗ Bishop Unicode character, or any other character not shown on the default iOS keyboard. More at Emojipedia.org What other emojis will be hidden by Apple? While I agree with much of the commentary in the article on Emojipedia, I disagree that hiding the handgun emoji is a good idea. Sure, Apple can do it, but the company’s reputation is already suffering from the perception that it has become heavy-handed in pushing its politics on its customers. Hiding the handgun emoji is just going to increase that perception. And it also raises the question of how much further Apple is going to take its emoji censorship. As I noted in one of my earlier articles, there are other emojis such as a dagger, knife, hammer, bomb, coffin, pill, cigarette, etc. that are potentially offensive to the folks running Apple. How long until some of those emojis are removed from the iOS and macOS keyboards? Exactly where is the line going to be drawn at Apple when it comes to censoring emojis? So far there are no answers to these questions, but hiding the handgun emoji would certainly give us a clear idea of where Apple is going to go in the future. If the handgun emoji is hidden, we’ll see others hidden eventually as well. As Apple hides more and more "offensive" emojis, the company will become known for limiting self-expression by users of its products. This will have a chilling effect on the company's reputation and will most likely result in some users abandoning Apple's platforms altogether. Tim Cook’s Apple is going down a very bad road I said in one of my earlier posts about the handgun emoji that the whole affair made me really miss Steve Jobs. Jobs made it a point to steer Apple clear of being involved in these kinds of political issues, and he was quite right to do so. But this is Tim Cook’s Apple now, and it’s a very different company when it comes to politics. This version of Apple has not shied away from pushing its politics on its users, and that has tarnished the company’s brand among some of its customers. The folks running Apple really need to pause for a moment and ask themselves what they will do if part of the company’s customer base eventually dumps its products entirely due to Apple’s political posturing in its software. Apple is courting disaster by becoming so political, and it if continues it will eventually affect sales of the company’s products in a very significant way. Who wants to buy a phone, tablet or computer from a company that overtly censors free expression in its software? Apple should simply provide a full selection of emojis on its iOS and macOS keyboards, and it should make sure that the images used for those emojis accurately represent what they are supposed to be.

That’s why, when it announced last summer that it would be launching a public beta program for iOS, many were surprised by the move. As it turns out, there’s a perfectly good explanation for the iOS public beta program. In 2012, Apple experienced what went down as one of its biggest blunders in recent memory. I’m of course referring to its decision to replace the venerable Google Maps with its own mapping app in iOS 6. The problem wasn’t so much the decision but Apple’s failure to vet the data for which its app relied on. Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet software and services, said in a recent interview with Fast Company that to everyone who privately tested the Maps app in Cupertino, everything seemed great. Not testing the app outside of their Cupertino bubble, however, proved to be a critical misstep. The early Maps app was so bad that Tim Cook personally apologized for it shortly after launch, going so far as to recommend users try third-party apps like Bing, MapQuest or Waze as they worked to fix it. Shortly after, it was announced that Siri and Maps boss Scott Forstall was leaving the company. Cue said that the reason customers are now able to test iOS is because of Maps.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple The Macbook Pro update will finally be coming this fall, report suggests Chris Smith BGR NewsAugust 8, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Apple is expected to debut a new line of MacBook laptops at some point in the last quarter of the year, with the long-forgotten Macbook Pro expected to finally get an update It’s not clear at this stage whether the MacBook Air brand will be discontinued or not, but a new report reveals more details about Apple’s rumored 2016 MacBooks. DON’T MISS: Inside story explains how Warner ruined ‘Suicide Squad’ A source with an accurate track record told 9to5Mac that the new MacBook Pro models are coming in the fall, complete with features not seen on a MacBook before, including a Touch ID power button and an OLED touch-sensitive row of function keys. This isn’t the first time these features have been mentioned in rumors. A KGI report first suggested the OLED function keys, shown in Martin Hajek’s render above, and said the MacBook Pro would come with Touch ID support this year. More recently, code inside macOS indicated that the fingerprint sensor would be supported in future Macs. Previous reports said that Apple’s new MacBooks will offer a slimmer, thinner and lighter design, and will include USB-C support and the removable of the iconic MagSafe charging port, in line with what Apple has done with the 12-inch MacBook. A recent leak indicated that up to four USB-C ports would be found on a MacBook Pro. Apple will likely introduce the new MacBook Pro (and Air?) at some point in fall once its macOS Sierra is ready to be released.

Apple’s fateful decision to ditch Google Maps for its own in-house creation didn’t go exactly as planned, you might recall — Maps was generally derided for lacking features like public transit schedules and direction editing, for turn-by-turn bugs that led motorists into dangerous hinterlands, and for visual bugs and glitches out the wazoo. Sustained public pushback motivated Apple chief Tim Cook to take the extraordinary step of suggesting “alternative” apps until Apple engineers could stabilize things, and was apparently a motivating factor in iOS software chief Scott Forstall’s dismissal. But that wasn’t all the disastrous launch caused, apparently. In an interview with Fast Company, Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of software and services, revealed that Maps was the impetus for the public iOS beta Apple launch two years ago. “We made significant changes to all of our development processes because of [Maps],” Cue told Fast Company. “To all of us living in Cupertino, the maps for here were pretty darn good. Right? So [the problem] wasn’t obvious to us. We were never able to take it out to a large number of users to get that feedback. Now we do,” he said. Related: The biggest problem with Apple Maps? Our overreaction According to Cue, Maps tested well internally, but Apple’s engineers lacked a sample size large enough to anticipate its many misbehaviors. A paucity of mapping data contributed, too — as reported by The Verge and others, the Cupertino firm was forced to cobble together maps from several vendors (it used TomTom’s data in the U.S., but other services internationally). And development resources stretched thin further exacerbated the issues — there were only “dozens of people” working on Maps prior to its public debut as compared to Google’s “hundreds” of Google Maps engineers and “thousands” of location data specialists. The predictable result? Widespread inconsistency, inaccuracy, and general incompetence. Shortly after Maps’s launch in 2012 alongside iOS 6, Canadian developer Jason Matheson ran a well-publicized test which showed that of 2,028 place names, Apple’s navigation app listed 551 incorrectly and omitted 688 entirely. And then there’s the infamous case where Fairbanks, Alaska drivers were instructed by Maps’ turn-by-turn feature to cross the Fairbanks International Airport’s runway, and the 35-acre Airfield garden and farm in Ireland that was mislabeled with an airport icon. “We had completely underestimated the product, the complexity of it,” said Cue. “All the roads are known, come on! All the restaurants are known, there’s Yelp and OpenTable, they have all the addresses. The mail arrives. FedEx arrives. You know, how hard is this?” Related: 5 wrong turns in Apple’s iOS 6 Maps app Maps has come a long way since then. It has overcome the internal management issues that dogged its engineers in 2014. It gained public transit directions and “more accurate mapping data” last year. And in March, Apple announced the opening of a new development office in Hyderabad, India that will staff a team of 4,000. And Cue largely credits the launch of Apple’s first public iOS beta test in early 2014: iOS 8.3. Previously, iOS developer builds required a $99-per-year subscription, but Apple launched a free, public program with built-in mechanisms for providing feedback two years ago. Since then, it’s expanded the scope of its beta program to include MacOS, previously OS X. “The reason you as a customer are going to be able to test iOS is because of Maps,” said Cue. As for Apple’s future Maps and beta plans, Cue didn’t elaborate. But artificial intelligence might have something to do with it, he hinted. “You’re trying to determine what are the features, what are the ways it can work really well, what are customers looking for, and what are the things you can do that are going to improve their lives,” he said.

Disappointed Fans Take To Social Media Music 1 0 0 August 7, 2016 Frank Ocean: ‘Boys Don’t Cry’ November Release? Disappointed Fans Take To Social Media Anya Wassenberg Frank Ocean and a new album release date in November? Fans hopes for the release of Boys Don’t Cry, one of the year’s most highly anticipated albums, were raised and then dashed this week and they vented their frustrations on social media with a creative flair. Boys Don’t Cry will be the follow up to channel ORANGE, his hugely successful Grammy-winning 2012 release. Frank Ocean And The August 5 Rumor On Monday, August 1, the New York Times ran a piece with the overly confident title, “Frank Ocean’s Long-Awaited ‘Boys Don’t Cry’ Is Due on Friday” – although the venerable publication did hedge its bets by acknowledging that, after so many delays, further extensions were still possible. The article cited a source that was said to have knowledge of the release plans, adding that the album would be accompanied by a video and book with the same title as the release. Boys Don’t Cry would reportedly be available as an exclusive on Apple Music for two weeks before a wider release. While there was no official word from Frank Ocean, Apple or his label, a video that showed up on his website led fans to believe the story. The video followed him for hours as he worked on building what looked like a carpentry project in an otherwise empty room. Eager fans took it as encouraging sign, given the week’s headlines. The Apple connection came via an Apple Music logo that appeared as a watermark in the video. But, as an Atlantic piece pointed out, the video may also have been an indication of work in progress. When the release didn’t happen, fans were disappointed – to say the least. MTV is calling it a “Frank Ocean-induced Emotional Riptide of Despair” and fans have taken to social media to express their disappointment, and in some cases, even anger. Where's that album fool? #FrankOcean pic.twitter.com/CFhcMBDftb — Landon.

In the spring of 2015, Frank’s Tumblr account featured a picture of Ocean sitting next to stacks of magazines. One featured a cover with the headline, “Boys Don’t Cry” and the caption “#ISSUE 1 #ALBUM 3 #JULY2015 #BOYSDONTCRYMAGAZINE.” It's Saturday…. #FrankOcean pic.twitter.com/hvTOrLRue3 — Ian (@Ian_Coyne) August 6, 2016 Me calling the police on #FrankOcean cause this can't be legal. pic.twitter.com/Ma3sAMU2ba — J. Smith (@Sir_JaLon) August 6, 2016 #FrankOcean it's officially 12:01…… pic.twitter.com/YOs1ZUs8jl — Alex King (@Alex_W_King) August 6, 2016 Is that album dropping? #frankocean pic.twitter.com/cSmouPSFD2 — Bojack (@22buttercup22) August 6, 2016 When July, 2015, came and went with no mention of the Frank Ocean release, fans began their social media campaign of hurt and disappointment. Despite public assurances from his producer and friends like Chance the Rapper, there was no word from Frank himself. Back in July of this year, Frank Ocean’s website sported an image of a library card with a “due date” stamp that read “July 2016,” along with a number of other dates that were crossed out, seeming to refer to the album’s many delays. When July came and went, fans noticed “Aug 5 2016,” which seemed to corroborate the New York Times story. Frank oceans album to come out in November ???????????????? #FrankOcean pic.twitter.com/FzEZC3wj6F — Thesohl (@JustSohlThings) August 6, 2016 Frank Ocean And ‘Boys Don’t Cry’ – A November Release? Or Just Another Tease? Now that August 5 has also passed without Boys Don’t Cry, fans and the media have noticed that the library card also contains a stamp that reads “Nov 13 2016.” Fans as well as the media have seized on the November 13 date as the new, “real” release date, with reports circulating in the New York Daily News, among many other media outlets. The truth of the matter is, no one except Frank Ocean knows when Boys Don’t Cry will be released, and it seems like Frank likes it that way. A piece in the Atlantic compares Frank Ocean to Harper Lee, the famously reclusive author of To Kill a Mockingbird. While his public appearances are few and far between and his social media presence limited to infrequent posts on isolated events like Prince’s death and the Orlando nightclub shooting, Frank Ocean has been keeping himself busy with a guest spot on Kanye West’s The Life of Pablo and sharing writing credits with James Blake on his latest release. As far as his own work is concerned, fans have had to make do with a cover of At Your Best (You Are Love) in 2015 and a song called Memrise that he posted to his Tumblr account in 2014. Will fans still be waiting until November – and what if November 13 is yet another false alarm? Only time, Frank Ocean, and the quality of Boys Don’t Cry whenever it is eventually released, will tell.

Email | 08 Aug 2016 | Print  ExtraBITS for 8 August 2016 by TidBITS Staff In this week’s ExtraBITS, Hulu is eliminating free access to its content, Apple’s top brass discusses the state of the company under CEO Tim Cook, Apple opens a bug bounty program, and we learn why there’s a controversy around emojis in iOS 10. Hulu Drops Free Plan to Focus on Subscriptions -- Video streaming service Hulu is dropping its ad-supported free tier. From now on, to watch Hulu content, you’ll have to pay $7.99 per month for the company’s Limited Commercials plan or $11.99 per month for the No Commercials plan (though a handful of shows still show ads due to the rights Hulu was able to obtain). Hulu is also partnering with Yahoo for a new ad-supported service, Yahoo View, which will run the five most recent episodes of shows from ABC, Fox, and NBC eight days after airing. Read/post comments Inside Tim Cook’s Apple -- Perhaps smarting from the media response to two relatively weak fiscal quarters, Apple sat three of its top executives down with Fast Company’s Rick Tetzeli to calm the waters. In the article, CEO Tim Cook, SVP of Internet Software Eddy Cue, and SVP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi discuss how Apple has changed in the Cook era, including how the problems with Apple Maps led to public betas of iOS. The wide-ranging discussion also touches on Siri and how subscription services are helping Apple’s revenues. While Apple’s top brass avoided specifics, Eddy Cue did share the company’s overriding ambition: “We want to be there from when you wake up till when you decide to go to sleep.” Read/post comments Apple Opens Bug Bounty Program -- Tech companies have long paid bounties to security researchers who find flaws in their software. Until now, however, Apple hasn’t availed itself of this method of encouraging vulnerability discoveries. Apple has announced a bug bounty program that will pay between $25,000 and $200,000 to researchers who discover certain classes of security vulnerabilities in iOS or iCloud. The program is open only to invited researchers for now, but Apple says that if someone outside the program discovers an exploit in a covered class, they may be added to the program. Over on the Securosis blog, TidBITS Security Editor Rich Mogull provides more details and calls it “a good start.” Read/post comments The Controversy Around the iOS 10 Gun Emoji -- Apple’s redesign of iOS 10’s emojis has generated controversy by changing the realistic pistol emoji (🔫) to a toy squirt gun. Jeremy Burge of Emojipedia argues that this shift could lead to tragic miscommunications, since every other platform, plus previous versions of Apple operating systems, displays that emoji as an actual gun. Burge suggests that the pistol emoji should be hidden from the keyboard entirely, and those who want to use the emoji could still copy it from elsewhere and paste it into messages. If nothing else, this kerfuffle shows why it can be problematic to rely on pictographs for communication. Read/post comments   Smile makes tools so you can have a productive day.

Ya Libnan Lebanon News and World News Live from Beirut Featured News Lebanon News World News Opinion Business News Arts & Culture Sci & Tech Video Apple says all US employees now receive equal pay for equal work August 4, 2016 by yalibnan 1 Comment Today, Apple released updated diversity figures indicating it has made slight but steady progress in hiring more women and underrepresented minorities — and ensuring those employees are paid the same as their white male counterparts. The new numbers, outlined on Apple’s dedicated diversity and inclusion webpage, indicate the company increased the percentage of female new hires from 31 percent in 2014 to 37 percent so far this year, while the figure for underrepresented minorities has increased from 21 percent of new hires to 27 percent in 2016. Apple classifies underrepresented minorities as “Black, Hispanic, Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Other Pacific Islander” in its report. While Apple’s progress has been slow with regard to hiring, it is making more substantial changes to how it compensates individuals. According to the report, the company has remedied pay gaps between white and nonwhite employees and men and women in the US. It did so by analyzing salaries, bonuses, and annual stock grants, to ensure its workers in similar roles with equitable performance earn the same amount of money. “If a gap exists, we’ll address it. And we’ll continue our work to make sure we maintain pay equity,” Apple wrote in the report. “We’ve achieved pay equity in the United States for similar roles and performance. Women earn one dollar for every dollar male employees earn. And underrepresented minorities earn one dollar for every dollar white employees earn.” CEO Tim Cook said in February that an internal year-long study found women at Apple made 99.6 cents on the dollar compared with men, while underrepresented minorities made 99.7 cents on the dollar compared with white employees. It appears the company has acted fast to fix the difference. There has also been mounting pressure from competing tech firms; in April, both Facebook and Microsoft claimed female employees now earn the same as male ones. Apple still overwhelmingly employs white males, with men representing 67 percent of its workforce and white employees representing 54 percent of the total workforce. Those numbers have changed by no more than 1 percentage point since 2014, when Apple began publicly cataloging the numbers. The company says it’s committed to improving those numbers across the board, to ensure the gender and racial makeup of Apple is a “reflection of the world around us.” Apple closed out its diversity report with this final statement: We see diversity as everything that makes an employee who they are. We foster a diverse culture that’s inclusive of disability, religious belief, sexual orientation, and service to country. We want all employees to be comfortable bringing their entire selves to work every day. Because we believe our individual backgrounds, perspectives, and passions help us create the ideas that move all of us forward. Creating an inclusive culture takes both commitment and action. We’re helping employees identify and address unconscious racial and gender bias. We’re cultivating diverse leadership and tech talent. We’re continuing our advocacy for LGBTQ equality, investing in resources for Veterans and service members and their families, and exploring new ways to support employees with disabilities. We’re also strengthening our common bonds through on-campus groups, events, and programs. Filed Under: Business News 5thDrawer See? It CAN be done.

"The Anti-Monopoly Service sees signs of price fixing violations in the Russian Federation at Apple iPhone resellers, which resulted in the same prices for these smartphones," it said in a statement. A representative for Apple in Russia was not immediately available for comment. The anti-monopoly body said it had opened its case after an appeal from a citizen with information that identical prices had been set for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models, which appeared in Russia in October 2015, at 16 major resellers. It said that an investigation had showed that resellers had set identical prices and kept them at that level for a certain time period, including for other models. MTS, one of the resellers mentioned in the anti-monopoly service's statement, declined a request for comment. Euroset, another firm mentioned, denied it had coordinated prices with anyone. Rivals promote gear In the primordial days of computing, IBM machines were so common inside corporations that there was a running joke in the industry: Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM. These days, the same could be said about Apple. Even IBM is promoting Apple gear. Apple's iPhones and iPads have become the preferred mobile computing devices for corporations, as industries from insurers to airlines aim to ditch bulky PCs and give their employees the ability to do their jobs from anywhere using smartphones or tablets.  More stories in International Abdication hint puts Japan at the crossroads Copter with sick baby crashes in Nepal Glitch grounds Delta flights Trump's diet: Big Macs are great 70 killed in Quetta hospital bombing    Copyright © 2016 The Telegraph.

Google has released an amusing new commercial that showcases Google Photos’ “free up space” funcionality. The ad features multiple missed photo opportunities, including graduations, birthdays, selfies and even Bigfoot sightings, all because the iPhone in question runs out of storage each time. The issue is also displayed in Apple’s well-known iPhone notification style. It is weird, however, that when the camera pulls back, it’s actually a Nexus 6P featured in the ad, despite the obvious dig at Apple. With Google Photos new free up space feature, once a photo has been uploaded to the cloud, users are given the option to delete the local copy of the video or photo, freeing up local storage on their smartphone for other purposes. This feature becomes even more useful when paired with Photos’ lower-quality free unlimited storage option. It’s important to keep in mind that this free tier does downgrade the quality of your photos. To be fair, the iPhone is also capable of backing up photos via Apple’s iCloud service in order to clear up built-in storage, though most users will likely need to pay for more storage if they at least use their camera somewhat regularly. SourceYouTube jpd514 “most users will likely need to pay for more storage if they at least use their camera somewhat regularly.” In french they call that “une arnaque” in english I think they call that “a cheat” and Mobilesyrup call this “to be fair” What a strange world Vito R. He was simply comparing backup options. It never ceases to amaze me how followers of a particular mobile brand or political affiliation or comic books take personal offence when someone critiques something the wrong way (in their eyes). What I find strange is that YouTube is the source when the wording is strikingly similar to an earlier post I read about this on a different site. jpd514 Sorry, if you take my comment as personal offense. Vito R. No need to be sorry, I wasn’t offended, I was amused. jpd514 Like me I suppose, you where amused when you read this : “most users will likely need to pay for more storage if they at least use their camera somewhat regularly.” ???? Vito R. I pay for storage with Google, don’t you? jpd514 With the Galaxy Note 5 Samsung offered me 100 Gb of free storage on Microsoft One Drive. You have to pay for your Apple addiction. You should quit Vito R. I get OneDrive free, they pretty much give it away. OneDrive is the least useful of the bunch in terms of a photo cataloging solution. Like I said, I pay for Google Storage for Android but you feel free to ignore that. Me Ted I think most of us use Google Drive for the unlimited photo storage option. Humbre I recall this promo is only for 1 year jpd514 No need for Cloud Storage anymore. I pre-order the Galaxy 64GB Note7 and I choose to receive, free from Samsung, a 256 GB MicroSD Card. FREEDOM RoboBonobo You should still back up to the cloud. MicroSD cards aren’t exactly the most reliable. I had one that corrupted everything a few years ago. jpd514 Will back it up to the PC using Samsung Smart Switch and always backing up at least 15GB on Samsung free Cloud. RoboBonobo Yes the important thing is to have multiple back ups on different media and multiple different physical locations. I back up to thumb drives, my PC’s mass storage hard disk, iCloud and Google Drive. Patrick O’Rourke I definitely do. Drive/Google Photos is a great back-up combo. Smanny Google photos is unlimited. Icloud is not. Not to mention an iPhone with a 4k camera with only 16gb of storage was stupid in the first place. It never ceases to amaze me that people that are loyal to a particular brand will defend stupid things. Vito R. It would be pretty stupid to buy a 16GB phone if you’re taking 4K videos. Now, is it stupid for Apple to sell it? Probably not as they know people will buy it and their data tells them that 16GB is probably somewhat OK for many iPhone users. Of course they want most users to spend the extra $100 on the 64GB version. Nadefrenzy It really isn’t. Most casual users struggle with 16GB. Only those who rarely use their phones say elderly people are ok with 16GB. Apple should make 32GB standard. Vito R. If I have a family of 5, should I buy a minivan or a 2-seater to transport us around? Does that mean they shouldn’t sell two seaters or does that mean I shouldn’t buy a two seater for my needs? If you can live within the confines of a 16GB iPhone or Nexus 5x vs spending the extra cash for more memory – go ahead. Personally, I’d go with more memory – but I’d also pay $2mo for storage so I can save full res backups while some wouldn’t. To each his own. josh6025 Considering flash storage is extremely cheap, I recently bought a 32 GB MicroSD for $10, the 64 GB was $25, so the decision to continue to make mid to high end devices, regardless of the brand, with 16 GB of storage is incompetent. Vito R. Well, the type of flash used in MicroSD cards isn’t the same as what they use in phones – but it is still relatively cheap. I would say it’s not incompetent but a good business strategy. Vendors can lower the initial cost for users that don’t need more memory and yet still have options for those that do. I’m not sure what the problem is? Patrick O’Rourke I’m comparing services and being critical of iCloud’s hefty subscription fees, which, I think are more than Google Photos, though I could be wrong. Unfortunately, I don’t think I’m fit to lead this Apple cult you speak of 🙂 demigod79 Come on guys, be fair. Apple is just trying to squeeze out as much money out of their users as possible. I mean, what do you want them to do? Offer unlimited photo and movie storage like Google? 😉 Vito R. Exactly. Apple wants your money for their hardware, Google wants more of your personal information to sell to advertisers. Different sales strategies, both multi-billion dollar corporations. demigod79 Except iCloud is not hardware, it’s a service. Basically, you have the choice between paying for photo storage (iCloud) or not paying (Google Photos). The choice is clear. Barry Harden Add to that a third option with Android phones: built-in microSD storage. Put in a 128GB card and you’re done. Vito R. I prefer phones that get updates, so Nexus is the only ones I keep around and they haven’t had an SD card for a long time. With cloud storage options I’ve never personally needed more than 32GB but I’d buy a phone with 64GB if available. Barry Harden Updates aren’t really an issue if you go third party ROM. Chao Yang Always amaze me that Android fans take third party ROM as option for software update. Not everyone know how to unlock bootloader, flash new ROM and possibly flash raido. I will always prefer iPhone than Android. iOS is much more secure, updated more frequently. There is virtually no lag with iPhone. Barry Harden Actually Android is more secure in that several hundreds of people contribute to a collaborative effort in making fixes and improvements to the Android ecosystem. True not even is technically sound but if that’s the case you can always get a Nexus phone and be done with it. Vito R. It’s actually not more secure in that most OEM rarely update their phones. Barry Harden Never heard of Blackberry’s android handsets? What about Samsung Knox for Android? Both are examples of companies providing the extra effort to ensure their phones are secured to meet the needs of a corporate environment. Vito R. As I’ve said, Blackberry does an excellent job keeping their handsets up to date with security updates. Samsung makes GREAT devices, they just can’t be bothered to update them with the monthly security patches (even though they said they would) leaving them vulnerable to exploits. Omar In 2016, there are tons of programs that are only a Google search away in which doing all of the above takes only a few button presses and a couple minutes of your time. I really couldn’t get any easier. Vito R. Haha, you’re joking right? I spend $800 on a phone and then I need to void my warranty and install crappy software made by a 16yo in his mom’s basement because the OEM i purchased from doesn’t update their products? I’ll pass thanks. Barry Harden You actually have choices in 3rd party ROMs. Last I checked CyanogenMOD is one of the best if not professional modding company run by adults. 3rd party ROMs can do wonders for a phone. Yes you can pass but you’ll always be stuck in Apple hell. Vito R. I buy Nexus phones because I want proper support from the manufacturer and gimmick free software. Cyanogen is a joke of a company. Their business model was a bust and now they’re restructuring. You’re advocating spending good money on a phone and then turning to third parties to support it because the manufacturer has abandoned you. Haha, and people call Apple users sheep. Tell me you don’t see the irony? As opposed to the Apple way which is supporting their customers with OS updates on day one of availability. Don’t you think having Android OEM support their products with timely updates is more desirable than voiding your warranty and flashing 3rd party software that doesn’t work as well as the manufacturer’s software? If that’s what you call “Apple hell” then sign me up. Barry Harden Nexus does add timely support for up 3 years for each device release. That’s more than enough and if you still haven’t changed your phone by then at least you can rely on 3rd party support. Apple sheep don’t realize how closed their ecosystem is. There are many apps that just aren’t available to Apple devices due to their function yet there are no restrictions if you load them to your Android. At the end of the day it’s about choice. You don’t get that with Apple. Vito R. I know, that’s why I buy Nexus phones, but it’s pretty ignorant to say that Android is about choice when manufacturers take forever to upgrade their phones and you try to twist that into a positive haha. Yes, iOS is more restrictive in terms of what apps are allowed to do – but it’s also more secure, has way better OS support from Apple, battery lasts longer, the apps are better and it actually has a working backup system – something Android STILL doesn’t have. Yes, you can change your lock screen and keyboard and launcher Android – but the only time I do that is when I buy a Samsung so I can go back to the Google versions. If you like to tinker with your phone and try out new ROMs then knock yourself out. Moody people just want a phone that works and will *never* actively seek to upgrade it – they’re the ones that get screwed when they buy a non-Nexus device as their phones are open to exploits that have long been patched by Google. Omar OnePlus releases their flagship phones with a custom ROM (CyanogenOS for the OPO, OxygenOS for the rest). Custom ROMS are built directly on AOSP, so it’s like stock Android with custom features added to it. Just because they are made by third party companies or people, doesn’t mean they aren’t high-quality software. This is 2016, and Google encourages custom ROM support by leaving Android open source. So yes, it’s a viable option, even for $800 flagships (there are ROMs available for Nexus devices, btw). I went from a Nexus 5 with stock Android to a OnePlus One with CyanogenOS… in terms of stability and quickness, I didn’t notice any differences. The look and feel was stock, but the amount of customization with the first iteration of CyanogenOS (running on KitKat) was great and maybe even a little overwhelming at first. Vito R. That’s an OEM ROM, not a “custom” ROM. I was referring to ROMs built by people not associated with the OEM. There’s nothing wrong with those ROMs as they’re commissioned by the OEM and have access to ask the non-open source drivers. A custom ROM would be one built by a third party (not released by OnePlus) when you want to get Android N a week or two after it’s released. Omar CyanogenOS is like a custom ROM of CyanogenMOD, which is a custom ROM itself lol… It’s a separate company. The reason OxygenOS exists is because the two companies had some issues with one another. Anyway, custom ROMs run just as smoothly (if not smoother) than many stock/OEM ROMs. Downplaying them without even trying one seems unfair to the hard work those people put into them….. Vito R. I’ve tried plenty of ROMs. You don’t seem to understand my distinction between ROMs floating around on the XDA Developers forums and a ROM commissioned by the device manufacturer. Install a 3rd party Android N ROM on your One Plus and tell me how great it works. It doesn’t matter how hard a “dev” works – custom ROMs do not run better or more smoothly because they don’t have access to the closed source drivers needed to get the devices to run their best. A Galaxy S7 is going to run better on an official Samsung ROM every time – no matter what the ROM builder claims. And a real ROM isn’t repackaging the official one minus the crapware. Omar I have a custom ROM on my One, and vanilla stock on my Nexus 5. Both running Android N. There isn’t any noticeable difference between them. Ofc OEM ROMs are optimized specifically for the respective device, but I would assume the people on XDA forums who have been making them for years have a profound understanding of how to do it. Sounds like you were using CM nightlies, which aren’t stable releases to begin with. But I suppose everybody’s experience will differ, so maybe we should just agree to disagree. Brian Stock Blackberry is actually doing a great job of supporting Android updates so far. Vito R. They are. I’d happily buy a Blackberry once they make a phone I’d want to use. If they made a phone like the One Plus 3 I’d buy it – I’d even be willing to pay a little more for it – but a rebranded Acatel Idol 4 doesn’t do it for me. Brian Stock The DTEK50 doesn’t do it for me, but neither do any other slab-phones with touch keyboards. I use a Galaxy S7 for work and it’s somewhat capable, but I’m still annoyed daily at having to peck out complicated series of characters on a slab of glass vs. a nice tactile keyboard. I’ll buy a Priv or the upcoming Rome/Mercury in the next year, unless manufacturers like HTC and Motorola come to their senses and offer hardware keyboards once again. Vito R. Well, the Galaxy S7 is probably the best all around phone currently on the market. If you don’t like on screen keyboards then BlackBerry is really your only option. HTC and Motorola HAVE come to their senses – that’s why they made the decision to not sell phones with physical keyboards – there’s just not a big enough market for them. I understand it sucks for users like yourself that prefer physical keys to glass, but the vast majority of people prefer a full sized screen in a compact package vs a slider or a phone that’s half keyboard. RoboBonobo You should still back it up in multiple locations. MicroSD cards can corrupt files irretrievably. Vito R. Yes, it is a service, but it’s a supplementary service to Apple’s hardware business – just like Google’s hardware efforts (Nexus, Chromecast) are supplementary to their software business. Apple’s main product is hardware sales does sell your information or serve you ads like Google does – nothing is free my friend 😉 If you’re comparing free vs. paid and your main concern is price – then yes, Google Photos is an excellent option. I use Google Photo’s but I pay for it because I want my full resolution photos. In addition, when you pay for Google Storage (or iCloud) you can store pretty much anything in there – not just photos – for me it’s worth the $2mo imo. FlamesFan89 honest question, and yes, I’m too lazy to look it up myself, but does Apple make more money from iTunes and the App Store or from hardware sales? Vito R. Hardware, by far. FlamesFan89 What are the relative numbers like? I would have thought that with the costs involved in hardware development, compared to software/service development, that the margins would be bigger on the services side, and would close the gap. Vito R. Apple has made something like $15B from the App Store (gross revenue) over the last 7-8 years. They had $42B total revenue and $7B in PROFIT (which was considered bad for them) last quarter. Net profit is high on pure software, it would be less on services like the App Store and iCloud where there is hardward and bandwidth costs involved. FlamesFan89 That all makes sense. Don’t take this as a knock to Apple, as it is not meant that way, as clearly the numbers you provide are staggering, but I’m actually surprised that they haven’t generated more revenue from iTunes. I would have thought that music (and movies and other media) sales would have been a huge portion of their total revenue. Vito R. Haha, I don’t care if you’re knocking Apple, but I have no idea how much they make from iTunes but I would think it is a big number relative to other digital media businesses – it’s just that everything they do is small potatoes when compared to iPhone sales. FlamesFan89 Fair enough. I guess my thought was, if you combined all the things like iCloud, the App Store, iTunes, etc. even if it is small compared to hardware sales, it is still a very big number, and those products and services all benefit from the collection of data, just as Google’s services benefit from the collection of data. So while their core business is certainly iPhone sales, I don’t think it is fair to imply that Apple doesn’t want your data. Perhaps Google wants it more, but it is very naive to think that Apple doesn’t want it, or isn’t using it, at least internally, to drive more sales of apps, music, services, etc. Vito R. Oh I’m sure they use as much data points as they can to learn about their clients and figure out what to sell them next as all companies do – but the difference between Apple (and Microsoft) and Google is that Apple wants to sell you iPhones and Google want to sell *you*. There’s nothing wrong with either model, but there is a difference. FlamesFan89 I disagree. Apple wants to sell iPhones, and Google wants to sell advertising space. At no point, has Google ever sold specific, personally identifiable information to an advertiser. It’s more along the lines of “we know from our data that people that like cars a lot, also look to buy tires, so, Goodyear, we can sell you advertising space in Gmail that targets people talking about cars”. That’s a far cry from “John Smith likes cars, and his phone number is 555-4455, and he lives at 21 Something Street, in Rondomville, and he last searched for a chocolate chip cookie recipe, and also plays Candy Crush, and frequents the local Wal-mart.” Vito R. You can disagree. While they’re not identifying you by social insurance number *you* are what they are selling. The more they know about you they more they make off you. FlamesFan89 Nope, they aren’t selling me. They are selling bundled, generalized, non-specific information about the habits/searches/locations/etc of multiple users. I’m pretty sure that at no point in time have *I* ever been sold seeing as how I have at no point in time ever had an owner. Then again, maybe you aren’t an actual person on the other end of the keyboard, and you are simply a data bundle consisting of non-identifiable information about large groups of users, in which case, *you* likely are being sold as we speak. Vito R. They don’t have to sell a bundle of anonymous users – they can target just you if the criteria matches. They’ve seemingly got pretty decent tools to export and delete your data, but tracking you is how they make money. That’s why they always default to leaving “do not track” off and why Chrome was the last browser to support it. FlamesFan89 Even still, they still aren’t selling *me*. They are selling non-identifiable information about “A typical user”. And in fact, they still aren’t even selling that! They are selling advertising space. If a billboard company is selling space on an empty billboard along Hwy #Whatever, and they tell a potential client that the roadway sees X traffic loads during rush hour, and Y loads during weekends, does that mean they are selling you and your driving habits? Even if they said, there is this one guy, that we know loves your products, and he drives by here every day, are they selling you? or are they selling the advertising space, and telling the client some information about a completely unknown person to them? Omar Google explicitly states they don’t sell your information (same with Microsoft). Rather they both spy on you (mostly with your consent) to provide you with information they deem is relevant to you. I’ve never been personally called up by a company rep and given personal offers for products, ever. These companies have no idea who I am. Vito R. I never said they sell your information to third parties, they keep it for themselves and then target you on behalf of others. Omar You’ve literally said they are selling us, repeatedly, in this thread lol… Vito R. They are selling us by giving advertisers access to us. I’ve explained exactly how they do it and I literally never said what you suggested. thereasoner Apples “service” profits are second only to iPhone profits having eclipsed those of both Mac and iPad. In other words, quite huge indeed. Smanny Google Photos supports images up to 16mp images for free. Anything greater than that, and you will have to pay. Since most phones don’t use higher than 16mp, then there is no issue with images formats and sizes. Vito R. It still compresses the photos – doesn’t keep the original pic. I’m cool with paying $2mo to keep my originals and to have more Google Drive space. Not a fan of this: “If the camera takes photos with 16 megapixels (MP) resolution or lower, *most* stored photos will *essentially* look the same using either storage option.” (Emphasis mine) Video is downsized to 1080p, probably 30fps. Mo Dabbas videos are dropped in quality. That I can notice easily. Not my thing Nadefrenzy It’s $2/mo for only 50GB. demigod79 I’m well aware of their business model and have no problems with it. In fact, I like the way Google uses my personal data to show me customized info and ads (at worst, I get an irrelevant ad that I can just ignore, at best I get a useful product and a more personalized computing experience). It’s the reason why I use gmail for everything, since I want Google to categorize and keep track of things (e.g., package delivery, vacation schedule, etc.). I consider it a value-added service as opposed to a cost. Ans yes, if you need to store the original photos then the free option is not for you. This was one of my initial concerns but I decided the reduced quality was good enough for casual photos and videos. Sally Mae How are those gaping security holes workin’ out for ya? FTR_Part_deux You get 5gb for FREE and the first tier for paid iCloud is CDN$1 for 50gb. Cheaper than Google. demigod79 You get unlimited for FREE with Google Photos. Case closed. RoboBonobo The unlimited option doesn’t save the full resolution photos. This isn’t good if you’re planning to edit the photos on a PC/Mac later on down the line. FTR_Part_deux iCloud is more similar to Google Drive than Google Photos. Google Photos: edit/share photos & vids; organize albums; search by date, place, or people; backup photos & vids. Counts against quote if stored in “original quality”, no quota if in “high” quality” Google Drive: organize photos/vids into folders; keep all files in one place; share/insert photos into docs/sheets/slides; upload/sync files to view from anywhere. Free 15gb or $2.79 (US or CDN?)/mth for 100gb. Sally Mae Right…but no one else is…oh, wait. *derp* willy That’s classic….. beyond funny, but It got boring after the first two or three failed photos, then it was like ‘is this over yet?’ Brad Fortin So, back in the days of film cameras, did people regularly get mad at camera manufacturers when they had used up the whole roll of film, or did they just understand that you could only capture a limited number of photos before having to unload the current ones to make room for the next set of photos? Stephen B Morris Common sense isn’t always common. That being said, it’s a sales ad. It served its purpose. Karl Schneider Exactly. And if you tried to market one of those cameras today…… tech has advanced yet Apple……… Luckily they have their fan base that will defend then regardless. Say again why Apple doesn’t offer expandable memory? Heck the new BB midline phone offers a 2TB microSD card support. TrickyDickie “Say again why Apple doesn’t offer expandable memory?” So that the iTards can rejoice at the greatness that is Timmy when they finally do lol Chao Yang Looks like fandroid like unstable slow as claw SD card. Fandroid also like loss all their pictures. Jay Android users will take the risk of lost photos over the inability to capture the photo in the first place. Common sense. Vito R. Why don’t Google’s own phones offer expandable memory? Stephen B Morris Because like Apple, Google doesn’t feel that it is necessary. Although Google has pretty much addressed the security issues with micro SD, the speed issues is enough for them to stay away for now. OEMs that tend to include a slot for micro SD in their phones usually tend to manufacture and sell the cards as well. The major OEMs anyway. Brad Fortin “Say again why Apple doesn’t offer expandable memory?” Because they’re a pain to manage (“is [app] on my phone, my older 8 GB card, or my newer 64 GB card?” “which card has my Led Zeppelin albums on it?” “here, let me show you my vacation phot- oh, they’re on the card that’s at home, never mind”), most removable memory cards are painfully slow compared to the internal storage (the people too cheap to buy an iPhone with large internal storage aren’t going to suddenly dish out for an ultra-fast U3 or V90 card, they’re more likely to get the slower and cheaper Class 10 with a read/write speed around 10 MB/s, compared to the internal storage at 400 MB/s read and 165 MB/s write), and there’s no room on the logic board for it (have you ever compared an iPhone teardown to another device teardown? The iPhone’s logic board is *very* densely packed, every square millimetre is used, which is in stark contrast to other devices that have large gaps and empty spaces on their logic boards). Maybe one day they’ll offer something like Android’s Adoptable Storage, mixed with their Fusion Drive software. Maybe they’re removing the headphone jack to make room for a microSD card slot (probably not). Marc Palumbo No they won’t unless Apple releases their own proprietary memory cards, which I still doubt they would. I think with 32GB, it’s enough memory for now. FlamesFan89 I don’t disagree with the speed difference, as that is plain and simple fact, but there are plenty of people, myself included, that are appreciative of the option to have an SD card slot on the phone, with absolutely zero intention of constantly swapping them the way that you characterize it. I’m not sure I have ever met, or heard of anyone, who has multiple cards that they are regularly swapping in and out. Me personally, I like that I can put a big card in my phone that has all my music on it. Speed doesn’t matter. I’ve never had an issue accessing my music, and it not being fast enough. It works at a speed that I can’t notice any difference accessing a music file on the device vs. on the card. And the great thing is, when I get a new phone, I move my card into the new phone, and I’m done. No need to transfer my 60+ GB of music to a new device via cable or anything. It’s a 5 second process of moving the card from one device to the next. So, while the speed argument is valid, and I don’t have anything against any company who doesn’t include an SD slot, it can be a nice feature to have, and it is certainly something I give weight to when picking a device. There is no need for the hyperbole. Brad Fortin You forgot to address the physical space requirements for a microSD card slot. There’s literally no room for it inside the device. FlamesFan89 two things: One, I’m not saying the iPhone should have one. I don’t care if it does or not. Two, they could literally design a new device and include it, and stop striving for paper thin. You are correct that they couldn’t put it in their current model, but there is nothing stopping them from including it in future models, they just have to alter their design. The design has changed in the past, no reason it can’t change in the future. My original point was simply that you were rather hyperbolic with your depiction of people having numerous cards, and swapping them constantly, and forgetting the ones they need, yadda yadda yadda. I think the reality is more that people throw a big card in once, when they first get the device, and then go on living their lives, without thinking twice about it. There is no doubt about it that internal storage has huge benefits over expandable storage, but that doesn’t mean that expandable storage doesn’t also have benefits. Marc Palumbo This is a great analogy actually. My only issue with this is that we only look at photos, but phone memory is taken up by other things as well such as music, videos, apps, etc. As evolution occurs with file size, we have understood that we require large hard drives to accommodate the growth of file sizes. I do think that the iPhone 7 will come in base 32GB. I think we’ve reached a point where it’s become ridiculous. Brad Fortin “I think we’ve reached a point where it’s become ridiculous.” Ridiculous for who, though? A few years ago Apple noticed that power users (32 GB and 64 GB) were regularly filling up their storage, but average users (16 GB) weren’t, so they doubled the higher storage tiers (to 64 GB and 128 GB) while keeping the base storage tier the same. They’ll no doubt increase the base storage (from 16 GB to 32 GB) one day, but only once they notice the average user is also regularly filling up their storage (like they did when they went from 4 GB to 8 GB, and again when they went from 8 GB to 16 GB). Marc Palumbo Ya I agree completely, but you just told me “A few years ago Apple…”. I think we can assume that that data is out of date possibly. I know a lot of people who get the 16GB iPhone because it’s expensive already but have to suffer with the 16GB space. Apple can simply start at 32GB and sell it at the same price and just omit the 16GB model all together. Brad Fortin As far as I understand it they’re trying to find a balance between offering enough storage in the base tier that the average user doesn’t regularly run out and not offering so much that a significant amount of the storage shipped is wasted. Apple’s been the world’s largest flash memory buyer for a few years now, and if they upgrade the base storage when most users wouldn’t need it they would be wasting both money and the resources required to make the memory (especially when a lot of those resources are conflict materials). With Apple’s ethos being that they want to leave the planet better than they found it, not wanting to waste flash storage by leaving a large amount of it unused makes sense. FlamesFan89 bwah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Ok, the only part of that comment that is grounded in reality is the part about not wanting to waste money. Possibly they don’t want to waste resources, but only because it would result in wasted money. Any garbage about wanting to leave the planet better than they found it is pure kool-aid drinking nonsense. If that were truly the goal, they wouldn’t be in the electronics business. Brad Fortin “Ok, the only part of that comment that is grounded in reality is the part about not wanting to waste money. Possibly they don’t want to waste resources, but only because it would result in wasted money.” And what about the part where they want to reduce the use of conflict material? or do the lives of others not matter to you? “If that were truly the goal, they wouldn’t be in the electronics business.” It’s possible to be in the electronics business and still do well when it comes to environmental policies, and were they not in the electronics business other companies would fill their place without putting the same kind of effort into their environmental policies. Like how they’ve shifted almost all of their operations to renewable energy while their competitors largely use non-renewable energy, or like how they ensure their devices and chargers use less energy when idle than competitors’ products, or like how they prefer to use highly recyclable glass and aluminum instead of cheap and less recyclable plastics, or like how they’re willing to pay more for conflict-free materials rather than going for cheaper conflict materials, or like how they use packaging made from paper sourced from sustainable forests, or like how they use more expensive materials that are free of toxic substances rather than going for cheaper materials that contain things like mercury, lead, PVC, and BFRs. To think that they can’t make a difference in the industry is just plain ignorant. All aboard the Apple Hate Train, choo choo! FlamesFan89 “And what about the part where they want to reduce the use of conflict material? or do the lives of others not matter to you?” Um, I’m not the company making electronics. I’m not sure why you are questioning my use of conflict material. It’s great that they are doing all the things you list. Those are all excellent things to do, but they are an unbelievably far cry from “leave the planet better than they found it” What I’m saying is that you have nicely proven that advertising works. All aboard the Apple Love Train, Choo Choo! Brad Fortin “Um, I’m not the company making electronics. I’m not sure why you are questioning my use of conflict material.” If you purchase devices that use conflict material then you’re responsible for increasing the demand for those materials. Not being the manufacturer doesn’t absolve you of responsibility. “It’s great that they are doing all the things you list. Those are all excellent things to do, but they are an unbelievably far cry from “leave the planet better than they found it”” I’d like to hear your ideas for how we can leave the planet better than we found it. Does it involve everyone becoming luddites? FlamesFan89 Your jumps in logic are hilarious. I don’t buy Apple products, therefore I am in support of the use of conflict materials. That’s rich. Do you do standup on a regular basis? I also love the jump from me saying that there is a difference in operating in an relatively environmentally responsible manner, and actually improving the earth, to somehow that meaning I want the world to live as luddites. You’re a hoot. You should entertain children’s parties. Brad Fortin “Your jumps in logic are hilarious. I don’t buy Apple products, therefore I am in support of the use of conflict materials. That’s rich. Do you do standup on a regular basis?” All I said was “if you purchase devices that use conflict material then you’re responsible for increasing the demand for those materials”, whether they’re Apple products or not. You made that jump in logic all on your own. “I also love the jump from me saying that there is a difference in operating in an relatively environmentally responsible manner, and actually improving the earth, to somehow that meaning I want the world to live as luddites.” Your statement earlier of “if [leaving the planet better than we found it] were truly the goal, they wouldn’t be in the electronics business” implies that it’s not possible for an electronics company to meet that goal, which also implies that we can’t reach that goal so long as there are electronics companies. If you meant something different you should have worded your statements differently. FlamesFan89 No, the logic jump fails are all yours. You said yourself that Apple is trying to REDUCE their use of conflict materials, meaning that they do still use them, even if it is at a reduced rate. So by your logic, we should all become luddites and avoid electronics, because by purchasing them at all, we are increasing the demand for them, and therefore, are fully supportive of conflict materials. In fact, it means we practically commit the human rights violations personally. Furthermore, you have an issue with reading comprehension. I stated that if *Apple’s* goal, note the emphasis, is to leave the earth *Better* than they found it, again, note the emphasis, then they should not be in the electronics business. You had it right when you said “it’s not possible for an electronics company to meet that goal” but then made the jump to “which also implies that we can’t reach that goal so long as there are electronics companies” which is where you failed. It is possible for humans to leave the earth better than found, and perhaps it would mean not having electronics companies, and everyone being luddites, but I’m not suggesting we do that (hence your logic fail). *APPLE* is suggesting *THEY* can do it, but I stand behind my statement that they cannot, and that if that truly is *THEIR* goal, then they are not in the right business. You have tried to turn that into me suggesting that the world shouldn’t have electronics companies, and that I think we should all be luddites. That is absolutely not the case. Brad Fortin No, you. FlamesFan89 I believe you just laid down your King. Brad Fortin Again with the leaps in logic. I don’t think you even notice when you do it. FlamesFan89 I’m pretty sure you don’t know what logic actually is. After all, I’m not the one who thinks that buying electronics means that you are in favour of what happens in the Congo. That’s you. FlamesFan89 Also, for the record, Google is also working to reduce their sourcing of conflict minerals for their data centre hardware, they just aren’t marketing it like Apple is, so again, I say in regards to you: Hook, line, and sinker. You are the stuff that Apple’s marketing department’s dreams are made of. Marc Palumbo So I figured this should be updated. Apple did decide to offer 32GB as the base now. It was just a slow evolution for Apple because now the standard has changed. File sizes are still growing each day and this change was important for Apple. Now that has quieted quite a few complainers from the Apple front. Brad Fortin It hasn’t really quieted anyone, they’ve just moved on to complaining about the headphone jack. Although it’s nice to see that they also went back and increased the iPhone 6S to 32 GB and 128 GB. Marc Palumbo There will always be complainers. But for me, the airpods aren’t good… yet. Just the battery life alone is seriously dissapointing. For 159$, you can get nice BT speakers that last longer.. probably have better quality sound too. Right now, I don’t see the benefits outweighing the problems, even with the features of the W1 chip. Brad Fortin The battery life is pretty good for the size, better than anything else their size, and with the case you can recharge them in about 15 minutes. Pairing is also dead-simple, and the pairing propagates to any other Apple devices signed into the same Apple ID. The W1 chip seems pretty amazing, too: Class 1 Bluetooth, so a range of ~300 feet, and about 1/3 the power of previous chipsets: The Beats Solo 2 lasted ~12 hours, the new Beats Solo 3 with the W1 chip last ~40 hours. Marc Palumbo 5 hours of total music playback isn’t good at all. It would suck to have to wait 15 minutes to get a 60% charge. The only ones who would find pairing an issue are the ones who aren’t really tech savvy and haven’t paired BT ever. I find the battery life extremely disappointing. If you wanted BT headphones, the AirPods would not be a choice. Brad Fortin 5 hours is plenty for most people. It’s not often people listen to music for more than 5 hours, non-stop. Charge them while you go to the bathroom, or eat, or something. Pairing is still an issue for 90% of people. Especially if you want to switch inputs from a phone to a tablet (or whatever other device), don’t know the default pairing code, etc. Eliminating that hassle is great for the majority of people who aren’t tech savvy. Marc Palumbo 5 hours is plenty? i don’t know about that. Charging things constantly is a major hassle. I would rather have convenience than hassles. if the battery would have been 10 hours, I wouldn’t have said a thing. You’re kind of forcing people to walk around with they airpod chargers now of which people already carry around powerbanks. Men will start wearing fanny packs again. Jay This isn’t 1980. We don’t expect 1980 options. Why not go back 300 years when we had to draw pictures in the sand with a stick… Did people get mad at the sand company because they had to keep wiping their pictures to make new ones? Brad Fortin You might have to add a couple more 0’s to get to the point where drawing pictures in the sand was the best way to communicate. Point is, there’s always going to be a storage limit, even on a service that purports to offer “unlimited” storage. s0pcannon Nope they had a counter so you knew roughly when you would run out. Brad Fortin Just like iOS has a warning when you’re running low on storage but haven’t filled it up yet. But, of course, people regularly ignore warnings of any kind. Stephen B Morris “It is weird, however, that when the camera pulls back, it’s actually a Nexus 6P featured in the ad, despite the obvious dig at Apple.” It’s not weird. You don’t show your competitor’s product in your ad. Those who are fed up with having the same problem may see your product as the solution and switch phones. The subconscious thought process for the ad is to first see that the solution isn’t your current phone (Hey that doesn’t look like an iPhone) then cause you to consider it as a viable option (Hey if that phone can do that, what else can it do? Maybe I should get that one). The Nexus 6P product placement wasn’t a case of not having access to an iPhone. Nothing in marketing is done by accident. Nothing. Vito R. Most people don’t know what a Nexus 6P is, they’d look at the phone and assume it was just a generic black slab. Also, you absolutely want to show your competitors product if you’re slamming it. That said, not really sure they’re competitors here – Google doesn’t care if you use an iPhone as long as you use their services. Stephen B Morris They are competitors in a sense. Google is trying to get you to use Google Photos vs Apple’s iCloud services. You are right in stating that Google doesn’t care necessarily about you using an iPhone. That doesn’t mean that they can’t plant “seeds” in the ad to make you consider switching platforms. Yes not too many people are aware that the Nexus exists and if this was a Nexus ad, then the ad would have failed at delivering the message with very little screen time. However just showing a phone that clearly does not look like an iPhone should be enough for those bothered by what they feel is their iPhone’s shortcomings to consider other options. People get hit with what, 10000 ads a day. Some blatant, other are more subtle. Sometimes just planting a seed is good enough for now. Sally Mae Yo, y’all! Where’s the story about the millions of Android devices with gaping security holes…?!? MoYeung Not t-r-o-l-l, just a tease Moose Google can’t laugh at iphones with only 16GB of storage and no SD card. The Nexus 5 was the same and it was the only one available at Canadian carriers. blzd As is the 5x released last October. I wonder if this means the upcoming Nexus devices will get rid of the 16GB option finally.

"Apple India, Acer India, Le Ecosystem Technology India, Lenovo (India), OPPO Mobiles India have sought a relaxation of sourcing condition. No decision has been taken by the government," commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha. The current FDI policy mandates local sourcing of 30 per cent of the value of goods purchased in respect of proposals involving foreign investment of over 51 per cent. The government had in June paved the way for Apple to set up stores in the country by easing the norms for single- brand retail sourcing norms and companies with cutting-edge technology. "It has now been decided to relax local sourcing norms up to three years and a relaxed sourcing regime for another five years for entities undertaking single brand retail trading of products having 'state-of-art' and 'cutting edge' technology," the Prime Minister's Office had said. Apple is expected to be a beneficiary of the rule tweak. Devraj Singh, executive director (tax & regulatory services) of EY, said, "This policy change as to exemption of sourcing norms will definitely give confidence to the bigger players to set up shops in India as compliance of the sourcing condition in the initial phase was difficult to comply with."  More stories in Business September spectrum sale date Seal on HDFC Life-Max merger Lok Sabha okay gives extra impetus to GST US ban hits Wockhardt Bids for Duncans invited McLeod stress on marketing Britannia Bengal drill    Copyright © 2016 The Telegraph.

Frank Ocean, “the innovative and enigmatic R&B singer, is set to release his next album, Boys Don’t Cry, on Friday through an exclusive deal with Apple Music, according to a person with knowledge of the release plans,” wrote Ben Sisario and Joe Coscarelli. Related Stories Frank Ocean, Harper Lee, and the Reclusive Artist Frank Ocean's Construction Project, Deconstructed Frank Ocean’s Radically Humane Response to the Orlando Shootings The story coincided with the arrival of an “endless” video showing Ocean performing carpentry work. But because the stream was posted without mention of an imminent album, it seemed likely that the Times’ source, “who was not authorized to discuss the release plans and therefore spoke on condition of anonymity,” was someone high-up at Ocean’s label, or in Ocean’s creative camp, or at Apple. The unauthorized breaking of silence was a reminder that even for a talent as singular as Ocean—and even in an era when physical distribution and long-lead promotion are no longer essential steps in the album-release process—no major musician fully works alone. Friday came and went without Boys Don’t Cry materializing, spurring understandable frustration among fans. But the false alarm seemed of a piece with one of the ideals that Ocean has long stood for: the notion of an artist fully in charge of his art. It’s possible that logistical snares have held up the album, of course, and it’s possible it was never actually planned for Friday in the first place. But at this point, after so many previous delays from him, Ocean may again be exercising his prerogative to stall—perhaps to continuing to polish the music, or perhaps to confound expectations again, or to retreat because of nerves, or to simply finish building whatever object he’s been working on in the video stream. By now it seems most healthy to think of all the waiting as part of the act. Throughout last week, Ocean appeared and disappeared on his stream for a few hours at a time, sporting various fresh outfits as he progressed from sawing to welding to entering a second room where he spray-painted boxes. It hasn’t been scintillating viewing. But it has put a spotlight on the other crucial way in which artists never fully work alone—fandom. At least some people are taking Ocean’s construction as performance rather than publicity stunt. Reading the Reddit thread with the comprehensive summary of what’s happened on the livestream—and all of the social-media spectacle surrounding it—offers a strange thrill: At least some people are taking Ocean’s activities as performance rather than publicity stunt. Hypnotic gifs have been made. The instrumental music that’s played in the background has been recorded and analyzed. Futile attempts have been made to locate the warehouse where he’s been working (though there are indications the entire stream may have been prerecorded). Theories as to the project’s meaning have been offered (“Frank is trying to make us realize that it takes a long time to create something”). Black-and-white images have been colorized. The irony of literally watching paint dry has been noted. Someone even created an online motion detector to alert the Internet whenever Ocean appears, though, unfortunately, it hasn’t had a chance to be used: As of this writing, Ocean’s last construction stint happened early Friday morning.  The reigning theory is that he has been building a staircase; for now, the boxes that might be individual stairs sit in the main workroom, unattended despite the livestream still running. You can tune in whenever you want, and Ocean, most likely, will return whenever—and only whenever—he wants.

Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press. Continue Reading Frederick Carl Frieseke / Wikimedia The Running Conversation in Your Head Julie Beck What a close study of "inner speech" reveals about why humans talk to themselves Language is the hallmark of humanity—it allows us to form deep relationships and complex societies. But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Electoral College Was Meant to Stop Men Like Trump From Being President Peter Beinart The founders envisioned electors as people who could prevent an irresponsible demagogue from taking office. Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook A semi-comprehensive list of the business concerns that may influence the president-elect as he prepares for the nation’s highest office Though several previous presidents have entered office with private fortunes to their names, none has done so with a business empire nearly as large or complicated as that of President-elect Donald J. Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out.

Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common?

Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000. (The most up-to-date results are here.) Continue Reading Etienne Fabre / SSAC A Shocking Find In a Neanderthal Cave In France Ed Yong A rock structure, built deep underground, is one of the earliest hominin constructions ever found. In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Continue Reading Ricardo Moraes / Reuters The Average 29-Year-Old Derek Thompson Forget media archetypes of older Millennials as college-educated singles living in cities. The typical 29-year-old is living with a partner in the suburbs—without a bachelor’s degree. What is the typical life experience for an American on the verge of turning 30? This is a hard question to answer, no matter who is asking. But it’s become especially difficult for an industry responsible with providing the answers: the national press. An irony of digital media is that the Internet distributes journalism, but it concentrates journalists. Jobs at media sites like The Atlantic, BuzzFeed, or Gawker are five-times more likely to be located in New York or Washington, D.C., than television-news jobs. The clustering force is only getting more centripetal: The share of reporting jobs in Los Angeles, NYC, and DC increased by 60 percent between 2004 and 2014. It’s easy to imagine many downsides of this agglomeration, like the dissolution of local reporting, but a subtler risk is that well-educated journalists in these dense cities wind up with a skewed impression of the world, a “majority illusion” based on the extremely unrepresentative cross-section of the country that’s immediately around them. To be fair, being a reporter in Des Moines or rural Nebraska, while it provides a better view of Des Moines and rural Nebraska, doesn’t offer a universal window into the average experiences of all Americans, either. For that, one needs something else, like a national survey.

But the dynamic third-year wide receiver is important in other ways, too, such as serving as a mentor to rookie cornerback Eli Apple. “He has taught me how to read routes better, and he will tell me things from a receiver perspective, like what receivers look for and little things like that,” Apple, the Giants’ first-round pick out of Ohio State who has been seeing plenty of first-team reps, said after practice Monday. “He has really been on me and just telling me to trust my talent and get my head around. Little things like that we have been talking about all the time, so he has been helping me out a lot actually.” Whenever Apple thinks he has gotten used to some of Beckham’s moves, the two-time Pro Bowl wideout will pull out something new. Apple had his best practice Saturday, when he showcased some of his coverage skills. Still, he was called for two holding penalties. The knock on him coming out of college was he used his hands too much. Beckham has talked to him about that, too. “You just have to learn how to mirror guys better and use your feet more, kind of just cut them off of their route and little things like that,” he said. “I am learning every day.” Ben McAdoo isn’t giving away any secrets for his preseason debut Friday against the Dolphins at MetLife Stadium. The first-year Giants head coach wouldn’t reveal whether wide receiver Victor Cruz would play — “We’re not going to talk much about [playing] time,” McAdoo said — and he won’t divulge who will be calling the plays, offensive coordinator Mike Sullivan or himself. “We’ll have a play caller on Friday, and we’ll evaluate it afterwards,” he said. McAdoo did say he has made a decision on who that person will be, but will keep it to himself. He called plays for the Giants the last two years as their offensive coordinator. He suggested he and Sullivan could rotate play calling. Victor CruzPhoto: Charles Wenzelberg As for the 29-year-old Cruz, who has missed most of the last two seasons with a right patellar tear and injured left calf, he has been a full participant since the start of training camp. The next step is playing in a game. “Victor has been sharp,” quarterback Eli Manning said. “I feel like he’s making plays, getting [up] to speed.” Co-owner Steve Tisch and former Giants linebacker Antonio Pierce both attended practice. Manning was crisp and accurate all practice, particularly during the 11-on-11, two-minute offense team drills in which he completed all six of his passes on one drive, capped by a 15-yard scoring strike to Beckham. After throwing an interception in his first pass of training camp, Manning hasn’t been picked off since. The Giants’ running game was 19th in the NFL last year, producing just five touchdowns, and so far in training camp, it hasn’t looked much better. That trend continued Monday, as Big Blue struggled to get a push against the middle of their vastly improved defensive line. Ryan Nassib throws a really nice deep ball. The backup quarterback hit on a pair of bombs, connecting with wide receivers Roger Lewis Jr. and Tavarres King. Defensive tackle Jay Bromley (ankle) and linebacker J.T. Thomas (hamstring) remain on the Physically Unable to Perform (PUP) list.

Monday, August 8, 2016 · 5:28 pm · 7 Comments “Apple’s TV efforts have undergone several plot twists in recent years, but its latest strategy finally appears close to being ready for prime time,” Buster Coen writes for TheStreet. “According to a recent report from Recode, Apple has focused on developing a TV guide that will allow users to navigate programming more easily via the Apple TV user interface. The company would reportedly explore the possibility of a single sign-in for the many services that a user may be subscribed to, such as Netflix and Time Warner’s (TWX) HBO GO.” “This news comes off of The Wall Street Journal‘s recent report that Apple was exploring the possibility of developing a skinny bundle last year, before tabling the idea because of failed negotiations,” Coen writes. “The idea was promising, but the Journal reports that Apple executives were too cocky in the negotiating process, remaining stubborn about their pricing and bluffing network executives into thinking that Apple had already made deals with other networks. As a result, Apple was unable to pull together the skinny bundle that it wanted.” “However, the company still recognizes the need for innovation in the TV sector to boost flagging sales — hence the TV guide,” Coen writes. “The proposed TV guide will certainly make it easier for users to find their desired content, but whether it will be enough to compel people to go out and replace their current set-top box with Apple TV is another story.” Read more in the full article here.

Example: AOL local TV listings, on air, cable, satellite. robebo Monday, August 8, 2016 - 7:47 pm · Reply I don’t believe for a moment that report that appeared in the Wall Street Journal about Apple being cocky, etc. Apple isn’t cocky, they have a clear understanding of the service they wish to offer their customers and that service is not the current cable blend of 10% stuff you want to watch combined with 90% stuff you wouldn’t give a dime for linked to a package price that creeps up every month or so until you spend an hour on the phone while they try in a thousand different ways to up sell you. Apple believes you only want the 10% and you want to pay a reasonable price that is what it is and stays that way over time. That isn’t cocky. That’s customer oriented. And it’s why in the not-too-distant future, those cable guys will be reduced to providing network access to contact provided by everyone else. Ads 3.0 Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 12:51 am · Reply Why does a content service have to cost the user any money? Why can’t it be supported by ads? Why can’t these ads reflect users’ profiles, instead of just generic, one-fits-all messages? Why can’t products be easily purchased with one click or a verbal command? Apple has a lot of information about users. They could charge a premium over other ad networks by smartly mining this info. For example, almost everyday I ask Siri what the Cubs score is. They could use this data and push ads regarding any Cub related business such as Cub paraphernalia, tickets, etc. Then, all that is needed to purchase the product or service is a verbal command or fingerprint, etc. I’m sure advertisers, companies, etc. would be thrilled with this model, instead of the ancient method ads are currently strewn across the landscape. It should be noted that I am not an expert in this field and some of the above might already be in play. I mentioned a few years ago that Android was listening to my voice if I had YouTube open in a browser. They would take my verbal ques and deliver an appropriate ad on the TV. For example, if I mentioned that I needed a vacation an ad for a local travel agency would appeared. If I said I was hungry for tacos a Taco Bell ad would appear. I only tested this once and it scared the crap out of me, so I never again used YouTube while watching TV. This is also another reason why I switched to the iPhone. I’m wondering if Apple’s differential privacy will be able to alleviate any privacy issues. alanaudio Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 3:00 am · Reply Most on-line TV guides offer variants of a grid style of timeline. If Apple can come up with a significantly better alternative, then they could be onto a winner. I would guess that a system that learns your preferences is the way they would go. For an example of how it’s likely to work, I would suggest taking a look at the Apple News app on IOS. You tell it which news sources particularly appeal and what topics you prefer and it offers selections tailored to your tastes. The more you use it, the more it seems to know what sort of news you prefer. Apple News has recently become my go-to source for news every morning and I think that Apple could do something similar with TV. It’s a shame that Apple News isn’t available on OSX too, I miss it when I’m using my iMac. Birdseed Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 9:34 am · Reply Yes, I always think that Apple News on the Mac would be awesome. Why Apple has not provided this is inexplicable.

REUTERS/Stephen Lam When it comes to the next iPhone, it seems like, in many ways, iPhone users will have to do without. Apple is changing things up and continuing its long war on that most humble gadget component: the button. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who has an excellent track record when it comes to iPhone leaks, reports that the new iPhone will have a much different home button. Per the article: "[The] new models will have a pressure-sensitive button that provides feedback to the user via a vibrating haptic sensation rather than a true physical click, according to the people." In other words, it will look like a button and feel like a button but it won't actually, you know, be a button. Which, I have to admit, troubles me a little bit. Some of it is psychological. Physical buttons and switches feel direct, and can make you feel like you have more control. If your touch screen is unresponsive, you know you can always hit the power button and the side button on an iPhone and physically reboot it. On a broader level, the revamped home button could make Apple devices harder to repair. Several Apple consumers already complain about "planned obsolescence" — the idea that the firm makes things hard to repair so that it can make money off new hardware. It's a bit of a tinfoil hat way to look at things. But with no button at all and no easy way to get into a phone, we're likely to see even fewer ways for third-party businesses to be able to replace parts. And not being able to replace parts could, in effect, shorten a gadget's life span. Complicating the function of the home button has already had this negative effect for some Apple customers. This February, many people were upset that replacing Apple's home button made their phones inoperable. Apple explained this was to ensure that no one tampered with the button's built-in security features. That's a sensible explanation. But it still means that users have to go to Apple with their repair problems, and possibly get their whole phone replaced, thanks to the complications of the home button. This only stands to get worse if the rumors are true. There are some general advantages, however, to ditching buttons, apart from aesthetics. One is that it gives you fewer places where outside debris such as sand, dirt, dust or water, could get in and wreak havoc with your devices. There has been, for example, a lot of pressure on Apple to make the iPhone more water-resistant. Fewer outside seams theoretically helps with that. And software buttons aren't all bad, either. In other phones, we've seen Android manufacturers go further than what Apple's rumored to be doing with the next iPhone and using software-only buttons with no physical spot on the phone to make screens bigger and free up screen space. The home, back and options buttons on a bar that hides at the bottom of the screen when not in use. Apple's certainly shown it can design for software buttons with its pressure-sensitive Force Touch on the new MacBook and the iPhone's 3D Touch. That technology means Apple can offer more than one dimension of function even with a flat screen. In fact, the options from those technologies goes far beyond what a single button could ever do. If it's executed well and doesn't react every time something brushes against it — I'm looking at you, Xbox One power button — it's unlikely to detract much from the experience. In fact, I only ever remember that my MacBook trackpad doesn't click when my computer's off. (Or, you know, when I'm writing an entire column about buttons.) We all seemed to get used to losing the physical "call" and "end" buttons, or the physical snap of hanging up a flip phone. Given what's rumored from Apple, this will be a far smaller compromise of physical sensation than that. But we may miss the button in other ways. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

Vine Report HOME U.S. SCIENCE/HEALTH WORLD ENTERTAINMENT TECH LIFE&STYLE Subscriptions Home TECH iPad Mini 5 specs rumors, release date: September launch means device will be part of Apple iPhone 7 event Jude Abastar Aug 10, 2016 1:10 PM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Apple)The iPad Mini 4. The tablet's next version, the iPad Mini 5, is expected to be released in September. The Apple iPad Mini does not share the same market dominance as its bigger cousin, the iPad, and the company's flagship smartphone, the iPhone. However, it no longer is a surprise for Apple in coming up with the decision to add a fifth generation to the line of iPad Mini's because the device in itself represents a highly specific class of users. Proof of how Apple values this little tablet device is the rumor that the upcoming iPad Mini 5 will be released in a huge September event by the company, along with two of the most highly anticipated devices from the Cupertino-based tech giant, the new iPhone 7 and the Apple Watch 2. The rumor does not really need contention because it comes from reputable tech leaker Evan Blass. According to Blass, pre-orders for the device will start on Sept. 9 and that Apple will then make the release date official right after that date. Although the first generations of the iPad Mini were marketed as the cheaper version of the iPad and the iPad Air, the iPad Mini 5 has what it takes to finally have its own identity and in the process impress users with its new set of premium hardware and software specs. For instance, the design is reportedly going to be sleeker this time, according to Mobile & Apps. The report also said that the use of an aluminum chassis will make it lighter but more durable. PC Tablet reiterates this claim by saying that the new iPad Mini will be 5 mm thick, which is made possible because of the absence of the 3.5 mm audio jack. There also are rumors that the upcoming tablet will be equipped with 3D Touch pressure sensitivity on its screen and that the 7.9-inch display will be retained. However, the fact that it will be powered by the most advanced A9 mobile processor means that it will be showcasing much better resolution, performance, and graphics overall.

Photo: George Tinari/Cult of Mac Apple’s latest iPhones could be its last with physical home buttons. According to a new report from Bloomberg, the iPhone 7 series will instead feature a new pressure-sensitive home button that uses Apple’s Force Touch technology. They might look awfully familiar, but this year’s iPhone upgrades will actually bring lots of big changes. Mark Gurman of Bloomberg reports that we can look forward to better photos, improved home buttons, and more. According to sources familiar with Apple’s plans, the iPhone 7’s home button will work in much the same way as Apple’s latest MacBook trackpads. When you press it, it will feel like it’s clicking, but that sensation will be generated by a haptic feedback engine. In addition to this new home button, the larger iPhone 7 Plus will deliver a new dual-lens camera that takes brighter and more detailed photos. “Both sensors, which each capture color differently, simultaneously take a picture, and the device produces a single, merged photograph,” the report adds. “The dual system sharpens photos taken in low-light environments, the person said.” This new camera also allows users to zoom into their subject without loosing so much clarity. However, it will be exclusive to the larger iPhone; the smaller iPhone 7 won’t get it, but it will get a larger lens instead. Gurman also confirms that the iPhone 7 series will indeed ship without a headphone jack. Users will either have to use wireless headsets with Bluetooth, or buy new headphones with Lightning connectors. It’s still unclear if Apple will give us an adapter or new Lightning-equipped EarPods. The good news is, by doing away with the headphone jack, Apple will give the iPhone an additional speaker that will make it louder.

Toggle Navigation A-   A+ Sign in News   Stock Home «Back Companies now big customers for Apple Vindu Goel | San Francisco Aug 09, 2016 12:16 AM IST In the primordial days of computing, IBM machines were so common inside corporations that there was a running joke in the industry: Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM. These days, the same could be said about Apple. Even IBM is promoting Apple gear. Apple's iPhones and iPads have become the preferred mobile computing devices for corporations, as industries from insurers to airlines aim to ditch bulky PCs and give their employees the ability to do their jobs from anywhere using smartphones or tablets. For Apple, which is struggling to reverse declining sales of its iPhones and Macs and has seen overall revenues drop for two quarters in a row, the corporate market is a surprising bright spot. Sales of high-end iPads to business customers in particular have been strong. Nearly half of all iPads are now bought by corporations and governments, according to the research firm Forrester. APPLE IS THE NEW IBM Apple's iPhones and iPads have become the preferred mobile computing devices for corporations   Sales of high-end iPads to business customers have been strong   During Apple's last financial year, it sold $25 billion in gear and services to companies and other large customers   While that was only about 11 per cent of the company's overall revenue, business sales were up 40 per cent from the previous year "Apple is stronger in the enterprise market with its devices than it is with consumers," said Frank Gillett, an industry analyst at Forrester. It is a long way from the days when Steven P Jobs, Apple's co-founder and longtime chief executive, derided corporate technology buyers as "orifices" and preferred to focus on building great products that would sell themselves. Pinpointing exact figures for Apple's corporate sales is difficult. Apple said growth was strong but declined to disclose recent numbers. During its last fiscal year, which ended in September, Apple said it sold $25 billion in gear and services to companies and other large customers. While that was only about 11 per cent of the company's overall revenue, those business sales were up 40 per cent from the previous year. That's compared with 28 per cent growth for the entire business. Companies are turning to Apple's products for their tight-knit hardware and software, advanced security features and intuitive interfaces. Aiding Apple's corporate sales has been a concern that phones and tablets running Google's Android software, which are generally cheaper and popular with consumers, have lagged in the security technology and the standardisation that companies want. For British Airways, which has built more than 40 custom iPad apps for its work force, switching to tablets has eliminated reams of paper used for flight plans, passenger manifests and maintenance records. Another app allows anyone at the airline to grab an iPad and quickly rebook passengers when a flight is cancelled or weather wreaks havoc on schedules. "We can get to customers wherever they are," said Abigail Comber, who is in charge of the customer experience at the airline. "It's technology that's very intuitive. What the team has managed to do brilliantly is take away everything that happens on the back end." The carrier has so far deployed its apps across 17,000 iPads, and is looking to digitise even more of its business. Apple says it is focused on creating great devices - for all customers. "We're dedicated to building products that make people's lives better, often in ways that we couldn't have even imagined, enabling them to do things that they have never done before," Susan Prescott, Vice-President of worldwide product marketing, markets and applications, said in a statement. "Our goal with business customers is the same - to enable them to do something great with mobile and truly modernise and transform their business." Apple's increased attention to business customers has not come without internal angst. "Apple totally recognises that their products are being used in a workplace context and not just at home," Gillett said. "But they are rabidly focused on making the world better for individual users. They have a strong fear if they begin to think too much about their enterprise customers, they will compromise the consumer experience." Apple runs three-day boot camps for companies at its campus in Cupertino, California, to help them rapidly build prototype apps. But it was not an approach that could be scaled up to thousands of corporate customers. Hence Apple's decision to team up with other companies that specialise in catering to businesses. As Timothy D Cook, Apple's chief executive, quipped at an industry conference last September: "Life is short. We're going to die soon. And you've got to have as many friends as you can." IBM, Apple's archrival in the early personal computer business, is now one of the company's biggest boosters. Under a two-year-old partnership, IBM, which has transformed itself into a technology services powerhouse, has developed more than 100 business-oriented apps for Apple's iOS operating system that it has sold to over 2,000 enterprises. The effort brought in more than half a billion dollars in revenue to Big Blue last year.Mahmoud Naghshineh, IBM's general manager for the Apple partnership, says Apple's devices appeal to companies that need to manage complex processes. IBM's strategy is to develop apps for specific industries, then customise them for each customer. Claims adjusters at Amica Mutual Insurance, for example, recently began using an IBM iPad app to collect information on claims, take photos, record statements and gain access to individual customer files. "The adjuster in the future will be able to complete their entire job on the iPad," said Adam Kostecki, an Amica manager involved in the project. Apple has also struck a deal with Cisco Systems, a maker of gear that manages corporate computer networks, to develop software that gives priority to mobile devices or apps. That software is in testing and will be unveiled next month when Apple releases a big upgrade to its mobile operating system. Three months ago, Apple teamed up with SAP, a big German maker of business software, to make it easier to build apps that connect to the SAP back-end software that many large enterprises use for inventory, sales, human resources and other corporate tasks. SAP is developing some of those apps itself and also writing a set of software tools that will let companies easily write their own mobile apps to retrieve their SAP systems. Many companies are forging ahead on their own. Lowe's, the home improvement retailer, has built five iPod apps. One allows store employees to pull up reviews with 360-degree views of products, check inventory and guide customers to the exact location of a product within its warehouse-size outlets. Other apps allow employees to match a carpet pattern and estimate how much a customer would need to cover a given area. Inspired by the iPhone-based checkout system at Apple stores, Lowe's has even written a checkout app that it is testing in its two Manhattan stores. "If you think about devices that a lot of retailers provide to their associates, they aren't user-friendly. They are sometimes very old technology," said Eric Hanson, the director of digital experience at Lowe's. "Our associates were deserving of an experience that was the same as we gave to our customers." Van Baker, an analyst at the Gartner research firm who studies mobile technology in businesses, said that most companies are just beginning to explore how mobile devices can transform their businesses. "For the vast majority of enterprises, mobile usage extends to email, contacts and calendars," he said. That opens up opportunities that Apple is cautiously pursuing. "Cook has taken a pragmatic approach without changing Apple's culture," Gillett, the Forrester analyst, said. Apple's philosophy, he said, is, "We want to stick to our knitting, what we're really good at - devices and software experiences for individuals - and work with others to translate Apple's strengths into the workplace." ©2016 The New York Times News Service Advertisement << Previous Article   «Back Most Read Ratan Tata's ego caused financial mess for group firms: Cyrus Mistry Demonetisation: Problem of plenty for RBI as banks park record Rs 4.32 lakh crore Demonetisation: Union Minister latest victim as hospital declines to accept old notes Supreme Court refuses to stay petitions against demonetisation No transaction charges on debit card payments: Govt More From International New UK visa rules for non-EU nationals come in force tomorrow South Korea President's office admits to buying 360 Viagra pills Japan-South Korea intelligence-sharing pact would aggravate hostility: China Donald Trump picks Nikki Haley as US envoy to United Nations Will Cyber Monday outdo Black Friday in 2016?

The US Supreme Court will decide in a case that pits Apple against Samsung Written by Marc Bain Obsession Fashion August 08, 2016 Apple, as seen by a Samsung device. (Reuters/Tim Wimborne) Share Written by Marc Bain Obsession Fashion August 08, 2016 This October, the US Supreme Court is scheduled to take on a case with major implications for designers of all sorts. It centers on how much Samsung should pay Apple for infringing on iPhone design patents. But a broad coalition of designers—including Dieter Rams; Stefan Hans Sielaff, design director at Bentley; Nicolas Ghesquiére, creative director at Louis Vuitton; and many others—argues that the case hinges on how we value design itself. The legal battle between the two smartphone makers is over how much money Samsung should pay Apple, after a US jury ruled in 2012 that Samsung had infringed on Apple patents and copied the design of the iPhone, specifically the rounded corners of the face, its bezel, and the grid in which icons are arranged. The judgment ordered Samsung to pay Apple $930 million, but on appeal Samsung successfully got the part of the ruling on trademark liability reversed, reducing the amount to $548 million. Samsung believes the amount is still excessive, and wants a cut in the $399 million of that figure attributed to design patents. But designers are concerned that if the court reduces the damages, it reduces the worth we attribute to design and could encourage copying in fashion and other industries. On Aug. 4, a group including Ghesquiére, Alexander Wang, Dries Van Noten, Calvin Klein, and others filed an amicus brief (pdf), which is a legal document from non-litigants with an interest in the outcome of a case, lending their weight to Apple’s argument. It begins by quoting the 1887 Congress, which stated that “it is the design that sells the article, and so that makes it possible to realize any profit at all.” The day after, brands including Tiffany & Co., Adidas, and Crocs filed briefs in support of Apple as well, according to WWD (paywall). Currently the relevant section of US law covering design patents states that the infringer is liable for the total profit made on the infringing product. US courts have typically taken this to mean that the party holding the patent is entitled to all profits attributed to the design, even if the infringement is on just one part of the design. Samsung argues the law goes too far. In the Aug. 4 brief, Charles Mauro, founder of design firm Mauro New Media, said design is essential to a “consumer’s understanding of what the product does and what the product means.” Appearance is as integral to a product’s identity as what it does. In its brief, Crocs argued that if design is part of the identity of a smartphone, it’s even more the case with a fashion product, since it doesn’t have numerous functions and design is “almost one and the same” with its brand. Mauro believes if the court rules that design infringement can be apportioned and liability no longer covers all profits, designers lose a major deterrent against copying, removing their incentive to invest time and money in developing new designs. “We would expect to see within a few years a massive influx of copycat products in the US and we will certainly see a diminishing impact of design,” Mauro told WWD. In theory, designers could become something like involuntary licensees, where the copier could still turn a profit off an infringing product and just pay for the portion that it copied. Earlier this year, however, a group of tech companies, including Dell, eBay, Facebook, and Google filed their own amicus brief (pdf) backing Samsung, which sees the penalty as excessive. Even if a Samsung phone infringed on 1% of an Apple patent, Apple would be entitled to 100% of the profits. The law could lead to “absurd” results, Samsung says, such as the maker of a shoe that infringes on two separate design patents having to pay more than its total profit.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Report: Apple boosted by corporate customers as consumer demand falters By Ethan Baron / August 8, 2016 at 12:34 PM Apple co-founder Steve Jobs sneered at corporate customers, but with iPhone sales dropping and the company’s revenue slipping, business clients have become a key base for the Cupertino firm. Jobs in 2008 demonstrated his contempt for the corporate buyer, referring in a meeting with Intel officials to the position of chief information officer. “Why would I do anything for that orifice called the CIO?” Jobs said, according to Computer Dealer News. Now, however, Apple is increasingly reliant on big-business customers, who occupy a crucial role now that the firm’s phone sales have been slowing down. Last year’s $25 billion in sales of equipment and services to companies and other large customers represented only about 11 percent of total revenue, but also reflected a 40 percent jump over the previous year, compared with 28 percent revenue growth overall for the company, according to The New York Times. “Sales of high-end iPads to business customers in particular have been strong,” the paper reported. “Nearly half of all iPads are now bought by corporations and governments. Companies are turning to Apple’s products for their tight-knit hardware and software, advanced security features and intuitive interfaces. “Aiding Apple’s corporate sales has been a concern that phones and tablets running Google’s Android software, which are generally cheaper and popular with consumers, have lagged in the security technology and the standardization that companies want.” The company’s iPhones and iPads “have become the preferred mobile computing devices for corporations, as industries from insurers to airlines aim to ditch bulky PCs and give their employees the ability to do their jobs from anywhere using smartphones or tablets,” the paper reported. And Apple CEO Tim Cook takes a different view of the corporate customer than Jobs. The firm started taking “enterprise” buyers more seriously when people began using their iPhones and iPads at work, Cook told a conference in September, according to Bloomberg. “When the world was bifurcated between consumer and enterprise, we focused on the consumer,” Cook said. “But now if you want a smartphone, you don’t say, ‘I want an enterprise smartphone.’ “Enterprise is a huge opportunity for us.” Photo illustration: An iPhone held up in front of the Apple logo.

Now, with BYOD, IT has to support Macs, iPads and iPhones. Apple wisely partnered with IBM who have been selling support and ‘solutions’ usually on a per user basis. The IT department simply passes IBM’s bill to each department (plus their internal mark-up). Users get the devices they want. IT takes no risk. Apple’s devices are more secure and manageable. Cisco and SAP joined the party more recently. Apple, IBM, Cisco, SAP, and end users all win. TrickyDickie “more secure and manageable” Lol! Matt Perkins iOS devices are proven more secure and easier to use than Android devices. You can be an Android fanboy all you want but the facts are facts. Security Researches all agree iPhones are more secure than Android devices. Hackers all agree iPhones are harder to hack into than Android devices and even Consumer Reports says iPhones offer the best out of box experience compared to Android. So not sure why you’re laughing unless it’s at your own ignorance. William Haynes IBM now sells and makes apps for the SURFACE tablets too. fstein No doubt. Windows and it’s variants must be supported too. AAPL.To.Break.$95.Soon.>:-) How long has it been since Steve Jobs passed away? Do people really think Apple is going to follow his way of doing business forever. Times change and the business has to change with it. When Steve was alive Android didn’t have 85% market share like it does now. All that’s left is poor countries with poorly-paid consumers only wanting to buy the cheapest piece of smartphone they can get their hands on. Apple had better find some other customers willing to pay for their products no matter where they come from. Apple should try as hard as possible to woo the enterprise and maybe the company will eventually lose that doomed reputation. Heck, no one is saying Microsoft or Tesla is doomed, so why should Apple be considered doomed. It would be nice if Apple could take over where BlackBerry used to be. Wall Street once worshipped RIM for having a lock on the enterprise. TrickyDickie “why should Apple be considered doomed?” Because even the fanboys are starting to wake up to their marketing tactics lol CelestialTerrestrial Tim did manage to get IBM and Cisco to promote Apple products in the Enterprise. IBM is now a reseller of Apple products. IBM is a Authorized Service Provider for Apple in the Enterprise. IBM is also a large and growing customer and case study as an Apple customer. Check out the JMAF conference presentation from last year, it’s a pretty good video to watch what IBM did last year and what benefits they are seeing. I think the old CIO mentality has been changing over the years and Apple’s benefitting. It sure doesn’t hurt that Tim is an ex-IBM and ex-Compaq manager with a degree in Industrial Design and an MBA. As brilliant as Jobs was, he really never understood the business world and that’s partly his own fault. He was too busy with the consumer and education space, he forgot who spends the most in IT. plus, IBM had the control and pushing PCs along with every PC clone mfg. So Microsoft benefitted by slapping their OS on anyone’s hardware. The problem is that it’s just flat out more costly to manage from an IT perspective and they forced their users to use Microsoft based OS, and then the employees bought PCs for the home because that’s all they knew. The iPhone really turned a lot of PC users over to Apple, and the Mac business has been increasing since. I think if everyone that has an iPhone were to use Macs, then Mac market share would reach 18% global market, which isn’t too shabby, they currently have only 7 to 8% global. The thing that people STILL can’t wrap their heads around is that if you add up the Net Profits of Microsoft, Google, Samsung, HP Inc., Dell, Lenovo, Acer and ASUS (All of Apple’s biggest competitors for desktops/laptops, smartphones and tablets), Apple makes as much as they do COMBINED. Apparently Apple’s business model works, and these others don’t. Apple only works on a 40% Gross Margin and retains a 20% Net Profit. For those idiots that think that Apple’s products are overpriced… I have one thing to say. NO, Apple’s products are not overpriced. It’s their competitors that are selling their products too cheaply, not managing their inventory/product offering well and they don’t have a strong efficient retail store model that works. If you look at Dell, HP, Lenovo, etc. they just make too damn many products and what happens is they overspend R&D, Support, and most importantly Inventory and they end up discounting them because they not only confuse the customer, but they can’t sell everything they make. It’s called TOO many SKU’s, TOO much inventory, TOO much discounting, and that’s TOO many TOO’s. Going after market share is the DUMBEST thing to do if you go after business that’s not profitable. A big number (customers) multiplied by zero (no profits) is still zero profits. That’s why IBM, Compaq and others got out of the PC industry and sold their businesses to someone dumber than they were. When people say that Android has the biggest market share. Well, yes and no. If you look at the smartphone business of products sold under the MSRP of $400, Apple has no market share, but if you look at the $400+ market, Apple has a pretty damn good market share. It’s just that the there are more people buying the sub-$400 smartphones and those don’t make any profit. They have those Freedom phones for $10, how can anyone make a phone for $10 and make an actual profit?

He accepts the inevitability of flaws, but relentlessly insists that employees pursue perfection. ‘I twitch less,’ says [APple executive Eddy] Cue cheerfully when I ask about the difference between Jobs and Cook. ‘No, no, no, just kidding! Steve was in your face, screaming, and Tim is more quiet, more cerebral in his approach. When you disappoint Tim, even though he isn’t screaming at you, you get the same feeling. I never wanted to disappoint Steve, and I never want to disappoint Tim. [Other than them,] I have that feeling with, like, my dad.'” “Perhaps the best example of this continuous improvement at work under Cook is the company’s rehabilitation of its Maps app, which was universally scorned after its introduction in September 2012,” Tetzeli reports. “Apple Maps’ miscues were legion: Bridges seemed to plunge into rivers; hospitals were located at addresses actually belonging to shopping centers; directions were so bad they confused airport runways with roads. Apple didn’t have a billion customers at the time, but it had more than enough to turn the app into a national joke. ‘Look, the first thing is that you’re embarrassed,’ says Cue. ‘Let’s just deal with that one fact of emotion. These things mean a lot to us, we work really hard, and so you’re embarrassed. We had completely underestimated the product, the complexity of it.'” “The changes didn’t come easy. Shortly after the app’s debut, Scott Forstall, a 15-year Apple veteran who was in charge of its development, was eased out. That was just the beginning. Forstall had overseen dozens of people working in relative isolation: Several thousand people now work on Maps,” Tetzeli reports. “But the company did more than just throw numbers at the problem. Cook also forced his execs to re-examine, and change, the way they worked with development teams. Famous for being secretive, Apple opened up a bit. ‘We made significant changes to all of our development processes because of it,’ says Cue, who now oversees Maps. ‘To all of us living in Cupertino, the maps for here were pretty darn good. Right? So [the problem] wasn’t obvious to us. We were never able to take it out to a large number of users to get that feedback. Now we do.’ Apple now does public beta testing of its most significant software projects, something that Jobs never liked to do. In 2014, the company asked users to test run its Yosemite upgrade to OS X. Last year, it introduced beta testing of iOS, which is the company’s most important operating system. ‘The reason you as a customer are going to be able to test iOS,’ Cue says, ‘is because of Maps.'” Tons more in the full article – recommended – here.

I have been using the inbuilt public transport functions to get around London. It’s great as it makes buses simple. But in most places I visited in Europe there just aren’t any public transport options. Street numbers are hopeless. Businesses are worse. In Sydney apple maps offers businesses in street locations that have been built over by a 5yr old mall. Perfection is some time away… deanbar Monday, August 8, 2016 - 6:28 pm · Reply “Perfection is some time away” ….. Yes, like 10 years or more. Maps in UK is worse than useless. It can’t even get my home location right, despite several fault reports to Apple. Routes it selects for destinations are absolutely ridiculous, Maps is an absolute joke, Apple should be ashamed of such rubbish. I still try it out from time to time, but always end up exasperated. alanaudio Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 2:21 am · Reply As another Apple Maps user in the UK, I couldn’t disagree more. It has recently earned it’s place as my navigation system of choice. I also have several up to date stand-alone SatNav units by TomTom and Garmin, but Apple Maps works far better than any of them. I also used Waze for quite a while, but encountered too many drawbacks. The maps are displayed without any lag, and appear to be updated very rapidly. I recently drove along a minor road which has been re-routed within the last couple of weeks and Apple Maps displayed it as it is now, while a month ago it showed it as it was then. Where available in big cities, the 3D images of building are a huge advantage in identifying where you need to go. However the biggest single advantage is the clarity of the maps. Obviously the route itself is clearly highlighted, but there are some other crucial advantages. It usually provides written directions for the next turn and the one after that ( which is something that many SatNavs don’t reliably do ), which means that in congestion, you can be more certain of getting into the correct line in a timely manner. There are some more subtle things like the way that the names of side roads are displayed as dynamic tags with points to the road itself. They’re very clever implemented so that they are a secondary feature, never obscuring the main route, but always visible and using text that is larger than would have been possible if the name were written within the displayed width of the road, as is conventionally done on maps. I try to avoid using the database to identify destinations. If I am able to provide a postcode for the required destination, it works as well as any other postcode entry system, which means that it’s excellent in cities and towns, but not so good in the countryside, where a specific postcode can cover an area of a couple of miles, but that’s a limitation of the postcode system, rather than Apple Maps. A specific UK postcode covers around 40 houses, so a street in a city might have several postcodes over a short distance, while in the countryside, a single postcode can cover many square miles, including several different roads. It’s made worse by the fact that in countryside areas, houses are rarely numbered, but instead are given names. With numbered houses, if you’re looking for no 71 and you’re passing no 43, with the numbers getting bigger, you know that you’re going the right way. With house names, if you’re looking for “The Old Schoolhouse” and are passing “Damson Cottage” you’re none the wiser. Unfortunately there are no online resources that I know of in the UK to show the position of house names on a map. I’ve been critical of the database behind Apple Maps for many years and while it has improved, it still needs to be made more reliable. I can never understand why when I’m in the UK and ask for driving instructions to a named business, Apple Maps has a tendency to offer businesses with similar names in the US ahead of the ones that I can actually drive to on this island. With tricky to specify destinations, locating the destination by some other means ( satellite photo, latitude/longitude, map grid reference, or simply looking at an on-line map provided by the business ) and then placing a pin as the destination is much easier than doing equivalent processes on dedicated SatNavs. applecynic Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 3:54 am · Reply C’mon friend. I would love to believe you, but you drive on the wrong side of the road… 🙂 alanaudio Wednesday, August 10, 2016 - 3:24 am · Reply My dear chap. I always drive on the correct side of the road for the country that I’m driving in. I’m sufficiently versatile that it’s no problem to me which side of the road that happens to be, or whether it’s a stick shift or an automatic. Which reminds me of a taxi ride I had in rural Turkey on a baking hot day. Sometimes the driver drove on the left and sometimes on the right. I asked him which side of the road they drive on and he said “In this part of Turkey, we drive on the shady side of the road.” applecynic Wednesday, August 10, 2016 - 6:58 am · Reply Splendid response, thanks for recognizing the fraternal humor. Now if we can only do something about that cooking…. 😉 cozmot Wednesday, August 10, 2016 - 9:41 am · Reply One of the *best* exchanges ever. Thank you two! dswe Monday, August 8, 2016 - 10:21 pm · Reply I have been a faithful Apple Maps user since it launched. But I’m fed up. I feel it’s worse today than it was a while back. It gets me lost so much I just can barely use it. I jump to Google Maps when I have to. I may no longer use Apple Maps unless it’s just in a major city. CraigNotGreg Monday, August 8, 2016 - 6:21 pm · Reply 1) Calling the Maps issue a debacle is hyperbole. There were other mapping alternatives and it’s not like people’s phones stopped working. 2) As the article suggests, simply making the initial Maps release a downloadable beta and keeping Google Maps the default for one release cycle, would have avoided the entire “controversy” (and probably saved Scott Forstall’s job). Derek Currie Monday, August 8, 2016 - 7:07 pm · Reply Cue: “To all of us living in Cupertino, the maps for here were pretty darn good. Right?” Except it’s icon directed users to drive off a Cupertino bridge. “Apple now does public beta testing of its most significant software projects, something that Jobs never liked to do. I’m STILL not convinced Apple like to do public beta testing. From experience, providing detailed beta feedback results in being ignored, even across several full version increments of OS X, not to mention beta increments. I entirely gave up bothering to submit Yosemite feedback. Apple didn’t give a rat’s, and it showed in the end product. Reported bugs in El Capitan have still not been addressed. I don’t beta test for my edification. The idea is to help you Apple. If you don’t want help, then stop treating testers as suckers. Derek Currie Monday, August 8, 2016 - 7:08 pm · Reply Oh and, extremely little beta feedback being submitted about macOS 10.12 Sierra is relevant to Maps. IOW: Article supposition FAIL. BenG Monday, August 8, 2016 - 8:53 pm · Reply I have a question for the readers. My use of Maps is limited to duplicating the functions of a Garmin GPS. I only (mainly) use it for trips from my home town to Elsewhere. I put it on my dash right in front of my eyes. On the iPhone (6) I can’t read any of the information except the miles. Turns and road information can’t be read. Garmin Has big letters for multiple items, makeing it easy to use. The iPhone has an pale, low contrast “Jony Ives” screen which is hard to read. Gramin has a very nice high contrast, bright color screen which easy to see. The iPhone begins the trip with voice prompts which stop are several turns. Then nothing. Voice prompts would sure help the poor visability problems mentioned above. Garmin give voice prompts all the way through, including potty breaks, etc., where the unit is switched on and off. I don’t see any one commenting about the lousy Maps GPS preformance for trips. All I hear is about whether a donut shop is mentioned. Does not one care what a lousy trip GPS Maps is? alanaudio Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 2:37 am · Reply Is there a reason why you have not taken advantage of the built-in features within IOS to improve legibility? Setting > General > Accessibility > ( Larger Text / Bold Text ) Larger text will offer a slider allowing you to increase the size of text within Apple that support Dynamic Text. As it’s name suggests, Bold substitutes a bold version of the font for the thinner one. For people with less than perfect eyesight, it can offer a significant improvement. I only use reading glasses from time to time, but Dynamic Text makes quite a difference for me and for my visually impaired friend, it makes the difference between being able to use her iPhone and not being able to. Beng Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 10:03 am · Reply alanuadio, I think you missed my point. I have good eyesight. I only use reading glasses. If I were to increase the font size, then all my screens would change. I neither need nor want that. The problem with Maps is that the distance (miles) is say 36 point (?) and everything else is 6-8 pt (?). THAT is the problem. Making everything bigger will not solve the problem – it may make it worse if the Miles run everything else off the screen. My only conclusion is that Maps is meant to be hand held close to the reading position of the face, where the small type is legible. I tried Google maps, which is better, but the best is simply the old Garmin GPS. citizen Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 12:33 am · Reply 3 days ago I was using Waze and Maps simultaneously because Waze indicated all 3 routes from Santa Clara to Monterey had accidents, police, and major delays. Surprisingly, about 3 minutes after Maps initially suggested the usual route, it flashed a notice that a reroute would save 12 minutes. It then coincided perfectly with the preferred route Waze was recommending. I was surprised because while Waze almost always flashes the fastest route based on traffic flows, Apple Maps had never done it before. All it needs now is to show my speed and the speed limit and I’ll use it exclusively. alanaudio Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 2:50 am · Reply I agree with your observations. Apple Maps re-routing now seems pretty good. I’m not sure where Apple gets it’s congestion information from, but it seems to be very up to date and reliable, so I assume that it might be crowd-sourced data, automatically gathered from iPhones along that road. The lack of speed limit display ( and overspeed warnings ) is a significant omission from Apple Maps. That and the warning about speed cameras and driving over the limit are the only reason why I still use my SatNavs on unfamiliar roads, but I still prefer Apple Maps for the actual navigation. When driving my British car in continental Europe, I always use a SatNav instead of Apple Maps almost entirely because Apple Maps does not display speeds. The speedo on my car is in mph and has an indistinct scale for km/h. The best way to be sure of knowing my speed is to set my SatNav to display speed in km/h. That’s especially important in Germany where radar speed traps are camoflaged or are sometimes built into things that look like ordinary street furniture ( automatic alerts for nearby speed traps are illegal in Germany ).

According to a report from the New York Times, as many as half of Apple’s iPad sales are from businesses and government entities, and sales of the higher-end iPads are particularly strong in the business market. Related: Apple debuts international versions of the iPad Pro’s Smart Keyboard For example, according to the report, British Airways has built as many as 40 iPad apps for its workforce to use, and switching to tablets has totally eliminated the need for paper records and paper flight plans for the company. One app allows employees to use an iPad to rebook passengers quickly and easily when a flight has been canceled. Of course, the shift does make some sense. Apple has been making a much larger push into business over the last few years than it did when the iPad was first launched in 2010. For example, the company buddied up with IBM in 2014 to launch a number of business-targeted iOS apps. It even paired with Microsoft to show off Office for iOS when the iPad Pro was first launched. Not only that, but Apple’s products do have an edge over Android and Microsoft slates — Apple products are often seen as more secure — whether they actually are or not — and Microsoft still doesn’t have a real mobile-focused operating system. The news certainly does represent somewhat of a shift, especially for Apple. Microsoft has traditionally enjoyed much more success in the business sector, and while Apple obviously isn’t finding more success than Microsoft in business just yet, it is interesting that such a large chunk of Apple’s income comes from business.
SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Report: Apple boosted by corporate customers as consumer demand falters By Ethan Baron / August 8, 2016 at 12:34 PM Apple co-founder Steve Jobs sneered at corporate customers, but with iPhone sales dropping and the company’s revenue slipping, business clients have become a key base for the Cupertino firm. Jobs in 2008 demonstrated his contempt for the corporate buyer, referring in a meeting with Intel officials to the position of chief information officer. “Why would I do anything for that orifice called the CIO?” Jobs said, according to Computer Dealer News. Now, however, Apple is increasingly reliant on big-business customers, who occupy a crucial role now that the firm’s phone sales have been slowing down. Last year’s $25 billion in sales of equipment and services to companies and other large customers represented only about 11 percent of total revenue, but also reflected a 40 percent jump over the previous year, compared with 28 percent revenue growth overall for the company, according to The New York Times. “Sales of high-end iPads to business customers in particular have been strong,” the paper reported. “Nearly half of all iPads are now bought by corporations and governments. Companies are turning to Apple’s products for their tight-knit hardware and software, advanced security features and intuitive interfaces. “Aiding Apple’s corporate sales has been a concern that phones and tablets running Google’s Android software, which are generally cheaper and popular with consumers, have lagged in the security technology and the standardization that companies want.” The company’s iPhones and iPads “have become the preferred mobile computing devices for corporations, as industries from insurers to airlines aim to ditch bulky PCs and give their employees the ability to do their jobs from anywhere using smartphones or tablets,” the paper reported. And Apple CEO Tim Cook takes a different view of the corporate customer than Jobs. The firm started taking “enterprise” buyers more seriously when people began using their iPhones and iPads at work, Cook told a conference in September, according to Bloomberg. “When the world was bifurcated between consumer and enterprise, we focused on the consumer,” Cook said. “But now if you want a smartphone, you don’t say, ‘I want an enterprise smartphone.’ “Enterprise is a huge opportunity for us.” Photo illustration: An iPhone held up in front of the Apple logo.

Now, with BYOD, IT has to support Macs, iPads and iPhones. Apple wisely partnered with IBM who have been selling support and ‘solutions’ usually on a per user basis. The IT department simply passes IBM’s bill to each department (plus their internal mark-up). Users get the devices they want. IT takes no risk. Apple’s devices are more secure and manageable. Cisco and SAP joined the party more recently. Apple, IBM, Cisco, SAP, and end users all win. TrickyDickie “more secure and manageable” Lol! Matt Perkins iOS devices are proven more secure and easier to use than Android devices. You can be an Android fanboy all you want but the facts are facts. Security Researches all agree iPhones are more secure than Android devices. Hackers all agree iPhones are harder to hack into than Android devices and even Consumer Reports says iPhones offer the best out of box experience compared to Android. So not sure why you’re laughing unless it’s at your own ignorance. William Haynes IBM now sells and makes apps for the SURFACE tablets too. fstein No doubt. Windows and it’s variants must be supported too. AAPL.To.Break.$95.Soon.>:-) How long has it been since Steve Jobs passed away? Do people really think Apple is going to follow his way of doing business forever. Times change and the business has to change with it. When Steve was alive Android didn’t have 85% market share like it does now. All that’s left is poor countries with poorly-paid consumers only wanting to buy the cheapest piece of smartphone they can get their hands on. Apple had better find some other customers willing to pay for their products no matter where they come from. Apple should try as hard as possible to woo the enterprise and maybe the company will eventually lose that doomed reputation. Heck, no one is saying Microsoft or Tesla is doomed, so why should Apple be considered doomed. It would be nice if Apple could take over where BlackBerry used to be. Wall Street once worshipped RIM for having a lock on the enterprise. TrickyDickie “why should Apple be considered doomed?” Because even the fanboys are starting to wake up to their marketing tactics lol CelestialTerrestrial Tim did manage to get IBM and Cisco to promote Apple products in the Enterprise. IBM is now a reseller of Apple products. IBM is a Authorized Service Provider for Apple in the Enterprise. IBM is also a large and growing customer and case study as an Apple customer. Check out the JMAF conference presentation from last year, it’s a pretty good video to watch what IBM did last year and what benefits they are seeing. I think the old CIO mentality has been changing over the years and Apple’s benefitting. It sure doesn’t hurt that Tim is an ex-IBM and ex-Compaq manager with a degree in Industrial Design and an MBA. As brilliant as Jobs was, he really never understood the business world and that’s partly his own fault. He was too busy with the consumer and education space, he forgot who spends the most in IT. plus, IBM had the control and pushing PCs along with every PC clone mfg. So Microsoft benefitted by slapping their OS on anyone’s hardware. The problem is that it’s just flat out more costly to manage from an IT perspective and they forced their users to use Microsoft based OS, and then the employees bought PCs for the home because that’s all they knew. The iPhone really turned a lot of PC users over to Apple, and the Mac business has been increasing since. I think if everyone that has an iPhone were to use Macs, then Mac market share would reach 18% global market, which isn’t too shabby, they currently have only 7 to 8% global. The thing that people STILL can’t wrap their heads around is that if you add up the Net Profits of Microsoft, Google, Samsung, HP Inc., Dell, Lenovo, Acer and ASUS (All of Apple’s biggest competitors for desktops/laptops, smartphones and tablets), Apple makes as much as they do COMBINED. Apparently Apple’s business model works, and these others don’t. Apple only works on a 40% Gross Margin and retains a 20% Net Profit. For those idiots that think that Apple’s products are overpriced… I have one thing to say. NO, Apple’s products are not overpriced. It’s their competitors that are selling their products too cheaply, not managing their inventory/product offering well and they don’t have a strong efficient retail store model that works. If you look at Dell, HP, Lenovo, etc. they just make too damn many products and what happens is they overspend R&D, Support, and most importantly Inventory and they end up discounting them because they not only confuse the customer, but they can’t sell everything they make. It’s called TOO many SKU’s, TOO much inventory, TOO much discounting, and that’s TOO many TOO’s. Going after market share is the DUMBEST thing to do if you go after business that’s not profitable. A big number (customers) multiplied by zero (no profits) is still zero profits. That’s why IBM, Compaq and others got out of the PC industry and sold their businesses to someone dumber than they were. When people say that Android has the biggest market share. Well, yes and no. If you look at the smartphone business of products sold under the MSRP of $400, Apple has no market share, but if you look at the $400+ market, Apple has a pretty damn good market share. It’s just that the there are more people buying the sub-$400 smartphones and those don’t make any profit. They have those Freedom phones for $10, how can anyone make a phone for $10 and make an actual profit? I think the Chinese government has to subsidize a lot of these China based smartphone mfg. that lose money on selling smartphones, but for how long can they do that? I’m surprised there isn’t more fallout in the Android world in terms of Android mfg going out of business.     About SiliconBeat Sign up for the Good Morning Silicon Valley newsletter GMSV     Tweets from @siliconbeat/siliconbeat   Popular Posts Older Silicon Valley techies pushed out onto the ice floes… Apple admits to iPhone ‘touch disease,’ blames… Crucial Silicon Valley H-1B visa issue unclear under Trump Why did Oracle’s co-CEO Safra Catz visit Trump?

William Hauser-USA TODAY Sports First-round pick Eli Apple is a talented young cornerback with a lot to learn. No offense to defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo or cornerbacks coach Tim Walton, but perhaps the person Apple will learn the most from is New York Giants super star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. Apple lines up against Beckham every day in practice. He said Monday that Beckham “has been helping me out a lot.” “He’s taught me how to just read routes better. He’ll tell me things from a receiver perspective, like what receivers look for,” Apple said. “The top of the route stuff he’s really been on me about. He’s telling me just trust my talent.” What’s it like trying to cover Beckham? “Odell’s a great receiver,” Apple said. “He’ll always pull something out that’s never expected … little things with his hands like he’ll pull you through. He’s a little guy but he knows how to use his hands the right way and he’s really savvy about using your force against you.” For Apple, learning to play with his feet more and use his hands less has been a primary focus. “It’s little things, it’s bad habits you’ve gotta break. In college it’s different,” Apple said. “You’ve gotta learn how to mirror guys better and use your feet more, kinda just cut ‘em off. I’m learning every day.” With Janoris Jenkins and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie on the outside and Leon Hall and Trevin Wade in the slot, there doesn’t appear to be an obvious path to a lot of playing time for Apple. “I just want to do my best and find a way to get on that field and contribute,” he said. “Right now I’m just trying to focus on mastering my outside corner technique and I’m trying to get in my playbook and pick up everything fast. However I can contribute, I’m trying to do whatever I can to get on the field.” Trending Five things I think I think about the 7-3 New York Giants What others are saying: The New York Giants have analysts confused Snap counts, PFF grades from Giants’ 22-16 victory over Chicago Bears Find Tickets Sun Dec 11 Dallas Cowboys @ New York Giants 8:30 PM - MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford, NJ 3,577 tickets available Sun Dec 18 Detroit Lions @ New York Giants 1:00 PM - MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford, NJ 4,714 tickets available See Full Schedule From our sponsor Stubhub Logo This Article has a component height of 9.

Okay fine, "never" is a difficult call to make. Suffice it to say that we're not going to see Apple release an iPhone with expandable memory anytime soon. The company makes way too much money getting people to shell out extra cash for higher capacity devices, and expandable storage like microSD card support would strand that gravy train at the station. Of course, there is a way to add microSD card support to any iPhone or iPad, and it takes about 1 second to do. Best of all, the Lexar microSD To Lightning Reader you need to make it happen is on sale right now on Amazon for $10 off. We first told you about this awesome little adapter way back in May of this year after it was first released. In a nutshell, it's a simple microSD card reader with a Lightning connector that you can attach to any iPhone or iPad. Then you install a free companion app from Lexar and you can save your photos, videos and more on any microSD card you want. Here are some more key details: Easily offload and transfer content to or from your iPhone or iPad with a micro SD card Great for anyone capturing photos or video with a sports camcorder or aerial camera Small, portable design with a Lightning connector Works with use of free file management app (App Store) Automatically and securely sync files The Lexar microSD To Lightning Reader normally costs $29.95, but Amazon is selling it for $19.99 from now through the end of the day on August 20. Trust us, this is a deal you won't want to miss.

PHOTO | COURTESY  By EDWARD MUNGAI Posted  Monday, August 8   2016 at  22:05 In Summary Some of these companies have also signed power purchase agreements with Kenya Power and are therefore generating increased revenues for their businesses. For business managers and shareholders, the adoption of renewables in the business model will deliver real advantages and increase the shared value of the business. Whichever way one looks at it, the energy business has attracted a lot of corporate players, some that we would never have thought of just a few years earlier. SHARE THIS STORY Tweet Apple, the tech giant known for iPhones, has, for instance, recently announced that it had established a subsidiary, Apple Energy, to generate solar power for own use as well as sell surplus to two US cities. Other tech giants like Facebook and Microsoft are on the same track with investments in early-stage clean technology companies to accelerate their transition from lab-scale to commercial viability. The big question is why this is becoming fashionable in the 21st century where non-energy businesses are now focusing on renewables. It is clear that there is a huge business opportunity in renewables especially solar and wind as source of captive power for institutions and hence the need to invest in the same. The phenomenon also makes business sense due to reduced power costs, generation of additional revenue from the sale of the excess power and walking the talk on fighting climate change. In Kenya, manufacturers are best placed to take advantage of the opportunity due to certain characteristics that make it competitive for them to generate power. These characteristics include; high power usage, roof tops suitable for installation of solar panels, power is usually a major cost component, abundance of sun, wind or waste which can be converted to power. In addition, increasing competition from cheaper products from China and Egypt should jolt local manufacturers to this new renewables reality. READ: Kenyan solar start-up bags GES prize for innovation READ: Kenyan solar start-up shines at global competition There are already some fast movers in this area and they have started reaping the benefits. For instance, Williamson Tea, Strathmore University and Garden City Mall are already showing that investing in renewables is rewarding and trendy. The three have installed renewable energy equipment on their properties to generate power on site, the dominant source being solar power. The solar panels’ smaller footprint — they sit atop unused space on roofs instead of requiring a dedicated piece of land like most wind turbines — makes solar appealing for onsite generation and use, hence the adoption by the three Kenyan companies. Power purchase agreements Some of these companies have also signed power purchase agreements with Kenya Power and are therefore generating increased revenues for their businesses. Companies should consider their power generation capabilities in the long term. The economies are in the positive especially considering that the prices of wind and the solar technologies are coming down. On the other hand, pressure is growing as companies within the supply chain and consumers become sensitive to how power is produced, and are demanding that companies move away from fossil fuels as part of engaging in corporate sustainability. Eric Schmidt of Google recently stated that “much of corporate America is buying renewable energy in some form or another, not just to be sustainable, because it makes business sense, helping companies diversify their power supply, hedge against fuel risks, and support innovation in an increasingly cost-competitive way.” 1 | 2 Next Page » Latest from Daily Nation: Business State bets on new pest-proof storage bags to reduce maize wastage Fraudsters give Kenyans importing vehicles from Japan sleepless nights Airtel loses 16-year battle against KRA’s Sh531m claim KenGen earns Sh27.6m from managing power firm Aggreko Cabinet okays household goods for bank loans NSE top gainers & losers n-soko About us Contact us Digital Editions Syndication Help Privacy Policy Terms RSS
Share with your friends Your Name Your Email Recipient Email Enter a Message I read this article and found it very interesting, thought it might be something for you. The article is called Android News: What’s new in Android 7.0 Nougat? and is located at http://www.starkinsider.com/2016/08/android-news-whats-new-android-7-0-nougat.html. Captcha Submit CLOSE Culture Tech/SV Wanderlust Interviews Video Features Culture Tech/SV Wanderlust Interviews Video Features Tech & Silicon Valley Android News: What’s new in Android 7.0 Nougat? By Clinton Stark - 08.08.2016 Android 7.0 is just around the corner. What should we expect from Google’s next major release, code-named Nougat, when it drops in the next few weeks? For one, don’t expect earth-shattering updates. Android, like iOS, is a mature mobile operating system and platform with broad support, including massive development community. It’s definitely not 2009. Back then — Droid Does! — mobile and the smartphone tantalized us. Indeed, a brand new world. We were happily decommissioning our BlackBerrys and jumping into the new, exciting world of Android. But now, the word of the day is: refinement. Google and Apple have both found their respective mobile metaphors. So it’s really about making what works, work just that much better. Baby steps, year on year. Google likes widgets (making the homescreen infinitely useful, informative), openness (so even most system programs and features are “apps”), and a do-it-all notification bar. It works, even if its more complex and demands a bit more effort from new users. Apple, on the other hand, likes an integrated experience (phone, tablet, and laptop), simplicity of design (meaning less customization… though restrictions, like the ability to install custom third party keyboards, have been easing in recent years), and ease of use. You just pick up an iPhone and it works. Not the most hacker friendly thing in the world, but then again this is the company that famously locked its original Mac (and iMac too!) computer from our tweaking hands. Respective slogans for these two differing philosophies might read something like this… Google: It’s your house. Go ahead and add wallpaper if you want. Apple: It’s our house. There’s V8 in the fridge. If you don’t like V8… well, there’s more V8 in the fridge. Hands-On with Android 7.0 “Nougat” I’ll leave it to others to assess the name. “Nougat”? I’ll just say that perhaps we’ve had our fill of dessert-themed codenames. I do like, however, how Google has implemented its beta channel. Want to test an upcoming release of Android? No more flashing, and multi-step procedures. Now, you simply sign-up with Google for the beta program, select which of your registered devices you want to test with the beta Android release, and soon thereafter (almost instantly in my experience) a system update notification appears. From there you install it like any other release. Great stuff. Even better: when the final shipping version of Nougat arrives, it will appear just like any other update. And it just keeps getting better: using this process does not wipe your data. You can test away, and not have to reset and reload your phone and apps each time. I installed Nougat on my Nexus 6 (still a great phone, battery life be damned). In no time I had 7.0 running. Not much of note at first. The app drawer is still there The notification bar is there. The homescreen, of course, is there. Pull down the notification bar and you begin to notice the first wave of refinements. Things look more… well, more… Material-esque. Notifications, for instance, extend edge to edge, and feature black text on a white background. A narrow row of 5 icons sit at top allowing for quick settings adjustments to things like wi-fi and do-not-disturb. Overall, my Nexus 6 seemed to run smoother — there was less lag. Below, some of the more interesting things I discovered after a few weeks of driving Android 7.0 Nougat (aka Android N) on a Nexus 6. What’s new Android 7.0 Nougat 1. Re-organized and simplified Settings short-cuts Pull down once on the notification bar, and you’ll see this:   Quick toggles for: wi-fi, cellular data, battery, DND and flash light. Notifications below, as you’d expect. Touch that small arrow, and the entire settings shade is revealed which includes the usual assortment of things you might want to adjust in a pinch. Touch “EDIT” and you can sort those icons to your liking, and add/drag new ones. Works very well. Big thumbs up for this new, refined (see!) look. 2. Total silence option Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. If you’re like me, trying to get a Nexus device to stop vibrating for notifications is akin to building your own industrial strength, portable linear accelerator in your spare time. Your far more likely to achieve success. With Android N, we now have three options: Total silence, Alarms only, Priority only. Once again, you can activate these moments until you turn them off, or, if you’re in a meeting for instance, you can put your phone into silent mode for an hour. 3. Multi-Window Mode It’s finally here. Are our phones soon to become more PC like? It would seem the case. It’s inevitable really. So, with Nougat, Google has added multi-window mode. In short, it’s terrific and works as you might expect. You can run apps side by side. On a phablet like the Nexus 6 it’s actually surprisingly usable. Let’s say I have Chrome open to a web page. Now I want to check Twitter for something. I simply long-press the recent apps button and the screen automatically splits in two. Then I select the app I’d like to open on the right side (Felix). Done. The process if fast, and, in my testing over the last few weeks, reliable too. Multi-Window mode should breathe new life into productivity devices such as the Pixel C. And, I suspect, it paves the way for Android to subsume ChromeOS completely some time in 2017. 4. Direct Reply Notifications If you get a notification you have the option to respond directly via the notification bar. This saves the step of opening the app itself. This could be handy if you want to fire off a quick “Got it” or “Yes” or “Rodger Dodger” using Hangouts. In practice, though, I found myself still opening the app itself and working from there. After all, does it really save that much time? Still a nice option I’m sure for some of you. 5. Quick Switch Again, it’s the little things. With Nougat you can double tap the recent button to switch back to the previous app. Handy. 6. Doze Mode 2.0 Call me a skeptic, but I’m not convinced Google yet has battery optimization on Android under control. Not even close. Nexus 6 battery is dreadful. Doze Mode 2.0 promises to limit apps and background activity when the screen is off. That way, when you pick up your phone hours (or even days they say) later, it will have plenty of life left. So far I’m not seeing that with my Nexus 6. Apple still has some kind of magic sauce that enables it to extend battery far and away beyond its competitors. I’m holding at hope that the final release of Nougat does improve battery life in standby situations. 7. All the Small Things Other small refinements or points of note in Android 7.0 Nougat that I spotted include: Status updates beneath each setting sub-section: Vulkan API support (replaces OpenGL). Meaning improved performance for gaming, VR and graphics in general Daydream VR will come built-in Seamless updates: Nougat enables two system images to run in parallel. This means you can use an app while it’s receiving an update from the Google Play Store. Nice! Long-pressing homescreen performs the same as Marshmallow and pulls up screen with 3 familiar options: Wallpapers, Widgets, Settings Should you buy a new phone to get the upgrade? If you’re happily running Android 6.0 Marshmallow (or even an earlier version of Android) and assuming it’s not receiving the Nougat update, there’s nothing here that would mandate you run out and buy a new phone. Yes, everything is slightly improved, most notably the UI and notification bar. And unless you have a keen interest in Google’s Daydream VR or the ability to open two windows side-by-side, there’s likely no other compelling features you’d miss with Nougat. Those with Nexus devices, will, obviously, want to upgrade as soon as possible. I’ve found the developer preview 5 to run with very few issues. This looks to be a solid, and, yes, refined release by Google. When will Android 7.0 Nougat Ship? Q3. That means we could see anytime through to the end of September, 2016. Explore. Create. Live.

Of course not. As John Gruber says, "Any conversation that uses that word is in silly la-la land." With Macs, iPads, and software applications and services, Apple isn’t a one-trick pony like BlackBerry, to use an example cited by those most freaked out about the recent iPhone slowdown. It recorded $50.6 billion in sales during that "disappointing" quarter, more than the combined revenue of Google parent Alphabet ($20.3 billion) and Amazon ($29.1 billion) over the same period. Its $10.5 billion in profits outpaced not just the combination of Alphabet ($4.2 billion) and Amazon ($513 million) but also Facebook ($1.5 billion) and Microsoft ($3.8 billion). "I don't read all the coverage on Apple that there is," Cook tells me a few days after my lunch with Cue and Federighi. "The way that I look at that is, I really know the truth." And he's ready to talk about it.

 Apple CEO Tim Cook: 'Companies should have values, like people do' Kif Leswing Aug. 8, 2016, 8:28 PM 16,271 facebook linkedin twitter email print AP Tim Cook has lost his temper in public exactly once during his tenure as Apple CEO. During the company's annual shareholders meeting in 2014, a representative for a conservative think tank wanted Cook to commit to making moves that were profitable only for the company. Cook's rebuke was swift. "When we work on making our devices accessible by the blind, I don't consider the bloody" return on investment, Cook said. "If you want me to do things only for ROI reasons, you should get out of this stock," he continued. That moment of anger has been the best summation of Cook's long-term viewpoint so far. But on Monday he doubled down in an interview with Fast Company. "My belief is that companies should have values, like people do," Cook said. A big change The Tim Cook era at Apple officially turns five this month, and one of the biggest changes is that the company has made several moves that might not make sense from an investor standpoint but do make for smart public policy. Some of Apple's moves might not change the company's top or bottom lines, but they make sense through a long-term view. Some examples: Apple has built massive fields of solar panels, and it even formed an energy company to sell clean power to its suppliers. Apple's 2015 environmental report said: "We don't want to debate climate change. We want to stop it." Ninety-three percent of the energy the company uses is renewable. Apple hired Lisa Jackson, a former leader of the US Environmental Protection Agency, to head up environment and policy issues at Apple. Cook publicly announced he was gay and has written op-ed articles about discrimination. Apple publicly fought the FBI over whether it should help crack into an iPhone and framed the issue as a moral one. "We feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the U.S. government," Cook wrote. Apple held a moment of silence at its annual conference for victims of the shooting at the gay nightclub Pulse. More recently, Apple fought against the addition of a rifle emoji to the iPhone keyboard and changed the gun emoji to a squirt-gun icon. Part of these moral stands come from the fact that Apple can plan for the long term, not just the next quarter. Earlier this year, Cook said he wanted Apple to be around for 1,000 years, and he repeated that. "I want Apple to be here, you know, forever," Cook told Fast Company. Apple solar panels in China.Apple That long-term view allows Apple to invest billions in self-driving cars, healthcare products, and other new technologies that might never see the light of day. Apple is not the only public company, nor Cook the only CEO, starting to realize that long-term growth and policies that enrich all stakeholders might be a better strategy than maximizing short-term profits. Business Insider has published a series of articles looking at how a focus on short-term profits can hamstring big companies. But Apple's stock price is still important. Many of Apple's engineers get a substantial portion of their compensation in stock options, and the stock is still down 11% from its peak in the past year, even after a strong rally during the past month. Activist shareholders, like Carl Icahn, have dumped Apple. Others want Apple to focus on the products and not necessarily the company's impact on culture. For those investors obsessed with short-term returns, and who want Apple to stop taking political positions, Cook has a message: Get out of the stock.

The Southeast Tourism Society has named the North Carolina Apple Festival one of the STS Top 20 Event in the Southeast for 2016.  The Southeast Tourism Society Top 20 Festival and Event Awards have highlighted programs around the Southeast since 1985. Festival-goers can choose from a variety of events which feature a street fair on Historic Main Street and surrounding event venues with continuous free entertainment, arts & crafts, local apple growers selling apple products, children’s & youth activities, special shows, exhibits, open houses, fun, festival food, and, to top it all off, the King Apple Parade.

They have a widely documented history of not seeing eye to eye, especially when it comes to patent infringements – made worse because they're the two dominating forces in the smartphone space. So whenever Samsung throws shade Apple’s way, things never turn out well. The latest case of Samsung pushing things just a little too far is a recent patent for a “Wearable Device” that draws heavily upon the Apple Watch ’s design influences. Apple Watch 2 is expected to launch in September (Photo: Apple) This new wearable, which is clearly a Samsung Gear successor, describes an “exchangeable” strap mechanism and lists various ways a strap could be connected to a watch body. While that’s not overly incriminating, as Patently Apple points out, Samsung notes a set of connection mechanisms and strap designs that sound entirely lifted from an Apple Watch. Not only can you clearly see the iconic heart-rate monitor and charging plate of the Watch, but Samsung makes no reference to Apple’s product in its patent. Image from Samsung's patent application Read More Apple Watch 2: Release date, price, specs and all the latest rumours The patent makes reference to a band that sounds startlingly similar to that Apple’s designs. It states: "The band for adjustment may be coupled with the band for fixing through a structure, such as a separated buckle or a continuous integral buckle, through a magnetic attracting force, or through a hooked ring or hooked member." In the interests of fairness, it should be said that Samsung does also reference its own Gear products and other smartwatches , so it isn’t just copying from Apple. Samsung Gear S2 smartwatch However, given the history of the two companies – most notably the long and drawn-out patent-infringement case from the Samsung Galaxy S2 – it’s odd the South Korean company would even dare venture near Apple’s school of design again. If you want to make your own mind up on what Samsung is up to, you can read the entire patent over on the US Patent Application website .

(NASDAQ: AAPL) rumor. According to 9 To 5 Mac, the release of the Apple Watch 2 is "imminent" and will feature "several flagship changes." 9 To 5 Mac, citing KG Securities' "reliable" Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported that the new Apple Watch will come equipped with a GPS, barometer, improved waterproofing protection and a new internal SoC to boost performance. The new watch could be announced alongside the iPhone 7 in September and launch in late 2016. Related Link: Did Apple Just Add To Its Stable Of AI Startups With Turi Acquisition? The publication isn't expecting any physical design changes to the Watch and the upgrade is the equivalent of an iPhone "S upgrade." As such, customers who were expecting a thinner body or an overall different look may be disappointed for the time being. However, it is possible that major changes to the appearance "appear to be on the cards" for the Apple Watch 3. The report also said that the analyst is expecting Apple to sell a "spec-bumped" version of its current Watch with a new SoC to improve CPU and GPU performance. Kuo also suggested that Apple could sell the Apple Watch 1 below the $200 mark, and the Watch 2 could also see a price cut. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « The iPhone 7's Pressure Sensitive Home Button Supported in new Bloomberg Rumor | Main | Apple Accused by Russia's Federal Anti-Monopoly Service of Retail Price Fixing iPhones » August 08, 2016 In New Interview Tim Cook Talks Up Services & iPhone but Stays Silent on what's Ahead   For Apple fans, there's an interesting yet long winded article out today by Fast Company. If you're new to Apple, the article will definitely fill in some of the blanks about selective parts of the company's history very nicely.   In June we posted a report titled "Forbes Misguided View is that Apple has Missed the AI Revolution," wherein the argument was made that Apple's competitors have yet to prove their leadership in AI in any meaningful way and yet the press has written Apple's work off with Siri as if they're losers.   On Sunday we posted a report titled "Chinese Smartphone Players make Apple Look like a Trend Follower instead of a Leader." On Friday we posted a report titled "Cocky Samsung believes that they're the Leader of 'Meaningful Innovation.'" It's a trend in the press with power competitors behind this push to paint Apple as a laggard and no longer an innovator in an attempt to take down the number one smarphone maker in the world at the top premium tier where the profits are made.   Bloomberg's 2015 report had Apple making 90% of the profits, to be exact. Of course Apple's competitors are scratching their eyes out, speaking in tongues and renting their clothing like biblical times. We should expect nothing less. Would we like to see Apple deliver another gigantic product hit like the iPhone or iPad to knock these critics out once and for all. Yes we would, but that's not likely in the cards anytime soon.   The Fast Company report points out a few key points made by Apple's CEO Tim Cook. One is that "subscription services such as Apple Music and iCloud storage are starting to deliver significant cash. Revenue from services now accounts for 12% of Apple's total sales, up from 9% the year before. In fact, Apple's services revenue exceeds Facebook's total revenue." How's that for perspective. Where's Facebooks great Oculus Rift and AI profits? Nowhere of course. So why is the press falling over themselves about Facebook?   Fast Company further noted that Tim Cook said that "the company has just gotten started. 'Oh, yeah. I expect it to be huge,' he says, smiling, his Alabama drawl becoming more pronounced as he delivers the good news.   The iPhone will continue to morph, in ways designed to ensure its place as the primary way we interact with and manage our technological experience for the foreseeable future. Apple will sell more devices, but its evolution will also enable it to explore new revenue opportunities. This is how Apple adapts. It expands its portfolio by building on the foundation laid by earlier products. That steady growth has made it broader and more powerful than any other consumer technology company."   So Where's the Next Killer Product like the iPhone?   Secondly, Fast Company's Rick Tetzeli noted that "It's entirely possible that Apple will never introduce a product as universally desired as the iPhone. That doesn't mean it won't continue to be a great company. 'The iPhone entered a market that was the biggest on earth for electronic devices,' Cooks tells me, as we're wrapping up our interview. 'Why is that? It's because eventually, everyone in the world will have one. There are not too many things like that.'   Then Cook makes another one of his points that can get lost if you don't understand the care he takes with every word. 'It's hard to imagine a market defined in units—not revenues—that's that big.'   In terms of unit sales, yes, there may never be another iPhone. But in terms of revenue, well, look at the industries that Apple is just now entering, or is rumored to be pursuing. Media and entertainment is a $550 billion global market. Global car ownership is a $3.5 trillion business. Annual global health spending is more than $9 trillion.   And while Apple may not currently dominate any of these arenas, remember that analysts once thought Apple would have a hit on its hands if it could garner 1% of the mobile phone business."   That last line reminded me of Steve Ballmer who once laughed at the iPhone as it debuted but laughs no more. Those who underestimated Apple and the iPhone revolution paid a very heavy price; just ask Microsoft, Nokia and Blackberry.     For more, read the full Fast Company report titled "Playing The Long Game Inside Tim Cook's Apple," here.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.     Posted by Jack Purcher on August 08, 2016 at 11:24 AM in 5.

 Apple is laying the groundwork to kill the iPhone's home button Steve Kovach Aug. 8, 2016, 2:29 PM 8,563 facebook linkedin twitter email print The iPhone fingerprint scanner could be just the start. REUTERS/Stephen Lam The iPhone's home button isn't long for this world. This year, Apple will introduce a new kind of home button on the next iPhone, and it won't be a physical switch. Instead, it will be pressure sensitive without moving parts, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports. (Think of it as a mix between the regular home button and 3D Touch feature on the iPhone 6s screen.) But the pressure-sensitive home button is just the first step Apple will take to eliminate the home button all together in future devices. There are already early reports about what's in store for 2017's iPhone, and it sounds like Apple will use the device's tenth birthday to rebuild everything from the ground up. That includes eliminating the home button and embedding the Touch ID fingerprint sensor into the display, according to an earlier Wall Street Journal report. By replacing the traditional home button with a sort of non-button in the iPhone 7, Apple will start weaning us off our habit of clicking it to get back to the home screen. Instead, it'll all be about training ourselves to use pressure-sensitive gestures, the same way we learned to pinch and zoom on a touch screen nine years ago. But here's the rub: So much of the iPhone's controls depend on clicking the home button. If it's gone, what will replace it? My guess is that 3D Touch will become even more important as a navigation tool, letting users do a firm press to zoom back to the home screen from their open apps. Is that better than the old-fashioned home button? Not necessarily, but it would allow Apple to dramatically change the iPhone's design, which is starting to feel stale compared to the competition.

Hulu goes subscription… No more free Hulu for you! Hulu goes subscription only, but Yahoo offers a work-around By Caleb Denison — August 8, 2016 11:12 AM Please enable Javascript to watch this video Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends It’s Monday, August 8th (happy birthday to my Dad!) and with the iPhone 7 announcement just over one month away, the rumor mill around the anticipated smartphone is heating up once again. A report from Bloomberg claims folks familiar with the matter say the new iPhone 7 and 7S or perhaps 7Pro may not have a physical home button. There will still be a home key, of course, but you won’t click it like you do now. Instead, it would simply be a circular section of the phones glass screen you’d press down on, and haptic feedback would give your finger or thumb a little click or thump. Now, this may not seem like a revolutionary move at first, but that home button is one of the more commonly broken pieces of an iphone, and the repair costs for that thing aren’t cheap. In some cases over $200 at third-party repair shops. Plus, replacement home buttons at thos shops don’t work as a fingerprint scanner. So, if Apple really does go this direction, its one less thing to break on their phones, and that’s going to create many more happy iPhone owners. Of course this is just the latest rumor, and there are bound to be more. You can find out everything we believe we know about the iPhone 7 right here. Is an Apple Watch 2 coming? And hey, as long as we’re on the Apple rumor chain, MacRumors reports that the Apple Watch 2 may be right around the corner, and it doesn’t look like it’s going to replace the existing Apple Watch, but instead add to it, creating an Apple Watch Line, of sorts. According to a securities analyst who correctly predicted the iPhone SE, the current Apple watch will get better waterproofing and a zippier processor. The Apple Watch 2, however, will add built-in GPS and a barometer for accurate location tracking, and it is possible Apple will add in LTE connectivity, meaning you’d be able to do all sorts of things with the watch without needing your cellphone or access to Wi-Fi. With the addition of a second Apple Watch, the refreshed original should drop in price, which has some speculating that the Apple Watch 2 could reinvigorate the smart watch segment. That remains to be seen, but we shouldn’t have to wait too long. We expect to hear about the new watch alongside the iPhone 7 news on September 12, and we could actually see some on store shelves by the end of this year. No more free Hulu Finally, if you’ve been relying on the free, ad-supported version of Hulu’s streaming TV service to get your network TV fix, you might be disappointed to hear that Hulu is going subscription only and killing off that free tier. Don’t fret, though: In a rather odd deal, Yahoo just announce ‘Yahoo View’ a streaming TV service that features … Hulu, and is free thanks to ad-based support. So, technically, there’s still a free version of Hulu out there, you just have to go to Yahoo to get it. And, for now, Yahoo View is desktop only – no word yet on when the app might be available for smart TVs, Roku, Apple TV, and the like. For more on this story, check out our full write-up here.

(AAPL) Drops Routers Google Shop Launches: Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Partners With Best Buy Co Inc (BBY) View All Posts If Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) follows its usual release pattern — and there’s no reason to believe it won’t — we should be seeing the iPhone 7 in September. Source: Sunnyc There have been a lot of iPhone 7 rumors floating around over the past few months, but as the expected launch date approaches and leaks of cases, components and even complete units have begun to show up with increasing frequency, we have a pretty good idea of what Apple has in store. Here’s a roundup of what we currently think Apple will unveil when it shows off its latest iPhone in just over a month. Form Factor It looks as though Apple will be sticking with the same two-model release strategy it initiated with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. There had been talk of a third iPhone 7 Plus “Pro” model as well, but most bets are on a 4.6-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus. 7 No-Name Tech Stocks That Will Make You Rich With iPhone sales slowing and Apple moving to a three-year model refresh cycle, this year’s smartphones are expected to look very much like the previous two generations. Leaked photos have shown the antenna band moving to the top and bottom of the case, the new versions may be slightly thinner and images have circulated of a darker, near-black color option, but the iPhone 7 should look very much like the iPhone 6 and 6s. iPhone 7 Camera One of the big selling points for 2016 is expected to be the camera, especially the one Apple appears to be sticking in the iPhone 7 Plus. Buyers who shell out for the more expensive smartphone are expected to get a dual-lens camera system for advanced photography. This could include the ability to take much wider angle photos, or one of the lenses may allow for a two to three times optical zoom. The dual-lens system can be seen appearing in many iPhone 7 Plus cases, including the ones shown in the photo that are already being offered for pre-order by China’s Sunnyc. The iPhone 7 itself seems to be getting an upgrade as well, with spy shots showing a much larger camera lens. Goodbye Headphone Jack While the iPhone 7 camera is expected to generate upgrade interest, one factor that could cool consumer demand is the headphone jack, or lack thereof. Rumors suggest that Apple is killing the headphone jack with the iPhone 7, instead relying on its Lightning port for audio output. That means either including new Lightning ear buds with the phone, or a Lighting to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter in the box. Lightning ear buds are a more elegant solution, but eliminating the headphone jack means millions of headphones sold over many decades are suddenly incompatible with the iPhone 7 — without an adapter. Including one in the box might quell some complaints, but there’s no doubt many people will be upset with this move. Waterproof and Improved Battery Life Why would Apple risk infuriating millions of music lovers by ditching the long-time industry standard headphone jack? It appears to have fallen victim to several other features, primarily waterproofing. Apple seems intent on eliminating every possible water entry point (including the home button which may become a “force touch” virtual version instead of a physical button) and that 3.5 mm headphone jack is a big entry point. While rival Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) has offered waterproof smartphones for years, the iPhone 7 would be an Apple first — and another big reason for current iPhone owners to upgrade.

Read More  and two-factor authentication What Is Two-Factor Authentication, And Why You Should Use It What Is Two-Factor Authentication, And Why You Should Use It Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security method that requires two different ways of proving your identity. It is commonly used in everyday life. For example paying with a credit card not only requires the card,... Read More , and even those who don’t are easily won over once they grasp the idea. A password manager can help simplify and secure your digital life Password Management Guide Password Management Guide Don't feel overwhelmed by passwords, or simply use the same one on every site just so you'll remember them: design your own password management strategy. Read More by storing your login credentials, and generating secure unique passwords which don’t lead to a “house of cards” effect if one service gets compromised. But many password managers are premium products, requiring an ongoing subscription to be genuinely useful. If you have both a Mac and iPhone, you could save yourself some money and simply use Apple’s own password manager completely free of charge. So let’s take a look at how you can do that, and more importantly whether switching to iCloud Keychain is the right decision for you. What is iCloud Keychain? iCloud Keychain is a part of the Safari browser, and though you don’t technically need to just use Safari to make use of it, it’s a lot more convenient if you do. It allows you to store website login credentials (usernames and passwords) as well as payment methods (debit and credit cards), which sync between your devices using the company’s iCloud platform. While the idea of storing all your passwords online may ring a few alarm bells, in terms of security iCloud Keychain is just as secure as any other password management solution. Apple has stated that Keychain uses 256-bit AES encryption How Does Encryption Work, and Is It Really Safe? How Does Encryption Work, and Is It Really Safe? Read More which encrypts data while in transit and when stored on the server. Ads by Google Devices also need to be added to your iCloud Keychain manually using two-factor authentication methodology — and like many other password managers, physical access to your devices probably poses the biggest risk. iCloud Keychain can be used to store login credentials (a web address, username, and password) and payment information (card number, expiry date, and cardholder’s name). You could also store other information as faux user logins, but that’s not really its intended purpose. The feature is limited to Apple devices and is fully integrated with the Safari browser. There’s no way of accessing information stored via iCloud Keychain in Windows, Android, or through another web browser. It’s also completely free, while most competing products are not. Keychain is arguably a more restrictive option when compared to the rest of the field, both in terms of what you can store and how you can access it. The Drawbacks Before you go ahead and set up iCloud Keychain, it’s worth looking at a few main drawbacks in Apple’s implementation. The biggest (aside from being Apple-only) is probably the reliance on the Safari browser, which not only restricts the feature’s usefulness in other web browsers but other iOS and Mac apps too. There’s no iCloud Keychain dedicated app, and the feature only provides native integration with Safari. If you want to look up a password for use with another iOS app, or another browser on a Mac; you have to launch Safari’s settings on the respective platform to do so. This is restrictive and annoying, and there’s no way to save a new app login on iOS or another Mac browser without manually adding it via the Safari preferences. As the feature is pretty barebones, there’s no way of categorizing your passwords to keep things tidy and easy to sort through. The feature is also limited to web logins, so if you have other credentials like FTP logins, router admin passwords, or you simply like to keep banking and financial stuff separated from social media and gaming, you can’t. There is a handy search field in both the Mac and iOS password list however. Apple should make this obscure submenu an app, it is basically free 1Password backed by iCloud Keychain. #iOS10 pic.twitter.com/HpTlNhGV1P — PF (@Razzo) June 17, 2016 Logging into apps, particularly on iOS, isn’t really any easier given that you have to access the password list via a settings panel. While many password managers make this as easy as possible by installing a third-party keyboard to access your credentials, Apple’s solution doesn’t offer this feature. While you can generate passwords with iCloud Keychain, this is only possible via Safari’s “Suggest Password” option that appears when you sign up for a new account. You can’t generate passwords when manually adding login credentials to the password list. The passwords — while secure — aren’t as complex or long as those that free solutions like KeePass X can come up with. There’s no way to tweak a password to include random symbols or be a minimum of 25 characters, so you might want to use a web-based password generator 5 Free Password Generators For Nearly Unhackable Passwords 5 Free Password Generators For Nearly Unhackable Passwords Read More to create your passwords manually. This also means that if you’re signing up for an account via an app, you can’t generate a password (or indeed save your new credentials) to iCloud Keychain without manually adding them. Setting Up iCloud Keychain Drawbacks aside, Keychain is a useful feature that Apple makes available free of charge. It might be worth enabling the feature and using it for a while before writing it off completely, and setup is relatively straight-forward. When you first set up iCloud Keychain, you’ll need to create an iCloud Security Code (currently six digits) which provides one way of granting keychain access to new devices. There’s also a method of doing so using two-factor authentication, which uses either SMS or device authentication. This means that even if someone gets hold of your Apple ID password, they’ll need your security code or access to another device of yours to gain access to your passwords. Setup works best from an iPhone, as you can opt to use your phone’s passcode which makes it easy to remember: Launch Settings > iCloud > Keychain, toggle the feature On and enter your Apple ID password. Follow on-screen instructions to create a security code, or opt to use your phone’s existing passcode. Enter a phone number where you can receive SMS messages when prompted. You can now add new devices using the security code or via manual authentication using an existing device (and as a backup, the SMS number you supplied): To add a Mac, iPad or another device: Head to Settings > iCloud > Keychain (iOS) or System Preferences > iCloud > Keychain (Mac), toggle the feature On and enter your Apple ID password. Choose either Restore with Security Code and input the code you created earlier, or Request Approval to approve from another device (you’ll need to enter your Apple ID password). Once approved your new device will be added and you will be able to save to your iCloud Keychain. I found Restore with Security Code to be the quicker of the two as every time I had approved my Mac using my iPhone, the approval was never instantaneous. Accessing & Adding Passwords Once the feature is enabled, all logins you’ve already saved locally to your Mac or iOS device will be transferred to your iCloud Keychain and shared between devices. In future when you’re browsing the web (in Safari) and a corresponding password is found, it will be automatically suggested. On iOS, a Passwords field will appear on the keyboard, tap it to auto-complete. On a Mac, credentials will present themselves as a drop-down option you can click on. To view your stored credentials (for logging into apps), clean up your password list, and add existing passwords (especially if you’re switching from another password management solution): On a Mac: Launch Safari and head to Preferences (command+,). On the Passwords tab you can use the Add and Remove buttons to create or delete entries, and right click and choose Copy Password (or double click the field) to access the password (requires admin password authentication). You can also opt to always display passwords using the Show passwords for selected websites checkbox. Saved payment information can be found on the AutoFill tab under Credit cards. On iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch: Launch Settings > Safari > Passwords. You’ll need to verify using your device passcode or TouchID to view the list. Tap an entry to view the stored password (tap and hold a password to copy it to clipboard), use the Add Password button at the bottom of the list to create a new entry, and swipe right on any existing entries to reveal the Delete button. Saved payment information can be found under Settings > Safari > AutoFill > Saved Credit Cards. iCloud Keychain Needs Improvement Not so long ago Apple waved its wand and massively improved their default Notes app Should You Be Using Apple's Notes for iOS and OS X? Should You Be Using Apple's Notes for iOS and OS X? For the first time since its release, Apple Notes for both OS X and iOS may be worth considering. Read More . They now need to do the same for iCloud Keychain and make it a genuinely useful cross-platform feature. It’s pretty great if you’re a big fan of Safari, but limiting it to the browser and not making it easier to use saved credentials on an operating system level means it’s not enough to tempt you away from 1Password, LastPass, or even free options if you’re already using them. I am not tempted to use it full-time as many features are lacking.

Photo: Pradeep Gaur/Mint New Delhi: Five companies—Apple India, Acer, Le Ecosystem Technology, Lenovo (India) and OPPO Mobiles—have sought relaxation in the local sourcing norms to set up single-brand retail stores in India, Parliament was informed on Monday. However, the government has not yet taken any decision on their requests, commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha. “Apple India Pvt. Ltd, Acer India, Le Ecosystem Technology India, Lenovo (India), OPPO Mobiles India have sought relaxation of sourcing condition. No decision has been taken by the government,” Sitharaman said. Currently, as per the foreign direct investment (FDI) policy, in respect of proposals involving foreign investment beyond 51%, sourcing of 30% of the value of goods purchased will have to be done from India. She said the proposals undertaking single-brand retail trading including those involving issues relating to relaxation of sourcing conditions on account of state-of-the-art and cutting edge technology are examined by the ministries/departments concerned. After that, the government considers these proposals taking into consideration views and comments of such departments, she added. She also said that since June 2014, the government has approved 20 proposals for foreign investment in the single-brand retail trading. These proposals include Adidas India, Tommy Hilfiger, Nike India and Montblanc Services. Replying to a separate question, Sitharaman said the department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) has received 808 applications of start-up recognition. “Out of these, 227 have been accepted and the rest have been requested to submit the required documents and have been referred to start-up India hub for handholding support,” she said.

Resend activation e-mail Infinite Loop / The Apple Ecosystem Apple Maps debacle is why Apple has a public beta program now "To all of us living in Cupertino, the maps for here were pretty darn good." by Andrew Cunningham - Aug 8, 2016 5:53 pm UTC Login to bookmark Enlarge / Devices running the iOS 10 beta. Andrew Cunningham Public betas are now a given for major and minor iOS and macOS releases for Apple, but that wasn't the case just a couple of years ago. The reason? Apple Maps, according to a Fast Company piece with quotes from Apple CEO Tim Cook, Software Engineering SVP Craig Federighi, and Internet Software and Services SVP Eddy Cue. To recap, the Maps app in iOS switched from using Google's data to Apple's in iOS 6 back in 2012. The transition did not go well; the reception from the press and the public was bad enough that it prompted a rare apology and led to the departure of longtime iOS software head Scott Forstall. "We made significant changes to all of our development processes because of [Maps]," Cue told Fast Company. "To all of us living in Cupertino, the maps for here were pretty darn good. Right? So [the problem] wasn’t obvious to us. We were never able to take it out to a large number of users to get that feedback. Now we do." Apple's software betas were always available to anyone willing to pay $99 a year for an iOS developer account, and the black market for beta access was thriving before the public beta program arrived. But today the public betas are available on a much larger scale, and they all include a built-in feedback app made specifically to help users file bug reports. Apple's public beta program started small and has expanded gradually, which is the company's normal approach to trying new things. It started with a beta for a OS X Mavericks point update in April of 2014 and expanded to include OS X Yosemite that summer. The next year, both iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan were offered as public betas, and public beta builds were released more frequently and in closer proximity to the developer versions. That has continued with iOS 10 and macOS Sierra this year. The rest of the Fast Company piece is standard fare for Apple executive interviews that aren't tied to any particular product. Cue, Federighi, and Cook talk about Apple's approach to product development and the company's continued efforts to get out from under Steve Jobs' shadow. They also make vague statements about Apple's future direction, but as usual, the company doesn't get specific about future products or initiatives.

Click Next Apple Watch To Include GPS, But No Cellular Capability: Analyst The upcoming second-generation Apple Watch likely will include a GPS radio and barometer for better geolocation capabilities. (Apple) PATRICK SEITZ 8/08/2016 Reprints The upcoming second-generation Apple Watch likely will include a GPS radio and barometer for better geolocation capabilities, respected KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a report. But it will still need to be wirelessly tethered to an iPhone for cellular data, he said. In a note to clients, Kuo said he doesn't expect Apple (AAPL) to add LTE support for standalone cellphone and data functionality to its smartwatch until 2017. And in 2018, he sees a radical design change with improved medical and health applications, which might require FDA approval, AppleInsider and MacRumors both reported Sunday. IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has a below-average IBD Composite Rating of 37, meaning it has been outperformed by 62% of stocks in key metrics over the last 12 months. For a list of top-performing stocks, check out the IBD 50 list. Apple is expected to launch the Apple Watch 2 this fall, along with an upgraded version of the original Apple Watch. The improved Apple Watch 1 will have a faster processor and better waterproofing, Kuo said. It might even get a price cut, he said. The Apple Watch 2 is unlikely to be slimmer than its predecessor because of the need for a larger battery to power the advanced components, Kuo said. Apple stock was up 0.8% to 108.37 on the stock market today. RELATED: How Many Watches Did Apple Sell Last Quarter?

Just about all the add-on keyboards available for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro depend on Bluetooth, but the Logitech CREATE uses Apple’s Smart Connector instead. It also has backlit keys, a slot to hold the Apple Pencil, and is available now for $129.99. We tested this accessory to see how suitable it is to turn Apple’s latest tablet into a 2-in-1. Design The CREATE is a single piece that clips to the back of the iPad and wraps around to the front so that it functions as a case. Most of the exterior is a synthetic weave (not the typical faux leather) that looks smart and provides a very good textured grip. Logitech promises that this material is resistant to stains and can be wiped clean. It comes in either black or blue. Logitech CREATE for 9.7-inch iPad Pro When closed, the case is 9.8 x 7.0 x 0.9 inches (248 x 178 x 23 mm), and just under a pound: 15 oz. (426 g). It adds moderately to the bulk of this tablet, but much of that is the keyboard. On the interior is a polycarbonate frame designed to protect against bumps and scratches, but the CREATE isn’t up to saving the 9.7-inch iPad Pro if something really severe happens to it. The screen gets some extra shielding from the rigid keyboard which closes down over it. There are openings for all the tablet’s speakers and ports so they are easily accessible without removing this folio. For some reason, the iPad’s volume buttons are covered with polycarbonate external buttons but the power button is just left exposed. Pen Slot Logitech is one of the very few companies that realize that people who have an Apple Pencil want an easy way to carry it around with their iPad Pro. The CREATE has a built-in slot that securely holds this stylus while also keeping it easy to access. Those who don’t feel the need to invest in Apple’s $99 accessory might use this slot to hold a more affordable stylus, or just a pen. Keyboard Logitech CREATE with 9.7-inch iPad Pro This tablet can be converted into a 2-in-1 by opening the CREATE and attaching the bottom edge of the iPad to the Smart Connector just above keyboard. This causes the back of the case to form into a brace that holds the display up. One of the few downsides of this product is that it can do that at only one angle, about 130º. This is a serviceable angle, but more flexibility would be better. Five rows of input keys and one row of function keys fit in a 9.2 x 3.7 area. The keys measure 0.6 x 0.6, with 0.1 in. of space between them. The tops of the keys are slightly concave, and there’s 1.4 mm of key travel, an adequate but not generous amount. The function keys are half the size of the regular ones, and can be used to control the display’s backlight intensity and music playback… there’s even a replacement Home button. These are very handy, and give the CREATE a nice advantage over the Apple Smart Keyboard, which has no equivalents. The keyboard backlights are another very nice touch, allowing the use of this accessory in any lighting condition. A pair of function keys switches between bright, dim, and off. Just be aware that the power for these comes from the iPad Pro, so extensive use on the brightest setting could drain the battery. Still, these backlights automatically turn themselves off if no key is pressed for 8 seconds, but they come back on again as soon as the user resumes typing. Performance Apple built support for Bluetooth keyboards into the iPad many years ago, and since that time a large number of these have been introduced. The iPad Pro line can use these, but the 9.7- and 12.9-inch models in this series also have the Smart Connector, a port that was added specifically for add-on keyboards. This allows the Logitech CREATE to function as if it were part of its tablet, drawing off its battery for the power it needs. It also means there’s no need to pair this accessory with the iPad; simply join the tablet to the keyboard at the Smart Connector and begin typing. No driver software is needed, either, nor is there is battery in the accessory that needs charging. Logitech CREATE for 9.7-inch iPad Pro After typing this review on the CREATE, as well as using it on and off for several days for other tasks, we never experienced any problems with dropped letters or repeating keys. We also asked a variety of people to try it out. Responses were generally quite positive, with our testers finding it easy to touch type on without needing any practice. One caveat though: people with large hands who find laptops or tablets keyboards cramped will find this one too small as well. But this is true of all the offerings specifically for 9.7-inch iPads. Value Logitech’s list price for this product is $129.99. Comparable keyboards for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro include the $149 Apple Smart Keyboard and the $149.99 Brydge 9.7. Another good option is the $129.99 ZAGG slim book. The best accessories usually don’t come cheaply, but the CREATE is one of the more affordable premium iPad keyboards. Conclusion Although the Logitech CREATE boasts an attractive design and a well-built keyboard, support for the Apple Smart Connector is what really makes it preferable to just about all its rivals that depend on Bluetooth. We rate it to be one of the best keyboard cases available for the Apple 9.7-inch iPad Pro.

Aside from the previously announced new iPhone 7, fans are expecting the company to release a brand-new 2016 update for their all-in-one desktop computer, the Apple iMac. According to the latest reports regarding the new Apple iMac, the company is expected to incorporate some of the latest technologies that are currently available into their new desktop computer. The new 2016 iMac is reportedly going to be coming with the latest AMD Polaris 10-based graphics processing unit (GPU). The new graphics chips are based on the latest FinFET 14-nanometer architecture technology that promises extremely fast performance along with significantly less power consumption. AMD has already released a number of consumer grade products, and it is highly likely that they will also be making these products available for Apple for them to add to their machines. If the cards are indeed incorporated in the new iMac, it will be making the all-in-one computer completely ready for virtual reality (VR) applications. This would be a big step for Apple as, currently, none of their computers are VR-ready. Oculus' Palmer Luckey had even mentioned that their device will not work with Apple machines as they apparently do not have the hardware capable of running VR programs. There are several reports that predict that the 2016 iMac may also be coming with Intel's latest Kaby Lake processor. However, some publications have claimed that it is possible for Apple to go with AMD Zen processors, which are also quite capable. Other components such as the storage, display, RAM, and other hardware will also reportedly be upgraded. For now, there hasn't been any confirmation yet as to the actual specs of the 2016 iMac, but reports have claimed that the new device may be coming out as soon as October this year.

Apple is reportedly releasing the successor to its 2-year-old iPad Air 2; however, if the rumors were true, the iPad Air 3 could be the final installment in the Air series. Rumors and reports about the Cupertino-headquartered company's plan to end the Air series with the iPad Air 3 have continuously sprouted online ever since the iPad Pro 9.7 was released this March. The rumors have yet to die down, with Macworld reiterating that it is very likely that Apple will focus on the iPad Pro series henceforth, leaving no time for the company to work on another Air iteration after this year's installment. The rumors may not have been baseless at all, since Apple has been struggling to sell its tablets ever since it launched the iPad Air 2 in October 2014. The decline in sales is taking a toll on the tech giant, with investors wondering if there is an end to this problem, as per The Motley Fool. This year, Apple is planning to rebound by refreshing all of its tablet lines and even its famous iPhone series, but it is going to be a big and expensive risk for the company's finances. Back in early March, Wired voiced out that Apple should give consumers a new reason to buy its iPads to counter the sales figures that appear to be "sinking like a horse in a quicksand." At the time, Apple has yet to take the wraps off of its iPad Pro 9.7 device, so the business site and many tech sites were speculating that the smaller Pro would already replace the iPad Air 2. Forbes also reported back then that the iPad Pro 9.7 overlaps the iPad Air 2 in so many areas that the former isn't quite as big of a deal or an upgrade for iPad Air 2 owners. It is also unclear whether the iPad Air 3 will just be a modified version of the iPad Pro 9.7, or a device that would impress the market with its new specs and features. As of late, rumors suggest that the iPad Air 3 could just be sporting the same specs and features as the iPad Pro 9.7 save for the A9x chip, because the former is presumably coming with the A10 chip, according to PC Advisor. There is no word yet on the possible new features that the iPad Air 3 will have that the iPad Pro 9.7 doesn't. Fans can expect details about these in the coming weeks or a few weeks prior the October release date of the device.  Related Apple iPad Pro 2 To Replace MacBook By Running OS X?

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Now is the worst time to buy just about anything new from Apple Monday Aug 8, 2016 at 12:03 PM Steve Kovach REUTERS/Robert Galbraith If you think it's time to buy something new from Apple, you're wrong. As fall approaches, so does an expected mega refresh cycle for a lot of Apple's products. iPhone The obvious new thing: The iPhone 7. We're about a month away from Apple's new smartphone debut, so unless your current iPhone is totally busted today, you should wait a few more weeks. The iPhone 6S price will drop, or you can get the latest and greatest hardware with the new phone. Either option is worth waiting for. MacBooks Then there are MacBooks, which have largely been ignored in recent years. It's been several years since the MacBook Air got a significant update, and many think it never will, now that the new super-thin MacBook is on the scene. But since it'll take a few more years for the pricey, underpowered MacBook to catch up to the Air's performance, the entire MacBook lineup is in an odd place. Do you get an Air, with its fuzzy display, or sacrifice power (and a few hundred extra bucks) for the sharp screen and gorgeous design of the redesigned MacBook? And what about the MacBook Pro, which hasn't been significantly updated in four years? My suggestion: Wait a few months for the expected major refresh coming to the MacBook Pro this fall. According to several reports, the new MacBook Pro will have a thin design inspired by the MacBook, plus a new touch screen on the keyboard that can display a variety of function keys and controls depending on the app you're using. It'll be the best of everything: great design and plenty of power. The other two MacBooks today require you to make a big tradeoff in one or the other. Mac The 5K iMac is the best desktop computer I've ever used. But the latest version is almost a year old, and could get a spec bump in the fall. There likely won't be a massive update, but last year Apple did improve the color representation on that sharp display. It's worth waiting a couple months to see if Apple adds similar improvements again this year. Then there's the Mac Pro. (You know, the one that looks like a mini version of a New York City subway trash can.) It's been woefully ignored by Apple for years, and there's little indication that's changing any time soon. Unless you need serious power, you're probably better off with an iMac. Apple Watch It's been nearly two years since Apple first introduced the Apple Watch, and almost a year and a half since it first went on sale. I don't recommend the Apple Watch for most people, but now is an especially bad time to buy one. While rumors around a new version of the Apple Watch have been pretty scarce, there's a decent chance it's coming this fall along with the iPhone 7. Trust me, you won't be missing much by waiting another month or two to see if a new version is coming out. iPad The iPad has a long life cycle, so if you bought one within the last four years or so, you don't need to upgrade now. But if your iPad is starting to feel old and clunky, you have a few options. The iPad Air 2 hasn't been updated in almost two years, and is overdue for a spec bump. Same goes for the iPad Mini. The only iPad worth buying right now is the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, the best iPad Apple has ever made. It launched in March, and probably won't get an update until next spring at the very earliest. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is OK for graphic artists and other niche users, but it's tough to recommend for just about anyone else. One exception Out of all the major products Apple makes, the Apple TV is the only one worth buying right now if you want it. It's not even a year old, and unlikely to get an update for a few more years. (It took Apple over three years to go from the third-generation Apple TV to the fourth-generation, after all.) Plus the Apple TV will continue to get better as Apple adds software updates and developers make new apps and streaming services. Go for it.

Today we’re switching things up, though, with some news on the next Apple Watch. The Apple Watch 2 will have the same screen sizes, thickness, and form factor as the original Apple Watch, says KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Despite having a similar design as the original Apple Watch, Kuo expects the Apple Watch 2 to include several upgrades over its predecessor, including a faster processor, a barometer, better waterproofing, and a larger battery. Also expected to be included is a GPS. The Apple Watch 2 is expected to launch in the second half of 2016. While nothing is official until Apple says that it is, the Apple Watch 2 upgrades named by Kuo sound reasonable. Features like a GPS, barometer, and better waterproofing should help to make the Apple Watch 2 much better for fitness, which is likely one of the most popular use cases for the device. And everyone can appreciate a faster processor and better battery life, which should help the AW2 to run faster and last longer. In addition to the Apple Watch 2, Kuo says that Apple is be prepping an improved version of the original Apple Watch. This upgraded Apple Watch 1 will reportedly get a faster processor and better waterproofing, though the waterproofing will not be as good as the Apple Watch 2. Kuo expects the Apple Watch to get a price cut, too, but he didn’t specify if that’ll apply to the original Apple Watch 1 or the upgraded Apple Watch 1.

The iPhone 6s iOS 9.3 update apparently came out with a lot of issues for Apple users. The company rolled out with the 9.3.1 update for the iPhone 6s and other iOS 9 devices to fix it. Then, in just a few short weeks, the 9.3.2 update also came. iPhone 6s users, especially, have been experiencing various bugs and issues since their smartphone came out. This is also the reason why Apple has been rolling out versions of the iOS 9 update. The iOS 9.3.3 update is reportedly the last update for the platform. Here are things you should know: iOS 9.3.3 Update News, Issues Battery life has always been an issue for Apple iPhones, but according to Gotta Be Mobile, there aren't any unusual battery drains while on the iOS 9.3.3. If iPhone 6s users are experiencing this, it may be connected to other issues. The outlet adds that the iPhone 6s UI and default applications are normal. No connectivity issues so far with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and LTE. This is only applicable for iPhone 6s users whose OS started on iOS 9. For earlier versions, there may be a few issues. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Aperture Games pointed out that the iOS 9.3.3 is just a small update at 55 MB and will only take a few minutes. Security issues have been taken care of with this update, but it's best to hatch a backup plan for downgrading in case something goes wrong. iOS 9.3.3 Update Jailbreak An iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak has already been released by Pangu. To jailbreak means to unlock Apple devices and in this case, those that are running iOS 9.2 to 9.3.3. Neurogadget reported that this jailbreak has been looked forward to by Apple device users. Instead of the 7-day expiry, the jailbreaking tool has been extended up to eight months with the new Pangu 1.1. The new update won't expire until April 2017. iOS 9.3.3 iBooks Issue Forbes pointed out that since the release of the iOS 9.3.3, many users, including iPhone 6 users, cannot access their iBooks. Apple stated that the issue is not tied to the update, but from Apple's own servers. The company said that the iBooks issue is fixed and gave reassurance that the files inside their iBooks app are backed up in iCloud. Will you be updating to the iOS 9.3.3 update?

The black chassis, SIM tray, and mute button pictured are much darker than any variation of Space Gray we’ve seen from Apple. This specific color is similar to the Space Black option on the stainless steel Apple Watch. Whether Apple will completely replace Space Gray or have Space Black as an additional color remains to be seen. Like previous ‘S’ upgrades, making a new color could potentially be a huge part of driving sales for the iPhone 7, with rumors pointing towards a smaller external design change. With the iPhone 7, Apple will be breaking its typical tick-tock iPhone release cycle by retaining the same external design three years in a row. With some minor adjustments, the iPhone 7 is expected to look exactly like the iPhone 6/6s. What are your thoughts on a potential Space Black iPhone color? Sound off in the comments below!

For example, the reasoning behind the iOS public beta program was in direct response to the whole Maps debacle. Eddy Cue says launching a public beta program for iOS allows the company to find and squish bugs prior to release. Noting that developing a Maps app was much harder than the company had foreseen. “To all of us living in Cupertino, the maps for here were pretty darn good. Right? So [the problem] wasn’t obvious to us. We were never able to take it out to a large number of users to get that feedback. Now we do.” Apple now does public beta testing of its most significant software projects, something that Jobs never liked to do. In 2014, the company asked users to test run its Yosemite upgrade to OS X. Last year, it introduced beta testing of iOS, which is the company’s most important operating system. “The reason you as a customer are going to be able to test iOS,” Cue says, “is because of Maps.” He also responded to those who say Apple lacks innovation after the passing of Steve Jobs. “The world thinks we delivered [a breakthrough] every year while Steve was here,” says Cue. “Those products were developed over a long period of time.” Cue says Apple’s innovation strides from the combination of software and hardware working together. Let’s say I’m at home doing email before work. I’d like Maps to tell me, ‘Don’t leave now. Your commute will be cut by 15 minutes if you stay home for a while.’ That would be very helpful. While stupidly vague, Tim Cook sheds some light on Apple’s future by dismissing the ‘Apple is doomed’ stories. The way that I look at that is, I really know the truth. Though, admittedly, Cook says Apple isn’t perfect. We have never said that we’re perfect. We’ve said that we seek that. But we sometimes fall short. The most important thing is, Do you have the courage to admit that you’re wrong? And do you change? The most important thing to me as a CEO is that we keep the courage. Cook also mentions that Apple isn’t afraid to move in new areas, but it will only do so when the time is right. Our strategy is to help you in every part of your life that we can, whether you’re sitting in the living room, on your desktop, on your phone, or in your car. While the interview was obviously scripted, it can be read in full here. Tags: Eddy Cue, Interview, iOS, maps, Steve Jobs, Tim Cook About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

The fitness benefits are worth it alone, as a shift worker having my watch remind me to get up and walk around a bit every hour made me realise after a few days of using it how lazy I’d become when I was working. Looking forward to WatchOS3, from what I’ve seen in the Keynote it’ll make my watch so much better.

Fox Business1:49 UP NEXT Apple is preparing to unveil successors to the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus as early as next month with more advanced photography capabilities and upgraded hardware in a design similar to that of last year’s models, according to people familiar with the matter. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 110.95 -0.85 -0.76% The standout features will be a dual-camera system on the larger iPhone, a re-engineered home button that responds to pressure with haptic feedback and the removal of the devices’ headphone jack, said the people, who didn’t want to be identified discussing unannounced features. Apple declined to comment. While iPhone demand has waned in recent quarters, partly due to the lull between product launches, the device continues to be the major source of Apple’s revenue. The new models will be critical to the holiday quarter, and Apple is counting on the phones to prop up sales ahead of an expected iPhone overhaul in 2017, the device’s 10th anniversary. Moving away from the typical two-year iPhone redesign cycle, this year’s models will look similar to the 6 and 6S, the people said, who added that there will still be noticeable tweaks. The new iPhones will retain the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes as their predecessors, introduced in September 2014. Apple will remove the two innermost antenna lines that run across the back of the current iPhones, the people added. Sharper Photos The dual cameras on the larger new iPhone will produce brighter photos with more detail, according to a person who has used a prototype version of the upcoming device. Both sensors, which each capture color differently, simultaneously take a picture, and the device produces a single, merged photograph, said the person. The dual system sharpens photos taken in low-light environments, the person said. The combination of the merged photos from the two camera sensors also allows users to zoom while retaining more clarity, the person added. The smaller version of the new phones will not include dual lenses, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier this year. Home Button Apple is planning an updated home button for the new models. Current home buttons are switches that physically press into the phone, but the new models will have a pressure-sensitive button that provides feedback to the user via a vibrating haptic sensation rather than a true physical click, according to the people. This mechanism is similar to that of the trackpads on the latest MacBook line. 9to5Mac reported on the home button design earlier. No Headphone Jack The new iPhones will remove the headphone jack in favor of connectivity via Bluetooth and the charging port. That will make room for a second speaker, said the people. Apple started allowing headphone makers to build headphones that can connect via the iPhone’s charger connector in 2014, the same year the company acquired headphone maker Beats Electronics. Macotakara earlier reported the headphone jack’s demise. The new models will run iOS 10, the new version of Apple’s mobile operating system coming this fall. The updated software offers interactive widgets to quickly glance at calendar appointments and favorite contacts, new messaging features, a new application for controlling smart home appliances, and a redesigned Apple Music. The new software will also run on current and some past iPhone models.

[Tech News Digest] Microsoft rolls out Windows 10 Anniversary Update, Instagram tells Stories, Time Warner buys into Hulu, Microsoft offers the HoloLens to everyone with money, and Grand Theft Auto IV cheat codes get mistaken for secret military... Read More to users around the world, Microsoft has focused one eye on the future. Windows 10 is, after all, the company’s final operating system, so it needs to evolve gradually as technologies emerge and fashions change. In a TechNet Blog post aimed at IT professionals, Microsoft detailed what’s in the Anniversary Update (Windows 10 version 1607) before stating that it will be the “last feature update for 2016, with two additional feature updates expected in 2017.” Learn more about the #Windows10 Anniversary Update & all its innovative features: https://t.co/xPmDYBkKLl pic.twitter.com/MR9pXQXciK — Windows (@Windows) August 2, 2016 Microsoft isn’t yet ready to detail any of the features coming down the pike, but we expect the next big update, codenamed Redstone 2, to be released early in 2017. Redstone 3 will then follow in the second half of the year. Windows users should get used to thinking of Windows 10 as being in beta, forever. It’s never going to be “finished”, for want of a better word, which will take some getting used to, but it does at least mean it should always be getting better. At least in theory. Ads by Google The Latest iPhone 7 Rumors There was once a time when new Apple hardware was kept firmly under wraps until the day it was unveiled on stage by an excited Steve Jobs. But Jobs is no longer with us, and neither is that level of secrecy surrounding Apple products. Now, we know exactly what’s coming down the line months before it’s officially announced. Take the iPhone 7, for example, which isn’t due to appear until at least September. And yet we already know everything we need to know about it. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who has an enviable track record of leaking Apple news, has confirmed previous iPhone 7 rumors and added a new one pertaining to the Home button. Citing people who “didn’t want to be identified discussing unannounced features,” Gurman reveals three things about the iPhone 7. 1. The headphone jack is indeed disappearing Apple Ditches the Headphone Jack, Mark Zuckerberg Tapes Over Webcam... [Tech News Digest] Apple Ditches the Headphone Jack, Mark Zuckerberg Tapes Over Webcam... [Tech News Digest] Apple plans to kill the headphone jack, Mark Zuckerberg covers his webcam with tape, Twitter lets verified users Engage, Apple will fund your next eBook spending spree, and Jerry Seinfeld's apartment is Doomed. Read More . 2. The iPhone 7 will feature a dual camera system which allows for brighter, sharper pictures than anything that has come before. 3. The Home button will be pressure-sensitive, and offer haptic feedback to users. Assuming this information is correct and the sum total of the improvements made to the iPhone 7, it suggests a mixed bag for Apple fans. Removing the headphone jack is a cynical mistake, the pressure-sensitive Home button is a gimmick, and the dual camera system could be a game-changer. So, if you like taking photographs with your smartphone, the iPhone 7 could be perfect for you. BlackBerry Brings Hub+ Apps to Android BlackBerry has released its Hub+ suite of applications on Android. Hub+, which brings all your various communications together, was previously only available on BlackBerry 10 and the privacy-focused BlackBerry Priv Android handset Read BlackBerry Priv Reviews, Try Cortana for iPhone...

The BlackBerry Hub shows all of your email and social media notifications in one place, while the Calendar and Password Keeper do exactly what you would expect them to do. Hub+ (available on Google Play) is free for 30 days, at which point you can opt in to see ads or upgrade to the entire suite of apps for 99 cents-per-month. Spotify Launches New Release Radar Spotify has launched a new feature called Release Radar, which, every Friday, will deliver a playlist of new music as curated by Spotify. Like Discover Weekly, one of Spotify’s previous automagic playlists Discover New Music with Spotify's Automagic Playlists Discover New Music with Spotify's Automagic Playlists Spotify has recently released several new ways of generating unique playlists that will help you discover awesome new music. We're here to guide you through these automagic playlist makers. Read More , Release Radar will be geared to each individual user, and no two playlists will be the same. Spotify Release Radar is ?? — Eefje Depoortere (@sjokz) August 6, 2016 With Release Radar, Spotify will recommend two hours of new music every week. Your selection of songs, as sourced from music released in the previous six months, will be chosen based on the artists and genres you listen to on Spotify. This means the more you listen, the better Spotify will get to know your likes and dislikes. Matt Ogle, Senior Product Owner at Spotify, tried to explain the thinking behind Release Radar, saying: “With the huge amount of new music released every week, it can be difficult to keep up with the latest tracks. With Release Radar, we wanted to create the simplest way for you to find all the newly released music that matters the most to you, in one playlist.” Kids React to Blockbuster Video And finally, with all of the various ways of watching movies we now have at our disposal, it’s easy to forget that until just a few years many of us were renting videos from a retail unit located a few miles away. Blockbuster only went out of business in 2013, but its time on top feels like a lifetime ago. With that in mind it’s no wonder young kids really have no idea what Blockbuster was, or understand why we put up with such a ridiculous system for so long. As this Kids React video from the Fine Bros. shows. The thing is, kids, Blockbuster was all we had, and it worked perfectly well for us for a long time.

To me beta used to sound like a really scary thing and I always avoided anything that was beta. This could have dettered some users from upgrading. I would compare Windows 10 with a part rolling release OS, because you can always update to the newest kernel. It would be nice if you called Windows 10 like that, it doesn't sound as bad as perpetual beta. Reply Joester August 18, 2016 at 4:00 pm Agree with Jimis2001. Windows 10 and newer Windows OS is now a WaaS (Windows as a Service) model. Which means always upgrading. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

While just predictions, Kuo has sources in Apple's supply chain, so these are more like highly educated guesses. Based on what Kuo's been told, the Apple Watch 2 will launch sometime in the second half of the year wielding a faster System-on-Chip (SoC) built by TSMC. And in addition to GPS, a notably missing feature of the original Apple Watch, the second generation model will sport a barometer, better waterproofing, and a higher capacity battery. Those are all welcome upgrades to what's already a well-built wearable. Adding GPS would especially be big, as it would mean being able to go jogging or biking or whatever without having to take a connected iPhone along for the journey for GPS tracking. That's a big advantage of competing wearables, such as the Microsoft Band 2. As for the aesthetics, Kuo's supply chain sources indicated that Apple Watch 2 devices will feature thinner display technology but retain the same screen sizes (38mm and 42mm), thickness, and general form factor of existing models. There was no mention of Apple Watch 2 wearables being compatible with existing bands, though we suspect they will be. Barring any surprises, Apple will probably roll out its second generation smartwatch at the same time it unveils its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus devices. That would put the launch at around mid-September.

Multiple rumors suggest that Apple is all set to launch its iPhone 7 this September; however, an official word is yet to come. Most publications believe that there will be no major additions in the new iPhone. On the contrary, the Verge reiterated a weak rumor, which could excite many fans – the conventional home push button will be replaced by a pressure-sensitive touch home button. According to the publication, videos, and leaked images, the device will feature a pressure-sensitive home button instead of the push button. However, the sources were not reliable. Now, this rumor has been endorsed by Mark Gurman, an analyst who is known for authenticity when it comes to Apple. As the term pressure-sensitive suggests, this new type of button will work on the basis of force applied. Currently, a single press takes users to the main screen within an app. The report explains that since there is no hardware there will be no physical click, which works as a response to the action. The company may integrate the pressure-sensitive home button with a haptic feedback, which is already present on many Android devices. Amidst all the disappointing news about the iPhone 7, such as the ditched headphone jack and a similar build and design as the iPhone 6s, the new type of home button may be a game changer. It may finally put an end to a problem that has been reported on the handset’s previous iterations, which is a faulty or irresponsive home button. The Touch ID, especially on the most recent variants, is extremely fast and often unlocks the phone even if the users pressed the home button only to check notifications. Also, the probability of the iPhone 7 being waterproof increases with this news, as a physical button is more prone to damage by water. With the headphone jack expected to depart, the company may be able to keep its users satisfied if it implements the new Bluetooth chip in its smartphone and wireless earphones, as suggested in this report. The spot of the headphone jack will now be covered by a second speaker. The ‘Plus’ variant of the device may host dual lens camera, as speculated. The dual lens will allow the device to capture two different images simultaneously, which will result in sharper and more refined pictures and videos, even in low-light. We believe the iPhone maker may not have incorporated many visual changes for its upcoming device, but it’s the subtle changes inside that can make Apple a great success again. Apart from the recent rumors, earlier it was hinted in some publications that the device will have an improved battery, and a 32GB variant instead of the 16GB.

While there has been a lack of leaks and rumors surrounding the new Watch, Kuo says the device will launch in late 2016 (likely alongside the iPhone 7 in September). The second-generation Apple Watch will look similar to the original, however, it will feature a GPS, barometer, faster SoC, and improved waterproofing beyond what we already have. Kuo believes we’ll be seeing the equivalent of an ‘S’ upgrade on the iPhone where the physical design will remain the same, but the internals will be getting a significant upgrade. Those wanting a thinner, lighter design will more than likely have to wait for the third-generation. On top of this, the analyst says that Apple will also be revamping the first-generation Apple Watch with minor internal improvements. While it may not get GPS, the original Apple Watch is said to feature a new SoC to improve CPU and GPU performance. Kuo also expects another price cut for the current models, following a $50 reduction in price to the Apple Watch Sport in March. While specifics are unclear, Apple could possibly cut the price down $100 making the entry level Watch $200.

Raymond Ronamai   August 8, 2016 21:40 IST 1 Shares 1 Shares Amazon Prime offers best deal on iPhonesREUTERS/David Gray All eyes are on Apple's upcoming flagship smartphone dubbed as the iPhone 7 as its release date is drawing close. The Cupertino giant may be trying to maintain utmost secrecy, but several details from its possible release date to specifications have been leaked over the last few weeks. Apple is expected to release two devices – the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus – next month as its predecessor, the iPhone 6s, will complete a year cycle in the market by this time. Interestingly, leakster Evan Blass aka @evleaks has claimed in a Twitter post that the device will be announced on Sept. 12 but it is not confirmed yet. Why advertise with us?

I wouldn’t recommend leaving your pet alone for days with this thing, but if work keeps you late every once in awhile, it’d be great to know that your furry friend isn’t going hungry.

Advertisement Advertisement First, each FreshWorks product includes a “crisp tray” which elevates the food off the bottom of the container, giving moisture a place to drip, and air enough room to flow.

It may sounds too good to be true, but customer reviews are fantastic, and Amazon’s taking offering a 2-piece set for $17 today, matching an all-time low.

Reviewers also say it chops through everything from fruit to ice cubes with no trouble, so it really can be a full blender replacement for most use cases. $34 Cuisinart Smart Stick CSB-75BC 200 Watt 2 Speed Hand Blender,… From amazon 5578 purchased by readers Gizmodo Media Group may get a commission Buy now Xbox One S 2TB + Four Games, $400 We’ve already started to see some bundle deals on the new and improved Xbox One S, but this is by far the best one yet.

Finance Search Thu, Nov 24, 2016, 5:20 AM AEDT - Australia Markets open in 4 hrs 40 mins Russia accuses Apple of alleged iPhone price-fixingAFP – Mon, Aug 8, 2016 3:49 PM AEST Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo Russia said it is taking legal action against Apple over the alleged fixing of retail prices for iPhones Russia said Monday it has launched legal proceedings against US tech giant Apple over the alleged fixing of retail prices for iPhones in the country. The Russian antitrust authority in a statement cited legislation banning businesses from setting up cartels or making agreements that limit competition. The Federal Anti-monopoly Service said its investigation "showed that from the start of official sales of iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus in Russia, the majority of resellers set identical prices for them and held them for a certain period." It said it had identified "resellers' prices coinciding" for other iPhone models as well, and named 16 major chains of mobile phones and other electronics allegedly taking part in the price-fixing. It alleged that this could be "the result of coordination of Russian resellers' price formation by the Apple group." This it claimed "led to the setting of prices on the Russian market and acceptance of so-called 'recommended' prices as compulsory." Russia said it is taking legal action against a Russian company registered by Apple, LLC Apple Rus, as well as Apple Holding B.V., Apple Sales Ireland, Apple Operations International and Apple Inc. In September 2015 Russia's antitrust authority found US Internet giant Google guilty of unfairly keeping rival services off Android mobile devices. The two sides are holding talks aimed at reaching an amicable solution. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Webjet signs with Chinese travel partnerAAP Webjet has formed a partnership with the largest travel aggregator in China, Dida Travel Technology.

Reuters August 8, 2016 21:13 IST Russia's Federal Anti-Monopoly Service said on Monday it had opened a case into price-fixing allegations concerning Apple iPhones. "The Anti-Monopoly Service sees signs of price fixing violations in the Russian Federation at Apple iPhone resellers, which resulted in the same prices for these smartphones," it said in a statement. Why advertise with us? A representative for Apple in Russia was not immediately available for comment. The anti-monopoly body said it had opened its case after an appeal from a citizen with information that identical prices had been set for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models, which appeared in Russia in October 2015, at 16 major resellers. It said that an investigation had showed that resellers had set identical prices and kept them at that level for a certain time period, including for other models. MTS, one of the resellers mentioned in the anti-monopoly service's statement, declined a request for comment. Euroset, another firm mentioned, denied it had coordinated prices with anyone.

 You'll be able to unlock the new MacBook with your fingerprint Antonio Villas-Boas Aug. 8, 2016, 11:09 AM 3,740 facebook linkedin twitter email print Martin Hajek The new crop of MacBook Pro laptops that Apple is expected to release this Fall may come with Touch ID fingerprint sensors built into the laptop's power button, according to 9to5Mac citing sources that have been reliable in the past.  It's not yet clear exactly what the uses are for a TouchID sensor on the MacBook Pro laptop. If the iPhone's TouchID sensor is anything to go by, a TouchID sensor on the MacBook Pro would let you unlock your laptop without typing a password, pay for apps, and even use Apple Pay to pay for online shopping.  9to5Mac's sources also reinforced previous rumors that the next MacBook Pro will feature a row of customizable OLED touch-screen buttons that will take the place of the "F" keys that are usually above the row of number keys on a regular keyboard. With customizable "F" function keys, which often go unused, you could potentially assign shortcuts to different apps, features, and functions. For example, you could change the location of the volume button "F" keys that are found on the right of Apple's keyboard to the "F" keys on the left. Currently, you can't switch the location of function keys, like volume controls, as they are permanently set on Apple keyboards. A concept of the OLED touch-screen function buttons by designer Martin Hajek. Martin Hajek 9to5Mac's reports of TouchID and an OLED touch-screen on the new MacBook Pro laptops are reinforcements of an earlier report posted in May by KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi-Kuo, who has accurately predicted features on new Apple products in the past. Despite the accurate predictions and reliable sources, nothing about Apple's new MacBook Pro laptops is set in stone until Apple itself reveals the new models during its Fall event in September.

This new MacBook Pro for 2016 would have a very similar look to previous models – albeit a bit thinner and more “MacBook-like”. It’d also have its own Touch ID sensor, allowing Apple to once again push the world of passwords further away from the mainstream. This rumor comes from 9to5Mac where their source “has provided reliable information in the past.” It’s suggested there that this model would work with OLED touch-sensitive keys – perhaps even a touch display above the device’s keyboard. The images you see above and below come from an article we published a few weeks ago in which designer/artist Martin Hajek modeled a set of possibilities for the next MacBook. There he’s made this next generation an awesome one with keys that can be re-arranged and plotted how the user desires. It’s also been reported previously (also by anonymous sources) that this next MacBook Pro will have multiple USB-C ports (as many as 4x) and no MagSafe power at all. This would be the end of the MagSafe as the MacBook has already done away with the port. At this time it would appear that the next MacBook Pro will be announced within the last three months of the year, and released to stores around the holiday season. It’s iffy whether or not Apple will release another MacBook Air, but if they do, it’ll come at the same time as this MacBook Pro, covering both ends of the price spectrum. Have a peek at the timeline below to see more about the MacBook Pro and where it’s headed.

Beck Diefenbach/Reuters Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email There could be new Apple Watch hardware around the corner, if a well-connected industry analyst is proved correct. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who last year correctly predicted Apple would launch the iPhone SE, says there are two new Apple Watches coming in the second half of 2016, MacRumours reports. One model will apparently be an incremental upgrade to the current Watch, with a better processor and improved waterproofing. A second model, to be called the Apple Watch 2, boasts those improvements plus more precise location tracking thanks to GPS and a barometer, as well as a bigger battery. Ming-Chi also suspects Apple will introduce LTE connectivity to the line in 2017. That'll mean you can use the Watch without needing to connect to a phone or Wi-Fi. Apple in June unveiled a new OS for the Watch. The company was contacted for comment but did not immediately respond. Despite enduring a drop in shipments, the Apple Watch is still leading the smartwatch pack. 1.6 million of the devices were shipped in the second quarter of this year -- a sizeable decrease from the 3.6 million shipped in the same quarter last year, but still far ahead of the 600,000 that Samsung did with its Galaxy Gear range. The Apple Watch 2 isn't Ming-Chi's only Apple prediction for this year. The analyst previously said that the company would be releasing a heavily revamped MacBook Pro in late 2016. It'll include an OLED touchscreen in place of function keys, Touch ID and USB-C support, he said. This article originally appeared on CNET.com.

 Now is the worst time to buy just about anything new from Apple Steve Kovach Aug. 8, 2016, 11:33 AM 56,101 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith If you think it's time to buy something new from Apple, you're wrong. As fall approaches, so does an expected mega refresh cycle for a lot of Apple's products. iPhone The obvious new thing: The iPhone 7. We're about a month away from Apple's new smartphone debut, so unless your current iPhone is totally busted today, you should wait a few more weeks. The iPhone 6S price will drop, or you can get the latest and greatest hardware with the new phone. Either option is worth waiting for. MacBooks Then there are MacBooks, which have largely been ignored in recent years. It's been several years since the MacBook Air got a significant update, and many think it never will, now that the new super-thin MacBook is on the scene. But since it'll take a few more years for the pricey, underpowered MacBook to catch up to the Air's performance, the entire MacBook lineup is in an odd place. Do you get an Air, with its fuzzy display, or sacrifice power (and a few hundred extra bucks) for the sharp screen and gorgeous design of the redesigned MacBook? And what about the MacBook Pro, which hasn't been significantly updated in four years? The MacBook. Reuters/Robert Galbraith My suggestion: Wait a few months for the expected major refresh coming to the MacBook Pro this fall. According to several reports, the new MacBook Pro will have a thin design inspired by the MacBook, plus a new touch screen on the keyboard that can display a variety of function keys and controls depending on the app you're using. It'll be the best of everything: great design and plenty of power. The other two MacBooks today require you to make a big tradeoff in one or the other. Mac The 5K iMac is the best desktop computer I've ever used. But the latest version is almost a year old, and could get a spec bump in the fall. There likely won't be a massive update, but last year Apple did improve the color representation on that sharp display. It's worth waiting a couple months to see if Apple adds similar improvements again this year. Then there's the Mac Pro. (You know, the one that looks like a mini version of a New York City subway trash can.) It's been woefully ignored by Apple for years, and there's little indication that's changing any time soon. Unless you need serious power, you're probably better off with an iMac. Apple Watch It's been nearly two years since Apple first introduced the Apple Watch, and almost a year and a half since it first went on sale. I don't recommend the Apple Watch for most people, but now is an especially bad time to buy one. While rumors around a new version of the Apple Watch have been pretty scarce, there's a decent chance it's coming this fall along with the iPhone 7. Trust me, you won't be missing much by waiting another month or two to see if a new version is coming out. The Apple Watch is nearing the end of its lifecycle. Reuters/Christian Hartmann iPad The iPad has a long life cycle, so if you bought one within the last four years or so, you don't need to upgrade now. But if your iPad is starting to feel old and clunky, you have a few options. The iPad Air 2 hasn't been updated in almost two years, and is overdue for a spec bump. Same goes for the iPad Mini. The only iPad worth buying right now is the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, the best iPad Apple has ever made. It launched in March, and probably won't get an update until next spring at the very earliest. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is OK for graphic artists and other niche users, but it's tough to recommend for just about anyone else. One exception Out of all the major products Apple makes, the Apple TV is the only one worth buying right now if you want it. It's not even a year old, and unlikely to get an update for a few more years. (It took Apple over three years to go from the third-generation Apple TV to the fourth-generation, after all.) Plus the Apple TV will continue to get better as Apple adds software updates and developers make new apps and streaming services. Go for it.

Turi helps developers create and manage software and services that use a form of AI called machine learning. It also has systems that let companies to build recommendation engines, detect fraud, analyze customer usage patterns and better target potential users, according to the Seattle-based startup’s website. Apple could use this to more rapidly integrate the technology with future products.  Apple’s move Friday is part of a broader battle among Google, Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. to gain an edge in AI, particularly in the field known as pervasive computing, where software tries to automatically infer what people want, one of the people said. Turi’s technology could feed into Apple’s Siri digital assistant, the person added, and help define new ways computers interact with people.  “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,” Apple said in a statement. GeekWire earlier reported the acquisition. Apple sees its Turi acquisition as a way to better tap into the growing community of AI researchers, said a person familiar with the deal. Apple has been criticized by researchers for being too secretive about its AI work. In contrast, Turi held a two-day machine-learning conference in July in San Francisco for data scientists and academics. Formerly known as Dato, Turi raised more than $25 million from venture capital investors including New Enterprise Associates and Madrona Venture Group, according to CrunchBase. Turi couldn’t be reached for comment on the deal. The Turi team will remain in Seattle, one of the people familiar with the situation said. Apple has purchased multiple firms over the past couple of years that specialize in artificial intelligence. The company has also begun to integrate these technologies into products such as its iPhone software and Siri. In January, Apple acquired Emotient, a startup that uses AI to recognize and act upon facial expressions. Last year, Apple acquired a pair of voice-centric AI startups, VocalIQ and Perceptio, to bolster Siri. VocalIQ specialized in using machine learning to allow voice assistants to engage in more realistic conversation. Perceptio focused on helping AI systems run on devices while sharing limited amounts of personal user data. Machine learning and AI help computers automatically understand images, videos, and spoken words. The technologies also allow systems to take actions or make recommendations on such data. Apple has already begun to show the fruits of its AI investments via better keyword recognition by Siri across multiple product lines. Apple will release a new version of its photo-management program for iPhones and iPads that uses AI to recognize objects in photos. For example, a user will be able to search for “sushi” and photographs of the food will appear. Apple will also bring machine learning capabilities to its iMessage application by adding a feature this fall that translates words in texts into emoji icons.

Apple is once again being targeted for alleged price-fixing, this time in Russia. The country’s federal antitrust body has today opened a case and investigation into accusations that Apple and 16 resellers formed an agreement to fix prices of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. In a statement, the Federal Anti-Monopoly Services explained that the issue was first brought to light by a citizen. The citizen apparently informed Russian officials that the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus carried the same price tag across 16 resellers, suggesting that Apple and the resellers had colluded to set such prices. “The Anti-Monopoly Service sees signs of price-fixing violations in the Russian Federation at Apple iPhone resellers, which resulted in the same prices for these smartphones,” the federal antitrust body said in a statement (via Reuters). Apple and the majority of the 16 accused resellers have not yet commented on the accusations. Euroset, Russia’s largest mobile phone retailer, however, denied the accusations that it had coordinated with Apple to set prices of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. Apple hasn’t had the best relationship with partners in Russia throughout the iPhone’s lifetime, either. In 2012, Russian carrier MTS accused Apple of running a “dictatorship” when it came to selling the iPhone. “They’re more in a dictatorship mode where they say, ‘This is what you have to do or you don’t get the iPhone,’” MTS Vice President of Marketing Vasyl Latsanych said at the time. “Being arrogant with your partners in big markets doesn’t pay off.” Recently, however, it has been rumored that Apple is looking to open a central center for iOS device repair in Russia after accusations that the company does not adequately support customers in the country. In the United States, Apple was of course the target of a price-fixing scheme relating to the iBooks Store. The case accused Apple of working with publishers to artificially raise the price of ebooks. The settlement saw Apple pay out over $400 million. It’s currently unclear what kind of fines and punishment Apple could be facing in Russia if it is indeed found guilty of price-fixing. The company hasn’t yet commented on the accusations, though.

Some critics believe that Apple is doing too many things at once, or wrongly placing its focus on areas like Apple Watch bands rather than its core product lineup. MacRumors Buyer's Guide for Macs The most vocal critics often point towards the state of Apple's current Mac lineup, which is beginning to stagnate. It has been 447 days since the last MacBook Pro release, while the MacBook Air has not been updated beyond a RAM bump in 518 days. Mac mini: 662 days. Mac Pro: 963 days. Apple's stock also remains down over 13 percent from its 52-week high, and investors perhaps have at least some reason for concern. Rumors suggest, for example, that the next iPhone will be an incremental improvement over the iPhone 6s, with more significant changes not coming until 2017. In a new Fast Company interview alongside CEO Tim Cook, Apple services chief Eddy Cue acknowledged that technology companies are "only as good as the last thing" they did. "Look," says Cue, who somehow manages to look both like a man who just woke up and a compact ball of perpetual energy, "one thing you know if you’ve been in technology a while, you’re only as good as the last thing you did. No one wants an original iPod. No one wants an iPhone 3GS."Cook admitted that Apple can "sometimes fall short," but indirectly added that the "Apple is doomed" narrative has existed during his entire 18-year span at the company. "Is Apple making more mistakes than we used to? I don’t have a tracker on that." […] "We have never said that we’re perfect," he continues. "We’ve said that we seek that. But we sometimes fall short." […] "What tends to happen with Apple, not just today but in the 18 years I’ve been here," says Cook, "is that invariably some people compare what we’re doing now to a vision or a product that somebody says they will create in the future."Fortunately for Cook, he said he doesn't "read all the coverage on Apple that there is," and instead focuses on pushing the company into a future that is bigger and broader. "I want Apple to be here, you know, forever," he said. As Cue says, grinning at the ambition: "We want to be there from when you wake up till when you decide to go to sleep." Cook himself is only slightly less brash. "Our strategy is to help you in every part of your life that we can," he says, "whether you’re sitting in the living room, on your desktop, on your phone, or in your car."Earlier this year, Above Avalon analyst Neil Cybart said Apple is on track to spend a record $10 billion on research and development this year, up nearly 30 percent from 2015, and significantly more than the little over $3 billion per year it was spending on R&D just four years ago. Cybart said the increased spending undoubtedly points towards development of the widely rumored Apple Car, suggesting that the company will pivot into the automobile industry. But if Cook's recent teaser about "great innovation in the pipeline" is any indication, Apple could have other plans in store too. Apple Maps and Public Beta Testing One other interesting anecdote in the wide-ranging interview: Apple Maps is the reason why iOS public beta testing exists. Apple now does public beta testing of its most significant software projects, something that Jobs never liked to do. In 2014, the company asked users to test run its Yosemite upgrade to OS X. Last year, it introduced beta testing of iOS, which is the company’s most important operating system. "The reason you as a customer are going to be able to test iOS," Cue says, "is because of Maps."Full-length interview: Playing The Long Game Inside Tim Cook's Apple Tags: Tim Cook, Eddy Cue, fastcompany.com [ 554 comments ] Top Rated Comments (View all) redheeler 15 weeks ago Cook admitted that Apple can "sometimes fall short," but indirectly added that the "Apple is doomed" narrative has existed during his entire 18-year span at the company.

Do we cheer when gas prices rise, prescription drugs cost more, internet prices increase at reduced speeds proving Comcast is doing super well and has an enormous war chest?

Here Are Some Of The Rumors Going Around About The Next Apple Gadgets Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Here Are Some Of The Rumors Going Around About The Next Apple Gadgets Image courtesy of YouTube August 8, 2016 10:44 am EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk what's the buzz? rumors technology apple iPhone 7 iPhone Pro iPhone 7 Plus iphones Apple Watch Apple Watch 2 It seems like immediately upon Apple releasing new products, the rumor mill gets to chugging along again, with folks trying to predict what the company will come out with next. It can be hard to stay on top of those rumors, so we thought we’d help. Right now there’s a lot of buzz around what the successors of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will be, as well as the specifics surrounding the upcoming versions of the Apple Watch. Here’s what we’ve been hearing: The Next iPhone • The name: Everyone’s been calling the next iPhones the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which would seem to make sense, based on how the company has named previous phones. There’s also leaked video going around that appears to show three new phones: one 4.7-inch iPhone 7 model, and two 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus and Pro models, BGR reports. • The shape: Rumor has it, and so does MacRumors, that the next phones will look a lot like the current versions, with the same thickness and screen sizes. The leaked video of the purported phones show that they’re similar to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, but there’s no camera ring like on the current versions, and the antenna lines are redesigned. • A dual-lens camera for the larger iPhone: The new cameras on the larger iPhone will make for brighter photos with more detail in low light, the rumor mill says. This combination of merged photos from the two sensors will allow users to zoom while retaining clarity, an insider told Bloomberg. The smaller iPhone won’t have these dual sensors. • No headphone jack?: This rumor has persisted for a while. Bloomberg spoke to the always wise “people familiar with the matter” who say it’s true — the next iPhone won’t have a headphone jack. There have been a few purported leaks of the design that show two speakers instead. How will you get your tunes delivered to your ears? Wired headphones will connect to the iPhone 7 using its Lightning port, MacRumors says, while wireless headphones provide another alternative. • A home button that doesn’t click: Instead of a home button that physically depresses when you touch it, the new iPhone is said to use pressure sensing haptic technology, Apple Insider reports, that will vibrate slightly when you touch it to let you know it’s been pressed. • Release date: It’s still unclear when the next iPhones will drop, but Bloomberg cites insiders who say it could be as early as next month at its annual media event. Preorders could begin on Sept. 9, and if the company follows its usual patterns, the new phones will be available to consumers a few weeks after they’re revealed to the public. Apple Watch 2 • The name: Apple Insider says the company is planning to release two Apple watch versions, one that’s a minor update of the current models, and an “Apple Watch 2.” • Preparing for accidental dunking: Resistance to water is expected to be improved on both new versions. • Improved geolocation: The Apple Watch 2 will have the same general design as current models, Apple Insider notes, but will also have a GPS radio and barometer for improved geolocation capabilities. • Better battery: A higher capacity battery will be available on the Apple Watch 2, but because it’s a larger battery, there won’t be the usual slimming of the device you might expect. • The release date: Before the end of 2016.

With the next Apple Watch, a well-known analyst said it will be the inside that counts, according to technology blog 9to5Mac. KGI Securities researcher Ming-Chi Kuo said the next watch will include a GPS, barometer, more robust waterproofing and a faster system, according to 9to5Mac. But the new smartwatch, slated to debut late this year and possibly as soon as next month, will likely keep the same physical design as the first model, 9to5Mac's Benjamin Mayo reported. Apple declined to comment, citing policy against commenting rumor or speculation. The internal update would mimic Apple's iPhone "S" upgrade system, which tends to improve the specs of a device while leaving the chassis intact, 9to5Mac reported. While the Apple Watch 3 should have "major external design changes," there could also be a "spec bumped" version of the Apple Watch 2 in the works, with a faster system but not the other features, 9to5Mac said.

Sporting an untucked apricot camp shirt and blue jeans over camouflage socks and a pair of blue leather racing shoes from Germany, Apple’s SVP of Internet software and services pulls up a chair at one of the marble-topped tables outside Caffé Macs,” Rick Tetzeli writes for Fast Company. “Nowhere is there any hint that ‘Apple is doomed,’ as suggested by Forbes and other outlets, or that it is engaged in a ‘user-hostile and stupid’ campaign against its customers (The Verge), led by CEO Tim Cook, a ‘boring old fart… a supply-chain supplicant’ (culture critic Bob Lefsetz).” “Under Cook’s leadership, Apple has come to seem quite fallible to many people. Its recent products have seemed far less than perfect, at least compared to the collective memory of its astonishing iPod–iPhone–iPad run from 2001 to 2010,” Tetzeli writes. “There are the public embarrassments, like its 2012 introduction of Maps, or those 2014 videos of reviewers bending, and breaking, an iPhone 6 Plus. Apple Pay hasn’t become the standard for a cashless society, and the Apple Watch ‘is not the watch we expect from Apple,’ according to John Gruber… Apple Music has been saddled with too many features, as if it were something designed by, God forbid, Microsoft; the lens on the back of the iPhone 6 extrudes; the new Apple TV has an illogical interface and confusing remote control.” “Steve Jobs had been the company’s editor, proud of saying no to features, products, business ideas, and new hires far more often than he said yes. Apple’s seemingly diffuse product line reinforces the argument that Cook is not as rigorous),” Tetzeli writes. “Apple executives are careful to avoid suggesting that the company is moving beyond its founder’s vision, but that’s exactly what’s happening in Cupertino.” Read more in the full article here.

KingMel Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 5:22 pm · Reply And a lot of us are sick of anonymous Tim Cook bashers full of gripes, but no concrete plans for improvement. Gripe all you want (preferably not on this forum), but don’t expect me to care. spyintheskyuk Monday, August 8, 2016 - 2:57 pm · Reply Spent 20 years listening to the same self deluded claptrap from the likes of you and the chin draggers above. You are no brighter or even more entertaining than those who preceeded you and Steve Jobs presense simply offered a different target rather than the nature of the attacks. Herself Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 11:47 pm · Reply Mud-slinging may make some of us feel better but it changes nothing, not when guys like Tim Cook are making Billions in profit for shareholders. His Board of Directors aren’t going to fire him for “lack of innovation,” “being asleep at the wheel,” or “wasting time with social activism” that they themselves support. Money talks louder than these empty accusations. Saying that Tim Cook is worthless is the same thing as saying that Steve Jobs exercised poor judgement in recommending him as his successor as CEO, and that the Apple BOD, in accepting Jobs’s recommendation, and in continuing to support Tim Cook ever since, are also losers. That line of argument ignores the fact of Apple’s massive financial success and social influence. Their success and social prominence makes them winners, not losers, in every dictionary except the one used by whiners. gespensen Monday, August 8, 2016 - 10:58 am · Reply Tim Cook is no Steve Jobs. Yet each CEO has their own way of leading a company. Many may not like how Apple is doing business today, I admit to be part of this group, but as long as Apple is diversing and making money each quarter all is good with Apple leadership. The Harrower Monday, August 8, 2016 - 11:26 am · Reply As long as a company posts a profit all is good with leadership? That’s pretty shortsighted for a company that used to be so innovative. You might be okay with that, but I’m certainly not. Apple doesn’t even make the thinnest laptop anymore. b9bot Monday, August 8, 2016 - 11:01 am · Reply Sick and tired of Tim Cook bashers. There are a few facts you boys are missing. One of the biggest facts is Tim Cook has given Apple 10 times the profits after Steve’s passing. Second is that Steve Jobs personally gave Tim Cook this job knowing what he could do. The Apple Watch is far from a failure owning 75% of the market. Taking away all the companies who thought being first was going to give them an advantage. NOT!!! Apple Music is already at 15 million subscribers and climbing. For a new business model I would say that’s pretty darn good. I would like to know who says no Mac models are recommended as a buy right now? PC’s aren’t exactly flying off the shelves and what exactly would give them an advantage? Putting fingerprints all over your screen? No thanks. You can use a trackpad to do the things they say in those dumb windows commercials just as easily and you won’t have to clean your screen after too. Sorry I am not buying the doom and gloom B.S. The Harrower Monday, August 8, 2016 - 11:22 am · Reply “I would like to know who says no Mac models are recommended as a buy right now?” Basically anyone who needs a decent GPU. Apple is selling the same computer from 4 years ago at the same price when it was introduced and using the same parts! If you are a rudimentary user and do Facebook, email, and graphic design work, Macs are fine. If you want to do any heavy lifting and work in either 3D or video editing, your best bet is to either build a Hackintosh or *gasp* buy a PC. I’ve been using Macs for 20 years. Been waiting over a year for a new machine that’ll suit my needs. The fact is Apple doesn’t make it. I’ve used Macs for 20+ years. This will be the first time my money is going to someone else. Part of me wishes Apple would just port OSX, sorry macOS, to Windows and be done with it. Shadowself Monday, August 8, 2016 - 2:32 pm · Reply Tim Cook has had PLENTY of time to prove himself. He’s so busy making Apple the company great he’s lost focus on making great products for Apple’s customers. “One of the biggest facts is Tim Cook has given Apple 10 times the profits after Steve’s passing.” And, Apple was making many times the profits in the late 80s under Sculley compared to what it was under Steve Jobs in the early to mid 80s. In the late 80s and even into 1990 many were proclaiming that Sculley was the PERFECT CEO for *any* computer company. (IIRC MacWorld even had him on their cover as the “Shogun” of the computer world.) However, he *DID* lay the foundation for Apple’s dark days. Anyone with more than two active brain cells will wonder if the same thing is not happening now. “The Apple Watch is far from a failure owning 75% of the market. Taking away all the companies who thought being first was going to give them an advantage.” But, in its niche, the Newton was a great seller too. We all know where that ended up. “Apple Music is already at 15 million subscribers and climbing. For a new business model I would say that’s pretty darn good.” It’s not a new business model. And, Apple bought Beats in order to get a damn good leg up on the process. I’d say that number of users is not so great given both those underlying conditions. “I would like to know who says no Mac models are recommended as a buy right now?” Anyone who wants a state of the art computer that is not anything close to a ‘netbook. I haven’t met a professional computer user in over two years who has wholeheartedly recommended buying any Mac. Yes, begrudgingly when it is absolutely necessary, but not out of pure choice. Professionals don’t buy a computer for today. They buy them for what they can do with them over the next 2-5 years. That means being able to keep them current. That means buying the state-of-the-art today and using it for a few years. — then buying the state-of-the-art again. No professional buys three plus year old technology unless they absolutely have to do so. “PC’s aren’t exactly flying off the shelves…” And, if the last quarter holds, Macs will be fading faster than PCs. So you’re advocating a worse sales rate than PC’s? I don’t believe in the doom and gloom about Apple. Apple (and Tim Cook) can still turn things around. They likely have another year or two before the dark days return. I expect Apple will turn things around before this time next year — in all its product categories, not just Macs. I’m truly hopeful. BUT, I’m not going to bet 100% of my life savings on it. -hh Monday, August 8, 2016 - 4:12 pm · Reply “I would like to know who says no Mac models are recommended as a buy right now?” Ultimately, it comes down to one’s Use Case for if they’re a good or bad value for you. Graphics is one example. Another is peripheral support for the 2015 MacBook — its USB-C port (and the only port on the machine) still lacks some hardware interface adaptors … adaptors which should have been designed, fabbed and in-stock on the day that this machine originally shipped. And yet another is local high performance storage without the hit of the “Thunderbolt Tax”. An example of this last one is the current BTO price of approx. $700 for a +1TB SSD upgrade: that’s the same as the retail price on a 2TB SSD … … which all makes it very brutally obvious that Apple is not offering competitive _value_ for their Macs. So much for ‘delighting the customer’ … remember when? rosswellian Monday, August 8, 2016 - 12:37 pm · Reply Don’t need new Mac models every year. Model T was a game changer because it is the same, you can get parts for it and it is a well-known thing. New models every year is what Buick and Chevvie did, and went bust doing. We are smarter than that. A Honda Civic or a Toyota Corolla, and a Mac, they are iconic and don’t need updating every year. The Harrower Monday, August 8, 2016 - 1:47 pm · Reply Macs aren’t a game changer anymore and you can’t buy parts for a Mac because everything is soldered in. I fail to see how any of this is relevant. Maybe you buy a Mac to be hip and cool and have it look nice. Fine I suppose, but that’s not want the vast majority of people buy computers for. Rettogo Monday, August 8, 2016 - 2:50 pm · Reply Apple has two things going for it at the base of everything. First, it’s the only machine that a user RARELY if ever needs to install anti-virus software on. Second, a customer can feel comfortable that Apple isn’t selling the customer data or otherwise using the customer information to make money or market to them. Bottom line – SECURITY. As long as Cook maintains that, he can’t harm it enough to run away the base of its customers.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is prepping to launch its second generation Apple Watch by the end of this year, with a slew of new features in tow. KGI Securities Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is reporting that the Apple Watch 2 will include: A faster redesigned TSMC built processor, Built-in GPS (first-gen Apple Watches have to pair with an iPhone and piggyback on the phone’s GPS), A barometer to measure air pressure changes, A larger battery, and perhaps most impressively, The device will be totally waterproof. What won’t be changing, according to Kuo, is the watch’s display size or the device’s overall footprint. The new watch also will not yet feature data connectivity yet — that perk is planned to be introduced next year. The analyst also expects a price cut coming soon on the original Apple Watch, which the company typically does just prior to, or in conjunction with, a product update. While the watch hasn’t been the runaway success that Apple hoped for, it has outsold all other smartwatches to date. Apple Watch sales are slowing dramatically, however, plunging 55% in Q1 this year, no doubt putting pressure on the company to release a big update. Speaking of updates, Apple is also expected to unveil a new iPhone this fall, allegedly dubbed the iPhone 7. The watch and phone will likely be announced at the same Apple event in September or October. Apple shares were mostly flat in Monday morning trading at $107.53. AAPL has gained 2.12% year-to-date, trailing the performance of the S&P 500, which rose 7% in the same period.

While we already have a pretty good idea of what to expect, a new report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman -- who has an extremely good track record for scoops and news on upcoming Apple products -- lends more weight to those rumors and brings some extra bits of information to the table. Gurman says the new iPhones will have a pressure-sensitive button that provides feedback to the user via a vibrating haptic sensation rather than a true physical click, similar to the MacBook's Force Touch trackpad. It’s unclear if this is meant to provide new functionality, or simply serve to save some space under the hood. The report reaffirms rumors we’ve heard many times before, like the 5.5-inch “Plus” model having a new dual-lens camera system that will produce better photos. The two sensors will capture two images independently then merge them into one to get higher quality images, especially in lower light conditions, and allow greater clarity when zooming in. Gurman also says this year’s models will look similar to the 6 and 6S, holding back on a major redesign until next year, when the iPhone celebrates its 10th birthday. The only noticeable change aside from subtler antenna lines is the lack of a headphone jack, opting for connectivity via Bluetooth and the charging port instead. Apple Watch rumors are also doing the rounds this morning. According to a separate report by AppleInsider, based on an investor note by KGI Securities' Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is planning two new models of the Watch which would arrive later this year. One of them will reportedly be a minor update to the current model, with a better processor and improved waterproofing -- sort of an ’s’ upgrade for the device. The second model, dubbed "Apple Watch 2" for now, will reportedly get GPS and a barometer, which will allow it to pinpoint more accurately your location. Apple will reportedly adopt thinner display technology for the Apple Watch 2, but will retain the same screen sizes and thickness as existing models, with a similar form factor overall, due to the use of a slightly larger battery. Kuo does not expect cellular connectivity on the Apple Watch until at least 2017 despite some rumors suggesting otherwise. We’re taking the Apple Watch rumors with a grain of salt, but if two new models are indeed planned for 2016, they might be unveiled alongside the new iPhones next month.

(Photo: File photo by Paul Sakuma, AP) SAN FRANCISCO — Several months before the holiday season, it's already shopping season in Silicon Valley. Merger mania is all the rage in tech, where it's beginning to feel like the late 1990s and early 2000 bust era all over again. But this time there's a notable difference that speaks to the fundamental value being created in this second dot-com boom. Companies are being scooped up for billions instead of being shuttered. A confluence of factors are contributing to the buying spree: A shift in tech to cloud-based computing has forced large companies such as Oracle and IBM to shore up product gaps. And a slew of start-ups, concerned about consolidation amid dwindling market values, are pursuing an exit strategy via acquisition. In the latest purchase, Walmart on Monday inked a $3.3 billion deal to buy online discount retailer Jet.com. USA TODAY Why Walmart is spending $3 billion for Jet.com Meanwhile, Apple last week said it had agreed to buy Turi, a machine-learning and artificial intelligence start-up, for an undisclosed sum. Uber agreed to sell its Chinese business unit to Didi, the leading ride-hailing service in China, and Oracle is looking to buy NetSuite for $9.3 billion. Other big deals include Verizon scooping up the core Internet assets of Yahoo for $4.8 billion, Salesforce.com inking a deal to pick up Quip, a maker of word-processing tools, for $582 million, and Microsoft snapping up professional networking site LinkedIn for a mammoth $26.2 billion. And late last week, whispers of Twitter-for-sale rumors resurfaced, as did a report in The Wall Street Journalthat cloud-computing company Rackspace Hosting is nearing a sale to a private-equity firm. Rackspace was not immediately available for comment. USA TODAY Oracle builds its cloud fortress with $9.3B NetSuite deal The flurry of deals isn't expected to end anytime soon. M&A activity perked up in early 2015 and reached a record $262.5 billion in the last three months of that year, according to Dealogic. Despite a dip in early 2016, the momentum continued in the second quarter, with $183.8 billion in deals, and nearly $90 billion in the third quarter. "We look for great talent and intellectual property, and we have been buying companies every three to four weeks and continue to do that," Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a call with analysts following Apple's third-quarter results in late July. Microsoft's recent bid for LinkedIn is just one of many pricey acquisitions unfolding in the tech space as companies look to grow by buying companies that provide them with needed expertise.  (Photo: Ritchie B. Tongo, EPA) Apple bought smaller companies specializing in artificial intelligence, augmented reality and speech recognition before it invested $1 billion int Didi. David Drummond, corporate development chief for Alphabet, Google’s parent company, told The Wall Street Journal in June that Alphabet may re-enter the acquisition fray after more than a year of inactivity as start-up valuations return to Earth. USA TODAY It's time for Twitter to sell: analysis The M&A boom has benefited buyers and sellers, a trend that should continue into 2017, says Shama Hyder, an angel investor based in Dallas. For sellers, whose valuations softened with a dip in venture funding, an acquisition offers an exit strategy absent of an initial public offering. For buyers, the addition of a start-up specializing in the cloud or machine learning allows them to quickly reinvent themselves and stay competitive in emerging markets. "Sometimes, the only way to catch up is to buy companies," says Charles Phillips, the former Oracle president who is CEO of Infor, a business-software company with revenue of more than $2.8 billion. "It's easier to spend cash than develop software." Consolidation is also driving M&A activity: There are simply too many companies is some market segments. “There will be a thinning-out in crowded segments” such as food delivery, health care and machine learning, says Nat Turner, CEO of Flatiron Health, a Google Ventures-backed start-up that has raised $330 million in funding. Start-ups in machine learning are particularly well positioned, Turner says, with potential buyers such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook. In early July, Google said it had agreed to buy Moodstocks, a French machine learning start-up. A LARGER IMPACT ON UNICORNS The high-stakes digital window shopping might also be fueled by the state of unicorns, private companies valued at $1 billion or more.  As values for such companies wane in a less-heated market, and a small percentage of them go public, more of them may be open to acquisitions, investors and tech analysts say. Unicorns increasingly face the possibility of becoming a rare species in Silicon Valley, where they once thrived. In the second quarter of this year, seven unicorns were created — compared with 25 in the same quarter a year ago, according to data from KPMG and Venture Pulse. One-time Internet pioneer Yahoo was recently the focus of a bidding war for its core assets, which were scooped up by AOL owner Verizon.  (Photo: Yahoo) The current quarter is “make or break” for unicorns in need of funding, says Paul Martino, a venture capitalist at Bullpen Capital, an investor in Marketo, SpotHero and others. “Many of these start-ups are in the crucial post-seed growth period. Without it, they either cut back operations or they fail,” he says. Time seems to be of the essence as companies are snapped up by suitors in and out of the tech world. Late last year, Raycom Media acquired PureCars, a leading digital-advertising platform for the auto industry, for $125 million in the broadcasting group's first "pure tech" acquisition and largest non-broadcast purchase in its 20-year history. "We were not on the market when Raycom called," says Jeremy Anspach, co-founder and CEO of PureCars. "It all happened so quickly." But, Anspach says, given the fast pace of tech deals lately, such inquiries increasingly are "ticking in the back of founders' minds now."

 One of Apple's biggest weaknesses is becoming a strength Kif Leswing Aug. 8, 2016, 10:14 AM 7,559 facebook linkedin twitter email print Andy Hertzfeld Apple, famous as the computing company that likes to "think different," is going corporate.  In fact, nearly half of all iPads are bought by corporations and governments, according to a Forrester estimate included in a feature about Apple's enterprise strength.  Since teaming up with IBM  in 2014 to sell iPhones and iPads to big Fortune 500 companies, Apple's products have become the "preferred mobile computing devices for corporations," reports the Times. Companies like British Airways deploy as many as 40 custom iPad apps for flight attendants, pilots, and airline workers. These apps allow the airline to, say, rebook a passenger or check a passenger manifest. British Airways has already bought 17,000 iPads for its workers and is looking to buy more.  Many enterprise apps are developed by IBM, which has created 100 enterprise apps for over 2000 companies, and now generates more than half a billion dollars from Apple-related services. IBM has made apps for insurance companies, retailers, and other specific industries. One of the reasons why businesses have decided to embrace iPhones and iPads is that Apple's security is superior to Android's, thanks to the way Apple controls both the hardware and software.  It's quite a turnaround for Apple, which is seeking new sources of revenue as sales have dropped on an annual basis for the past two quarters. Apple's always sold computers to businesses, but while CEO Steve Jobs was in charge from 1998 to 2011, the company was significantly more focused on consumers. Aside from the famous photo of Jobs flipping off the IBM logo, there's one fun anecdote that hammers the change home. Back in 2008, Jobs called chief information officers, the people who buy computers for big businesses, "orifices," according to a story told by VMWare CEO Patrick Gelsinger: “I went with (former Intel CEO Paul) Otellini to meet with Jobs and his lieutenants. We go into this meeting and say Steve, let’s work together to make your Macs better for enterprise customers. Jobs looks at us and says ‘why would I do anything for that orifice called the CIO?’ At Intel we’re aghast; two-thirds of our business is that orifice called the CIO. He went on to say ‘I’m going to build devices that are irresistible for consumers, and CIOs will just have to deal with it.”   NOW WATCH: Here's why some people have a tiny hole above their ears Loading video...

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 9:45 PM, August 8, 2016 Updated: 1:42 AM, August 9, 2016 SAN FRANCISCO — Apple is preparing to unveil successors to the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus as early as next month with more advanced photography capabilities and upgraded hardware in a design similar to that of last year’s models, according to people familiar with the matter. The standout features will be a dual-camera system on the larger iPhone, a re-engineered home button that responds to pressure with haptic feedback and the removal of the devices’ headphone jack, said the people, who didn’t want to be identified discussing unannounced features. Apple declined to comment. While iPhone demand has waned in recent quarters, partly due to the lull between product launches, the device continues to be the major source of Apple’s revenue. The new models will be critical to the holiday quarter, and Apple is counting on the phones to prop up sales ahead of an expected iPhone overhaul in 2017, the device’s 10th anniversary. Moving away from the typical two-year iPhone redesign cycle, this year’s models will look similar to the 6 and 6S, the people said, who added that there will still be noticeable tweaks. The new iPhones will retain the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes as their predecessors, the first of which was introduced in September 2014. Apple will remove the two innermost antenna lines that run across the back of the current iPhones, the people added. SHARPER PHOTOS The dual cameras on the larger new iPhone will produce brighter photos with more detail, according to a person who has used a prototype version of the upcoming device. Both sensors, which each capture colour differently, simultaneously take a picture, and the device produces a single, merged photograph, said the person. The dual system sharpens photos taken in low-light environments, the person said. The combination of the merged photos from the two camera sensors also allows users to zoom while retaining more clarity, the person added. The smaller version of the new phones will not include dual lenses, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier this year. HOME BUTTON Apple is planning an updated home button for the new models. Current home buttons are switches that physically press into the phone, but the new models will have a pressure-sensitive button that provides feedback to the user via a vibrating haptic sensation rather than a true physical click, according to the people. This mechanism is similar to that of the trackpads on the latest MacBook line. 9to5Mac reported on the home button design earlier. The new iPhones will remove the headphone jack in favour of connectivity via Bluetooth and the charging port. That will make room for a second speaker, said the people. Apple started allowing headphone makers to build headphones that can connect via the iPhone’s charger connector in 2014, the same year the company acquired headphone maker Beats Electronics. Macotakara earlier reported the headphone jack’s demise. The new models will run iOS 10, the new version of Apple’s mobile operating system coming this fall. The updated software offers interactive widgets to quickly glance at calendar appointments and favourite contacts, new messaging features, a new application for controlling smart home appliances, and a redesigned Apple Music. The new software will also run on current and some past iPhone models.

Cosmos Rings for Apple Watch puts a slick role-playing quest on your wrist The Final Fantasy maker's exclusive new game plays to the Watch's strengths. Andrew Hayward (Macworld.com) on 08 August, 2016 22:00 0 - - - - print email The Apple Watch hasn’t yet become the wearable gaming sensation that some hoped for, with an irregular stream of interesting games and little spotlight from Apple itself. Games like Lifeline and Runeblade have shown that there’s potential to create compelling experiences around the Watch, but for the most part, larger publishers haven’t taken much interest. However, that might be changing. In July, Square Enix—the storied publisher behind the legendary Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest role-playing series—released Cosmos Rings, its first-ever Apple Watch exclusive. True to the publisher’s legacy, Cosmos Rings is a role-playing adventure, but it’s one that is tuned to the strengths and limitations of the Apple Watch: it’s simplistic and playable in tiny bursts… or you can just let it play itself most of the time. Glance over for a quick burst of action during the day with Cosmos Rings. It’s also nicely polished and presented, although the premium price point ($6 now; $9 once August ends) might surprise some mobile gaming fans. Cosmos Rings has been rocking my wrist since it lunched, and I’ve been pulled into its progressive grind more so than with any other Apple Watch game to date. Here’s why it’s worth a look for wrist-based gaming fans—and a positive sign for the future. Cosmos from Chaos Cosmos Rings is apparently spun off from the Chaos Rings series, which was Square Enix’s first major attempt to create original RPGs for iOS devices. Luckily, you don’t need to be familiar with the four previous games in that series, which is smart, since the first three aren’t even on the App Store anymore—only Chaos Rings III remains. So much for franchise-building! Your iPhone sets up the story, in which a fateful argument shapes the adventure. While the game is played entirely on the Apple Watch, you’ll need your iPhone for a few minutes to kick off the storyline. The God and Goddess of Time oversee the passage of time across the universe, but disagree over whether they should ever intervene to help humans in peril. When the God ultimately does stop time, the Goddess shatters into pieces that fall into the Rift, which the God of Time must then explore to bring back his beloved. From there, you’ll swap over to the wrist and guide the God of Time through battles as he tries to restore the movement of time and recover the shards. This takes place over the course of several in-game days, each with 12 “hours” worth of monsters to slay. Cosmos Rings takes its cues from roguelike games such as FTL: Faster Than Light and The Binding of Isaac, in which your character can die permanently and you’ll be forced to start over again. Sounds rough, right? The upside is that you gradually get stronger and earn new abilities, which enhance and empower each subsequent run. It’s a hardcore genre made pleasingly straightforward in Cosmos Rings. In fact, the game can play on its own most of the time without your interaction or even oversight: The God of Time will swing his sword every few seconds, clear through the monsters in each area, and then face a tough Reaper of Time boss at the end of each in-game hour. You will need the Watch screen on for those bosses and during the last three minutes of each play attempt, but otherwise there’s gradual progress being made while you’re in a meeting or taking a nap. That’s handy. The bright-on-black aesthetic looks great on the little OLED display. At the start, each campaign lasts for 30 minutes of real time—once the timer ticks down, the God of Time falls and his quest begins anew at the start. However, you’ll earn experience points all the while, which can be used to enhance your sword’s power, permanently buy more minutes for your timer, or even add special abilities that can be chained together with powerful results. Over time, these little upgrades help you push further and further with each new attempt, unlocking more of the game. And if you actually pay the game a small amount of attention, rather than just letting it exist on your wrist, then the rewards and progress are significantly amplified. Wrist warrior To be honest, I didn’t even realize there was an active component at first—Cosmos Rings’ concise instructions on the Watch aren’t always super clear, nor are they complete. You can find out plenty more via the Help section on the iPhone app, but in the moment, I figured the extent of my active tinkering was simply picking the right upgrades and abilities over time and starting new adventures as needed. Not true! In battle, you can tap the screen to bring up your skill relics, which recharge and rotate into view when available—and tapping each one adds, for instances, a massive power boost to your next attack. Keep tapping these skills in succession and you’ll create even more damaging chain attacks, which help you clear through monsters at a much faster clip. Choosing upgrades, reading story snippets, and turning back time are also part of the Cosmos Rings equation. Better yet, you can unlock additional skill slots to extend your chains, which ultimately makes active play even more rewarding over time. But it also becomes more necessary, it seems, otherwise the higher-level enemies will take ages to defeat if you’re just watching rather than actually interacting. It’s an interesting approach that not only eases you into the game’s mechanics, but also quickly shows you the benefits of playing your moment-to-moment role. It’s not the only active perk, either, as you can also rewind time to effectively reset the clock. Rolling back the digital crown lets you go back to the start of the current “hour” or back to any previous one, thus adding a big block of time in the process. It’s almost too beneficial, in my initial testing: You can do it multiple times in a single adventure, and as far as I can tell, there’s no drawback to using the game-extending feature. In fact, the Help guide in the iPhone app suggests you’ll find hidden relics and items via time travel! It’s like a massive reward for being mindful of the game, as opposed to just letting it play out on its own. Ringing endorsement? Still, I like the choice provided by Cosmos Rings: You’ll still make slow and steady progress simply by checking in a few times during the day, or you can spend a couple minutes really playing it and significantly enhance the rewards. It’s an ideal fit for your Watch, then, as it’s always there running in the background, and you need only the main screen and a couple of menus to get the full experience. Even little story nuggets pop up as you explore new hours and days in the game, although the ever-upward grind really is the core of the experience. Cosmos Rings’ time-centric premise and gameplay elements are certainly a thematically appropriate fit for the Apple Watch. Cosmos Rings does have a couple of the common issues of Apple Watch games, even if it runs natively on the device. It’s sluggish to respond at times, both to taps and spins of the digital crown, and can take several seconds to refresh its status when you fire it up after not paying attention for a while. And having to keep the screen on during those new Reaper battles or during the last three minutes of your run can be a bit irritating. On the other hand, Square Enix’s first Apple Watch exclusive is attractive, and it’s a new benchmark for what’s possible on the tiny screen. It uses detailed pixel art, but rather than spotlight retro-fantasy heroes (like in many Square Enix classics), the graphics showcase futuristic, neon-heavy battles that dazzle on the wrist. Add in occasional artwork stills for the story segments and it’s surely the most impressive-looking game available on Apple Watch. But it’s also $6 to $9, which will probably shock some prospective players. That’s a reasonable price to pay for a game you might enjoy over the course of several months, but if you grab it expecting a more expansive experience for the money, then you may feel shortchanged. The free Runeblade hits some similar notes, in terms of furthering a light role-playing quest through small interactions and gradual improvement over time, but I’ve found Cosmos Rings to be a more engaging effort. You’ll pay a premium cost, but this is also a premium game built for the wrist. It’s an uncommon find in the App Store of late: A noteworthy, original game designed for the Apple Watch, plus it’s from one of the biggest publishers in the industry. Cosmos Rings is oddly alluring in its wearable design, plus it’s an encouraging sign: A hint that maybe more studios are seeing the Watch as a platform worthy of development and experimentation. Hopefully Cosmos Rings finds enough of an audience to warrant that initiative.

Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

Rubenking, Max Eddy August 8, 2016 10 Comments Yes, Apple's Ivan Krstic announced a new bug bounty program at Black Hat. But before that he explained several components of iOS security in unprecedented detail. You've heard by now that Apple announced a new bug bounty program at the recent Black Hat conference. In an unusual appearance, Ivan Krstic, Apple's head of security engineering and architecture, made the announcement himself. But that was just the last 10 minutes of a 50-minute presentation. For The first 40 minutes, Krstic took an unprecedented deep dive into three components of iOS security. And by deep, I mean bathyspheric. My overall takeaway was a sense of awe at how thoroughly these systems protect user data, even from Apple itself. I'll try to convey what was said, without getting too technical. Hardened WebKit JIT Mapping Sorry, that's what it's called. JIT stands for Just In Time, and refers to the way Javascript code is compiled just in time for its execution. "This is necessary for high-performance JavaScript," explained Krstic. "But the code-signing policy has to be relaxed. The JIT compiler emits new, unsigned code. An attacker who managed a write-anywhere attack could enable execution of arbitrary code." For a little background, areas of memory can be marked with read, write, and execute permissions. That distinction, introduced ages ago, snuffed out attacks that executed code in areas devoted to data. Briefly, Apple's solution involves a technique putting the compiled JavaScript into a memory area that permits only execution. Processes can't read what's there or write new data. There's a bit more to it than that, but this change, specific to iOS 10, wipes out a whole range of possible attacks. Secure Enclave Processor Applications on an Apple device run in a CPU called the Application Processor, or AP. Modern Apple devices have an entirely separate CPU called the Secure Enclave Processor, or SEP. "The SEP is protected by a strong cryptographic master key from the user's passcode," said Krstic. "Offline attack is not possible. It sidesteps the attack surface of the AP, even when the AP has been compromised. It arbitrates all user access and manages its own encrypted memory. On first initialization it uses a true random number generator to create a unique device key within the processor. It's not exportable, and it's stored in immutable secure ROM." Krstic went on to explain how the device uses four types of internal security keys with different characteristics. Type A exists only when the device is unlocked. Type B is an always-present public key, plus a private key that exists when the device is unlocked. Type C comes into existence the first time the device is unlocked after boot. And type D is always available. The presentation moved on to a number of seriously intricate diagrams. One walked through the process of booting and unlocking the device, showing how each key type was created and stored. Every file on your device has its own, unique encryption key; another diagram showed the intricate dance that lets the SEP authenticate and decrypt that file while keeping the essential security keys inside itself. Another explained the complex process that makes it possible for you to choose "Update later." And yet another walked through the process that permits unlocking via touch ID without keeping the master key visible in any way. The key takeaway from this part of the talk is that Apple has really, really thought through what's required to manage encryption completely inside the Secure Enclave Processor, without forcing the user to go to much trouble at all. If you'd like to see those diagrams for yourself, check out the Krstic's full presentation. Synchronizing Secrets It's awfully convenient that you can sync your data between multiple Apple devices. HomeKit lets you manage IoT devices, AutoUnlock makes your Mac unlock when your Apple Watch is nearby, your photos sync through iCloud, and so on. But security-wise, syncing is a problem. "Traditional approaches are not good," said Krstic. "One way is to make the user enter a strong 'sock drawer key' on all devices; lose it, and access to the secrets is lost. The other way is to wrap the data in a derived key that leaves the data exposed to the account provider." "We had a number of goals here," continued Krstic. "Secrets must be available all devices, protected by strong crypto. Users can recover secrets even if they lose all connected devices. Data is not exposed to Apple, and there's no possibility of a brute-force attack." Authentication in the basic iCloud Keychain system is simple. Every device has its own key pair, and in order to add a new device to the sync circle, you must approve it from one of your existing device. Apple's backend is not involved; it has no privilege. If a user loses access to all devices, access can be regained using both the iCloud Security Key and the iCloud password. Krstic explained in great detail how Apple manages this system without leaving open the slightest possibility that anyone, including anyone at Apple, could access data from the back end. The system involves what are called admin cards, created at the time a new fleet of crypto servers is commissioned. "Admin cards are created in a secure ceremony when the fleet is commissioned, and stored in separate physical safes in custody of three different organizations at Apple, in tamper-proof evidence bags," said Krstic. That situation lasts only until the fleet is actually put into operation. At that time, said Krstic, "We put the admin cards through a novel one-way hash function." Pulling a clearly-used blender from under the podium, he continued, "Yes, a trip through the blender." Once the fleet of crypto servers is active, it can't be updated or modified in any way, not even by Apple, because the admin cards have been destroyed. If it happens that an update really is required, Apple must spin up a new fleet and send out a software update that makes user devices connect to the new fleet. "Why do we do this," said Krstic. "Why do we take this last step that's extremely unusual? We go to great lengths to engineer the security systems to provide trust. When data leaves the device, the stakes are even higher. We need to maintain that trust. If we keep possession of those admin cards, there's the possibility that's not true. That's how seriously we take our mission about user data." Asked, "Did you do this because of the FBI requests for information?" Krstic replied, "I'm an engineer. I can only answer questions about why I presented today." OK, fair enough. But I think the questioner was right. Making a self-contained system that you can't even modify yourself is a pretty good way to keep someone else from making unwanted changes. I hope I've conveyed the level of detail in Krstic's talk without making your eyes glaze over. Judging by the chatter as the group dispersed, the true byte-level security geeks in the room were highly impressed. Back to top Previous : Having a One-Network Stand in a Short-Term Rental?

However, along with the anticipation for the smartphones is the incessant rumors and speculations about their specs and features. The latest word from the grapevine claims that the Cupertino giant has modified the home button of the iPhone 7 devices to mimic the functionality of the latest MacBooks’ trackpad technology. The new home button is reportedly designed to be flush with the surface of the iPhone 7, but it is going to be capacitive, which according to famous Apple leakster Mark Gurman translates to a button that gives off vibrating haptic sensation on every touch, The Verge reported. The latest rumors about the upcoming iPhone 7 point at a redesigned home button. Getty Images/YOSHIKAZU TSUNO/AFP This is not the first time that this type of rumor about the iPhone 7’s home button surfaced. Back in June, Forbes picked up an online rumor claiming that Apple will be upgrading the home button by making it more sensitive to touch. Another key feature that Apple is said to be modifying for its upcoming iPhone iteration is the phone speaker. Instead of just retaining the single speaker found in the device’s predecessors, the company has reportedly added a second speaker to improve the overall quality and volume of the handset’s sound system. In addition, Apple has reportedly made the drastic decision to ditch the universal 3.5mm headphone jack from its new devices to strongly implement the use of Bluetooth connectivity, Lightning EarPods or other peripherals that can be connected to the device’s dongle, Engadget reported. Other rumored specs and features of the new iPhone 7 devices include IP68-certified waterproofing and wireless charging via Smart Connectors. There is also the addition of a dark blue color variant in the upcoming line of iPhone devices, according to PC Advisor. Finally, the most famous rumor about the iPhone 7 claims that the iPhone 7 Pro version will be sporting a dual-lens camera system that was designed to take superior quality photos. Apple has yet to confirm any of the rumors. Everyone  might just have to wait for the official launch in September to know the latest upgrades. Leakster Evan Blass claims that the launch date would be on Sept. 7, the start of pre-orders on Sept. 9, while the iOS handsets’ official release date on Sept. 16.

A new video recorded in 4K reinforces one of the early iPhone 7 rumors, and you might not necessarily like it. DON’T MISS: Inside story explains how Warner ruined ‘Suicide Squad’ The first iPhone 7 reports said that Apple was working on three distinct iPhone handsets for this year: one 4.7-inch iPhone 7 model, and two 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus and Pro models. The difference between the phablets concerns the rear camera. The Plus version supposedly comes with the same camera that’s found on the iPhone 7, while the Pro would have a dual lens rear shooter. The Plus would likely be the most expensive option. This video leak shows exactly this particular iPhone 7 setup. We’ve got a gold iPhone 7, a gray iPhone 7 Pro and a pink iPhone 7 Plus. The design elements we expect appear to all be there. We’re looking at redesigned cameras that are still protruding, but lack the camera ring seen on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6, redesigned antenna lines, and dual speakers on the bottom (that’s right, there’s no headphone jack on either model). Curiously absent is the three-dot Smart Connector port that the 5.5-inch iPhone should offer, a feature that’s also contested by certain reports. The video was posted online by Dutch site TechTastic, which picked it up from a YouTube account that seems to be linked to a Japanese iPhone reservation store. More recent reports indicated that Apple would have enough dual lens camera supply to equip all 5.5-inch iPhone 7 versions, which is why this new leak is puzzling. Sure, we may be looking at genuine iPhone 7 parts, but these might be earlier design mockups. The good news is that we have just a few more weeks of waiting until we find out the truth about Apple’s iPhone 7 plans. The company will unveil the iPhone 7 during a special media event in early September, and launch it in the weeks following it.

 The next Apple Watch may be just as chunky as the current one Rob Price Aug. 8, 2016, 6:25 AM 5,335 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook announces the Apple Watch during an Apple special event at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on March 9, 2015 in San Francisco, California. Stephen Lam/Getty Images If you're hoping for a slimmed down Apple Watch in 2016, don't hold your breath. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reportedly believes that the next wearable from the Cupertino hardware company will be just as chunky as the original device. The original Apple Watch launched more than a year ago, back in April 2015. It's pretty comprehensively dominating the wearable market, but it isn't exactly setting the world on fire. Smartwatches remain a niche market, and Apple doesn't break out sales figures — a sign they're not spectacular. (One analyst believes they dropped 40% from Apple's Q1 to Q2 this year.) Ming-Chi Kuo, who works for KGI Securities, is one of the most reliable Apple analysts in the business, with sources inside the company's Asian supply chain. Apple blog AppleInsider has got a hold of a research note for investors, in which the analyst lays out what he thinks will change in the next Apple Watch. For a start, there's reportedly going to be two of them: A slightly improved version of the original device, and a more overhauled "Apple Watch 2," which will include a GPS and barometer for the first time — improving its location services. However, it will look largely the same as the original bulbous, 10mm thick Apple Watch, Ming-Chi Kuo believes. Apple has apparently decided against making it slimmer (as it often does with the iPhone), and is improving the battery life instead. Battery life has been a major bugbear for users of the Apple Watch, with apps restricted to save battery and charging required every night. Any improvement in that area will be welcome — even if it means the device won't be getting more discreet. NOW WATCH: This hidden iPhone feature will boost your reception Loading video...

VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY Notoriously tight-lipped about its products, Apple remains mum about a second-gen Apple Watch. But KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has high hopes for a product launch in the second half of 2016. According to MacRumors, Kuo on Sunday issued a research to investors stating that the so-called Apple Watch 2 will feature a faster processor, GPS, barometer, better waterproofing, and a higher capacity battery. Once-rumored LTE connectivity, however, is not expected until 2017, the analyst said. Internal upgrades, meanwhile, are unlikely to reflect the overall design. Despite utilizing thinner display technology, the next wearable will remain the same in terms of screen size and thickness, Kuo suggested. Kuo did not immediately respond to PCMag's request for comment. VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY The Apple Watch 2 rumor mill has been churning for more than a year: Just two months after the smartwatch hit shelves in 2015, reports tipped a second-generation version with a video camera for FaceTime and Wi-Fi chip—neither of which were mentioned in Kuo's report. By August 2015, Cupertino was crowned the No. 2 wearable vendor in the world, behind Fitbit. While iFans await the next Apple Watch iteration, Cupertino continues to push updates to current models. WatchOS 3 is slated to arrive this fall, boasting speedier app load times thanks to a new "dock," which can instantly launch built-in and third-party programs. //Related Articles Living With an Apple Watch Other UI tweaks include the ability to swipe up from the bottom to view the Control Center, the new Scribble feature that translates drawn letters into text, and more customization. The smartwatch is becoming increasingly popular among consumers, according to a recent NPD Group report. Though health-conscious fitness trackers still lead the pack, accounting for more than double the smartwatch base, the gap is narrowing.

"The Anti-Monopoly Service sees signs of price fixing violations in the Russian Federation at Apple iPhone resellers, which resulted in the same prices for these smartphones," it said in a statement. A representative for Apple in Russia was not immediately available for comment. The anti-monopoly body said it had opened its case after an appeal from a citizen with information that identical prices had been set for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models, which appeared in Russia in October 2015, at 16 major resellers. It said that an investigation had showed that resellers had set identical prices and kept them at that level for a certain time period, including for other models. MTS, one of the resellers mentioned in the anti-monopoly service's statement, declined a request for comment. Euroset, another firm mentioned, denied it had coordinated prices with anyone.

(AAPL): 2 Trades for Apple Stock’s Bull Charge Sentiment says the AAPL stock rally isn't over quite yet By Joseph Hargett, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Aug 8, 2016, 9:23 am EST     Popular Posts: Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Monday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) 2 Post-Trump Trades for Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Earnings Recent Posts: Wednesday’s Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and AT&T Inc. (T) 2 Ways to Collect on Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Tuesday’s Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), GoPro Inc (GPRO) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) View All Posts Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), still riding the post-earnings wave, looks poised to reclaim old territory north of $110. Formerly bearish-leaning analysts on Wall Street have come around, and technical developments thanks to a continued rise in AAPL stock have bolstered the sentiment backdrop for Apple considerably. Click to Enlarge But speculative options traders aren’t buying into the rally just yet. Technically speaking, Apple stock has been in rebound mode for the past month. Shares are up more than 12% since the beginning of July, drawing AAPL’s 10-day and 200-day moving averages into a bullish cross. Shares gapped north of psychological resistance at $100 immediately following earnings, and follow-through buying has pushed AAPL stock north of technical resistance at $105. Furthermore, Apple’s rally into the weekend pushed the shares north of significant call open interest accumulations at the $106 and $107 strikes, leaving little in the way of overhead hurdles until Apple stock hits $110. Turning to the sentiment backdrop, despite moaning about Apple Watch and iPhone sales, Wall Street analysts remain extremely bullish on the shares. In fact, Zacks data indicates that 28 of the 32 analysts following AAPL stock rate it a “buy” or better, with only two “sell” ratings to be found. 7 Consumer Stocks You Should Be Watching That said, there is room for improvement, as the 12-month consensus price target of $124.06 represents a modest 15.4% premium to AAPL’s close on Friday. Outside of Wall Street, options traders have grown downright bearish over the short-term.  While the August/September put/call open interest ratio for Apple stock comes in at an unusually high 0.85, the August ratio has ballooned to a perch of 1.49, with puts easily outnumbering calls among options set to expire this month. As for August implieds, the monthly Aug. 19 series is pricing in a roughly 3% move for Apple stock during the next month. This places the upper bound at about $109.89, while the lower bound lies at $104.11. AAPL stock has mounting technical support near $105, while resistance lies overhead at $110. 2 Trades for AAPL Stock AAPL Call Spread: If you’re looking to buck the trend in the options pits and join the bullish contingent in the brokerage community, then a Sept $110/$115 bull call spread has potential. At last check, this spread was offered at $1.15, or $115 per pair of contracts.  Breakeven lies at $111.15, while a maximum profit of $3.85, or $385 per pair of contracts, is possible if AAPL trades at or above $115 when September options expire. AAPL Put Sell: If you’re still not sold on the AAPL recovery, then a September $100 put could fit a neutral-to-bullish stance. At last check, this contract was bid at 57 cents, or $57 per contract. The upside to this put sell strategy is that you keep the premium as long as Apple stock closes above $100 when September options expire. The downside is that should AAPL stock trade below $100 ahead of expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $100 per share. As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

"Apple is stronger in the enterprise market with its devices than it is with consumers," says Forrester analyst Frank Gillet, in a statement to the Times. The boost from businesses and governments would have seemed highly unlikely six years ago when the iPad was originally launched, but Apple has been keen to woo businesses over to its mobile tablet in recent years. Apple teamed up with IBM to launch a range of business-focused iOS apps back in December 2014, and the company has also been working with Cisco and SAP to ensure iPads work well in enterprises. Apple even teamed up with Microsoft to make the iPad Pro a success. During the tablet's launch, Microsoft's Office chief, Kirk Koenigsbauer, jumped on stage to demonstrate Office for iPad Pro. Microsoft has consistently tweaked its Office software for the iPad Pro ever since to make it more powerful, and the productivity suite even features in Apple's latest iPad Pro commercial. Apple wants everyone to believe that the iPad Pro is a real computer capable of real work, and it's clear that businesses are adopting it that way for their mobile computing needs. Apple's success in the enterprise is unusual Apple's fresh success in the enterprise is unusual for the company. Microsoft has typically dominated desktop computing inside businesses, and Steve Jobs always focused Apple on building products that consumers would love. Jobs even called IBM's best customers an "orifice," and famously gave IBM the finger in a classic photo during the ‘80s era when Apple competed aggressively with IBM. Apple even aired a commercial depicting IBM as Big Brother from the George Orwell novel. Apple has an advantage over both Android and Windows for tablets in the enterprise. Google's Android security is often seen as inferior to iOS, and Windows has lacked touch-based apps to take advantage of a true mobile tablet mode. Under Tim Cook, Apple will now attempt to balance how it sells the iPad as the future of computing to both consumers and businesses. It's a delicate balance that will shape exactly what form factor the iPad evolves into in the future. Apple built the iPad Pro to replace Windows, and now it has to prove it truly can.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple is reportedly gearing up to announce and launch the iPhone 7 next month, something that shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone who has been following the iPhone 7 or, indeed, Apple. According to Bloomberg, where Mark Gurman is now covering Apple (you may have remembered his byline from 9to5Mac), the new iPhones will indeed support a redesigned home button with haptic functionality. That suggests it won’t have the physical “click” most people are used to, and will rather rely, we presume, on magnets to produce a digital “click.” That would be similar to the technology employed in the MacBook and MacBook Pro, and it could enable Apple to add additional functionality to the home button (think long press, for example). Bloomberg also said that Apple is indeed sticking to a “design similar to that of last year’s models,” which suggests yet again that we won’t get huge update in the industrial design department. The report adds that Apple is including “advanced photography capabilities” to the larger iPhone, presumably the iPhone 7 Plus, which probably means we’ll see the dual lens camera system make its debut. The modules are said to allow for “brighter photos” and will “sharpen photos taken in low-light conditions.” Apple is once again said to ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack, and screen sizes are said to remain at 4.7 inches and 5.5-inches. The report did not provide a date for Apple’s event, but Apple typically begins selling its new iPhones right around the middle of September.

A man uses his iPhone at an Apple store in Brooklyn, N.Y. Successors to the 6 and 6S could be unveiled as early as next month.  (ANDREW KELLY / REUTERS)   By Mark GurmanBloomberg Mon., Aug. 8, 2016 Apple is preparing to unveil successors to the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus as early as next month with more advanced photography capabilities and upgraded hardware in a design similar to that of last year’s models, according to people familiar with the matter. The standout features will be a dual-camera system on the larger iPhone, a re-engineered home button that responds to pressure with haptic feedback and the removal of the devices’ headphone jack, said the people, who didn’t want to be identified discussing unannounced features. Apple declined to comment. While iPhone demand has waned in recent quarters, partly due to the lull between product launches, the device continues to be the major source of Apple’s revenue. The new models will be critical to the holiday quarter, and Apple is counting on the phones to prop up sales ahead of an expected iPhone overhaul in 2017, the device’s 10th anniversary. Moving away from the typical two-year iPhone redesign cycle, this year’s models will look similar to the 6 and 6S, the people said, who added that there will still be noticeable tweaks. The new iPhones will retain the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes as their predecessors, the first of which was introduced in September 2014. Apple will remove the two innermost antenna lines that run across the back of the current iPhones, the people added. The dual cameras on the larger new iPhone will produce brighter photos with more detail, according to a person who has used a prototype version of the upcoming device. Both sensors, which each capture colour differently, simultaneously take a picture, and the device produces a single, merged photograph, said the person. Article Continued Below The dual system sharpens photos taken in low-light environments, the person said. The combination of the merged photos from the two camera sensors also allows users to zoom while retaining more clarity, the person added. The smaller version of the new phones will not include dual lenses, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier this year. Apple is planning an updated home button for the new models. Current home buttons are switches that physically press into the phone, but the new models will have a pressure-sensitive button that provides feedback to the user via a vibrating haptic sensation rather than a true physical click, according to the people. This mechanism is similar to that of the trackpads on the latest MacBook line. The new iPhones will remove the headphone jack in favour of connectivity via Bluetooth and the charging port. That will make room for a second speaker, said the people. Apple started allowing headphone makers to build headphones that can connect via the iPhone’s charger connector in 2014, the same year the company acquired headphone maker Beats Electronics. The new models will run iOS 10, the new version of Apple’s mobile operating system coming this fall. The updated software offers interactive widgets to quickly glance at calendar appointments and favourite contacts, new messaging features, a new application for controlling smart home appliances, and a redesigned Apple Music. The new software will also run on current and some past iPhone models. Read more about: Apple The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

REUTERS/Maxim ShemetovMore MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Federal Anti-Monopoly Service said on Monday it had opened a case into price-fixing allegations concerning Apple iPhones. "The Anti-Monopoly Service sees signs of price fixing violations in the Russian Federation at Apple iPhone resellers, which resulted in the same prices for these smartphones," it said in a statement. A representative for Apple in Russia was not immediately available for comment. The anti-monopoly body said it had opened its case after an appeal from a citizen with information that identical prices had been set for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models, which appeared in Russia in October 2015, at 16 major resellers. It said that an investigation had showed that resellers had set identical prices and kept them at that level for a certain time period, including for other models. MTS, one of the resellers mentioned in the anti-monopoly service's statement, declined a request for comment. Euroset, another firm mentioned, denied it had coordinated prices with anyone.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple New leaked video shows off all three iPhone 7 models Chris Smith BGR NewsAugust 8, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Ever since iPhone 7 reports started coming out, we’ve had two sides of the story when it comes to the number of distinct devices Apple would unveil come fall 2016. A new video recorded in 4K reinforces one of the early iPhone 7 rumors, and you might not necessarily like it. DON’T MISS: Inside story explains how Warner ruined ‘Suicide Squad’ The first iPhone 7 reports said that Apple was working on three distinct iPhone handsets for this year: one 4.7-inch iPhone 7 model, and two 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus and Pro models. The difference between the phablets concerns the rear camera. The Plus version supposedly comes with the same camera that’s found on the iPhone 7, while the Pro would have a dual lens rear shooter. The Plus would likely be the most expensive option. This video leak shows exactly this particular iPhone 7 setup. We’ve got a gold iPhone 7, a gray iPhone 7 Pro and a pink iPhone 7 Plus. The design elements we expect appear to all be there. We’re looking at redesigned cameras that are still protruding, but lack the camera ring seen on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6, redesigned antenna lines, and dual speakers on the bottom (that’s right, there’s no headphone jack on either model). Curiously absent is the three-dot Smart Connector port that the 5.5-inch iPhone should offer, a feature that’s also contested by certain reports. The video was posted online by Dutch site TechTastic, which picked it up from a YouTube account that seems to be linked to a Japanese iPhone reservation store. More recent reports indicated that Apple would have enough dual lens camera supply to equip all 5.5-inch iPhone 7 versions, which is why this new leak is puzzling. Sure, we may be looking at genuine iPhone 7 parts, but these might be earlier design mockups. The good news is that we have just a few more weeks of waiting until we find out the truth about Apple’s iPhone 7 plans. The company will unveil the iPhone 7 during a special media event in early September, and launch it in the weeks following it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cy_aOsQgj8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cy_aOsQgj8 Trending right now: Ultimate Pokemon Go cheat lets you walk anywhere in the game without moving an inch This Pokemon Go evolution calculator will help you get the most powerful Pokemon Brand new Pokemon Go hack helps you locate Pokestops and gyms See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next A laser pointer from the stands helped the Oakland Raiders beat the Texans BGR News iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech Donald Trump’s advisors are lying to him Quartz T-Mobile has some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve seen BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

Unveiled at the company's highly-anticipated keynote event in San Francisco last week, the Apple Watch Series 2 looks very similar to the company's first edition Watch, with a square face. However, while the first Apple Watch was "splash" proof, the second edition Series 2 is "swim" proof - completely water resistant to a depth of 50 meters, in both swimming pools and open water. In order to waterproof it, Apple said it had to close up the ports. This meant the firm had to redesign the speaker so that it has a mechanism that pushes out water.

The Watch Series 2 also features a second-generation display that's two times brighter at 1000 nits, which Apple said will make all the difference when wearers are outside in the sun. To ensure workouts are more accurate and the Watch Series 2 has built-in GPS, which connects to satellites instantly, and even means that a route map will show your varying speeds. "With built-in GPS, Apple Watch Series 2 records precise distance, pace and speed for outdoor workouts such as walking, running or cycling, without needing to take an iPhone," said Apple. "Users can begin an outdoor workout immediately as Apple WatchSeries 2 uses Wi-Fi, GPS and locally stored satellite data to quickly identify their location. "On completion of an outdoor workout, view a route map that shows variations in speed in the Activity app on iPhone. Whether running, going for a swim or walking between meetings, the Activity app on Apple Watch Series 2 counts all daily activity."

Apple’s decision to offer a public beta program for iOS, for example, was in direct response to the Maps debacle … Admitting the building the Maps app had been much harder than the company had realized, Eddy Cue said that it was that experience which led Apple to launch a public beta program for iOS, so that more bugs would be identified prior to release. “To all of us living in Cupertino, the maps for here were pretty darn good. Right? So [the problem] wasn’t obvious to us. We were never able to take it out to a large number of users to get that feedback. Now we do.” Apple now does public beta testing of its most significant software projects, something that Jobs never liked to do. In 2014, the company asked users to test run its Yosemite upgrade to OS X. Last year, it introduced beta testing of iOS, which is the company’s most important operating system. “The reason you as a customer are going to be able to test iOS,” Cue says, “is because of Maps.” Cue also responded to those who criticize what they perceive as a lack of innovation since the days when Steve Jobs was in charge. “The world thinks we delivered [a breakthrough] every year while Steve was here,” says Cue. “Those products were developed over a long period of time.” Much innovation is incremental, he says, gradually increasing the functionality of both hardware and software. Let’s say I’m at home doing email before work. I’d like Maps to tell me, ‘Don’t leave now. Your commute will be cut by 15 minutes if you stay home for a while.’ That would be very helpful. Tim Cook said that he doesn’t worry too much about the ‘Apple is doomed’ stories out there. The way that I look at that is, I really know the truth. That doesn’t mean the company is perfect, he says. We have never said that we’re perfect. We’ve said that we seek that. But we sometimes fall short. The most important thing is, Do you have the courage to admit that you’re wrong? And do you change? The most important thing to me as a CEO is that we keep the courage. Cook also said that there is no lack of ambition within the company – that it wants to expand into new areas, but will do so when the time is right. Our strategy is to help you in every part of your life that we can, whether you’re sitting in the living room, on your desktop, on your phone, or in your car. He cites health as one area where the company has already made huge strides into what is effectively an entirely new area for the company. We’ve gotten into the health arena and we started looking at wellness, that took us to pulling a string to thinking about research, pulling that string a little further took us to some patient-care stuff, and that pulled a string that’s taking us into some other stuff. Healthcare, notes the piece, is a $9T industry, and even one percent of that business would represent a $90B slice. Even Apple might call that a pretty good business. The story, while obviously spoon fed, is a good read on the perception that Apple is trying to present ahead of the iPhone 7 launch.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Apple Watch 2 tipped to sport bigger battery, GPS and LTE support, two versions expected Apple is expected to make its next generation Watch more powerful with new features. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has issued a research note that talks about possible upgrades for the Apple Watch 2. According to Kuo, Apple Watch 2 will likely launch in the second half of 2016 with a faster TSMC-built processor, GPS, barometer, superior waterproofing, and a higher capacity battery. He further said Apple will launch two Apple Watch models this year, one of which will come with minor updates, while the other one will pack in some new features. The minor updated version of Apple Watch will come with a faster 16nm processor from TSMC. It will also be waterproof. In case of the high end model, which is said to be dubbed as Apple Watch 2, will sport GPS radio, barometer, as well as a higher capacity battery. However, it is disappointing that Apple will not make any design changes to the two new Apple Watch models. Kuo says Apple will change the form factor for Apple Watch only in 2018. A report last week said that Apple Watch 2 will sport a thinner display as it will use One Glass Solution” (OGS) display technology instead of Glass on Glass (G/G) technology. Apple is expected to announce the next generation Apple Watch in September along with the new iPhone. "Apple Watch 2 tipped to sport bigger battery, GPS and LTE support, two versions expected", 5 out of 5 based on 3 ratings.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Apple allegedly buys AI company Turi for £153 million By Sead Fadilpašić Shares It looks like Apple bought an AI company. But it's keeping very quiet about it, and the company that was allegedly acquired is also awfully silent. But the media are buzzing, and sometimes, that's enough. It was according to Geekwire, and later V3, that it was said how Apple bought Turi for $200 million (£153m). Geekwire pulled the story, in the meantime. So, what is this Turi thing, anyway? It's a 'fast, scalable machine learning platform', it says, for both developers and data scientists. Its toolkits allow for simple development of machine learning models. “Turi toolkits simplify the development of machine learning models. Each incorporates automatic feature engineering, model selection and machine learning visualisations specific to the application. There is no faster way to build performant [sic] models,” the website says. It says it has clients in fraud detection, customer churn and sentiment analysis industries. It would make a lot of sense for Apple to make such an acquisition. Artificial intelligence is a hot topic nowadays, with various industries tapping into the new technology and making it work to cut costs and improve the bottom line. On the other hand, all of Apple's competitors, including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, all are experimenting with artificial intelligence at some level. On top of it all, everyone is expecting for Siri to get a major facelift in the upcoming iOS 10, so adding extra manpower to the development stage would make a lot of sense.

Radicals & Visionaries A Chronic Health Condition Was No Barrier to Success for This Entrepreneur Amy Osmond Cook Leadership Qualities 22 Qualities That Make a Great Leader Adam and Jordan Bornstein Radicals & Visionaries Get Better at Your Own Job by Doing Someone Else's Kelsey Meyer ON-DEMAND EVENT STRATEGIES TO GROW YOUR BUSINESS Watch Now August 29, 2016 This article originally published on Aug. 8, 2016. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak designed the first Apple computer for themselves for fun, and because they were broke. To pay for the inaugural machine’s guts, they did what many scrappy entrepreneurs do when they’re just starting out: They hawked their prized possessions for capital. Wozniak sold his fancy HP calculator and Jobs sold his Volkswagen bus. With the cash they ponied up, they were in business -- almost. Related: Charitybuzz's Big Idea: Altruistic Online Auctions Next, they “liberated some parts” from their employers. Tinkering with lifted bits from Hewlett Packard, Wozniak’s workplace, and from Atari, Jobs’s employer, the Woz rolled up his sleeves and got to work. There, out in the garage at Jobs's childhood home in Los Altos, Calif., Wozniak “was up 'til four in the morning for many moons” jimmy-rigging the bulky “microcomputer” machine together. When they finally had a working prototype, the Apple 1, Jobs had eyes for selling it. That was back in the summer of 1976. “We had absolutely no idea what people were going to do with these things when we started out,” the late Jobs recalled in 1980, while waxing nostalgic about the birth of Apple Computer Company, now Apple, Inc. This truly is a unique piece of technology. Bid on this #Apple 1 for your chance to own this piece of history!https://t.co/t8nWRWb2J5— Charitybuzz (@charitybuzz) July 29, 2016   Related: Apple Co-Founder Steve Wozniak Sweetly Describes How He Fell in Love With Tech in Fun Reddit Video Flash forward to today, and the most unique, and quite possibly the first, Apple 1 in existence is up for auction on Charitybuzz. Dubbed the “Celebration” Apple 1 by computer historian Corey Cohen, it’s expected to fetch up to $1 million dollars. Cohen, who authenticated the computer for Charitybuzz, tells Entrepreneur that the techie artifact is a one-of-a-kind find. That’s because not only are there believed to be approximately 60 to 70 Apple 1 units still in existence, but also because this pristine-condition collectible features a blank printed circuit board, was never sold to the public and -- here’s the kicker -- Cohen claims there’s a “high probability” that Jobs himself put his hands on it. (He doesn’t think Wozniak did. The inventor-engineer was likely too busy juggling his day job and writing the BASIC code to make nascent Apple computers function, column by column, by hand on a yellow pad.)   “The Apple 1 board is a not just a piece of history, but a piece of art,” Cohen says. “It’s different than every other Apple 1 we’ve ever seen, and its components are actually better quality. It’s Apple’s rookie baseball card, the unicorn in the forest with the biggest horn.” Related: Vintage Apple 1 Computer Auctioned Off for Record-Setting $905,000 Another reason Cohen says the “Celebration” Apple 1 is so special: It speaks volumes about Wozniak’s and Jobs’s pennywise entrepreneurial ingenuity and grit. “The RAM chips that are on it are very expensive and the RAM chips on all the other boards to come weren’t, comparatively,” he says. “So it’s as if they were playing with how cheap they could make future models, seeing which substitute components they could use for the cheapest, which would be very in line with something Steve Jobs would’ve done -- find the least expensive components he could and scale.” If there’s one lesson that entrepreneurs can extract from the backstory behind this particular Apple 1, according to Cohen, a longtime entrepreneur himself, it is to leverage existing mass-produced technology -- and the manufacturing techniques behind it -- in the most resourceful, innovative ways. Doing just that could enable you to get your business off the ground fast, and on a shoestring budget. Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs - https://t.co/oD8yfn3Uab #tech #iot #technology pic.twitter.com/ag4WG6UV5q— Tech IoT Today (@TechIotToday) May 20, 2016 “Jobs and Wozniak applied an electronics manufacturing technique that was used for other things,” he says, “like radios and Atari machines, stuff from the defense industry, to produce a mostly assembled board so that they didn’t take weeks to build these things. It made them able to deliver their first 50 computers in 30 days with a skeleton crew of two or three guys in a garage. This shows that, once you have an assembled product, you can work on making that assembled product cheaper to maximize your profits and become successful in very little time.” Borrow, modify, invent and reinvent for less. It’s the scrappy startup pattern that enabled Apple to help spark the personal computer revolution and to innovate time and again. Related: 'Steve Jobs' Is a Fascinating Exploration of the Complexity of Genius Another example of how Jobs tweaked existing technology “designed for something completely different” to improve Apple’s, Cohen says, is when he signed an exclusive contract with glass manufacturing giant Corning. “He went to Corning and he basically said, ‘You know that Gorilla Glass you think is a failure? I want it,’” The result: the first smartphone to feature scratch-resistant glass, was a smashing success, and iPhones are still global top-sellers to this day.   But let’s get back to the now-obsolete technology that paved the way for Apple to mushroom into a multi-billion-dollar corporation -- the humble “Celebration” Apple 1 and the race to own the bragging rights to it. If you’re in a position to bid, lucky you, the auction runs until Aug. 25, with 10 percent of the proceeds benefitting the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. Three bids are on the books so far. The highest, as of this writing, was $270,000. As for Cohen, he’d rather not know how much money the historic relic, “the quintessential Apple to own if you’re a collector,” reels in. “When there’s an auction like this, I intentionally try not to watch,” he says. "I feel attached to every Apple 1 board that I’ve worked on, but I have to let them go.” Aug. 29, 2016, update: Last week Cohen did let the Apple 1 go, but not for $1 million. The machine sold for $815,000 to Glenn and Shannon Dellimore, founders of Glamglow, a trendy mud mask brand Estée Lauder recently scooped up. The relic joins another rare Apple computer the Los Angeles couple previously purchased. Kim Lachance Shandrow Kim Lachance Shandrow is the West Coast editor at Entrepreneur.com.

And a senior, influential tech analyst has predicted just that. Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI Securities has issued a research note to investors in which he predicts Apple will release an Apple Watch 2 before the end of 2016. In addition, he thinks that the upgraded device will sport built-in GPS, a faster TSMC processor, barometer and better water resistance. He also claims that the new device will likely have a larger battery, with more charge to keep the Watch powered longer between charges. Apple Watch 2: What's the story so far? Best Apple Watch apps: 31 apps to download that actually do something Apple Watch review: 5 months with Apple's smartwatch In terms of design, he states that the new models will retain similar form factors to the last and will come in the same sizes: 42mm and 38mm. They will not have LTE connectivity, however, he says. They will still require connection to an iPhone for data and voice communications. Kuo also predicts that a tweaked version of the current Apple Watch will also be launched this year. They will get processor and waterproofing bumps, but won't come with the GPS or barometer. Of course, as an industry analyst, Kuo is unlikely to have inside knowledge so this is all to be taken as a pinch of salt. But his experience in Apple predictions still makes his predictions noteworthy.

X Dual camera among features of new iPhone as details leaked Re-engineered home button and removal of devices’ headphone jack among other moves Mon, Aug 8, 2016, 12:05 The new iPhones will remove the headphone jack in favour of connectivity via Bluetooth and the charging port.         Apple is preparing to unveil successors to the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus as early as next month with more advanced photography capabilities and upgraded hardware in a design similar to that of last year’s models, according to people familiar with the matter. The standout features will be a dual-camera system on the larger iPhone, a re-engineered home button that responds to pressure with haptic feedback and the removal of the devices’ headphone jack, said the people, who did not want to be identified discussing unannounced features. Apple declined to comment. While iPhone demand has waned in recent quarters, partly due to the lull between product launches, the device continues to be the major source of Apple’s revenue. The new models will be critical to the holiday quarter, and Apple is counting on the phones to prop up sales ahead of an expected iPhone overhaul in 2017, the device’s 10th anniversary. Screen sizes Moving away from the typical two-year iPhone redesign cycle, this year’s models will look similar to the 6 and 6S, the people said, who added that there will still be noticeable tweaks. The new iPhones will retain the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes as their predecessors, the first of which was introduced in September 2014. Apple will remove the two innermost antenna lines that run across the back of the current iPhones, the people added. The dual cameras on the larger new iPhone will produce brighter photos with more detail, according to a person who has used a prototype version of the forthcoming device. Both sensors, which each capture colour differently, simultaneously take a picture, and the device produces a single, merged photograph, said the person. The dual system sharpens photos taken in low-light environments, the person said. The combination of the merged photos from the two camera sensors also allows users to zoom while retaining more clarity, the person added. The smaller version of the new phones will not include dual lenses, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier this year. ADVERTISEMENT Updated home button Apple is planning an updated home button for the new models. Current home buttons are switches that physically press into the phone, but the new models will have a pressure-sensitive button that provides feedback to the user via a vibrating haptic sensation rather than a true physical click, according to the people. This mechanism is similar to that of the trackpads on the latest MacBook line. The new iPhones will remove the headphone jack in favour of connectivity via Bluetooth and the charging port. That will make room for a second speaker, said the people. Apple started allowing headphone makers to build headphones that can connect via the iPhone’s charger connector in 2014, the same year the company acquired headphone maker Beats Electronics. Macotakara earlier reported the headphone jack’s demise. The new models will run iOS 10, the new version of Apple’s mobile operating system coming this fall. The updated software offers interactive widgets to quickly glance at calendar appointments and favourite contacts, new messaging features, a new application for controlling smart home appliances, and a redesigned Apple Music. The new software will also run on current and some past iPhone models. – (Bloomberg)       Topics: Apple Beats Electronics Bloomberg Read More Apple wilts in China as smartphone market heats up Apple offers $200,000 reward for finding security flaws Apple to swap gun emoji for water pistol amid crime debate Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Commercial Property Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case Technology Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing English Soccer Ex-England player David White reveals sexual abuse by coach Business Pharmacist taking skincare back to its natural source Sponsored A bank-beating foreign exchange proposition How ‘nudge theory’ can improve pension provision Black Friday: what is it and how to prepare for it Send an AdMailer Christmas card and help a homeless charity ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business WRC asks Cityjet pilots to defer strike 18:11 Central Bank mortgage rule change: What it means for you 17:35 UK chancellor Philip Hammond maps out post-Brexit future 17:23 Builder Siac posts profits of €322,000 15:47 Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case 15:38 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing Tech Tools: projector for use with smartphones Review: Vivofit Jr, an activity tracker for kids Fool your children into activity by turning it into a game Prynt prints your smartphone photos – and adds video Tech Tools: It’s augmented reality meets actual reality with the help of Zink technology Smart wifi plug gives you the power to control the power Tech Tools: TP Link device means you can use home appliances from your smartphone Most Read in Business 1 First-time buyer deposits cut to 10% as Central Bank eases mortgage rules 2 Central Bank mortgage rule change: What it means for you 3 What to do in your 20s/30s...if you don’t want to be broke in your 60s 4 UK chancellor Philip Hammond maps out post-Brexit future 5 Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case 6 Shocking revelations at Rush Credit Union are just the start 7 Thousands affected as RaboDirect axes investment funds 8 Michael Noonan says ‘brass-plate operations’ will not be welcome 9 Loosening of mortgage rules will push up house prices, says Davy 10 Vulture funds hit by political cave-in on tax reprieve Never miss a story.

However, the government has not yet taken any decision on their requests, commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha. "Apple India Pvt Ltd, Acer India, Le Ecosystem Technology India, Lenovo (India), Oppo Mobiles India have sought relaxation of sourcing condition. No decision has been taken by the government," Sitharaman said. Currently, as per the FDI policy, in respect of proposals involving foreign investment beyond 51%, sourcing of 30% of the value of goods purchased will have to be done from India. She said the proposals undertaking single brand retail trading (SBRT) including those involving issues relating to relaxation of sourcing conditions on account of 'state of the art' and 'cutting edge technology' are examined by the ministries/departments concerned. Apple given relaxation in sourcing for 3 years only: Government Apple has only been given a "breather" for the first three years by providing relaxation to it in local sourcing norms and the compulsory 30% local sourcing clause has not been completely dispensed with, government today informed Rajya Sabha. After that, the government considers these proposals taking into consideration views and comments of such departments, she added. She also said that since June 2014, the government has approved 20 proposals for foreign investment in the single brand retail trading. These proposals include Adidas India, Tommy Hilfiger, Nike India and Montblanc Services. Replying to a separate question, Sitharaman said the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) has received 808 applications of startup recognition. "Out of these, 227 have been accepted and the rest have been requested to submit the required documents and have been refereed to startup India hub for hand-holding support," she said.

According to a report in Mac Rumours, the new Apple Watch will be powered by a faster TSMC processor and will come with GPS and barometer. The Apple Watch 2 will also come with a bigger battery and will sport improved waterproofing. If you are wondering, how the Apple Watch 2 will look like, be assured that it will look similar to the first Apple Watch. KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that "radical design changes won't be adopted until 2018." Read also: Apple Watch 2: Five likely 'features' The analyst also hinted there will be two version of the upcoming Apple Watch 2. While one of the versions will offer minor improvements over the original Apple Watch, the second version will offer specialised activity tracking features and will come with GPS radio and barometer. The next-generation Apple Watch is said to feature One Glass Solution (OGS) based display, instead of one with Glass on Glass technology. DigiTimes, citing information from TPK Holdings, an Apple supplier, said that OGS technology eliminates the glass layers used in the Glass on Glass technology, making the screen slightly thinner. Not only will this make the rumoured Apple Watch 2 thinner, but also lighter. The report further adds that the production of OGS panels for the next-gen Apple Watch has hit some technical issues, leading to low yield rates. However, it is still unclear if this has affected overall production or not. Meanwhile, rival Samsung is also looking to launch its Gear S3 smartwatch at IFA 2016 in September. Samsung is expected to add new sensors in the upcoming Gear S3. It will provide features to track an "active outdoor lifestyle" like surfing, skydiving and mountain climbing. The smartwatch will reportedly come with an altimeter, barometer, speedometer and an integrated GPS chip.

Apple Watch 2 to Launch in September with GPS, Bigger Battery GO Upgraded first-generation models also expected Aug 8, 2016 09:28 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  A new iPhone isn’t the only Apple product that’ll see daylight in September, as the company is also planning to take the wraps off new Watch models at the same event, according to a well-known Apple analyst. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has explained that the second-generation Apple Watch is very likely to see daylight in the second half of this year, probably in September. It will boast several upgrades, including a GPS and a new processor developed by TSMC, the same provider of iPhone chips who’ll also be in charge of building the CPUs for the upcoming generations of the phone. Additionally, Apple is planning to add a barometer to measure elevation more accurately, better waterproofing, and a bigger battery that’ll be absolutely necessary, given all the other new features. The GPS sensor, for instance, is often considered the main battery hog on today’s wearables, so a bigger battery should provide better autonomy when used with GPS. By adding a GPS module, however, Apple makes the Watch capable of running independently of the iPhone, as the device currently uses the phone for location tracking. With a GPS, the Apple Watch can provide additional stats, such as distance covered (such information is currently offered based on an estimate or using a calibration previously made with the iPhone) and mapping data. At the same time, it can also help the company offer additional services, such as emergency services calling and automatic transmission of coordinates - SOS calling will be available with Siri in the next OS update, so such a feature would perfectly align with this new direction that Apple seems to be embrace. For calling capabilities without an iPhone in the proximity, however, the Apple Watch would need LTE support, but according to the analyst, this new feature won’t arrive this year. This could be a sign that Apple is just laying the foundation for more future improvements that could be provided in the coming years. As far as the design of the new Apple Watch is concerned, the second generation will have almost the same look and dimensions as the existing model, but it’ll be a bit thinner and feature a new display. While Apple is working on improving waterproofing, the second-generation Apple Watch won’t be fully waterproofed, so it won’t support swimming. Apple will continue not to recommend showering with the Watch, so it’ll just be water-resistant with additional protection. New first-generation Apple Watch models In addition to the second generation, Apple is also planning to unveil upgraded models of the existing version featuring new hardware, such as the TSMC processor and waterproofing. The device will lack new features such as GPS and the barometer, but the plan here is most likely to offer a more affordable device that would help expand the Apple Watch and reach more customers. Most likely, the price of the Apple Watch will drop by $100 once the second generation goes live, in a strategy similar to what Apple is doing with the iPhone. The Apple Watch 2 could retain the price of the existing model and sell for $299 for the entry-level version. #Apple#Apple Watch#Apple Watch 2#iPhone 7 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Watch 2 Could Launch in September with the New iPhone Rose Gold iPhone 7 Revealed in Leaked Video Apple Watch, Mac OS X/macOS Get New Stable and Beta Updates How to Get Notifications on Both iPhone and Apple Watch iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks    The first-generation Apple Watch New Mac Apps Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate: A straightforward multimedia converter, editor and downloader that helps you grab clips from the web, encode and burn them with just a few clicks of a mouse button War Thunder: An engaging and enthralling online game where you must destroy the enemy tanks, aircraft and human forces in order to win and gain a new rank.

In a note to investors, Kuo said that while one of the versions will just be a minor upgrade over the existing Apple Watch, the other version - dubbed Apple Watch 2 - will come with a handful of new features. The version featuring minor upgrade will be powered by a TSMC processor built on the 16nm process and feature better waterproofing. On the other hand, the Apple Watch 2 will include a GPS radio, barometer, as well as a higher capacity battery. None of the versions will feature any design changes, Kuo said, adding that a change in the wearable's form factor is only expected by 2018. As for 2017, the analyst predicted that Apple will add LTE support to the device that year.
