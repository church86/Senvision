Sure it was a little rude, but at least it gave Apple fans something to do while all eyes were focused on Google. We already showed you how to install iOS 10.1 beta 2 on your iPhone or iPad even if you don’t have a developer account, and it’s ridiculously easy to do. Some people prefer to keep things legit though, and luckily the wait between Apple’s developer beta releases and its public beta releases isn’t long at all. DON’T MISS: iPhone 7 vs. Galaxy S7 blind camera test: Guess which model hardcore Apple fans picked Apple on Wednesday released the latest beta version of its iOS 10.1 software, iOS 10.1 public beta 2. The new build is packed full of bug fixes, and you’ll also find refinements as well as a few new features. What’s more, iPhone 7 Plus users who install iOS 10.1 public beta 2 will gain access to Apple’s Portrait Mode feature, which uses the 7 Plus’ dual lens camera to create a bokeh effect on photographs so that they look similar to photos captured using a high-quality DSLR camera. If you want the new iOS 10.1 public beta 2 software on your iPhone or iPad, all you need to do is sign up on this page on Apple’s website. You’ll then be able to download and install a special beta profile on your iPhone or iPad, which will give you access to iOS 10.1 public beta 2. Once the profile is installed, simply go to Settings > Genera > Software Update and follow the on-screen instructions to install the update.

Tags: Apple-Apple+ Wearables-Wearables+ Pages 1 Introduction, Design and Display 2 Interface, Functionality, Performance and Connectivity 3 Camera, Multimedia, Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion Photos Comments Intro Apple has a well-deserved reputation for helping to define our expectations for what are still, to many shoppers, new product types. The iPhone showed both consumers and other handset manufacturers alike how much untapped potential there was in the burgeoning smartphone market, and the iPad helped tablets move away from their characterization as either under-equipped laptops or blown-up phones to a novel, useful form factor in its own right. After those milestones, it was only understandable that all eyes were on Apple as the smartwatch movement began to take shape. Companies like Pebble started getting that ball rolling, and by early 2014, smartwatches felt like they were on the brink of going mainstream, with Android Wear about to make its debut – so where was Apple's eagerly awaited effort? We had to be patient, and confirmation of the Apple Watch didn't land until the waning days of summer 2014. Even then, it was still a bit of a tease – Apple may have announced its inaugural wearable product, but it wouldn't be until the spring of 2015 that users could actually pick up an Apple Watch for themselves. But when that day finally arrived, Apple quickly picked up a sizable chunk of the smartwatch market with an attractive, well-executed series of models offering a variety of material types, sizes, and style options. But for all the Apple Watch did well, ever since its debut we've been wondering, “what's next?” After all, that odd pre-announcement strategy sure felt like Apple was rushing to get its wearable to market, and maybe we'd see a very different Watch once Apple had some time to sit back and see how consumers responded, experiment some more with design and construction techniques, and reflect upon what it learned from this first-gen launch. It took well over another year, but last month we finally saw the fruits of those efforts, with the release of the new Apple Watch Series 2. It's far from a back-to-the-drawing-board upgrade, and if this were an iPhone, we'd be calling it the Apple Watch S, but with a smattering of new features, some upgraded watch software, and a fresh new iPhone to pair it with, is this the Apple Watch sequel we've been waiting for, or a case of too little, too late? Let's take a look at the new Apple Watch Series 2. In the box: Apple Watch Series 2 (for this review, the 38mm Silver Aluminum Case with White Sport Band) Pair of Sport Bands (S/M and M/L) Magnetic wireless charger AC adapter How-to-guide Safety/warranty slip Design Upgrades await within, but that's one familiar-looking body In the months leading up to the launch of Apple's second-get Watch, rumors furiously speculated about what sort of look we might get. Would Apple add new hardware like a camera to its wearable? What about changing up the design with something like a curved display, or adding new controls to the existing button and crown? Well, after all that noise, we're coming away with an Apple Watch Series 2 that's a near spitting image of the original; unless you plan on flipping one over and checking the text surrounding the Watch's optical heart-rate sensors, you'd be hard-pressed to tell this one apart from the first model. That may upset Apple fans who were looking to see the company take more risks with its wearable's design, but really it speaks to Apple's confidence that it was headed down the right path the first time around; sometimes you need to take a few stabs before you find a look that really resonates (look no further than Samsung's early Galaxy Gear watches), but if you do manage to come up with a hit right out of the gate, maybe there's something to be said for staying the course. None of this is to say that Apple's new smartwatch is a pure rehash of the first-gen model, but the manufacturer has been positively conservative in the upgrades it's decided to employ. And while there are some surprises lurking within, there's little in the new Apple Watch's design that betrays its upgraded internals. Maybe the clearest indication that you're dealing with a new Apple Watch comes in the form of some new Series 2-only variants. For instance, there's the new Apple Watch Nike+ with its perforated strap and multi-tone styling. And the high-end Apple Watch Edition graduates from a conspicuously showy gold body to one crafted from extra-strong ceramic. There's even the Apple Watch Hermès, with its designer straps and buckles. But for all these variants, the basic look of the Apple Watch remains more or less unchanged. What changes to that basic look that can be discerned are almost too small to spot, which is good because they may just be steps in the wrong direction: while the face of the new Apple Watch retains the same dimensions as the first-gen model, the watch body itself grows just under a millimeter in thickness – from 10.5 to 11.4mm. And correspondingly, weight takes a step up, too, as the 38mm Watch grows from 25 to 28.2 grams, and the 42mm model from 30 to 34.2 grams. Those figures are for aluminum bodies, and will vary for steel and ceramic. Oddly, the 38mm ceramic Apple Watch is thicker than every other model, at 11.8mm. Thankfully, the new Apple Watch doesn't really feel that bulky, despite its growth spurt. With the 38mm model we looked at, the watch's curves help it appear slim even with its objectively thicker build, and the extra weight doesn't make the smartwatch feel overly burdensome to wear. With wearables, thin is great, but if you can (smartly) do slightly thicker without ruining things in the process – well, we suppose that works, too. Finally, we've got a functional change, that we might as well talk about in the same breath as these other external hardware updates: Apple's super-charged the Watch's water resistance, moving from protection against sweat, rain, and a quick hand-washing (though with Apple advising against full-on submersion) to rated for submersion in depths up to 50 meters. There are still all sorts of asterisks attached to that classification, though – Apple warns against the combination of water and high speeds, like you'd experience while waterskiing. But even with those concerns in mind, this is still a big upgrade to the smartwatch's durability.   Popular galleries Google Pixel XL vs Apple iPhone 7 Plus Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7 Google Pixel Review Google Pixel XL Review LG V20 Review Apple iPhone 7 Plus Review Apple iPhone 7 Review Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Moto G4 Play Review Sony Xperia XZ Review FIT 100%-+ ‹ PREV 1 of 9 NEXT › image image image image image image image image image ‹ Prev Next View As One Page » View As Slideshow » 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. Display Apple heard your demands for a brighter screen and delivers Arguably even more so than with a smartphone, we expect a lot from a smartwatch's display. It needs to be easily readable in all manner of environmental conditions, as usable up close as at arm's length, and convey all its information to the user without sucking dry the watch's battery in mere hours. The OLED panel of the first-gen Apple Watch was already quite attractive, offering a screen that blended seamlessly in to the watch's glossy black face, while also proving the bold colors and sharp contrast that OLED screens are known for. With its second-gen hardware, Apple – much like with the wearable's overall design – didn't decide to move in a drastically different direction. We've got the same resolutions as before: 272 by 340 pixels for 38mm models, and 312 by 390 pixels for 42mm variants. And just like before, the most affordable aluminum options protect their screens with Ion-X strengthened glass, while steel and fancier options – now ceramic instead of gold – get synthetic sapphire crystals. All of this sounds like business as usual, but there is one key upgrade hitting the Watch's display: with Series 2, the screen is now noticeably brighter; Apple claims twice as bright as the original, hitting an output of 1,000 nits. That sound likes a big deal, and truthfully it goes a long way towards helping out with daytime visibility. But it would still be nice to see more fine-grained brightness controls in Apple's software. Right now, watchOS offers only a three-way toggle between brightness levels, and there doesn't appear to be a huge difference between the middle and top spots. While that makes it harder than it should be to appreciate all this extra brightness, we didn't really have any problems with visibility during our tests.

Apples watch face is off for most of its life. That is a joke when it comes to a watch. Pebble, Android Wear, and Tizen devices have their watch faces on all the time.

Fitness part is cool, GPS directions on your wrist while driving is cool is just about the only things i can think of for a smart watch but in no way worth paying more than $100 for and that still farfetched as i have to take it off to charge it daily.

TechieXP1969 (Posts: 10497; Member since: 25 Sep 2013) There is not a wearable I have tried that get 18 hours if you actually use them. Especially if they have GPS and you install and app that uses it. In order to get 18 hours, you would need to only use it to tell time. The Gear S2 last 2.5 days on a single charge in my experience, when I do nothing but read notifications and count steps and check the time. If you actually try to use an app for an extended period of time, it dies. I used S-Health to track a day at Six Flags. It was using GPS. I pulled it off the charger at 10AM and it was dead by 6PM. Playing music wireless to my headphones, I got roughly close to 6 hours of usage. These things suck when you actually try to use them. The batteries are just too small. For what all of them cost, especially since the apps are all but useless since they just repeat with limited functions what a phone does already, they should have much better battery-life. They need to last a week on a single charge and at least a full 24 hour day with heavier usage. posted on 05 Oct 2016, 11:40 3 Reply 13.

Apple Watch Series 1 vs Series 2: which should you get? By David Nield   The fresh new model or the revamped original? Shares You've no doubt noticed that there's a new Apple timepiece in town, and if you're in the market for a smartwatch then you might well consider it an obvious choice for the top of your shortlist. But wait just a minute, because there's a 'Series 1' option from Apple too. It's cheaper and it does almost everything the Apple Watch Series 2 does, which means your choice of wearable isn't quite as straightforward as you might think. Here we break down the differences between the two devices to help you make an informed choice. It's worth pointing out the Series 1 isn't exactly the original Apple Watch - it's the original, with a speed boost in the form of a dual-core processor that makes it almost as quick as the brand new Series 2. Apple Watch Series 1 vs Series 2: Overview Image: Apple CEO Tim Cook, cheering the original Apple Watch The first Apple Watch was announced in September 2014 and went on sale the following April. That means it was 18 months old when Apple took the wrappers off the new model, which debuted in September 2016 alongside the iPhone 7. It was a pretty impressive arrival, and addressed a lot of complaints about the first Apple Watch, but Apple has kept a Series 1 alternative on sale for £100 ($100) cheaper. As we've noted, it's a tweaked version of the original: there's a faster processor inside it, and it has the upgrade to watchOS 3 installed, just like its more expensive sibling. It's a strategy Apple has tried with its iPhones - note that it still sells the iPhone 6S and the iPhone SE alongside the 2016 model - and the Cupertino company is obviously trying to keep potential buyers interested at lower price points. Your buying choices are more restricted with the Series 1, which is only available with an aluminum case and a sport band. As you might have expected, the ultra-premium versions of the first Apple Watch were retired when the Series 2 came along. Apple Watch Series 1 vs Series 2: Design Image: Series 1 Squint and you'll miss the design differences between the Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2 (the extra choices of colours and straps notwithstanding). On both watches you get a choice of either 38mm (272 x 340 pixel) or 42mm (312 x 390 pixel) screens, though the Series 2 display is substantially brighter. Opt for the Series 2 watch and you get the option of a woven nylon band, Nike Sport band or Hermès strap on top of the original sport band. There are also stainless steel or ceramic cases available if you're willing to pay extra, so bear that extra choice in mind. For the actual watch body, though, the differences are minimal - just some extra brightness on the Series 2, plus harder sapphire crystal screens if you go for a stainless steel or ceramic case. The Series 2 is a little heavier too. You can in fact buy any of the extra straps for the Apple Watch and they'll fit both Series 1 and Series 2 devices. Overall, you're unlikely to choose one timepiece over the other on design alone. Apple Watch Series 1 vs Series 2: Specs Image: Series 2 Now we're down to the nitty gritty: the raw specs. Both watches have dual-core chips, though on paper the one in the Series 2 is faster (in tests, it doesn't seem to make a whole lot of actual difference, as this is just a watch after all). There are some extra goodies that come with Series 2: built-in GPS for tracking your routes without a phone and full waterproofing to 50 metres (the Series 1 is just splash proof). Both watches come with a heart rate sensor and Force Touch, plus all the usual stuff like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity options. Apple hasn't revealed much about the batteries inside these devices but quotes 18 hours of life for both, so there shouldn't be a massive gap between the Series 1 and Series 2. There's not all that much between them overall, though GPS is a big feature to have on the watch for those times you want to leave your iPhone at home. Apple says the CPU inside the Apple Watch Series 2 makes it twice as fast as the original - but remember we're talking about the souped-up Series 1, not the original Apple Watch. Apple Watch Series 1 vs Series 2: Conclusion Image: Series 1 (left) and Series 2 (right) The bottom line is that the Apple Watch Series 2 gives you a brighter display, built-in GPS for location-aware apps, and full waterproofing for going swimming. It's also technically faster, but not to an extent that you're really going to notice. First-person shooters and video editing packages for wearables are few and far between, and most apps will be just as snappy on both timepieces. Are those extra features worth the extra £100 (or $100)? It really depends how much spare cash you have and what you want to do with your watch. For running and swimming, the Series 2 is probably worth the investment. If you're just using it for getting notifications on your wrist and trying out regular Apple Watch apps, you're going to be just fine with a Series 1. The big question is what will Apple do next year? Are we going to get a new Apple Watch every year alongside an iPhone? Or are these devices destined to be updated much less regularly. With only two (or two-and-a-half) smartwatches launched by Apple to date, it's still too early to say.

Sonoma State Star - The university's student-run newspaper Home News Student Life Sports Opinion Arts & Entertainment Photo Galleries Digital Issue About Us Home/ News/ Student Life/ Sports/ Opinion/ Arts & Entertainment/ Photo Galleries/ Digital Issue/ About Us/ Student Life Home/ News/ Student Life/ Sports/ Opinion/ Arts & Entertainment/ Photo Galleries/ Digital Issue/ About Us/ October 05, 2016 Apple drops iPhone 7, and headphone jacks October 05, 2016/ Alex Randolph, Staff Writer It seems as though it’s a normal part of September now.  Alongside the school year starting again, and ‘Talk Like a Pirate Day’ coming and going with little fanfare. There is now a new annual event - people crowding around their nearest electronics store for Apple’s newest iPhone. This year was no different, as Apple fans and tech geeks across the globe swarmed stores Friday to either purchase or pick up their order for the iPhone 7 and/or iPhone 7 Plus, the newest member of Apple Inc.’s multi-billion dollar family. Seeing how most stores sold out in hours,  you or someone you know either already has or is waiting for their version of Apple’s newest toy. But those readers who are not diehard fans of Apple, and already have a smartphone of their own, have a very important question; is there a pressing need to get a new iPhone at all?   There’s not a lot different with the new iPhone compared to the old one. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S were already excellent, if the user reviews are to be believed. True, Apple’s newest software update, iOS10, comes with the phone, which got good reviews from websites such as Engadget, praising the new system for it’s numerous small changes that make for a more convenient experience. But there’s nothing stopping you from downloading the operating system to your older model iPhone, so it’s hardly a sales feature. Some changes to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus include new water resistance, a longer battery life, expanded memory and a better camera. There has also been some praise for having a faster processor, although you may not notice if you don’t play a lot of games or watch videos on your smartphone. For the most part, these all work fine - a longer battery life and bigger memory is something all phones could use more of, and the water resistance is long overdue. The iPhone 7’s camera is only slightly improved, capable of taking better low-light images, but the iPhone 7 Plus comes with dual rear cameras, making it capable of putting two pictures together to create different effects, such as an extra zoom. However, there is some concern that the extra battery life and memory claim         is misleading. According to Vaughn Lewis, a Verizon employee who tested the iPhone 7, the device doesn’t come with iOS 10 installed.  “I feel like the battery’s going to be great on it,” he said, “until you install iOS 10, and that’s going to take a lot of installation space off the phone itself.” And that could negatively affect the battery life as well. If you’ve been following the news at all, you probably already know the biggest problem people have with the iPhone 7 is the total lack of headphone jack.  While steps have been made to accommodate for this, such as an included headphone adapter and bluetooth functionality, there have been complaints that plugging in the adaptor and the headphones creates unnecessary busywork.  More importantly, you can’t charge your phone and listen to music at the same time, since the adaptor plugs into the charger slot, and bluetooth functionality requires spending more money on top of what you already spent for a new phone. It’s also worth mentioning that the home button this time isn’t actually a button, but a solid circle that reacts to a press of your finger. If you’re wearing gloves or have a strip of cloth in between, the home button won’t register it. While not a bad change on its own, since there’s something to be said about lowering your chances of accidentally switching off your phone, there have been complaints about the unfamiliarity of the new design - CNET mentioned in an article that it was quite an adjustment for them. So, should you get the new iPhone? Well, if you don’t have an iPhone 6 or 6S and want to support the company, then yeah - by all accounts it’s still a good phone.  However, if you already have an iPhone 6S, perhaps the best thing you can do right now is wait - the iPhone 6 is a great piece of tech already, and the incremental improvements in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus may not be enough for you to get the new one. Let the feedback from the actual customers come first, and decide from there.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Southwest Airlines Flight Evacuated due to a Replacement Samsung Note 7 Catching on Fire | Main | Samsung Draws a Line in the Sand with Google by Acquiring Viv » October 05, 2016 Samsung won 32 Design Patents this week for things like a Cardboard Box, Foldable Tablet & more   Yesterday Samsung was granted 32 design patents covering everything from a vacuum Cleaner brush to a medical CT scanner (or computer Tomography Apparatus) to a refrigerator to a holder for a wine glass, user interface icons and more. The designs noted in our report today with patent figures cover a foldable tablet device and most importantly a cardboard box. Say what? Yes a cardboard box. In April Apple won a design patent for an Apple Store bag. Apple then applied for a utility patent for that bag detailing materials and so forth. The Android world went nuts that Apple would actually patent a paper bag. The Telegraph thought it was funny and their fans had a field day with it. The story went around the world and covered by a number of tech sites including Forbes, The Guardian, Slashdot and others. Well, what will they say now that their beloved Samsung, maker of the explode-able smartphone, has won a design patent for a curved TV box? Perhaps the trick to this box is that it's explode-able too. Yes, it's the new trend at Samsung these days in case you were sleeping. Considering that design patents don't reveal future or current product detailing – we'll never know for sure.   Unlike "patent applications," design patents published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office don't reveal pertinent information about a particular design. We can look at the design and appreciate it for what it projects, but we'll never discover which materials may be used to construct the design. We'll never know what unique internal components may be hidden within the device or learn about any unique features that we could look forward to. All we get is the simple visual of what could be coming down the pipeline.   Excluding the 'Amazing Cardboard box' – Samsung's foldable tablet is of interest being that the company keeps promising Wall Street that one is on the way for the last two or three years. We're still waiting.The joke keeps on going. In fact, foldable smartphones have been promised since 2009. But they'll get it right one of these days, it's a promise.   Samsung Design Patent for 'Electronic Device' – Foldable Tablet   Samsung Wins a Design Patent for a Curved Cardboard Box? Yup!     Wow, a cardboard box. And think that it took four Samsung engineers, not cartoonists, but highly qualified engineers to pull off this wonder box design is simply amazing. Yes, you can boo and throw popcorn at the screen now.     A Note for Tech Sites covering our Report: We ask tech sites covering our report to kindly limit the use of our graphics to one image.

Gambone Apple Valley Review Eureka! Eight months ago, Apple Valley resident/antique trunk restoration expert Randall Barbera truly hit the mother lode of opportunity when he was hired to restore a collection of vintage Louis Vuitton trunks that once belonged to publishing mogul William Randolph Hearst. According to Brian Kenny, director of collections and archives for The Hearst Corporation, the trunks had been left in storage and forgotten about for years. The company sought out Barbera last December through his Apple Valley-based company Antique Trunk Restoration & Design. Kenny said he soon realized Barbera was the right man for the job. “We came across a number of antique Louis Vuitton trunks,” said Kenny. "Not knowing much about the restoration of antique luggage, I was amazed by the work that Randall Barbera did and did not think such work was possible. Astounding.” Barbera said when he received the the trunks, they were quite beat up and in need of extensive repairs. Thankfully, the Hearst Corporation gave him plenty of time to complete the job. "The Hearst Corporation told me to take as much time as I needed, which was good news because the trunks were in bad shape,” said Barbera. The project included a full-sized wardrobe trunk, a large striped canvas courier trunk from 1875, and an early gray "Trianon" pattern from 1854, which is said to be of the first generation of Louis Vuitton trunks ever produced. “I think that one might have belonged to Louis’ mother, which is incredible.” Upon completion of the trunk restorations, Barbera admits he was sad to see them go. Nonetheless, the experience created wonderful memories for Barbera and his wife Lisa. “The Hearst Corporation invited us to Hearst Castle and we also went to some cool parties they hosted,” said Barbera. “We were treated wonderfully and are so grateful for the opportunity we were given.” Antique Trunk Restoration & Design was originally located in Manhattan Beach. Barbera, a native of North Carolina, said he decided to move his business to Apple Valley in 2015 in order to expand his space, as well as escape to a more peaceful and quiet lifestyle. “My wife Lisa and I were kind of burned out on Manhattan Beach,” said Barbera. “We thought it would be cool to go to the desert and at first, we checked out Tucson. But then we realized it was too far from L.A., so we started looking at properties in Apple Valley and found exactly what we were looking for. “These past few months have been great and being here seems like it’s just what the doctor ordered. It’s a refreshing change.” According to Barbera, every trunk he restores is meticulously reworked and repurposed into a one-of-a-kind work of art. He said he uses Old World-style building techniques with the same tools that built the original trunks hundreds of years ago. "My antique trunks are one-of-a-kind works,” said Barbera. “On average, six weeks or more are spent on each project and an antique trunk in not considered complete until every design possibility has been examined and then exhausted. “Punctuating the original design by taking it one step further to enhance personality is the ultimate goal." Prices for Barbera’s trunks range from several hundred dollars to upward of $1,500. Styles include steamer trunks, cabin trunks, toy chests, wooden chests and more. The pieces can be used for everything from storage chests to coffee tables, Barbera said. For more information, visit www.randallbarbera.com or call 310-318-7129.

Photo by Anton Ivanov / Shutterstock 5 Oct 2016 at 23:35, Thomas Claburn Thomas Claburn Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Recent Articles Meanwhile, in America: Half of adults' faces are in police databases Third of Donald Trump's debate deplorables are mindless automatons This speech recognition code is 'just as good' as a pro transcriber Comment For over a year, Apple's software has been the subject of more derision than might be expected for a company of its size. Developer Marco Arment took Apple to task early last year, arguing that OS X (recently rebranded macOS) is full of embarrassing bugs and that the company is trying to do too much on unrealistic deadlines. Arment subsequently disavowed his post because of the widespread media attention it received. But there was blood in the water and the feeding frenzy has continued at Apple's expense, at least in part because controversy, manufactured or not, drives online traffic. It continues to this day. On Tuesday, one fiction writer – who asked us to keep him anonymous – voiced his dissatisfaction, eliciting agreement from a few others. "I just need things that work, and that I can rely on working," he lamented. "I say this with the utmost regret, sadness, and no small sense of betrayal: Apple doesn't seem to make those things anymore." Along similar lines last month, Mohammad Azam, an iOS instructor at The Iron Yard, conducted a small Twitter poll that found some measure of dissatisfaction. And elsewhere in the Twitterverse, grumbling about Apple's software quality continue to echo. Shortly after Arment's post, Jean-Louis Gassée, a former executive at Apple and Be, and now a general partner at Allegis Capital, addressed the issue in a post on Monday Note. Gassée singled out Apple's word processor Pages and its unwieldy music organizer iTunes for criticism. Apple's three iWork products, of which Pages is one, should be labelled beta, he said. And he described perennial whipping boy iTunes as "a mess, an accumulation of debris and additions without a discernible backbone." Apple acknowledged the issue indirectly when it reportedly said that iOS 9 and OS X 10.11 would have fewer features and a greater focus on stability. But that didn't call off the dogs. By February 2016, Walt Mossberg, historically an Apple fan, had joined the chorus, noting that he'd witnessed "a gradual degradation in the quality and reliability of Apple's core apps," both for iOS and OS X. He too took aim at iTunes, and also criticized Mail, Photos, and iCloud. Shortly thereafter, Apple executives Eddy Cue, SVP of internet software and services, and Craig Federighi, SVP of software engineering, responded to Mossberg's complaints in an interview with Daring Fireball's John Gruber. About 25 minutes in, Federighi said, "I know our core software quality has improved over the last five years. Improved significantly." And he noted that with regard to software quality, "There's nothing we care about more." The Register asked Apple to provide some software quality metrics – the company gets crash reports from millions of its customers who opt in, and it has internal processes for assessing the quality of its engineering work. But Apple did not respond. So it may be, as Federighi claims, that Apple's software engineers are actually writing code with fewer significant bugs than they were a few years ago. But without data, it's difficult to separate complaints based on personal preference or unwillingness to alter established patterns from complaints based on bad interface decisions, unstable code, or inadequate backend infrastructure. Moreover, it's difficult to assess how many more complaints should be expected simply by virtue of Apple's growing customer base and growing product line. There have been a few obvious snafus in recent years, like Apple's short-lived decision to replace the old and reliable mDNSResponder networking software with !@#%ing discoveryd, and the disastrous launch of Apple Maps – so bad that CEO Tim Cook apologized. But it's not clear that Apple's software is better or worse from a reliability standpoint than Microsoft's or Google's. Apple maintains an internal database of bugs called Radar that could be used to assess the frequency of bug reports over time. But the company does not make Radar public. In an effort to promote greater transparency, developer Tim Burks in 2008 launched Open Radar, a way to make Radar submissions to the developer community. Even so, it's hardly a comprehensive way to assess whether alleged problems stem from the quality of Apple's code or from users who may just be holding their iPhones the wrong way. Apple could be more open about the issue, but the company hasn't been able to fix that flaw for decades. ® Let us know what you think – comment below or drop us an email.

The trio left Apple in 2012 and founded Viv. Viv will continue to operate as an independent company. Viv has enhanced contextual understanding thanks to "dynamic program generation," which means that Viv can understand the intent of a user's queries and self-code responses on the fly. Viv can understand context and stack multiple queries on top of each other. For instance, at TechCrunch's Disrupt NY event last year, Kittlaus was able to ask Viv whether it was raining in Seattle a couple days prior, following up with whether it'll be warmer than 70-degrees near Golden Gate Bridge after 5pm the day after tomorrow. Kittlaus tells TechCrunch that the reason it sold to Samsung was ubiquity. The company ships 500 million devices a year, he explained, which gives Viv a large distribution network. On the other hand, the acquisition gives Samsung its own AI assistant that can go toe-to-toe with Siri, Google Assistant and Amazon's Alexa. Samsung says that while the acquisition was done by its mobile team, the company sees the benefits to multiple product categories. "From our perspective and from the client’s perspective, the interest and the power of this really comes from taking advantage of the Samsung scale overall, as well as the richness of the touch points we have with consumers." Viv's technology may eventually work its way into Samsung's non-mobile devices, like washing machines, refrigerators and TVs. Advanced AI assistants have become a focus amongst Apple and its rivals recently. In May, it was reported that Apple was planning on introducing a next-gen natural language API in its rumored Amazon Echo competitor. The technology behind the API is the work of VocalIQ, a natural language outfit purchased by Apple in October 2015. The API has the ability to do "session-based" contextual responses similar to Viv.

The company has announced it's acquiring Viv Labs, a startup formed by the creators of Apple's Siri personal assistant, for an undisclosed amount of money. The deal is being reported both by TechCrunch and CNBC and has been confirmed directly in this Medium post. Viv Labs publicly showed off its next-generation artificial intelligence assistant (simply called Viv) back in May. The product was able to successfully handle a series of complex user requests, wowing an audience at Disrupt NY. The trio behind Viv — Adam Cheyer, Dag Kittlaus, and Chris Brigham — gradually departed Apple following the company's acquisition of Siri in 2012 and have been working on Viv in the years since. Now they'll be under Samsung, but Viv Labs will operate as an independent company, according to TechCrunch. Still, Samsung is buying the team and its technology for a reason. Viv will provide services to Samsung and the company's many platforms. A powerful, intelligent integrated into Samsung's countless gadgets could help position the company against Siri, Amazon's Alexa, the Google assistant, and a slew of "bots" from other companies. "Our focus is really more device-centric," Samsung mobile unit CTO Injong Rhee told Recode in an interview. "How do we revolutionize how users interact with our devices and our appliances?" The technology is likely to appear in Samsung's 2017 family of Galaxy flagships before expanding to other devices like TVs. This move also continues Samsung's ongoing efforts to break from any dependence on Google services; Samsung Pay competes directly with Android Pay, and now Viv could be Samsung's answer to the big feature in Google's new hardware family. Samsung is fully committed to AI, according to the post from Viv Labs CEO Dag Kittlaus: Samsung is setting its sights on becoming a major player in software and services, and specifically AI. Samsung Pay has already proven to be one of the most successful mobile payment platforms in the market and SmartThings is another software acquisition signaling their conviction. And they have installed a new cadre of senior SW-savvy management stretching all the way to the top with a mission. You will soon come to see the utter seriousness of Samsung’s intentions. And like us, they aim to win. Via: TechCrunch Source: Samsung (Medium) More From The Verge Sand's End Facebook won’t call itself a media company.

What Your Choice of Smartphone Says About You New research provides insight on why you might swing Android over Apple. Sean Gallup/Getty Images This week Google launched its new phone, the Pixel. Not a month ago, Apple unveiled its latest, the iPhone 7. To be expected, several websites -- BGR, IB Times, CNET, USA Today -- pushed out reviews, extolling the virtues of one over the other. But for some folks, which phone you buy may have less to do with its features and more to do with who you are. "It is becoming apparent that smartphones are a mini version of the user," said Heather Shaw, from the University of Lincoln's School of Psychology. RELATED: Why Do Apple Releases Generate So Much Buzz? Shaw and her colleagues conducted a couple of studies to see what phone choice said about a person. First, they asked 243 participants to list different stereotypes they associated with the users of each brand. Characteristics such as honesty, humility, agreeableness and openness came up. Next, the researchers tested the stereotypes against actual personalities. To do that, they asked 530 Android and iPhone owners to take a personality test. Afterward, the test-takers were asked what kind of phone they owned. The new Pixel.Google When Shaw and her team looked at the results, they found this: Although people mainly stereotyped Android users as having greater levels of honesty, humility, agreeableness and openness than iPhone users, in reality Android users scored higher in the honesty-humility category. (As an iPhone user, let me just say that I'm very humble.) iPhone users were seen to be more extroverted. (Check) Women were twice as likely to own an iPhone over an Android. (Check) iPhone users thought it was more important to have a high-status phone than Android users. (I'm also very honest.) More than iPhone users, Android owners characterized themselves as people who avoided buying products just to be similar. (Pfft) This last point is interesting if you look at the advertisements for the phones when the study was conducted earlier this year. Android's motto was, "Be together, not the same." Apple's slogan was, "If it's not an iPhone, it's not an iPhone." "We found that the personality traits of the smartphone users matched the brand personality of their owned phone," Shaw told DNews by email. To be honest (see earlier parens), technical features do impact my phone-buying decisions. Historically, Apple has been more stringent when it comes to accepting apps into their AppStore and arguably that has kept out bugs and malware. The new iPhone 7 has the secondary rear camera (Pixel doesn't) and the new phone is water-resistant (Pixel isn't). For people into the latest VR tech, the Pixel will probably appeal more. But Shaw pushes back on this, wondering if we simply embody the semantics and characteristics of the technology we own. "If you buy an iPhone," she said. "Over time you might start acting like a typical iPhone user."

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Elizabeth Dwoskin October 5 Follow @lizzadwoskin Dag Kittlaus creator Siri for Apple. Now he's joining forces with Samsung. (The Washington Post) SAN FRANCISCO -- Samsung, the largest maker of televisions and smartphones in the world, is buying Viv Labs, a high-profile artificial intelligence startup founded by the inventors of Apple’s Siri voice assistant, the South Korean electronics conglomerate said Wednesday. The move is a major land grab in the battle for cutting-edge artificial intelligence taking place among tech giants. Samsung, which has lagged in such services, is now positioned to add intelligent, Siri-like voice capabilities to its vast collection of home and mobile electronics. “We have a unique opportunity to take advantage of AI, and show the rest of the industry what the smart, connected world can look like,” Jacopo Lenzi, Samsung’s Senior Vice President of Business Development and Strategic Acquisitions, said in an interview. The companies declined to disclose the purchase price of the deal. It is no coincidence that Samsung chose to make its announcement just one day after Google touted its own foray into smartphones and other technologies that can converse back and forth with users, providing them with information and services. Samsung and Google have a longstanding and complex partnership — one that is likely to become further strained now that Google has released a smartphone to compete directly with Samsung’s flagship Galaxy device, said Charles Golvin, research director at Gartner. Google’s Android operating system is used in most Samsung smartphones, as is the Google Play app store and many of Google’s popular apps. Given the frenzy around artificial intelligence, Lenzi said it was not surprising that multiple companies would make similar efforts. He declined to comment further on the Google relationship. Goolge released a high-end smartphone and home device, called Google Home, on Tuesday. Both come equipped with the new so-called Google Assistant, a voice-assistant that can do things like buy movie tickets, play music, or make a hotel reservation when asked. “When I look at where computing is headed, it’s clear to me that we’re evolving from a mobile-first to an AI-first world,” Google’s chief executive Sundar Pichai told an audience in San Francisco that had gathered for the launch of the new products. In an interview Tuesday, Google’s Vice President of Product for Android, Brian Rakowski, said the company’s broader goals were to maintain strong partnerships with manufacturers that would elevate the quality of all Android products. He said the Pixel smartphone is in its early days, but that the relationships might be reconsidered down the line. “This is our first rodeo,” Rakowski said. “If we’re successful, maybe we’ll rethink that in a few years.” The Google Assistant sounds remarkably similar to Viv, whose capabilities were outlined in the Washington Post in May. Viv’s founders, Adam Cheyer and Dag Kittlaus, picture a world in which people can interact with technology in one long conversation, liberated from the frustrating experience of toggling between apps on a smartphone. For example, a Viv user could tell the assistant they want a hotel room in San Jose, and the assistant would not only offer options, but ask follow-up questions such as, “Do you prefer a king-size bed or a room with a view?” The assistant would then complete the transaction, all without a person having to go to an app -- or type anything at all. If Viv sounds far-fetched, it’s because nothing like it exists today — and there was always a question of whether the founders could really pull it off. Current virtual assistants, such as Siri, Google Now, or Samsung’s current one called S-Voice, can do a Web search based on a user’s voice command. But those assistants largely produce a list of links and options to click on — users still have to resort to typing to make a purchase. In contrast, Viv Labs has partnered with dozens of vendors behind the scenes, including hotels, florists, movie and concert tickets services, travel companies and even the makers of smart refrigerators and other appliances (In Kittlaus and Cheyer’s world, appliances powered by Viv’s tech will also be able to talk back and forth to consumers). These vendors broke down attributes of their products and shared them with Viv engineers. For example, a flower company has identified its flowers by color, texture, and type so that Viv could be responsive to specific questions. Finding the right buyer was always part of Viv’s strategy. As in the case of Siri, which was a tiny software program when Apple bought it in 2010, Kittlaus knew that getting broad reach would mean partnering with a large player whose products are already used by massive numbers of consumers. Both Google and Facebook made offers earlier this year to buy Viv, and Kittlaus also talked with Comcast, according to people familiar with the matter. Conversations with Samsung began this summer, Lenzi said. Kittlaus said he was impressed by the reach of Samsung — the sheer number of products, from washing machines to smartphones to televisions, that could become animated by conversation. Of course, Viv has not yet been tested on that kind of scale. “I honestly didn’t realize how big it was until we got into these discussions,” Kittlaus said in an interview. “There are are sorts of different touch points that can be brought to life with these conversational interactions.” business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

It also plans to expand voice-assistant services to home appliances and wearable technology devices. Samsung joins a number of tech firms locked in an increasingly heated race to make AI good enough for consumers to interact with their devices more naturally, especially via voice.  Technology firms are locked in an increasingly heated race to make AI good enough for consumers to interact with their devices more naturally, especially via voice control. While Google is widely considered to be the leader in AI, others including Amazon.com, Apple and Microsoft have also launched their own offerings including voice-powered digital assistants. Samsung, the world's top smartphone maker, is also hoping to differentiate its devices, from phones to fridges, by incorporating AI. The financial terms of the deal have yet to be disclosed, but the acquisition of Viv could help the Korean firm shore up its competitiveness.  Google's new Pixel smartphones, released with the US firm's voice-powered digital assistant, threatens Samsung and other smartphone makers who are largely reliant on the Android operating platform. 'Viv brings in a very unique technology to allow us to have an open system where any third-party service and content providers (can) add their services to our devices' interfaces,' Rhee In-jong, Samsung's executive vice president, told Reuters in an interview.

Devindra Hardawar , @devindra 10.05.16 in Personal Computing Comments 999 Shares Share Tweet Share Save ZenBook 3 Get more info More 76 Scores Engadget 76   Critic Not yet scored   Users 1 Reviews Not yet scored   Key Specs Type  Ultraportable Bundled OS  Windows System RAM  4 GB Maximum battery life  Up to9 hour Pointing device  Trackpad From $749.00 Buy Now Apple's tiny MacBook was a revelation when it debuted last year. It was thinner and lighter than most ultraportables on the market, and its refined design brought over some cues from Apple's mobile hardware. So it was only a matter of time before a PC maker took a swing at a similar design. Enter the ASUS ZenBook 3, a minuscule machine that promises to be just as portable as the MacBook while packing in much faster hardware. But while ASUS has proved it can sell powerful machines for far less than the competition, it's less experienced when it comes to delivering truly premium hardware. The ZenBook 3, while attractive on the surface, is a reminder that ASUS still has a lot to learn. Gallery: ASUS ZenBook 3 review | 10 Photos 10 +6 Engadget Score Poor Uninspiring Good Excellent Key ASUS ZenBook 3 from $749+ Buy Now 76 Pros Thin and light design comparable to the MacBook As fast as other high-end ultraportables Vibrant screen Comes with a mini-dock for extra ports Cons Keyboard and trackpad are difficult to use Fingerprint sensor placement makes no sense Build quality is suspect Summary The ZenBook 3 does a decent job of mimicking the MacBook's design while also cramming in faster hardware. But the combination of a hard-to-use keyboard and trackpad, along with build quality concerns, make it difficult to recommend. Hardware At first glance, the Zenbook 3 screams luxury. Its aluminum alloy case is smooth and sleek, and it measures an impressive 11.9mm at its thickest point. I particularly liked the deep shade of blue and the gold accents, which are classy in a subtle way. ASUS's ZenBook line is unquestionably "Apple-inspired," with an emphasis on thin profiles and all-metal cases. But the ZenBook 3's design in particular looks like a mixture of the MacBook and the 11-inch MacBook Air, right down to the small notch below the trackpad and the look of the speakers above the keyboard. That's one way to evoke a premium feel, I guess. But it would have been nice to see some actual innovation, as with HP's sexy new Spectre. With a 12.5-inch display, ASUS managed to outdo the MacBook by half an inch. But Apple's laptop boasts a higher-resolution 2,304 x 1,440 display, as compared with 1080p on the ZenBook. At least it's a good-looking display, though; it's bright enough for outdoor use, while colors appear vibrant and mostly accurate. Though it's not a touchscreen display (that's to be expected with such a thin laptop), ASUS covered it in Gorilla Glass 4 for extra protection. After testing out plenty of touchscreen Windows laptops over the past few years, though, I'm surprised by how much I missed that feature here. While the two-pound ZenBook 3 feels light and sturdy at first, it wasn't long before I started noticing flaws. Applying a bit of pressure around the laptop's keyboard leads to some seriously disturbing creaking noises, as if the seams around the bottom of the case are rubbing against each other. It's not something you might ever do to your laptop, but this also doesn't bode well for long-term durability. If a bit of force from my hands can disturb the case's integrity, how can I ever trust it in a book bag with other heavy items? Then there's the keyboard and trackpad, which present a different set of issues. The ZenBook 3's buttons have more travel than those on the relatively flat MacBook, but the feedback you get when pressing them is mushy and insubstantial. Perhaps it's just because I'm a heavy typer, but I was never able to get into a decent typing flow. While I eventually got used to the wonky feedback, I still get more typos with this machine compared with every other laptop keyboard I've tested recently. Honestly, even though the MacBook's keyboard isn't ideal either, I still prefer it to the ZenBook 3's. The trackpad, while large and relatively smooth, is a chore to use. It requires a lot of pressure to register clicks, which isn't great when you're trying to balance an ultralight notebook on your lap. It would often get confused with left and right clicks, and on several occasions I had to press down multiple times for it to register anything. Tapping the trackpad to select things isn't great either, as it often moves the pointer off your target. And for some reason, ASUS thought it was a good idea to put its fingerprint sensor right on the trackpad. That effectively renders the top-right portion of the trackpad a dead zone most of the time. At least the fingerprint sensor works well; it usually gets me to the desktop in less than a second. On several occasions, I received warnings about Windows Hello being disabled because of too many fingerprint login attempts, even after I was just waking it up from sleep mode. I'm not sure why those errors occurred, but it makes me think that Windows Hello is somehow trying to identify fingerprints even when the ZenBook's lid is shut. (And that could be tied to the flexing issue as well.) You might have noticed one other nod to the MacBook: The ZenBook 3's only ports are a single USB-C socket and a 3.5mm headphone jack. At least ASUS was kind enough to bundle in a USB-C mini-dock, which includes an HDMI port, a traditional USB connection and another USB-C socket. Unfortunately, you can use the dock's USB-C port only for charging, which will make life difficult if you want to connect a USB-C device and an external monitor at the same time.

Our review unit came with a Core i7-7500U, which offers speeds between 2.7GHz and 2.9GHz, and 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM clocked at 2,133MHz. ASUS says it worked with Intel to achieve that memory speed, which is faster than any other ultraportable on the market. It even exceeds the maximum 1,866MHz RAM speeds Intel officially supports for its latest chips. The MacBook, on the other hand, is still stuck with slow Core m3 and m5 CPUs and a maximum of 8GB of RAM. Apple might refresh it soon, now that the seventh-gen Intel CPUs are available, but for the time being, ASUS wins the spec battle. The ZenBook 3 felt just as zippy as other high-end ultraportables.

The latter model was the one I tested, so keep that in mind if you're hoping to achieve the kind of performance reflected in our benchmarks. Apple's MacBook, which is really the only direct competitor, starts at $1,299, with a significantly slower Core M3 CPU, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. Bumping up to $1,599 gets you a Core M5 and more storage, but you'll still be stuck with 8GB of RAM. If you can live with something slightly heavier, then you've got a wealth of ultraportable options to choose from, including HP's revamped Spectre 13 (2.45 pounds), the fantastic Dell XPS 13 (2.6 pounds), and even Microsoft's Surface Pro 4. All of those machines will likely get upgraded soon with Intel's seventh-gen CPUs, so it might be worth waiting a bit (or snap up one of last year's models if they're on sale).

But according to well-known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI Securities, the iPhone 7 isn’t selling as good as the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, despite all the reports that we’ve seen lately.

The reasons? There’s two of them, according to the analyst. First of all, it’s the exploding Samsung Galaxy Note 7.

It was thinner and lighter than most ultraportables on the market, and its refined design brought over some cues from Apple's mobile hardware. So it was only a matter of time before a PC maker took a swing at a similar design. Enter the ASUS ZenBook 3, a minuscule machine that promises to be just as portable as the MacBook while packing in much faster hardware. But while ASUS has proved it can sell powerful machines for far less than the competition, it's less experienced when it comes to delivering truly premium hardware. The ZenBook 3, while attractive on the surface, is a reminder that ASUS still has a lot to learn. Gallery: ASUS ZenBook 3 review | 10 Photos 10 +6 Engadget Score Poor Uninspiring Good Excellent Key ASUS ZenBook 3 from $749+ Buy Now 76 Pros Thin and light design comparable to the MacBook As fast as other high-end ultraportables Vibrant screen Comes with a mini-dock for extra ports Cons Keyboard and trackpad are difficult to use Fingerprint sensor placement makes no sense Build quality is suspect Summary The ZenBook 3 does a decent job of mimicking the MacBook's design while also cramming in faster hardware. But the combination of a hard-to-use keyboard and trackpad, along with build quality concerns, make it difficult to recommend. Hardware At first glance, the Zenbook 3 screams luxury. Its aluminum alloy case is smooth and sleek, and it measures an impressive 11.9mm at its thickest point. I particularly liked the deep shade of blue and the gold accents, which are classy in a subtle way. ASUS's ZenBook line is unquestionably "Apple-inspired," with an emphasis on thin profiles and all-metal cases. But the ZenBook 3's design in particular looks like a mixture of the MacBook and the 11-inch MacBook Air, right down to the small notch below the trackpad and the look of the speakers above the keyboard. That's one way to evoke a premium feel, I guess. But it would have been nice to see some actual innovation, as with HP's sexy new Spectre. With a 12.5-inch display, ASUS managed to outdo the MacBook by half an inch. But Apple's laptop boasts a higher-resolution 2,304 x 1,440 display, as compared with 1080p on the ZenBook. At least it's a good-looking display, though; it's bright enough for outdoor use, while colors appear vibrant and mostly accurate. Though it's not a touchscreen display (that's to be expected with such a thin laptop), ASUS covered it in Gorilla Glass 4 for extra protection. After testing out plenty of touchscreen Windows laptops over the past few years, though, I'm surprised by how much I missed that feature here. While the two-pound ZenBook 3 feels light and sturdy at first, it wasn't long before I started noticing flaws. Applying a bit of pressure around the laptop's keyboard leads to some seriously disturbing creaking noises, as if the seams around the bottom of the case are rubbing against each other. It's not something you might ever do to your laptop, but this also doesn't bode well for long-term durability. If a bit of force from my hands can disturb the case's integrity, how can I ever trust it in a book bag with other heavy items? Then there's the keyboard and trackpad, which present a different set of issues. The ZenBook 3's buttons have more travel than those on the relatively flat MacBook, but the feedback you get when pressing them is mushy and insubstantial. Perhaps it's just because I'm a heavy typer, but I was never able to get into a decent typing flow. While I eventually got used to the wonky feedback, I still get more typos with this machine compared with every other laptop keyboard I've tested recently. Honestly, even though the MacBook's keyboard isn't ideal either, I still prefer it to the ZenBook 3's. The trackpad, while large and relatively smooth, is a chore to use. It requires a lot of pressure to register clicks, which isn't great when you're trying to balance an ultralight notebook on your lap. It would often get confused with left and right clicks, and on several occasions I had to press down multiple times for it to register anything. Tapping the trackpad to select things isn't great either, as it often moves the pointer off your target. And for some reason, ASUS thought it was a good idea to put its fingerprint sensor right on the trackpad. That effectively renders the top-right portion of the trackpad a dead zone most of the time. At least the fingerprint sensor works well; it usually gets me to the desktop in less than a second. On several occasions, I received warnings about Windows Hello being disabled because of too many fingerprint login attempts, even after I was just waking it up from sleep mode. I'm not sure why those errors occurred, but it makes me think that Windows Hello is somehow trying to identify fingerprints even when the ZenBook's lid is shut. (And that could be tied to the flexing issue as well.) You might have noticed one other nod to the MacBook: The ZenBook 3's only ports are a single USB-C socket and a 3.5mm headphone jack. At least ASUS was kind enough to bundle in a USB-C mini-dock, which includes an HDMI port, a traditional USB connection and another USB-C socket. Unfortunately, you can use the dock's USB-C port only for charging, which will make life difficult if you want to connect a USB-C device and an external monitor at the same time.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE (L to R) Google Wifi, Google Chromecast Ultra, Google Home, Google Pixel XL, Google Pixel and Google Dreamview VR are displayed during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco. The Internet giant ratcheted up its rivalry with Apple and Amazon by unveiling new smartphones, an Internet-connected speaker that channels a digital assistant and other gadgets Google took on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into hardware Tuesday, launching premium-priced Pixel smartphones and a slew of other devices showcasing artificial intelligence prowess. The unveiling of Google's in-house designed phone came as part of an expanded hardware move by the U.S. company, which also revealed details about its new "home assistant" virtual reality headset and Wi-Fi router system. The San Francisco event marked a shift in strategy for Google, which is undertaking a major drive to make Google Assistant artificial intelligence a futuristic force spanning all kinds of Internet-linked devices. "We are evolving from a mobile-first world to an AI-first world," Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said. "Our goal is to build a personal Google for each and every user." Rick Osterloh, head of a new hardware division at the California-based Internet giant, added, "We believe that the next big innovation is going to take place at the intersection of hardware and software, with AI at the center." Pixel will be available with a five- or 5.5-inch display, starting at $649 for U.S. customers, similar to the latest iPhone models. Pre-orders began Tuesday in Australia, Canada, Germany, Britain and the United States. By using its own name on handsets, Google is aiming for a bigger slice of the competitive smartphone market, dominated by Samsung and Apple. Until now, Google's flagship devices had used the Nexus brand with hardware partners that have included China's Huawei and South Korea's LG. The California group also sought to expand in the smartphone market by purchasing Motorola in 2011, but sold the unit less than three years later. Unlike past smartphone alliances, Google stressed that it had complete control of Pixel from start to finish, contracting with Taiwan-based HTC to manufacture handsets. The new Pixel phone is "the first phone made by Google inside and out," said Sabrina Ellis of the Pixel product management team. By producing both the hardware and Android software, Google is making a more direct assault on Apple and its tightly controlled ecosystem. Besides being the first smartphone to ship with Google Assistant, it will come with unlimited storage for photos and videos and be compatible with the company's new Daydream virtual reality platform. Pixel has a "smart" camera for sublime photos and a program to make it easy for users to switch operating systems, a move aimed at encouraging iPhone users to convert to Android. However, Google may find it challenging to gain market share, analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said. "Aside from the camera, the new Google Pixels are pretty undifferentiated compared to Samsung and iPhone 7th generation phones," he said. "They don't exactly swing anyone around the room." Gartner analyst Brian Blau said "the most exciting part" of Tuesday's announcement was the assistant, which showcases Google's strength in artificial intelligence. "It's a different tactic from Google, taking the stance that they want to have that direct relationship with their customers," he said. "It is clearly a step into Apple's world" of controlling hardware and software and services, he added. Google also showed off a new Daydream View headset into which compatible smartphones can be slipped to serve as screens for virtual reality experiences. Google added to the coming hardware line-up with a modular Wi-Fi system that lets a set of interconnected mini-modems be spread around homes to make signals strong in all spots. The Internet giant also introduced its Google Home virtual assistant, which will be a direct challenge to popular Amazon Echo devices. Google described Home as a voice-activated assistant that enables users to tap into the company's online capabilities to answer questions, manage tasks, control devices in homes, stream videos and more. Google Home was also synced to work with the freshly unveiled Chromecast Ultra device for streaming high-resolution online video to television screens. The $129 Google Home device will be available in retail shops on Nov. 4. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Previous in Tech Five years after the death of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, the Silicon...

If they’re a bit more methodical, they’ll look at their mission critical apps and monitor for updates from those associated developers. But, above all, a decision to not upgrade (or do it soon) must be balanced against the security updates folded into the new version. . __________________________ Security Protocol The feature list of macOS Sierra is deceptively simple. It is so modest in its scope that some users may be seduced into thinking that they may not need the upgrade, even though it’s free. That’s a bad idea. When a new version of macOS comes out, my first reaction is to check my mission critical apps. Being both a writer and a podcaster, I can’t afford a show stopper. But I’m always mindful that, in this day and age, many security fixes, many of which have architectural impacts, are rolled into each major release. Those architectural changes, in some cases, can impact the operation of some apps. That’s one reason why Apple has a long period of developer and public betas to work out those kinks. By the time a major release, like Sierra, is launched, most of those problems should be solved. Why doesn’t Apple roll out the fixes piecemeal? The answer is that some are synergistic and depend on major OS changes that could, in turn, affect developers. Secondly, many sound scary, but are still in proof of concept phase and aren’t widespread in real world exploitations. They need to be attended to, but an urgent single point security update isn’t called for. A Helpful Analysis from Intego The Mac Security Blog at Intego is a very helpful place to find out more about all this. In the post for 21 September 2016, Jay Vrijenhoek explains the situation with Sierra nicely. 1. Apple maintains a webpage that provides details for all its security updates. 2. The entry for Sierra cites 65 security fixes. 3. According to author Vrijenhoek, there is something important to note: For those not familiar with reading Apple Security bulletins, the addressed vulnerabilities mention ‘Available for: OS X El Capitan v10.11.6,’ but this means the vulnerability was found in OS X El Capitan and fixed only if you update to macOS Sierra. Note that the Security Update2016-001 for El Capitan and 2016-005 for Yosemite only fixes a few critical kernel issues, not the 65 issues fixed in Sierra. Accordingly, if you’re good to go with all your mission critical apps, it’s a good idea to upgrade to macOS Sierra just to make sure one of these obscure bugs doesn’t get exploited in the wrong place and the wrong time: your Mac. It’s also important to recognize that because iOS is a descendant of [Mac] OS X, it often shares common security flaws. Author Vrijenhoek correctly points out: As an added bonus, the list of vulnerability fixes in iOS 10 was amended to show 28 additional vulnerabilities that were addressed in the release. Apple did not release these details until Sierra was released, likely because both operating systems shared the same flaws. Publishing details on the flaws that were addressed in iOS 10 would have given those with malicious intent a nice roadmap of what to exploit in OS X. I surmise this is why major releases of macOS and iOS and tvOS are rolled in the same month. Apple often has to address the same flaw in all variations of its OSes. Be Aggressive. Like Apple I’m being a little over the top next, but not much. If you’ve been thinking that you can continue to survive with, say, a 2007 iMac running Mountain Lion, I’d advise against it if that Mac is connected to the Internet. I also surmise that the reason Apple encourages updates with it’s Auto-downloading feature is so that customers are always mindful of the need to upgrade. Because Apple’s OS updates are free, Apple’s only incentive is to protect its customers, not develop a revenue stream. On the other hand, forcing users to upgrade before they’ve certified their mission critical apps would be inappropriate.  Apple has chosen a wise middle ground. “macOS Sierra Now Auto-downloading, but not Auto-installing.” After a new macOS release, there are lots of articles that will guide you though the update of your apps so you can then update your OS. Here’s one by our Bob LeVitus: “macOS Sierra and App Compatibility.” The bad guys are resourceful and aggressive. Apple customers should never assume they can do nothing and get away with it. _______________________ Teaser image via Shutterstock.

As ex Apple employee #0088 i always read your editorials and Particle Debris blog which are the best rational viewpoint on Apple on the Web. As a developer still using Terminal for development, i would like to read a regular article about the issues that arise with new major MacOS releases for the world of unix development tools installed via HomeBrew, MacPorts and the like. E.G. database engines like Postgres, Java SDK development, JAVA EE, and the like which i use with BBEdit, for my (now outdated) habits of CLI development. Keep up the good (rational) work. October 5, 2016 at 5:42 EST PM John Martellaro October 5, 2016 exAppl0088: Thanks for the props. And an interesting challenge! October 5, 2016 at 5:58 EST PM geoduck October 5, 2016 So with luck I’ll be updating to a new MBP in the next month. My old one is going to my wife to replace her 2008 MB running Snow Leopard. “Aw darn honey, the system has Sierra on it. I guess that old Filemaker from a decade or more ago is going to have to go. And the other Apps that you love, I guess you’ll have to upgrade them too. Sorry. But look you get a 15 inch screen.” There’s method in my madness., October 5, 2016 at 6:52 EST PM Scott B in DC October 5, 2016 “There are lies, damned lies, and statistics.” Counting the number of vulnerabilities fixed is a red herring. One would expect that newer software would require more maintenance than more mature software. It’s the nature of the beast. It is also irresponsible reporting. Rather than suggesting Sierra is “more secure” because of the fixes, I will contend that Sierra is less secure because it requires additional hardening. Further this “Vrijenhoek” is wrong based on real analysis of the systems. If Apple has a CVE open for a vulnerability in El Capitan and reports to the government that it is fixed and has the CVE resolved in El Cap, then the fix was applied to El Cap. Otherwise, it would not pass government accreditation and it would be business Apple would lose. Do you know how many iPhones are running iOS 8 that would never get upgraded to new models if Apple lies about this? I love all of these “experts” who wouldn’t know a fact if it jumped up and bit them in the behind. It really makes it more difficult for those of us on the ground trying to prevent people from being more stupid than they are! October 5, 2016 at 9:17 EST PM vpndev October 6, 2016 “For those not familiar with reading Apple Security bulletins, the addressed vulnerabilities mention ‘Available for: OS X El Capitan v10.11.6,’ but this means the vulnerability was found in OS X El Capitan and fixed only if you update to macOS Sierra.” That is NOT the meaning I have from reading that text. To me, “Available for: OS X El Capitan v10.11.6” means that the fix for this vulnerability is available for 10.11.6. I would like someone with easy access to Apple to query this interpretation – it has been tossed around a lot lately and it’s time that Apple defined what the meaning really is. October 6, 2016 at 12:44 EST AM Stacy Michal October 6, 2016 Apple security is a big concern nowadays, thats why i would recommend PureVPN’s iOS App to hide our online private data October 6, 2016 at 8:57 EST AM andrusz November 10, 2016 PureVPN is an American company? I do not see a canary letter on their web site. Which means all your data goes directly to NSA, etc. Thank you very much! November 10, 2016 at 7:44 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Paul Chapman reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Tributes to Steve Jobs outside Apple's California headquarters took many forms, but mourners were united in their admiration. SOUNDBITE: Robert Scoble, business tech writer, saying (English): "Everything he's done for the past few years has rippled through the industry." SOUNDBITE: David McConnell, Apple employee, saying (English): "He's a visionary, unquestionably. I think he led the world, probably, in computers, the iPhone, everything. It's truly amazing what he did." Apple fans began laying floral tributes and cards outside the firm's HQ late into the night after the news broke of Jobs' death at the age of 56. The firm's co-founder had fought a long battle against cancer and other health problems. SOUNDBITE: Parth Dhebar saying (English): "Steve Jobs said that he wants to make a dent in the universe and I think he clearly did that." SOUNDBITE: Beth Johnson saying (English): "It's just kind of devastating because his vision is really what made Apple." SOUNDBITE: Adam Lowe saying (English): "I'm here with my iPhone, obviously, and you know, just this one device actually was quite a life-changer for me, just in how I did everything. So yes, I think they're going to lose a lot with his passing." Apple said Jobs' wife and immediate family were with him when he died. No other details were immediately available.

According to a Reuters report published Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2016, Yahoo reportedly scanned hundreds of millions of email accounts at the behest of U.S. intelligence or law enforcement. The scans reportedly selected messages that contained a string of unknown characters. Yahoo did not deny the report, saying only that it is a "law abiding company, and complies with the laws of the United States." (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) less FILE - This Jan. 14, 2015 file photo shows Yahoo's headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif. According to a Reuters report published Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2016, Yahoo reportedly scanned hundreds of millions of email ... more Photo: Marcio Jose Sanchez, Associated Press Yahoo reportedly ordered to search email for digital signature 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Yahoo was ordered last year to search incoming emails for the digital “signature” of a communications method used by a state-sponsored, foreign terrorist organization, according to a government official familiar with the matter. The Justice Department obtained the order from a judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. To comply, Yahoo used a modified version of its systems that were scanning all incoming email traffic for spam, malware and images of child pornography. The system stored and made available to the FBI a copy of any messages it found that contained the digital signature. Yahoo was forbidden to disclose the order, and the collection is no longer taking place, the official said Wednesday. The news story has opened a new chapter in a public debate over trade-offs between security needs and privacy rights that has cast a spotlight on the sometimes cooperative, sometime antagonistic relationship between Silicon Valley companies and the government. It comes six months after a standoff between the FBI and Apple, in which the government obtained a court order to force the company to engineer a special system to help it unlock an encrypted iPhone from one of the attackers in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino. The FBI gave up the fight with Apple after it found a way into the iPhone without the company’s help. By contrast, Yahoo cooperated with the court order to use its scanning systems to hunt for the digital signature, although the technical burden on the company appears to have been significantly less than what the FBI had wanted Apple to do. Although the digital signature was individually approved by a judge, who was persuaded that there was probable cause to believe that it was uniquely used by a foreign power, the collection was unusual because it involved the systematic scanning of all Yahoo users’ emails. More typical surveillance court orders instead target specific user accounts. The description by the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, of the unusual surveillance operation carried out at Yahoo shed significant new light on the basis for a report Tuesday by Reuters that has attracted widespread attention and provoked outrage among privacy and technology specialists. The news agency reported that in response to a “broad demand” from the government, Yahoo had “secretly built a custom software program to search all of its customers’ incoming emails for specific information provided by U.S. intelligence officials.” In fact, according to the government official and other people familiar with the matter, Yahoo was served with an court order to look only for code uniquely used by the foreign terrorist organization, and it adapted the scanning systems that it already had in place to comply with that order rather than building a new capability. Asked Wednesday about the information obtained by the New York Times about the order, Suzanne Philion, a Yahoo spokeswoman, said the company had nothing further to add. Earlier in the day, the company said in a statement that the Reuters article was “misleading.” “We narrowly interpret every government request for user data to minimize disclosure,” Yahoo said. “The mail scanning described in the article does not exist on our systems.” Technology companies like Yahoo, Google and Microsoft are required by law to search email traffic and digital uploads for child pornography and report those images to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. They similarly search traffic for malware and spam, which companies disclose in their terms of service. The use of that technology to carry out an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to search for a digital signature used by a foreign power is rare. Several other companies said they had not encountered such an order, and the official familiar with the Yahoo matter portrayed it as innovative.

Well, not quite. It's officially called "Pixel, Phone by Google," and the search giant unveiled it Tuesday during a much-hyped event in San Francisco. The Pixel, available with either a 5-inch or 5.5-inch display, is a grown up Google phone, meant to compete with the top brass of the smartphone world, including Samsung and Apple. It's a sharp strategic shift for Google, which has until now been content with selling phones through its Nexus program. For that, Google farmed out some of the hardware design to other manufacturers -- like LG, Asus and Huawei -- who put their brands on the phone alongside Nexus. For tech watchers, the Pixel ends years of speculation about when Google would actually build a premium phone. The rumors started the moment Google bought a tiny mobile software startup called Android in 2005, a move that eventually pit it against Apple's iOS software for the iPhone. It prompted Apple's Steve Jobs to declare he was willing to spend every bit of his company's cash on fighting a "thermonuclear" war to destroy Android. The phone has Google's signature G on the back.Photo by James Martin/CNET So when Apple announced its own foray into the smartphone market in 2007 with the iPhone, we knew something was missing, an archrival. Coke has Pepsi, the Lakers have the Celtics, Tupac had Biggie. The iPhone needed a worthy competitor, someone even more formidable than Samsung, the world's biggest maker of phones. That's why a Google phone has been a long time coming. "When we finally decided to do it, everyone was like, 'What took you bozos so long?'" Brian Rakowski, a Google vice president of product management, said in an interview Tuesday. More on Pixel Google Pixel offers cold comfort to silent partner Google Pixel cautiously rolls dice with Verizon exclusivity Google Pixel makes a bid for Android history But dreams of this hypothetical clash of the tech titans typically envisioned the iPhone (a name that Apple bought from Cisco, by the way) fighting against the Google Phone. Or maybe the Gphone, as Android co-founder Andy Rubin called it in 2007. Something you could picture in lights on a marquee or in headlines on review face-offs. Instead, we got iPhone versus...Pixel. It's not exactly epic, like Superman versus Batman (the superheros, not the movie). Google insists Pixel is the right name for its new phone. "For us, it's always represented the best of hardware and software designed and built by Google," Rick Osterloh, Google's hardware chief, said on stage Tuesday. That's because Pixel isn't a new name. There are already Pixel Chromebook laptops and tablets that Google designed in-house. Rick Osterloh, Google's hardware chief, introduced the new phone.Photo by James Martin/CNET Still, it's pretty much an unknown brand. And that may be the point, said Dean Crutchfield, a New York-based brand consultant. For most people, Google means search. The Google name doesn't have the "panache" to carry a high-end phone. "The reason the phone isn't called Google is the brand doesn't stretch that far," he said. "If you stretch a brand too far, it snaps." Plus, Google thinks people will come to know it as "the Google phone" anyway, despite its proper name, a company spokeswoman said. She points out that it says "Phone by Google" on the box and the phone itself has a big G on the back. "Phone by Google" is also printed in teeny tiny, nearly illegible letters on the bottom of the back of the phone. "People know who built this phone," Rakowski continued. "It's quite clear. We're not being shy about it." A 'most-loved' brand Maybe you're thinking it's unimportant to dissect a name, that it's just semantics. Shakespeare wrote, "A rose by any other name would smell as sweet." But remember, Romeo and Juliet died because of their names. "When we finally decided to do it, everyone was like, 'What took you bozos so long?'" Brian Rakowski, Google vice president of product management Google knows better than anyone that branding and marketing matter. Just look at the ill-fated Google Glass, which failed because, among other things, the company couldn't get the story right as to why you'd spend $1,500 on awkward eyewear. If Google wants to go up against a heavyweight like the iPhone with this new phone -- and by all accounts, it does, given the Pixel's starting price of $650 and Google's exclusive deal with Verizon as the wireless provider -- then the company needs to nail everything, including the marketing. And the name. There are probably several reasons why the company wanted to call it something besides the Google Phone. Maybe Google didn't want to scare its hardware partners, which are still deeply important when it comes to Android, by jumping into the deep end with a full-on, branded phone. Or, if the phone is a flop, it would be tough to give it a second try with another Google phone if the company has already played that name card. Google made its own premium phone to showcase its software and services.Photo by James Martin/CNET Still, the Google name is a world-class asset. It's the most valuable brand in the world, according to the BrandZ Top 100 list, a study by the branding and advertising agency Kantar Millward Brown. Who's No. 2? Apple. And when it comes to the world's most-loved brands, Google is No. 4, according to the YouGov BrandIndex. Apple is close behind at No. 6. Interestingly enough, the study also lists the iPhone as its own brand. It's No. 8. Maybe Google hopes Pixel will join the list. The ranking suggests people tend to think good things when they hear Google. What do people think when they hear Pixel? Maybe that Adam Sandler movie that got a 16 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and 27 on Metacritic. But if Google didn't choose Pixel because Pixel could help its brand power, it could be the other way around, said Jan Dawson, CEO of Jackdaw Research. "If Google does a phone named Pixel, and it's successful, then it makes Pixel successful," he said. Or maybe there's something more subliminal at work here. A pixel, literally, is a kind of unit of measurement for images on a screen. On phones, pixels are the building blocks of software as manifested on a display. And software has always been at the heart of Google. So even though you're holding a shiny rectangle in your hand with Google's signature G on the back, Google wants to remind you that it's in the business of software. Pixels, not atoms. And in fact, that's how Google executives, standing under a digital banner that declared "Made by Google," explained it on Tuesday when they discussed why it's time for Google to make its own hardware: Software and data are bigger parts of people's lives than ever. Said Osterloh: "The rise of volume and complexity of all the information makes it so that this is the right time to be focused on hardware and software."

Here are tips for selecting the best method. By Erik Eckel | October 5, 2016, 1:40 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Dong Ngo/CNET Running Windows on a Mac was once a process fraught with tribulation, though now it's a common operation that should be painless. With continued Mac performance gains, Boot Camp improvements, and two capable virtual machine (VM) technologies in VMware Fusion and Parallels Desktop for Mac, Apple professionals have multiple options to reliably power Windows installations on Macs. The only trick is knowing which option—Boot Camp or a VM—works best for your intended Windows purposes. Here are recommendations for common scenarios. SEE: Gallery: 10 screen sharing programs for Windows and Mac that make collaboration and support easy Single proprietary Windows app Likely the most common Windows-on-a-Mac need, many Apple professionals also require Windows due to the need to run one critical proprietary, often industry-specific, Windows application. Despite cloud-computing and web-based trends, some applications continue only providing full functionality when run within a dedicated Windows environment. More about Networking Gartner's 10 big trends that will change how IT operates How to deploy a Samba domain controller in under 10 minutes Real-world server room nightmares Subscribe to TechRepublic's Data Center Trends newsletter I possess such first-hand experience; an industry-specific professional services automation application powers my business' daily operations. While possessing mobile and web-based options, the program only provides full functionality—such as financial and accounting features—when run natively within Windows. Unless the sole proprietary program possesses intensive processing requirements, such as is commonly true for video editing and three-dimensional drafting, running Windows within a VMware or Parallels VM typically proves most convenient. Tasks commonly completed using OS X continue to prove immediately available, while the single Windows application is just a few clicks away and behaves as if it's just another application needing to be opened within OS X. No reboot is required. No OS X applications or functions are sacrificed. Recommendation: VMware or Parallels VM Multiple proprietary Windows apps Some Apple professionals must run multiple Windows applications simultaneously. An example is a Mac user who frequently manages workflow processes using a Windows-based industry-specific application and often enters customer-related information within a Windows-specific tool. Such a scenario is trickier. A single universal recommendation is more difficult, but not out of the question. Assuming the Windows applications don't require intensive system resources, running Windows within a VMware or Parallels VM will again prove most convenient for the same reasons a VM is advantageous when running a single Windows-dependent program, as described above. But, if the Windows programs require considerable graphics and processor power, or if all the computer's memory is required to provide proper performance, Boot Camp may be required to deliver the most reliable operation. However, it's more likely that, if the proper Mac model is selected and possesses the correct video performance capacity and corresponding CPU and memory upgrades, a VMware or Parallels VM will prove best. Most multiple proprietary Windows app needs I encounter require either a combination of Windows-specific browser plug-ins and the Windows OS or low-level resources but the Windows OS, meaning these applications can usually be capably accommodated using a VMware or a Parallels VM. Recommendation: VMware or Parallels VM, with some rare exceptions as noted Frequent and intensive Windows operation Occasionally, some Mac users must run demanding Windows applications. Video editing, audio mixing, three-dimensional drafting, development testing, animation, production lighting, scientific and architectural applications can all stress even powerfully configured Macs. When such circumstances arise, Mac users are typically best served running Windows within its own environment using Boot Camp. In such situations, Boot Camp helps ensure most all system resources are dedicated to the Windows installation. Many common functions—including less-demanding tasks such as internet access, email, printing, and file share access—can still be accessed from within the Windows environment for convenience sake, while the demanding Windows-dependent programs receive the benefit of additional CPU and memory resources, in particular.

It makes sense. When looking at the wearables market as a whole, it's dedicated fitness devices, not smartwatches, that are the market leaders. And Fitbit remains the leader of fitness devices. According to the latest IDC numbers, Fitbit owns a quarter of the wearables market, and despite competition from all sides it has increased market share 48 per cent in the last quarter. Fitbit, phone, headphones ... exercise is no longer a solitary pleasure. Photo: istock Looking at these numbers, Alex Healy, Australia Pacific region Product Manager for Fitbit, was understated. "It's nice to be at the top of the heap," he said. "But our success has always been based on really simple core principles." From the first devices shipped, Fitbit focused on three things: ease of use, the social platform behind the product, and giving users just enough motivation to stick around. "For our first few years, we had very little marketing," said Healy. "Our initial sales all came from word of mouth. Our customers became our advocates. Exercise is hard. Staying motivated is hard. We know this. Sixty per cent of our user base mentions the competition between friends as their main motivator" Whatever they're doing, it's working. I've been using Fitbit for years now, and while I've preferred aspects of the competition – I loved the layout of the Jawbone Up app, the crazy amount of stats of the Microsoft Band, the holistic approach of Sony's app, which measured time you'd spend on email or Facebook alongside your workouts  – I kept coming back to Fitbit for one simple reason. That's where all my friends are. Advertisement And social is something that Apple, in particular, still gets so wrong. On the latest Apple Watch, you can now taunt or cheer a friend's daily activity, but the message will arrive on their phone as a standard text, without any context. This has already led to some hilarious misunderstandings among my friends. But while there's room for a dedicated fitness device now, how long can that last? If smartwatches become cheap enough, then surely the winner in the fitness market will be an app that works across all devices. And right now, there is no Fitbit app for Apple Watch or Android Wear. You can't send your fitness data from either watch to the Fitbit platform, which I find frustrating. Fitbit's short term solution for smartwatch wearers seems to be to make Fitbits ever smaller, and more like jewellery, so you won't feel too ridiculous wearing two separate devices. And reluctantly, that's what I do. On the other end of the spectrum, the company's most popular tracker, the Charge, now has a limited number of "smart" features, such as text messages and calendar notifications from a paired phone. But it is first and foremost a fitness device. "Wall Street killed us," notes Healy, when the company announced the Fitbit Blaze, a device that looked more smartwatch than fitness tracker. Investors want Fitbit to know its place in the wearable category. But it's not just the high end of the market encroaching in on Fitbit's territory. On the low end, the company faces increased competition from Xiaomi, which released an excellent fitness tracker, the MiBand 2, earlier this year. The MiBand 2 includes an OLED display, sleep tracking, and a 20-day battery for around $30. Even the app is well designed, and available on Android and iOS. The MiBand 2 is available internationally for those willing to hunt for it, but the vast majority of sales happen within China's borders. And again it comes back to social: Fitbit are banking on your friends to sell you on Fitbit. I've tried a MiBand, and I came back to Fitbit, because that's where my friends are. And maybe, just maybe, I'll lose weight one day, too. Advertisement 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

Instead, Apple's new earbuds plug into the Lightning jack, which is problematic if you want to use them while also charging the phone at the same time. Nearly 3,000 users have already turned to a US$10 adapter on Kickstarter to solve the issue, raising over twelve times the campaign's initial goal with three weeks left to go. The iLDock (for iPhone Lightning Dock) is a really simple dongle that plugs into the Lightning port on the iPhone on one end and sports a Lightning port and an old-school headphone jack on the other side, allowing you to once again charge and listen simultaneously like in the good old days. There is a catch, though. When you use the dock, you also lose the in-line volume and track control Apple introduced with its Lightning-based earbuds as well as data synchronization capability through the Lightning port. Otherwise, iLDock is a pretty simple and straightforward adapter for those that aren't quite ready to do things Apple's way just yet. The dock works with any Apple device with a Lightning port and comes in some additional configurations as well. If you want to be able to charge and listen via the new Lightning-based earbuds simultaneously, there's an adapter called iLDock Duo that gives you two Lightning ports. The iLDock Plus gives you a headphone jack, Lightning port, USB port and memory card slots all in a single adapter for iPhone power users. That's quite a lot more flexibility than other solutions we've seen like the Fuze case that incorporates a headphone jack and battery into a iPhone 7 case. The iLDock team claims they started working on their products several months ago when rumors started swirling that the headphone jack might disappear from the new iPhones. As a result, they hope to be ready to ship to Kickstarter backers in November. But as with any crowdfunding campaign, be sure to proceed with caution, as it's quite common for such promises to be put off and there's very little recourse to get that donation back when campaigns choose not to honor their pledges. That said, ten bucks isn't much to risk to add a little more functionality to your pricey new iPhone. The iLDock comes in colors that match the iPhone colors. It can be had for as little as a $10 contribution, or $20 for the iLDock Plus. You can see it in action in the campaign video below.

Nevermind the consumer realm: Is Apple's mobile enterprise supremacy really at risk? By Brandon Vigliarolo | October 5, 2016, 12:57 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Google Yesterday's Pixel phone announcement by Google has people all over the tech industry talking. Is it an iPhone killer? Will it finally help Google earn a spot in the enterprise? For some it might seem like a competitor, but there are serious limitations that will prevent it from really making a dent in Apple's armor. To understand why the Pixel isn't the new enterprise golden child we only need to consider what the businesses truly want in a mobile device. Unfortunately for Google it's not all great cameras, bright blues, and headphone jacks. What the enterprise wants More about Mobility CIO Jury: 10 out of 12 tech leaders trust Samsung despite Galaxy Note7 failure IBM Watson is coming to the iPhone, and that's big news for business users Tech Pro Research: Social media policy Subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter To be fair, there are some features of the Google Pixel that will make it a good choice for businesses—but those perks aren't enough to take the spotlight off what it lacks. Enterprises need four things in a mobile device: security, ecosystem partners, integration capabilities, and support. It's all about security Mobile devices are ubiquitous, and that means they're being used for work. While an increase in mobile use in the workplace creates a security risk it can be mitigated by making good hardware and security choices. "Apple is favored by enterprises because of the tight ecosystem control that Apple exerts, over the air OS updates (vs. Android updates that are OEM dependent), and because iPhones operate in a secure 'sandboxed' environment," says Werner Goertz, mobile analyst for Gartner. SEE: Why haven't we seen the smartphone security apocalypse in iPhone and Android yet? (TechRepublic) Also worth mentioning is the lack of security features discussed at the Made By Google event at the Pixel launch. Serious improvement needs to be done to eliminate Android security issues if they aren't simply going to be an immediate threat to enterprise networks. Not mentioning security makes it seem like Google is intentionally avoiding it. Google needs ecosystem partners to succeed Apple has a huge leg up when it comes to enterprise-level partnerships: IBM, Cisco, SAP, and Deloitte all have agreements to help integrate iOS devices into business infrastructures. If Google and Android want to get in they have to catch up. Goertz said that Google has tried pushing its way into the enterprise with Android For Work, but has had limited success when up against Apple's already formidable partnerships. Easy business integration isn't optional Here's where Pixel might have an edge: it's highly integrated with G Suite. Businesses that use a lot of Google Cloud services may prefer using Pixels to iPhones: Anyone who's spent a lot of time using an iOS device with Google apps knows they aren't the best of friends. SEE: 10 mobile security myths that need debunking (TechRepublic) iPhones can definitely hold their own against Google when it comes to the cloud—it all depends on how important Google integration is for a particular business. Support is essential Being able to get help with a device is essential, especially if you're not a huge business that has an ever-available IT team. Pixel owners have access to 24/7 live support, which can be incredibly helpful. The catch with the Pixel is how long Google is going to support it: software upgrades will stop after 2 years, leaving owners with a phone that's only going to receive security patches, and those will stop in just one more year. Apple products, on the other hand, have an amazing support platform in Apple Joint Venture. $499 a year gets support for five systems, and it is extensive support. Apple will migrate files, set up machines, and provide live support, pretty much acting like a remote helpdesk. Apple devices also receive updates for five years, not just two. When iOS 10 launched in September it was available on iPhone 5, which launched in 2011, and newer devices. It can get expensive to replace devices for a whole company every two years when support ends, making a five-year window far more attractive. The bottom line There are reasons a Pixel would be a good choice for business: better G Suite integration, 24/7 phone support, and unlimited cloud storage for photos and video. If Google is hoping to truly break into the enterprise with Pixel it's going about it the wrong way: the first step is a larger focus on enterprise integration, big partnerships, and (most important) Android security.

Apple, who missed Monday's loss to the Vikings with a hamstring injury, was on the field for stretching to open the walkthrough-style session. But the first-round draft pick will be listed on the team's official injury report as did not practice, his projected status if the team had held a formal practice. Safeties Nat Berhe (concussion) and Darian Thompson (foot) were also not at practice. The only thing that kept the Giants from a full-on defensive back wipeout for the day was the fact cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie (groin) was projected as a limited participant. The veteran corner was active against the Vikings, but did not play. Head coach Ben McAdoo said he was only available in an emergency.  The poem stanza OBJ should read The fact the Giants did not add a safety after holding workouts Sunday suggests they expect at least one of the injured defensive backs to return for Sunday's game. The Giants will need all the help they need against quarterback Aaron Rodgers and the Packers.  Tight end Larry Donnell (concussion) and right tackle Marshall Newhouse (calf) did not practice as well. Newhouse, who has missed the last two games, was outside in a jersey and shorts and without a walking boot. Only stretching was open to reporters, but Newhouse's attire could be a sign he is beginning on-field rehab.  Running back Rashad Jennings (thumb) was listed as limited. Jennings has been limited each practice the last two weeks, only to be inactive on game day. Defensive tackle Robert Thomas made his return to practice after four weeks with an undisclosed illness, and was a limited participant.  Defensive end Olivier Vernon (wrist) was listed as a full participant.  GIANTS:  Did not practice: CB Eli Apple (hamstring), S Nat Berhe (concussion), TE Larry Donnell (concussion), RT Marshall Newhouse (calf), FS Darian Thompson (foot) Limited practice: RB Rashad Jennings (thumb), CB Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie (groin), DT Robert Thomas (illness) Full practice: DE Olivier Vernon (wrist) PACKERS:  Did not practice: TE Jared Cook (ankle), CB Sam Shields (concussion) Limited practice: DT Letroy Guion (knee), LB Clay Matthews (ankle/hamstring), CB Damarious Randall (groin) Full practice: S Morgan Burnett (groin), DE/LB Datone Jones (knee), FB Aaron Ripkowski (back) James Kratch may be reached at jkratch@njadvancemedia.com.

Earnings Get Rescheduled -- But Why? Is Apple planning an event on the day it was previously scheduled to report earnings? Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Oct 5, 2016 at 3:13PM Apple CEO Tim Cook at an Apple product launch event. Image source: Apple. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had previously scheduled to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, Oct. 27. But a "scheduling conflict" recently prompted Apple to move its earnings to Oct. 25. The rare rescheduling of Apple's earnings release has prompted speculation that the tech giant is planning a product launch event in its place. Is Apple planning an event on Oct. 27? Numerous reports have pointed to an Apple event in October. Of course, an October Apple event wouldn't be out of the norm. The company has launched new products during October in four out of the last five years. The bigger question, of course, would be why Apple would want to move its earnings release earlier so the company can launch products on Oct. 27. The most plausible explanation for Apple moving its earnings release for an Apple event is that it doesn't want declining iPhone sales overshadowing product launch news. It's no secret Apple is likely to report a year-over-year decline in total revenue, driven by declining iPhone sales, for its fourth fiscal quarter of 2016. Apple has guided for revenue to decline anywhere between 11.7% to 7.8% in Q4 year over year. Even if Apple beats its own guidance for the quarter, revenue is still likely to be down on a year-over-year basis, making headlines reporting declining sales nearly inevitable. By scheduling an Apple event after earnings instead of before, the company can replace earnings headlines with ones focused on its latest products. The ever-active Apple rumor mill expects the company's October event to be focused on Mac products. Macbook. Image source: Apple. One product likely to debut at the fall event is a significantly overhauled MacBook Pro. Expectations for a new MacBook Pro started gaining steam when the very reliable and well-connect Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, from KGI Securities, said (via 9to5Mac) Apple plans to introduce a "thinner and lighter" version of the device this year. The new MacBook Pro will take design cues from the recently overhauled MacBook, include Touch ID support, and a new OLED display touch bar, Kuo said. Other products the Apple rumor mill has speculated could debut at an October event are new MacBook Airs and iMacs, and maybe even a 5K display. An October Apple event would be smart An October event with new Mac products would be a boon for the company at a very important time. Not only are many of Apple's Mac products overdue for a refresh, but the segment has been hurting recently. Lacking new products to help sales, Apple's Mac segment revenue was down 13% in the company's most recent quarter. With Mac sales accounting for about 12% of Apple's total revenue, declining revenue in this segment can drag Apple's overall business. Further, by refreshing its Mac products ahead of the holidays, Apple would help set itself up for a big holiday quarter. Combining new Macs with a recent launch of the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2, Apple would have a shot at returning to year-over-year revenue growth in Q1. Investors, of course, shouldn't fret over the exact date of an Apple launch event. Whether the event is scheduled before or after earnings won't make a difference in the company's business over the long haul. But the date change for a "scheduling conflict" does make a strong case for an Apple product launch event in October. Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

Could this chip appear in the next iPad Pro? James Martin/CNET The next iPad Pro could make your current iPad Pro feel slow, old and busted 0 Share: Tablets by Gordon Gottsegen October 5, 2016 12:42 PM PDT Up Next President Obama slams fake news for eroding democracy Apple is reportedly working on the A10X chip, a new super-chip that will likely power the next iPad Pro and blow its predecessors out of the water, according to a rumor post by Dutch tech blog Techtastic. Last year Apple unveiled its iPad Pro alongside the iPhone 6S. While the 6S was immensely popular, Apple intended the iPad Pro as a more niche, superpowered office-oriented tablet that could replace your laptop. In order to make the tablet as powerful as a full-blown PC, it was given the A9X chip, a component more powerful than the A9 inside the iPhone 6S. If Techtastic's claims are correct, we could see the release of an A10X chip, the beefed-up version of the A10, which currently powers the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. If the Apple chip trend continues, the A10X will likely find its way into the next iPad Pro models. Techtastic says this tip is from the same source that leaked early information about the A10 chip. Enlarge Image Geekbench scores for previous (and possibly future) Apple chips.Photo by Techtastic Techtastic used Geekbench tests to show how powerful the A10X is compared to other Apple chips. These benchmark tests have been used to map out performance of all iOS products, and early on showed that an alleged iPhone 7 was more powerful than last year's iPad Pro, which has since been restated. The results show accelerated growth from chip to chip. The A10X is given a multiprocessor score of 6,588, while the A9X gets 4,990. That's about a 28 percent difference. If these numbers are to be believed and the A10X shows up in an upcoming iPad Pro, it would far surpass the performance of the A9X powered original. This could make a big difference for users running work apps such as Microsoft Office for iOS. Apple has not officially announced any details about upcoming iPad Pro models, and was quiet about the tablet's future in its September press event. In this vacuum, however, a few rumors have emerged about multiple iPad Pro models on the way. Whether these rumors are true or not, it would be interesting to see what kind of tangible performance difference a next-gen iPad Pro processor could demonstrate. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

So while anger over roaming charges remains a problem, pushing the iPhone to yet another of the UK’s large service providers will not only boost sales of Apple handsets but also enhance the general connectivity of consumers on-the-go. This, some say, is an issue which has dogged mobile as a critical channel for travel brands. Nevertheless, interactivity still appears to focus around a key areas – something that examining the iPhone app charts can illustrate. Take the iTunes App Store in the UK. The top free apps for the iPhone are dominated by relatively basic information services, such as a London tube map, Google Earth, Urbanspoon (a dining out app), train travel search and another to identify the location of traffic speed cameras. The first app featured in the list which is produced by a so-called travel brand is the Kayak Flight and Hotel Search – remarkable in itself given Kayak’s reasonably low profile in the UK on the web. BA’s app, which was one of the first launched on the iPhone in July 2008, hovers around position 15 in the top 20. As for the paid apps, public transport and airline information services dominate once more – travel brands It is left to the Lonely Planet Travel Guides app (costing a nominal £0.59) to secure the only place in the top 20 for a well known travel brand beside from the rail information sites. There is a similar story in the US. The top free apps are dominated, once again, by information-style services – with the exception of the Kayak and TripCase apps. Paid apps follow a similar trend to the UK. One quirk of usage either side of the Atlantic Ocean which emerges in the App Store charts – which Apple PRs are reluctant to give away – is how eager (or not) iPhone users are to pay for their apps. One in four of the top iPhone travel apps in the UK are paid for by consumers – in contrast to that of the US where just one of the top 20 apps is bought by users (FlightTrack for $5). It is reasonably well known that many of the major travel brands have decided to take a raincheck on investing heavily in mobile functionality such as iPhone apps and other handsets tools – although most are reluctant to admit it. “We have had other things to concern ourselves this past year and, to be honest, it is easier to watch others test the water for us before investing heavily in so-called killer mobile technology,” says one well-placed technology executive within a major global travel brand. The expansion of the iPhone in the UK and similar moves in the US when AT&T loses its grip on the service could be, this particular executive believes, the trigger for a raft of enthusiasm for mobile travel.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Kevin May Kevin is senior editor and a co-founder at Tnooz.

Thats my 2c rant… 🙂 Reply 7 years ago   DonaldS I think there’s quite a lot going on here. Just writing out my hat: 1. Part of the problem is that most of the supposedly content-rich travel apps aren’t very good. Once you’ve bought one “guide” that’s no more than a WikiTravel scrape with basic location-sensitivity laid over it, you won’t make that mistake again. Have a thorough play with some of the apps launched by traditional big players, too, and you’ll find some horrible efforts (despite the fact that they, more than anyone, have access to superb content). 2. Perhaps, too, that the app format is just better suited to simpler stuff (“basic information services”, as you call them)? Yelp, Qype, etc. all ride consistently high in the charts because they do one job (relatively) well. Ditto public transport apps. 3. Perhaps it shouldn’t be so surprising that in a new field like this, it *isn’t* the big players we should look to to innovate well. Among the paid apps, the top “guide-style” (above all the “recognized” brands) isn’t Lonely Planet, but “Instant New York”: see http://www.instantcities.com. It may not be a brand we know well… yet. [Disclosure: I have 2 apps forthcoming with them, so I won’t wax about them too much here…] Of course, the arrival of Orange (and the growth of Android) will grow the app market. But better products would be even more beneficial.

Now, The Guardian reports that Apple’s iOS Developer Academy will open in Naples this week, hosting 200 students for its inaugural program. The inaugural program will last 9 months and see the 200 students receive the latest iPhone, iPad, and MacBook. The program is entirely free for students thanks to an investment by Apple and University of Naples Federico II. Apple designed the classroom for the program, focusing on small group work. Competition will also be a “fundamental”part of the program. While one half the classroom will be dedicated to small round tables, the other half will consist of a lounge area for students to relax. The layout of the large, open-plan classroom was designed by Apple. “The didactic model is very new [for us],” Leopoldo Angrisani, a university professor, said. Small groups of students will sit at round tables equipped with special acoustic systems so the teacher can communicate with each table individually about their work. All courses will be taught in English, since it is meant to be open to students from around the world. The first semester of the program will focus on software development, while the second will center on design and startup creation. One of the central purposes of the program will be to place students in jobs at local companies following their competition of the program. Tim Cook has said that he admires that “entrepreneurial spirit” of Naples and thinks that Apple can “make more of a difference there.” Apple’s iOS Developer Academy will open tomorrow, October 6th, as the Università di Napoli Federico II.

Google is beginning to look, and feel, a lot more like Apple. (Photo: Jessica Guynn, for USA TODAY) SAN FRANCISCO — If Google's product bonanza Tuesday seemed familiar — a new line of pricey smartphones, a snazzy voice-activated service and a virtual-reality headset — it wasn't by accident. The hardware-software double play was decidedly Apple-like. It's no coincidence because, frankly, Google is beginning to look, and feel, a lot more like Apple. And that could mean a major shake-up in a tech industry roiled by questions over Apple's innovation and declining iPhone sales, exploding Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, an expected sale of Twitter, and a mad scramble by nearly everyone else to bolster their cloud-computing services. “The market has co-opted the Apple playbook in some ways,” says Matthew Quint, director of the Center on Global Brand Leadership at Columbia Business School. From a design perspective, he said, Google's new Pixel phone "is as close as possible in look to an iPhone than anyone, including Samsung.” (Google has aligned with Samsung in the latter’s patent design dispute with Apple that goes before the U.S. Supreme Court next week.) There is a sea change at the Googleplex in Mountain View, Calif., with a product strategy and approach straight out of the playbook at Infinite Loop in Cupertino, Calif. In short, Google is constructing a digital empire of devices and services, run from one platform, to compete with Apple's cohesive, polished ecosystem. It is developing a system to control sleek consumer-electronic products, software and services. Google's new consumer electronics devices will be displayed in a pop-up shop in New York City on Oct. 20.  (Photo: Jessica Guynn, for USA TODAY) In other words, the days of Google's fragmented Android approach are over. "Google seems to have finally embraced the old maxim that if you're serious about software, you need to make your own hardware," says Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. The Pixel line, Dawson says, is "a recognition that the best hardware products come from the companies that make the operating systems, which has been Apple's strategy all along — and Microsoft's more recently with the Surface and phones." USA TODAY The 5 times Google trolled Apple at Pixel event And, based on Tuesday's small sample size, it seems a wise path: Google is creating a more uniform experience for users. The strategic gambit is exemplified in Pixel and Pixel XL, Google's new smartphone product line. Priced at an iPhone-like $649 ($769 for the XL), the sleek phones represent an improvement from their predecessor, Nexus, which at times seemed like a hobby rather than product line. HTC is assembling the new Google phones. Google unveiled its Daydream VR product.  (Photo: Jessica Guynn, for USA TODAY) The phones featured high-end specs. But the real bragging rights came from the Google Assistant, Google's version of Siri that, as Google would point out, leverages the artificial intelligence and machine learning its been developing for years — through its PC-based search then through its extensive mapping and finally in efforts like AlphaGo, the program that beat a human champion at a notoriously difficult game board game. It was hard not to see the litany of examples of what Assistant could do in the light of Apple's improved but still-limited Siri digital assistant. The new phones also touted nifty features: cameras that snap photos faster; longer battery life; and free, unlimited storage, the kind of shopping list Apple likes to trot out at its product launches to oohs and aahs. . A video promoting the Pixel also embraced something now missing on iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus: "3.5-mm headphone jack satisfyingly not new." In the background, someone coughs "ahem." Google had more fun at the expense of Apple, poking fun at its South Bay neighbor by announcing Pixel comes in three colors — quite black, very silver and really blue. Several weeks earlier, Apple unfurled the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in black and jet black. Google rounded out its bag of goodies with Google Assistant, a super-smart digital helper; a new Home Internet-connected speaker device; a WiFi system; and Daydream View, a VR headset. It's the sort of hardware-software treasure trove that Steve Jobs once imagined, and spoke of. USA TODAY The new Google Pixel vs. iPhone 7 vs. Galaxy S7 Google's gambit isn't unique, nor is it flawless. Its retail strategy has struggled in getting gadgets to consumers, and it does not have stores, as Apple does, to display its wares. But it does have apparent momentum at a time when its smartphone rivals face obstacles. As Creative Strategies analyst Ben Bajarin points out, Google and Microsoft — with its Surface table strategy combining hardware and software — are emulating Apple. "It is a recognition that tightly integrating hardware and software will always yield the best customer experience," he says.

Earnings Get Rescheduled -- But Why? Is Apple planning an event on the day it was previously scheduled to report earnings? Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Oct 5, 2016 at 3:13PM Apple CEO Tim Cook at an Apple product launch event. Image source: Apple. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had previously scheduled to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, Oct. 27. But a "scheduling conflict" recently prompted Apple to move its earnings to Oct. 25. The rare rescheduling of Apple's earnings release has prompted speculation that the tech giant is planning a product launch event in its place. Is Apple planning an event on Oct. 27? Numerous reports have pointed to an Apple event in October. Of course, an October Apple event wouldn't be out of the norm. The company has launched new products during October in four out of the last five years. The bigger question, of course, would be why Apple would want to move its earnings release earlier so the company can launch products on Oct. 27. The most plausible explanation for Apple moving its earnings release for an Apple event is that it doesn't want declining iPhone sales overshadowing product launch news. It's no secret Apple is likely to report a year-over-year decline in total revenue, driven by declining iPhone sales, for its fourth fiscal quarter of 2016. Apple has guided for revenue to decline anywhere between 11.7% to 7.8% in Q4 year over year. Even if Apple beats its own guidance for the quarter, revenue is still likely to be down on a year-over-year basis, making headlines reporting declining sales nearly inevitable. By scheduling an Apple event after earnings instead of before, the company can replace earnings headlines with ones focused on its latest products. The ever-active Apple rumor mill expects the company's October event to be focused on Mac products. Macbook. Image source: Apple. One product likely to debut at the fall event is a significantly overhauled MacBook Pro. Expectations for a new MacBook Pro started gaining steam when the very reliable and well-connect Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, from KGI Securities, said (via 9to5Mac) Apple plans to introduce a "thinner and lighter" version of the device this year. The new MacBook Pro will take design cues from the recently overhauled MacBook, include Touch ID support, and a new OLED display touch bar, Kuo said. Other products the Apple rumor mill has speculated could debut at an October event are new MacBook Airs and iMacs, and maybe even a 5K display. An October Apple event would be smart An October event with new Mac products would be a boon for the company at a very important time. Not only are many of Apple's Mac products overdue for a refresh, but the segment has been hurting recently. Lacking new products to help sales, Apple's Mac segment revenue was down 13% in the company's most recent quarter. With Mac sales accounting for about 12% of Apple's total revenue, declining revenue in this segment can drag Apple's overall business. Further, by refreshing its Mac products ahead of the holidays, Apple would help set itself up for a big holiday quarter. Combining new Macs with a recent launch of the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2, Apple would have a shot at returning to year-over-year revenue growth in Q1. Investors, of course, shouldn't fret over the exact date of an Apple launch event. Whether the event is scheduled before or after earnings won't make a difference in the company's business over the long haul. But the date change for a "scheduling conflict" does make a strong case for an Apple product launch event in October. Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Replacement Samsung Galaxy Note 7 catches fire on airplane Replacement Samsung Galaxy Note 7 catches fire on airplane By Joel Hruska on October 5, 2016 at 3:15 pm Comment Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 was supposed to be a cutting-edge halo device with an aggressive set of new features. Samsung’s original plan was to launch the device before Apple could field the iPhone 7, then reap the rewards of positive press while Apple grappled with unhappy customers who don’t want to shell out $160 for plastic earrings and prefer their devices with the ubiquitous headphone jack. Instead, the Note 7 is mostly known for being a fire hazard. To Samsung’s credit, the company has been extremely proactive about dealing with the problem, and has repeatedly pushed its customer base to return the device for a refund or replacement. Unfortunately, the company’s battery problems might not be over. Southwest Airlines Flight 944 from Louisville to Baltimore had to be evacuated this morning after passenger Brian Green’s Samsung Galaxy Note 7 caught fire. The Verge spoke to Green, who confirmed that his device showed the characteristic black box that distinguishes between a replacement Note 7 and an original version, and Green stated his battery icon had been green. That’s how Samsung has visually distinguished the new, safe Note 7s from the defective variants. The phone began smoking after Green turned it off and placed it in his pocket at the request of the flight crew. While the plane was still at the gate and could safely be evacuated, reports suggest that the phone (which was left on the plane for obvious reasons) burned through the carpet and into the subfloor of the aircraft. Brian Green’s Galaxy Note 7 box, with the black box. (Image from The Verge) Right now, it’s not clear if this failure was a one-off or a sign that Samsung’s battery problem isn’t as fixed as the company thought it was. At this point, either is possible. The fact is, a certain percentage of smartphones will suffer catastrophic battery failure. Even so, there are battery chemistries that are more-and-less susceptible to thermal runaway. It’s also possible to include safety systems that can react and stop a thermal runaway from causing a catastrophic fire, though I’m not aware of any of these being used in the space-constrained mobile environment, where manufacturers simultaneously slash thickness and push for improved battery capacities. Right now, the explanation for Samsung’s battery failures is that one of the batteries the company uses was slightly too thick for the battery compartment. While this did not prevent the battery cover from fitting on the device, the cells of the lithium-ion battery were slightly compressed and therefore more likely to short-circuit. It’s possible that Samsung truly fixed the problem and this particular failure is unfortunately timed. It’s also possible that either some flawed batteries were mistakenly shipped in new units, or that the company’s initial recall failed to completely address the problem. If this is a one-off for the replacement devices, Samsung shouldn’t have too much of a problem moving forward — but if more “good” Note 7’s keep catching fire, the company’s entire Note product could be tarnished for good. Earlier, we had praised Samsung’s quick response to the problem, but if it turns out they didn’t catch every instance of failure, it’ll blow up even larger than before.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Apple And Sharp Meeting Up Over OLED Screens For IPhone 8 Posted: Oct 5 2016, 1:04pm CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in Rumors | Apple     Recently we heard that Sharp is now planning to spend more than $566 million on OLED screen technology. One wonders why it is so keen in this investment well our recent sources tell us that Apple is gearing up Sharp to be its key supplier for OLED screens to be used in its future iPhone. Don't Miss: The Best Black Friday 4K HDR TV Deals If this really happens to be true and Sharp does prove to be a potential supplier of these OLED screens which are going to be incorporated in to the iPhone for the first time then Sharp has a lot to maintain this deal. Sharp will have to sustain the ability of meeting Apple’s strict quality control system as well as keep up with demand for the volume of such OLED screens. The keenness expressed by Sharp to spend a tremendous amount on this OLED screen technology is a clear sign that the company sees a big Apple contract dangling in front of it eyes. However one prevalent problem is the time scale. Apple is rumored to release iPhone 8 on its 10th anniversary nearly this time next year. This phone is thought to have an OLED screen and if it is really the case than it would be pretty difficult for sharp as looking at the supply constraints of OLED screens all over the world. A company supplying OLED good enough in number to meet Apple’s demands is no easy job,however, things are good for Sharp because Apple has no choice but to revert to OLED screens no matter when this is because Samsung is shipping absolutely gorgeous OLED screens in to its flag ship models and the rest of the industry is also following the trend. LCD screens have been maintained by Apple for more than we can imagine. OLED offers much more including incredible colors, efficient power management and so on. Last note, we just can’t wait to get our hands on a black iPhone having an OLED display.

In the video, the device’s camera lens is shown attracting scratch marks at a level six on the Mohs scale of hardness. That’s quite surprising given both the official iPhone stats webpage and Apple’s marketing boss Phil Schiller insist all current iPhones use sapphire for camera lens protection. Now, pure sapphire crystal should sustain scratches up to a level nine, so it’s odd that the iPhone 7’s camera lens would scratch more easily than it should. As it turns out, the sapphire “issue” was serious enough to warrant an official statement from Apple. “Apple confirms the iPhone 7 camera lens is sapphire, and under proper testing conditions, achieves the hardness and purity results expected from sapphire,” Rene Ritchie quoted Apple’s official statement given to iMore. Apple confirms sapphire glass, because apparently science and video watching are hard: (Full explainer up soon!) pic.twitter.com/u49jWnTyyB — Rene Ritchie (@reneritchie) October 5, 2016 It essentially boils down to the difference between “scratching” and “fracturing”. In his full explainer, Ritchie writes: Fracturing—as opposed to scratching—is what happens when you have something so incredibly thin—unlike the much thicker watch used for comparison—and you apply pressure with no level of control. Rene’s article basically implies that JerryRigEverything didn’t conduct his iPhone scratch test properly. “You’d have to precisely apply the same level of force, likely to the same thickness of material, to properly do that test,” Rene concludes. He added this: The video is fine for what it is, but it doesn’t include the necessary controls and contains enough theories throughout that the ultimate conclusion it reaches might escape people who don’t understand the subject or don’t watch it closely. Following Rene’s article, JerryRigEverything acknowledged on Twitter that the iPhone’s camera lens is in fact solid sapphire after all though he originally speculated that maybe Apple was using a thin veneer of sapphire over glass and calling it sapphire. “Just to clarify: the iPhone camera lens IS solid sapphire, not a laminate or glass. Just like I show and explain in the video. Apple isn’t lying,” the YouTuber wrote on Twitter. As a quick backgrounder, JerryRigEverything’s video seen above shows the iPhone 7’s sapphire lens beginning to show scratches at a Mohs six. The sapphire lens on the iPhone SE also scratched with a Mohs six while the iPhone 6 series showed scratches at a level six on the Mohs scale of hardness. In comparison, JerryRigEverything scratched the cover glass of a Tissot watch which, too, uses sapphire crystal for protection against scratches. First scratch marks on the watch started appearing at a level eight on the Mohs scale of hardness. Responding to a question posted on Twitter by a fan shortly following the iPhone 7’s release, Schiller wrote that both new iPhone models use sapphire protection for the Home button and camera lens, just like prior iPhone models. @Lunnzies Not true. Camera lens cover and top of Home Button both Sapphire. #iPhone7 — Philip Schiller (@pschiller) September 17, 2016 What’s your take on this topic? Is Apple telling us a white lie concerning its use of sapphire in iPhones? Could it be that the iPhone’s camera lens and Home button are not as scratch-resistant as we thought they would be, or are we making too much fuss about the semantical difference between “scratching” and “fracturing”, do you think?

If they didn’t change the lens from the 6s or the 6 and the 5s etc, then I don’t care. I haven’t heard of scratched lenses being an issue, so unless they just changed it for the 7 and 7 Plus, I don’t have any problem with it. PhoneTechJay I mentioned that in another thread lol, it should not be a problem now if it wasn’t a problem with the other phones. Rowan09 And someone will try and make this a scratch-gate. I really don’t get the point of this test because the 5SE and 6 scratched at the same scale as the 7. diggitydang Sorry, missed that one, but sounds like great minds think alike! Brandon Barker I have had every iPhone since the 4 and have never had a problem. I now have the 7plus and this is the first phone that i have ever cracked the glass lense and it has broke out. I do not believe this is sapphire. diggitydang Interesting. Could be coincidence but I would also be suspicious too, in your position. Will Apple replace it or fix it for you? That’s crappy though. Sorry to hear. GigaTigga Is anyone else really tired of hearing that the tests weren’t performed in an exact testing lab? Can anyone tell me the last time they put their phone in their pocket and the sand inside of it was scratching to the exact standards of testing? Its a horrible excuse from corning about gorilla glass 5, and i really thought apple would give something better than the same old “the test wasn’t performed in a vacuum”. Well I hate to tell them, real world usage isn’t in a vacuum. Tiltasauras It’s the pressure applied that’s important. Jerry is applying way more pressure than the sand in your pants will. therealjjohnson When’s the last time you took a metal pick and tried to intentionally scratch the lens on your phone? GigaTigga If you think its just a “metal pick” you’re missing the point. The hardness picks are designed to simulate materials of similar hardness to other items, such as sand, glass, etc. There are materials as hard as the “metal pick” that your phone will encounter with day to day use, if you’ve ever had anything scratch ever, then you have already experienced this. The point is, we realize its not a scientific test, anyone with eyes (no offense to blind people) can see that this is not a precisely measured interaction between the pick and the phone. This is precisely my point, no one is using their phone in a vacuum, so saying the test is an invalid test in and of itself is invalid, of course, in my opinion. I’m an apple fan boy btw. I’d love for apple to prove him wrong, but saying he didn’t do the test in the most scientific manner he could, doesn’t do it for me. therealjjohnson Except a pick and a grain of sand are not alike and that’s not the same type of pressure or situation. Please miss me with that “pick was designed to simulate” stuff. The pick was designed to be a straight piece of metal. And under no circumstance would I take a piece of metal and apply pressure directly to the lens of my phone. I fail to see how that simulates sand. GigaTigga So if he found a piece of sand which matched the hardness of the pick, then placed the piece of sand on the lens and rolled it around, scratching it, would that satisfy the “metal pick” part of your discontent with the test? therealjjohnson He amount of pressure you can apply with a grain of sand & a metal pick you can hold in your hand and create leverage with is not the same. You can’t get leverage on a grain of sand. GigaTigga I’m not too sure if you can or not, if i’m being honest. lolthisguy you obviously have no idea what you’re talking about. hardness is resistance to permanent deformation. if the pressure applied is the same with a metal tip or grain of sand, its still the same. JohnS You’re right. But if you read the article the consensus is that he didn’t actually manage to scratch the sapphire lens with his pick. The pressure he applied actually caused the sapphire to fracture along the path he applied that fine tip to. I’m sure you’re aware of this already but the harder a material is the more brittle it tends to be. When deliberately scratching a fine point with a fair amount of force how brittle an object is turns out to be a bigger deal than how scratch resistant it is. lolthisguy He fractured the lens when he lifted it from the iPhone. He said it in the video. In the video, you can clearly see him scratch it and not fracture the lens. Also, pressure is required in order to test hardness. JohnS Sorry man, if you watch the video he says (and I quote) “we see something entirely different [versus the scratches on the watch] … this crack here happened as I was lifting the lens out of the iPhone frame. The level 6 and 7 picks definitely did permanent damage, but under the microscope they look like small fractures instead of scratches.” (His words not mine) As far as the pressure required to test, that’s only partially true, you can’t scratch a diamond with a razor blade no matter how much pressure you apply. But you can scratch Talc with a razor with almost no pressure at all. The only reason you’d typically apply a fair amount of force to an object traditionally when scratch testing is so that you can get as clean and deep a scratch as possible so that it is easy to see. And the pressure exerted by the fine point of a pic is undoubtedly higher than any normal camera lens would encounter. Remember that the finer the point the less pressure it takes overall to deal immense pressure to the object. For instance did you know that an average woman wearing high heals puts more pressure per square inch on the ground beneath those heals than a fully grown male elephant? lolthisguy Ahh ok. Thanks man. Pressure=Force/Area. I’m up on my knowledge. chacal la chaise Lack of respect for the scientific method glares. Where’s me Ray Bans. Joonyaboy Makes sense to me. Just like there are bulletproof glass that can be penetrated by the right kind of bullets Bacillus And any water entering the phone will be “wild”/ “uncontrolled” water ? Oh wait, it doesn’t matter anyway. Warrantee applies only in the Lab… JohnS You do realize that Apple can’t possible afford to cover water damage under warranty right? The iPhone is water resistant to 3.3 feet for 30 minutes. How on earth do you propose that Apple would test to see if the phone took water damage from being dropped into the deep end of a swimming pool or being in someones pocket while swimming or something for more than 30 min? Bacillus Welcome to the World of FEATURITIS, my son. Water resistance, scratching, better battery life, improved headphone connectivity – all marketing buzztalk that essentially does not translate to real life usability. JohnS Can you list for me the non useful features? Water resistance I would argue is at the top of the list for useful features! Remember the good old days when a simple water spill could ruin your electronics permanently or being in a heavy rain could cause your phone to take damage? Haha, or a child teething on your phone could pump it so full of saliva that it permanently ruined it (true story)? Better Battery life and new processor architectures that allow for significantly better performance while saving battery consumption? Isn’t that the exact thing that customers ask for every single year? Ask anyone why they don’t use bluetooth and the 3 big reasons are price, poor audio quality and intermittent connections. Granted Apple can’t directly change prices in this market (although they can try to increase the demand which ultimately will drop prices), but they are innovating to fix the other two. Personally I’m really interested in getting a beats headset now and that’s something I wouldn’t have said just a month ago. I can go on, but the point is not every feature has to be flashy or new and exciting. Sometimes the best features are the ones that just make daily life that much easier or less stressful. As soon as Apple falls into the trap of feeling the need to release “exciting” upgrades then we are going to have a gimmick war with Samsung on our hands. Personally my favorite OS X update was Snow Leopard. Almost no new features, but it was almost half the size, twice and fast and rock solid in performance. I’m sure you would have hated it but for me, it was everything I wanted at the time. Rowan09 Personally I really don’t care. People should worry more about scratching the screen instead of the two smallest areas on the phone. steven I dropped my iphone 7 plus from the top of the shower caddy in a hotel room on to a stone shower floor. no scratches, dents, cracks. I don’t care what it is, it did its job. steven (for the record, it was in the shower with me after spending a long run in my Camelbak w/empty Gu packets nova voter sure it was haha armyk As far as I saw. The “problem” is that sapphire layer is thin and breaks when they push hard, this does not represent scratch test, but more like break test. Those scratches are actually broken sapphire, not scratched one. So if they would you scratch with the tools and not push like maniac he would get the same result as on the watch. askep3 why would they cut costs for something like this Chang in Charge They need to issue a statement regarding cellular connectivity issues on the iPhone 7. Bugs Bunnay Explanation: CHINESE SAPPHIRE! Stoffsprenger ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Oh how I love these first world problems! Ernie Marin My question is, do you plan on buying a phone just to scratch it or to actually use it, because considering that for 8 years the iPhone has been almost the same price yet gets upgraded almost at every model, I honestly don’t care is the glass is Sapphire or cheap crystal from around the corner. It still a very affordable phone considering all of it’s features. Dao Sasone As stated in the video, real sapphire is supposed to be around 9. Lens was at 6. Why not state its sapphire plated. JohnS The simple reason is that the harder something is the easier it is to shatter (think glass hitting the floor vs a rubber ball). It’s super easy to scratch rubber with a fingernail but you’d be hard pressed to scratch a glass plate with your finger. It’s the same thing here. Sapphire is very easy to break but very hard to scratch. By pressing with a fine tipped tool as hard as he did he actually caused the Sapphire to fracture under the tip. In real world usage the sapphire should be much more resistance to scratches from sand and stuff in your pockets and the glass should help make it stronger as well. But another thing to think about is that laminating sapphire to glass doesn’t make it any less sapphire than buying a sapphire protection sheet and attaching it to the front of my phone. Sapphire doesn’t stop being sapphire when it comes in contact with glass. Dao Sasone Lol you’re missing the point. Why didn’t apple say its sapphire plated as i mentioned. Just like 18k or 24k gold. They need to advertise it right. Other wise its false advertisement. Same shit as lying if you ask me. JohnS Ok let’s say it wasn’t sapphire plated and that they took the exact same sheet of pure sapphire and laminated it directly to the glass exterior of the lens. Would that magically have made the sapphire more pure? Or is the Sapphire somehow only pure if it never comes in contact with glass? Apple only claims that the camera lens is protected by a sapphire cover. The fact that they chose to mount it int he way that they did is secondary. They did 100% what they claimed. No false advertising here. Dao Sasone Lol you’re funny. Any mixtures of any element of course becomes impurity. Apple only file a patent regarding the production procedure and the average joe never cks on that. They never stated anywhere along the line that it not 100% pure sapphire. That its blended with glass. So that is false advertisement. But believe what you want. JohnS You have an interesting definition of mixture my friend. If Apple stated that they somehow blended Sapphire and glass then they would be lying. As far as I know you can’t even bond Aluminum oxide and Silicon dioxide (at least not in any way that retains their individual properties) in a chemical mixture. If Apple claimed that they made a lens of Sapphire and used it to cover the camera lens they would be telling the truth. I’m still not sure why you hate the idea that Apple laminated the sapphire to a piece of glass? Or do you just want Apple to be seen as the villain here? If they had laminated it directly to the lens (also glass) it wouldn’t be repairable should something happen without replacing the entire camera which would be significantly more expensive. Also, Sapphire is a lot harder to work with when it is in thin sheets. Not only is it very brittle but it is hard to cut as you can imagine being as hard as it is. Turns out that laminating it to glass allows you to retain transparency while having a base material that can be cut to exact specifications to mount inside a phone housing. Which coincidentally enough is important especially when water proofing comes to play and things need to be as exact as possible. Again, there are a lot of reasons to mount sapphire to glass, it also supports the overall structure as glass is more resistant to shattering than sapphire. But to say that the second you mount sapphire to glass you’re created a mixture of elements and are marketing a fraudulent product is actually rather hilarious. Makes me think I should tell people that the walls at my work are no longer pure concrete since we painted over them and that they are now good to go to put a nail in it to mount that picture 😛 Sorry my friend. You’re trying to make a case out of poorly argued semantics and it just isn’t going to work. You can want Apple to be a villain all you want, and I’m sure that you can find some stories to defend that narrative but this sadly for you isn’t really one of them. Bayetae Shropshire It shouldn’t be that detail as to how a person should scratch their lens and what level of pressure should be applied, and different scientific terminology used to explain the process of proper scratching. At the end of the day, in the everyday use of ones phone and getting possible scratches on the lens isn’t done with a certain amount of pressure applied consistently, it’s usually a mistake or accident. So if the lens still scratches under those conditions because someone who “accidentally” scratches their lens isn’t applying the correct pressure when “accidentally” scratching their lens doesn’t makes sense. Dj Stef The guy tested the iPhone camera lens under an electronic microscope and showed to have impurities and that the top part had more of the sapphire content while the back side more silicon (glass). Wtf is apple talking about? Liars. Plus he showed the patent with the sapphire laminates. I agree tho that he may have been scratching it too hard in relation to the thickness of the lens. But still a $1million electron microscope doesn’t lie! It is NOT PURE SAPPHIRE PERIOD! JohnS If I buy a pure sapphire protector cover for my iPhone and attach it to the glass screen of my iPhone does it stop being sapphire because it’s touching glass? As stupid as that question is, that’s essentially the argument people are making here. Apple bonded a sheet of pure sapphire to a sheet of glass. Why? Well, although Sapphire is a lot more scratch resistant than glass, it’s a lot more prone to shattering. laminating sapphire to glass theoretically gives you a material with all the shatter resistance of glass with the scratch resistance of Sapphire. So no, Apple didn’t lie. Whether their pure sapphire protection was mounted to a thin piece of glass in the housing or directly to the glass on the camera lens, the fact remains that it is still pure sapphire. So yes, it’s pure sapphire. period. Dj Stef are u ok buddy? the lens as a WHOLE is NOT pure sapphire. ONLY the TOP part is. the EM proved that. swallow it and ur apple pride please… JohnS LOL, you are right. As a whole entity it is not pure sapphire. HOWEVER, there is a layer of pure sapphire mounted to a sheet of glass (for a number of reasons) and that layer is what was being called into question. Is there a layer of pure sapphire covering the camera? Yes 🙂 Is that 100% pure Sapphire layer mounted to glass? Yes 🙂 Here’s the problem. Let’s pretend that that same piece of sapphire wasn’t laminated to a piece of glass held in place in the iPhone housing. Let’s pretend that it was instead laminated directly to the lens of the camera (which happens to be glass as well), would you still say that the pure sapphire covering is magically impure because it was attached to the camera lens and that the camera lens as a whole is not pure sapphire? What are you hoping for? That Apple would make a 7 element lens of nothing but sapphire? Sorry but in this case there is no pride for me to swallow my friend. Apple did 100% what they claimed. They covered their GLASS lens with a layer of Sapphire. Whatever methods they chose to use to cover their lens with it were or how they mounted it in place, the fact remains; Apple put a layer of pure sapphire over the camera. Dj Stef jesus u sound worse than steve jobs. listen, first the camera has its own lens. that obviously cant be made of sapphire… the COVERING however is 1 piece composed of 2 parts: a backside which is “100% pure” glass, and a frontside which is “100% pure” sapphire… end of story. and i think the sapphire part is thinner than the glass part? cant remember the video saw it when it was released. stop backing up Apple like its some Messiah, go endorse something else bro thats “100% pure” legitimate 😉 JohnS Hahaha, almost think that could be a compliment. And no I don’t back up Apple 100% as if they were some Messiah. I’m actually in chat right now with them working to get some issues resolved after finding more bugs in one of their applications. Apple makes plenty of mistakes and I make no effort to hide that. But in this case I’m honestly baffled by the point you are trying so hard to make. Is there a piece of sapphire over the camera? Yes! Is it pure sapphire? Yes! Is it mounted to the glass inside the iPhone frame instead of the camera itself for increased reparability? Yes! So… What’s the issue? If you admit it’s a piece of 100% pure sapphire mounted to 100% pure glass and that the sapphire is pointed outwards towards the world to protect from scratches… what’s the issue? Apple Claims that there is sapphire over the camera. This is true. I fail to see how the choice of mounting that sapphire can become such a huge deal. In all the iPhones I’ve owned, I have yet to see any of them acquire a single scratch on either the camera lens or the home button while the screens on all of them have received several scratches. You may be horrified that Apple put a thin piece of glass between the camera and the sapphire, but all I know is… it works. (and there’s sapphire protecting my camera) Leslie Bee I own many Apple products, but as time goes by, I’m getting more and more disappointed in Apple as a company. It’s now been five years since Steve Jobs passed away, and it shows. 🙁 The iPhone battery is still under-powered, and Jony Ive has the nerve to say it would ruin the user experience to put in a longer-lasting one. Then they introduce a battery case that even Quasimoto would be ashamed to own. They build a MacBook with only one port, that we’re somehow supposed to use to charge it and plug in various USB devices, all at the same time. Not to mention they did away with their wonderful MagSafe plug. They’ve done away with the headphone jack, claiming “courage”. The truth is, they seem to now be in the business of making dongles and adapters and replacement chargers. I could go on, but let me just repeat myself: I’m getting more and more disappointed in Apple as time goes by. It seems to me that Phil Schiller and his marketing minions are now running company.

Apple today released iOS 10.1 Public Beta 2 to testers in the Apple Beta Software Program. If you’re a member, you can download this update over the air by going to Settings > General > Software Update on the iOS device that you’ve enrolled in the program. As for what’s included, this update is likely similar to the one that was released to developers yesterday. That update added a scroll bar to the Messages App Drawer and removed the dots to represent each app. It also removed the ability to drag and drop stickers in Split View mode on an iPad. Apple hasn’t said when iOS 10.1 will be released to the public. Given Apple’s history with beta releases, though, we’ll likely see one or two more beta updates released before iOS 10.1 is made available to all users. iOS Apple Previous ArticleEvents from Facebook app will help you find stuff to do Next ArticleApple unleashes iOS 10.1 beta 2 update Don't forget to VOTE!

Taking cues from Apple, Google has finally stepped down to designing its own hardware, but not limiting itself to smartphones only. The company believes it can take full advantage and the capabilities of hardware by using its artificial intelligence and machine learning. Apple has long been designing operating systems for its own hardware. Now Google is doing the same with its Pixel phones running company’s Android system. The Google keynote event at San Francisco on October 4 highlighted a series of new hardware, but the primary focus was on Google’s products rather than the device itself. With the five new devices announced, Google is preparing for its own eco-system and the base controller is Google’s own artificial intelligence — Assistant. Let’s take a quick glance at what Google has to offer. Pixel, Pixel XL Google announced its much anticipated smartphones, the Nexus successor Pixel (and Pixel XL), in a small event in San Francisco. The company ditched the Nexus branding for the new name Pixel, which will now be manufactured by Google themselves under the tag ‘Made by Google’. Both Pixels are powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset with 4GB of RAM with a unibody design made from a combination of metal and glass and will be sh-ipped with Google’s latest And-roid version 7.0 Nougat. Google has renamed its Nexus launcher to Pixel Launcher and included Assistant, apart from bringing a slew of new features to the table. Google claims that the Pixel sports a 12.3MP rear camera and is one of the best ones out there. The came-ra also clubs with Goo-gle Photos to offer users unlimited online storage, for life. As for the hardware specs, the sm-aller Pixel will sport a 5-inch display with a full HD AMOLED panel, 2770mAh battery, 8MP front camera, USB Type-C USB 3.0, single SIM, and 32GB/128GB storage. While the two smartphones are almost identical, the Pixel XL only differs by display with a 5.5-inch qHD (2K) AMOLED display and a larger 3450mAh battery. The Google Pixel is priced at Rs 57,000 for the 32GB variant, while the 128GB variant will be selling at Rs 66,000. The Pixel XL on the other hand is priced at Rs 67,000 for the 32GB variant and the 128GB variant will be selling for Rs 76,000. The device will be up for pre-orders starting October 13. Daydream VR Google also unveiled its Daydream View, a Virtual Reality (VR) headset at the event. The VR headset will come with a companion motion controller, a feature missing from other conventional VR headsets till date. The new wireless motion controller for Daydream can fun-ction like a fishing rod, a steering wheel or a pointer to permit more sophisticated VR experiences. Google also plans to share design guidelines with other manufacturers to make Daydream headsets and contro-llers. Daydream View and the controller will be out in November for $79 and will be available in three different colours. Google Home Google Home is company’s answer to Amazon’s smart home speaker ‘Echo’. Google Home will be able to perform many of the same tasks similar to Amazon’s Echo. However, Home will have Google’s AI Assistant, which can connect and control many of Google’s hardware in the same network. Voice commands from the user can be used to completely control the other hardware, for example, play music, field questions, search for information and control home appliances. Google Home will be available from November, pre-orders have already started. Price starts at $129 with a 6-month free subscription of YouTube Red. Chromecast Ultra Google announced the next iteration of its media streamer Chromecast, dubbed as the Chromecast Ultra. The new video-streaming Chromecast Ultra will now support 4K resolution videos for larger displays. It will challenge Amazon’s Fire TV, which also supports 4K resolution, but is fairly cheaper than the latter. The Amazon Fire comes at a hefty price of $100, while the Chromecast Ultra is priced at a mere $69. Google Wi-Fi Google also aims to improve Wi-Fi networks in homes by offering its own home-brewed wireless router — Google Wi-Fi. The company believes that people use the internet differently now, with games, video chatting and more on various devices throughout the entire space of the house. The new routers can beam to a farer distance by clubbing each other’s powers in combination to create a broader range of operation. The new Google Wi-Fi system will cost about $130 for a single unit, while a three-pack option for larger homes will come in at a cheaper cost about $300.

Alibaba Founder and CEO, Jack Ma meeting with David Cameron the then UK Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street during his visit to London in October 2015. number10gov/flickr, CC BY-NC Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn As the financial media speculates about Twitter being acquired by Salesforce, Alphabet (formerly Google) or even Apple, companies outside the Californian tech scene have received little attention as potential suitors. There’s now clear interest, appetite and capacity for cross-border mega deals in online tech, as Tencent’s acquisition of Supercell in June this year has shown. “Asian strategic investment in European Tech firms has grown steadily over the last decade but this year it has gone through the roof” says London-based Jack Fisher, Senior Business Development Manager of Global Deals Data provider, PitchBook. Tencent is China’s largest online social media and gaming company. Its landmark majority investment in Finland’s Supercell (makers of the global smash hit mobile game Clash of Clans) valued the 200-person company at US$10.2 billion. This crowned it as Europe’s first “Decacorn” or private startup online tech company to reach a valuation of more than US$10 billion. In June 2016 Finland’s Supercell (and maker of Clash of Clans) became Europe’s 1st Decacorn (Private tech co valued at over $10Bn) thanks to a majority investment from China’s Tencent. bata/flickr In another Transatlantic mega deal, Japanese Tech Investment Giant SoftBank’s US$31.4 billion back in July acquisition of British chip designer ARM Holdings, whose success has been buoyed by the use of their chips in tens of billions of web connected devices for Apple, Samsung and others is the biggest ever purchase of a European technology company ever and SoftBank’s largest overseas acquisition. In September last year, China’s other online giant Alibaba hired Michael Evans, the former Vice-Chair of Goldman Sachs, to lead the company’s quest for offshore expansion. Evant has since overseeen five acquisitions, all worth more than US$200 million, and each of them outside China - in Singapore, India, Hong Kong and the US. The latest one is the largest yet — a US$1 billion deal for a controlling stake in the number one South-East Asian e-commerce startup, Singapore based Lazada Group. While Twitter may not be on the radar of overseas investors, there is now a large and growing stream of international global mergers and acquisitions in the technology sector every month. Cross-border deal flow has steadily increased each year since the emergence of the web and shows how the new economics of “online gravity” is accelerating globalisation. This new economics has helped forge the five most valuable companies in the world right now — each now valued at more than US$300 billion. They include Apple (with a fortune built on the web connected iPhone), Alphabet (formerly Google), Microsoft (now parent to LinkedIn and Skype), Amazon and Facebook. Two more companies with massive fortunes also built on the incredible economics of the web, the Chinese online giants Tencent and Alibaba, also now enjoy market valuations in excess of US$250 billion each. They now rank among the worlds largest companies. Global tech cross-border dealflow is accelerating. October 2016. Paul X McCarthy Since 2000, US technology companies have acquired 230 Asian tech companies with the numbers steadily increasing each year. With even more dramatic growth, Asian tech companies have acquired 373 companies since 2000. Between 2011-2013 Asian tech companies were acquiring between 20 to 30 US companies per year and now it’s double this rate with between 50-60 major deals being consummated each year. Recent noteworthy large-scale deals include: Acquirer Acquired Valuation at acquisition Date Softbank, Japan ARM Holdings, UK US $31.4 Billion July 2016 Tencent, China Supercell, Finland US $10.2 Billion June 2016 Tencent, China Riot Games, US US $400 Million February 2011 Rakuten, Japan Ebates, US US $1 Billion September 2014 Rakuten, Japan Viber, Cyprus US $900 Million February 2014 Acquisitions — one of the keys to tech innovation Mergers and acquisitions are a key but often overlooked part of the digital economy and central to the success of the global technology innovation ecosystem as we know it. Most of Alphabet’s significant innovation since it created the world’s most famous search engine has been the result of its 190 acquisitions. Google Maps, for example, was an acquisition, so too Google Docs, Gmail, and YouTube. Many elements at the core of Google’s breathtaking commercial success in online advertising rely on innovation from startups that were acquired and integrated into Google’s own internal efforts. The impact of the web on accelerating globalisation can be seen beyond the tech sector too. Many digitally transformed traditional industries like media, telecommunications and electronics have also become the subject of major Asia-based cross-border acquisitions including: Industry Acquirer Acquired Valuation at acquisition Date Publishing Nikkei, Japan Financial Times, UK US$1.32 billion 2015 Electronics Toshiba, Japan Landis+Gyr, Switzerland US$2.3 Billion 2011 Telecommunications Singtel, Singapore Optus, Australia US$8.5 billion 2001 Not first time there’s been a surge in cross-border deals In the early 1990s Japanese consumer electronics giants were on the hunt for Hollywood movie studios. They wanted media, software or “content” as it has become known to complement their hardware. Japanese companies invested more than US$13 billion (nearly US$25 billion adjusted to today’s money) in the US film and television industry, which included the mega acquisitions of two of the six largest Hollywood film studios — Matsushita’s acquisition of MCA and Sony’s purchase of Columbia Pictures. Even Walt Disney turned to Japan for US$600 million in financing for its films. It remains to be seen whether we may see a repeat of this scale of deal making with any of today’s US online giants given their unprecedented scale. What’s almost certain is we will see more frequent and larger scale cross-border acquisitions of companies up to the size of Twitter (around US$30 billion) and perhaps even at the scale of Paypal or eBay (US$50 billion+). At a smaller scale again, expect to see many more yo-yo deals with companies criss-crossing the planet to acquire others in their efforts to dominate a vertical market or technology sub-sector. Examples of these style deals include: LeEco (Beijing)‘s $10m acquisition of Sydney based Octopus TV (London) in January* Carsales (Melbourne) estimated $15m purchase of Chileautos (Santiago) in March and Naspers (Cape Town) $180m takeover of Citruspay (Mumbai) last month. This Chord diagram using seals data from Crunchbase illustrates the total number of Global cross-border technology deal flows since 2000 organised by continent.

image/svg+xml MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS SEARCH People and Careers Taking a Closer Look at Trump, Clinton's Views on Cybersecurity, Tech Issues The nation’s next president could help strike a balance between privacy and the government’s need for data. Here's how the two candidates match up. by Wendy Lee, San Francisco Chronicle / October 5, 2016 0 (AP Photos) (TNS) -- At last week’s presidential debate, Donald Trump famously expressed concern about “somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds” hacking into computers. In a speech Monday in Virginia, he sought to clarify his views on cybersecurity, saying it would be an “immediate and top priority,” and that a Trump administration would call on the Department of Justice to create a task force “to crush this still-developing area of crime.” The speech was a rare foray into technology policy for the Republican candidate. Where Hillary Clinton has filled a nearly 7,000-word briefing on hacking, net neutrality and other technology topics, Trump’s views have largely come across through tweets and cable-news soundbites. The nation’s next president could help establish policies that affect how Silicon Valley operates and the speed at which innovative products become available to consumers. The president’s stance could also sway how foreign governments treat American tech companies abroad, and strike a balance between privacy and the government’s need for data. Here is how the two candidates match up: RELATEDStrong Cyber Perimeters Key to Reducing Breaches, Cybersecurity Expert SaysPresidential Debate 2016: Cybersecurity Highlights Significant Differences in Policy, Understanding Between CandidatesClinton vs. Trump: What Do Their Tech and Innovation Policies (or Lack Thereof) Mean for Jurisdictions? Cybersecurity: Trump’s speech Monday contained few specifics beyond the creation of a task force. A team of military and civilian experts would also, he said, review the government’s systems and make them “as secure as modern technology permits.” Cybersecurity attacks from China, Russia and North Korea and non-state groups are among “our most critical national security concerns,” he said. The speech went slightly beyond the debate, in which Trump said “the security aspect of cyber is very, very tough,” but that the U.S. should do better. Trump drew fire this summer from Clinton and national security experts for encouraging Russia to “find” 30,000 unreleased emails from Clinton. He has also resisted identifying Russia as the country that breached the Democratic National Committee’s emails, in contrast to many experts. Clinton also plans to prioritize cybersecurity. In last week’s debate, she said the federal government under her command would take action in response to foreign hacking attacks. “We’re going to have to make it clear that we don’t want to use the kind of tools we have,” she said, adding: “But we will defend the citizens of this country.” She would enforce the use of security tools (like multifactor authentication), encourage government departments to consider “bug bounties,” in which the government pays hackers to show their systems’ vulnerabilities, and invest in emerging cybersecurity technologies. Net neutrality: Clinton said in her briefing that she supports the principle that Internet service providers can’t charge publishers and app makers different amounts for delivering videos, apps and other media to consumers, often called net neutrality. She backs the FCC’s decision in 2015 to stop broadband carriers from slowing down the Internet for some sites while charging others for faster service. A federal appeals court’s backing of that decision, which came down in June, was cheered by people in the tech industry who rely on a speedy Internet to run their products. “Hillary would defend these rules in court and continue to enforce them,” according to Clinton’s campaign website. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. But registered Republican Roger Royse, who works in Menlo Park and hosted a forum with GOP candidates last year in Silicon Valley, said he thinks Trump would not support net neutrality. In 2014, Trump tweeted that net neutrality “will target conservative media.” While net neutrality doesn’t actually police content, Trump has said he aims to cut down the government’s regulation of businesses in general. “His position is consistent with conservative and Republican ideology in that less regulation is better and there should really be good reasons before you let government start regulating something,” said Royse, who hasn’t decided whom he will vote for but is leaning toward Trump. Other regulations: Trump has not specifically mentioned the tech sector in his job creation plan, but some analysts believe his emphasis on reduced regulation would be favorable toward technological advances like self-driving cars, an emerging field that faces questions from privacy advocates and on topics such as how insurance will be applied. “Staying the course for (Trump) might actually be very supportive of the technology sector,” said Professor Steven Weber at UC Berkeley’s School of Information. “If he believes the tech sector is a source of economic growth, he ain’t going to kill the golden goose.” Still, Trump has criticized tech companies, including Apple. After Apple refused to assist the FBI in getting data from an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters last year, Trump said Apple should help the government’s cause. Apple said in a court document that complying could set a “dangerous precedent for conscripting Apple and other technology companies to develop technology to do the government’s bidding in untold future criminal investigations.” “Boycott Apple until such time until they give that information, I think that’s a great idea,” Trump said at a South Carolina event in February. Clinton has walked a finer line, saying she supports creating a commission on data security and encryption that would be made up of people in the public safety and technology fields. “Hillary rejects the false choice between privacy interests and keeping Americans safe,” according to her campaign briefing. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, co-hosted a fundraiser for Clinton in August and has also hosted a fundraiser for House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican. Cook has said that the government overreached in the Apple case, which was ultimately resolved when the FBI paid outside hackers to find a way into the shooter’s iPhone. As a general rule, Clinton “definitely sees technology as a great tool, as a great tool kit to deal with economically and just making the government work better,” said Linda Moore, CEO of TechNet, a bipartisan organization that represents the tech industry. In an interview last month, she said that her group was eager to hear a technology agenda from Trump, but “we haven’t seen anything out like that yet.” Free speech online: Clinton has also pushed for an open Internet abroad in countries like China and Russia that sometimes block access to the Web. Services like Twitter and Facebook are banned in China, for example. Trying to keep the Internet open is “an ongoing struggle with more oppressive regimes around the world ... who want to be able to shut it down at will (and) interfere with people’s freedom,” Clinton said at a San Francisco event in 2014. But she also wants to stop the Islamic State from continuing to use the Internet for recruiting, and she has urged social media companies to close terrorist-linked accounts. “We have got to shut down their Internet presence, which is posing the principal threat to us,” Clinton said at a New Hampshire town hall last year. Trump has also voiced concerns about people being recruited online by the Islamic State. In December, he said he would like to talk to Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, about possibly closing off parts of the Internet. (Gates is a Microsoft board member and adviser to CEO Satya Nadella, but lacking a day-to-day role at the company, it’s not clear how he would direct Microsoft’s Internet operations in the way Trump proposed, let alone affect the Internet more broadly.) “I sure as hell don’t want people who want to kill us and kill our nation (to) use our Internet,” Trump said in a CNN Republican presidential debate. But fundamentally, some analysts question whether Trump understands what tech is about (outside of using Twitter). The Republican candidate’s reference in the first presidential debate to “the cyber” and enthusiastic praise of his 10-year-old son’s computer abilities crystallized this for many. “Trump, not surprisingly, appears to have no coherent policy and little understanding of the issues,” said John Simpson with the privacy advocate group Consumer Watchdog. ©2016 the San Francisco Chronicle.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Remembering Steve Jobs on the 5th anniversary of his death by Seth Fiegerman   @sfiegerman October 5, 2016: 2:38 PM ET Tim Cook's Apple: 5 years in Bryson Gardner was in a meeting at Apple's headquarters on October 5, 2011, when he received a text from his wife: Steve Jobs had died. Gardner, who directed development for various iPod and iPhone models, remembers being struck by "an immediate realization of the impact of Steve Jobs on creating the company and changing the world." "Sadness and appreciation," is how Gardner, now CEO of Pearl Automation, sums up his feelings from that day. That sentiment also describes how much of the tech world feels on the fifth anniversary of Jobs' death. On Wednesday, Apple (AAPL, Tech30) employees, customers and members of the media paid tribute to the visionary cofounder and CEO who remains one of the most influential figures in Silicon Valley. "I think the industry has been feeling the impact of the lack of his presence," says Andy Grignon, a former senior manager at Apple who helped launch the original iPhone. The industry, he adds, is still trying to fill the "void" of a "true product visionary that could assemble the pieces into [products] people felt they had to have." Walt Mossberg, a veteran technology journalist who knew Jobs, echoed that sentiment. "I miss him. The tech industry misses him. He and his work are still guideposts," Mossberg wrote on Twitter. Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, remembered his predecessor and friend with one of his many powerful quotes. "Most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition." Remembering Steve and the many ways he changed our world. pic.twitter.com/ONAuEoq3uU— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) October 5, 2016 Apple set up a dedicated page on its website to highlight messages it has received from friends, colleagues and customers about Job's death. "Over a million people from all over the world have shared their memories, thoughts, and feelings about Steve," reads a post on Apple's website. "One thing they all have in common -- from personal friends to colleagues to owners of Apple products -- is how they've been touched by his passion and creativity." Related: Apple under Tim Cook: More socially responsible, less visionary One post on Apple's site from a man who identifies as a former employee of Pixar, a company Jobs sold to Disney, called Jobs a "champion" for "those of us that believe in our core that everything we do should matter -- that in everything there is a sacred art." "People have spoken of you as the Thomas Edison of our time, but perhaps they have it wrong," a fan wrote on the site. "Thomas Edison was the Steve Jobs of his time." Picture that hangs in Twitter HQ.#SteveJobs pic.twitter.com/zkxrEOUors— Carl Quintanilla (@carlquintanilla) October 5, 2016 Jobs died at the age of 56 from complications of pancreatic cancer. His final years as CEO were marked by the tremendous success of new devices like the iPad and especially the iPhone. Apple's market cap has skyrocketed to more than $600 billion since Jobs' death thanks in large part to the iPhone. However, Apple's remarkable 13-year run of year-over-year sales growth is now in danger as iPhone sales start to taper off. Under Cook, Apple has become more socially responsible, but employees say the company is also becoming more bureaucratic and less innovative. Cook and Apple have worked to move beyond the Steve Jobs era while simultaneously trying to protect Jobs' legacy. The founder's office at Apple remains intact. Top Apple execs have also pushed back against certain books and films claiming to tell Jobs' story. The fight to protect Jobs' legacy may be a losing battle, however. "Steve Jobs" is now shorthand for any entrepreneur or business leader looking to stand out from the pack -- for better or worse. Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) and Theranos, two tech companies that have been front and center this year for their corporate struggles, are each run by CEOs who have very clearly fashioned themselves after Jobs. Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of blood test startup Theranos, is fond of dressing in black turtlenecks like Jobs and applying his focus on total secrecy around products. That didn't stop her from getting banned from owning or operating a lab for two years. Jack Dorsey, the cofounder and CEO of Twitter, has borrowed so many lines from Jobs that there used to be a Tumblr collecting them all. He is now running two companies at once as Jobs did, but one of those companies, Twitter, is said to be on the chopping block. If anything, both CEOs may unintentionally serve as reminders of just how unique Steve Jobs really was.

One test on the sapphire cover of the rear-facing camera, calls into question whether lens cover is indeed made of sapphire after it's shown being scratched with picks designed to emulate the Mohs hardness scale. On the Mohs scale of hardness, sapphire rates a 9, coming in just under diamond at a 10 on the top of the scale. Its hardness makes it resistant to scratching, and so it's used by high-end watch makers and by Apple to cover the Home button and the rear camera of the iPhone 7. In the video, scratches are made on the iPhone 7 camera and a sapphire-equipped Tissot watch using specialized Mohs tools. With a pick the reviewer claims is "Mohs 6," he is able to make scratches on the camera lens, theorizing that it is made from sapphire-laminated glass or impure sapphire because sapphire should resist scratches at Mohs 6. This test, and others like it, have caused people to claim that Apple is lying about using pure sapphire crystal over the camera lens, prompting the company to release an official statement subtly calling into question the testing methods used in the video. The reviewer does use tools to determine the composition of the sapphire and finds carbon, but it is not clear that the test was done without contamination. Apple confirms the iPhone 7 camera lens is sapphire, and under proper testing conditions, achieves the hardness and purity results expected from sapphire.Last month, Apple's Phil Schiller also confirmed on Twitter that the rear lens cover on the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus are constructed from sapphire. @Lunnzies Not true. Camera lens cover and top of Home Button both Sapphire. #iPhone7— Philip Schiller (@pschiller) September 17, 2016 According to iMore's Rene Ritchie, there's a simple explanation for the discrepancy between Apple's claims and what's going on in the video. The tools used in the video aren't scratching the lens -- they're causing fracturing, as can even be seen when the sapphire is placed under the microscope, due to heavy pressure. Fracturing -- as opposed to scratching -- is what happens when you have something so incredibly thin -- unlike the much thicker watch used for comparison -- and you apply pressure with no level of control. You'd have to precisely apply the same level of force, likely to the same thickness of material, to properly do that test.Apple has used sapphire crystal for iPhone components for multiple years and maintains that sapphire crystal continues to be present in the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, a conclusion that was also ultimately reached in the video.

What, he's an Apple fanboy for citing the scientific reason why it scratched? God forbid living in a world constrained by the laws of nature. Rating: 31 Votes yanksfan114 6 weeks ago This is kind of off topic, but isn't it crazy how much you learn about random things in the world because of a phone? If it wasn't for smartphones I wouldn't know nearly as much about SoC's, display technology, materials (ceramic, glass, aluminum, sapphire), and even cameras. All the coverage on the little things that makes a smartphone great is really interesting stuff. Rating: 26 Votes LordVic 6 weeks ago Still won't stop the naysayers. I believe the reason why the camera scratched so easily is because there is a coating on it. well, doesnt' that kind of defeat the purpose of using sapphire then? the Sapphire is desired because of it's anti-scratch resistance. If they're just going to put a coating on top, that is more scratch prone, you've now just lowered your scratch resistence to the point of the coating, not the sapphire. Rating: 12 Votes verpeiler 6 weeks ago Rene Ritchie, the definition of an Apple fanboy. Stopped reading anything on iMore because of him. Rating: 10 Votes keysofanxiety 6 weeks ago Point is, the lens isn't going to scratch under normal scenarios when coming into contact with most objects. Speak for yourself. I frequently carry a diamond pick and blowtorch in my trouser pocket. Rating: 8 Votes randfee2 6 weeks ago First of all: I don't think that Phil Schiller or 'iMore's Renie Ritchie' actually know what sapphire is. If not sapphire (what one commonly expects it to be), this would be close to fraud. It doesn't really matter if one can still claim whether this aluminum oxide can still be called sapphire, for me what counts is the property people expect when they read 'sapphire' and that is HARDNESS!!!! Phil Schiller could sell sewage water as 'bottled water' yeah, but it wouldn't really be what people would expect. If you read 'sapphire' you buy it for it's hardness. If Apple-Sapphire is not as hard as the material everybody knows as 'sapphire' .... well.... dishonest/greedy... or incompetent. ....... DELETED I can promise you one thing. The second I get my hands on an older/broken iPhone, I will analyze it with the state of the art equipment I have at my disposal at work (1. Nanoindentation = proper hardness measurement, 2. XRD = x-ray diffractometry for crystallinity check). So if anyone has a spare part flying around, just message me, I can do this any day. My hunch is, that whatever apple calls this, it isn't nearly as hard as what everybody expects when they hear SAPPHIRE and that is what truly counts! edit: The EDS spectra he shows are not sampled right. Thanks to the lab assistant that forgot to explain to him - or him for misinterpreting. They say 'Map Sum Spectrum' and if they're from the maps he showed it is obvious where the silicon and carbon signals are coming from!!!! The coating on the inside of the coverglass! He needed to measure just the bulk material with a spot-sample in order to get the correct spectrum and my guess now is: - EDS done wrong --> bulk material actually pure aluminum oxide (crystallinity & hardness still unknown) - Hardness test scratched a second anti-reflection coating on the outside which is less hard (SiNx, SiCx, SiOx, MgF... whatever). This one is too thin to be seen using EDS --> ZOOM IN more using the SEM or use ellipsometry! I will test this myself in time and we will see. Rating: 7 Votes Bbqthis 6 weeks ago Rene Ritchie may take a lot of flak for being overly optimistic about Apple, but you have to be blind not to see the differences in the video between the marks on the watch and Phone. Night and day. Clean, narrow lines vs jagged, wide marks. Makes total sense. Rating: 6 Votes Relentless Power 6 weeks ago I was confident it was Saphirre. Even though none of my previous iPhones lens were scratched or prone to being scratched. Some just take care of their devices better than others in my opinion. Rating: 4 Votes Return Zero 6 weeks ago The fracturing vs. scratching is a completely sufficient explanation. Even diamonds can fairly easily be crushed or chipped with materials of much lower hardness. Proper hardness (scratch) tests are performed with much less force applied down into the glass compared to what is seen in the video. You want to make sure you are testing the surface hardness of the material, not the compressive or flexural strength.

Toggle Navigation A-   A+ Sign in News   Stock Home «Back Google Pixel may dent iPhone 7 hype Alnoor Peermohamed | Bengaluru Oct 05, 2016 11:53 PM IST India is among the six countries in the world where Google will launch its Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. With pre-orders starting on October 13, it could dissipate some of the hype around the Apple iPhone 7’s launch this Friday. Google’s Pixel range of phones have been designed entirely in-house and the prices, starting at Rs 57,000, are also similar to that of iPhone 7. The devices will go on sale by the end of October across Flipkart, Croma, Reliance Digital and Vijay Sales. Armed with Google’s artificial intelligence-powered assistant and top-notch hardware to boot, the Pixel and Pixel XL mark Google’s entry into the truly high-end smartphone market. While the previous Nexus devices were often compared to the iPhone, the search giant along with its partners sought that those devices were accessible to a larger number of buyers. “If you look at it from Google’s perspective, they’re trying to position Pixel as the most premium Android experience you can get. If the company can market it well in the next two-three weeks, they could attract mature Android buyers in the market for a new device and with the Samsung Note 7 debacle, I’d say Google is well placed,” said Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research. But, a big sticker price could mean low sales for the Pixel phones. Even Apple controls only three per cent of the smartphone market. Moreover, Apple heavily relies on older models of its iPhone, such as the 5s which sell for under Rs 20,000, to drive nearly half of its sales in the country. While Google has its work cut out cannibalising Samsung’s share in the premium smartphone market, experts say going after Apple will be a Herculean task. Samsung, a long-time partner of Google, is the only player that is giving Apple a tough fight in India’s premium device market, with HTC, Sony and LG being relegated to the sidelines. “The big question is if Google Pixel can position itself as the most advanced smartphone. That’s something we’re going to have to wait and see,” added Shah. Apple’s focus on growing its business in India suggests that the country is on the way to becoming one of the largest markets for premium smartphones. If Google wants to beat the iPhone with its Pixel phones, it is going to have to replicate or break the aspirational value which Apple has so successfully created for its devices. In terms of picking partners for India, Google is clearly showing global rivals Amazon and Apple that it is taking sides. The new Pixel smartphones will be sold exclusively on Flipkart. Google has also tapped one of Apple’s largest India partners — Reliance — which runs a large number of exclusive Apple stores in the country. “Both Google Pixel and the iPhone could be technologically pari passu products of equal importance, of equal value, of equal affinity, but in image terms the two are like chalk and cheese. Apple is the platinum standard of the industry whereas Google is a ration shop for information. So, Google needs to invest a lot more than depend on the laurels of being the most accepted, the most daily used and the most intrusively used brand in India,” said Harish Bijoor, a brand consultant. Being a services company before becoming a device maker, Google knows a thing or two about a wholesome experience, and isn’t leaving it solely up to its new Pixel phones to woo buyers. The firm, which will offer 24x7 device support for its new smartphones, has also extended the service to India, setting up a dedicated call centre for its buyers here.

Taiwan asks Google to blur images of South China Sea island Google cuts its giant electricity bill with AI How to make an honest robot? Google takes on the challenge The string of announcements -- including the $649 Pixel, a smart speaker for the living room dubbed “Home,” a virtual reality headset, and a new Wi-Fi router -- is the clearest sign yet that Google intends to compete head to head with Apple, Amazon.com, Inc. and even manufacturers of phones using its own Android mobile operating system. Unlike earlier Google phone efforts under the Nexus brand, the Pixel devices are designed and developed by Google from the start, although Taiwan’s HTC Corp. will serve as the contract manufacturer. SWIPE AT APPLE Taking another page from the Apple playbook, Google said it would work exclusively with a single carrier in the United States, Verizon Communications, Inc., on the Pixel, emulating Apple’s agreement to launch the original iPhone with AT&T, Inc. That deal gave Apple unprecedented control over the look of the phone and how it worked. The phone comes in two sizes, and its high-end camera is one of few distinguishing features, analysts said. The phones come in black, blue and silver and will be able to get up to a seven-hour charge in 15 minutes. Pre-orders began on Oct. 4. “Aside from the camera, the new Google Pixels are pretty undifferentiated compared to Samsung and iPhone seventh generation phones,” industry analyst Patrick Moorhead said. While the new phones are clearly aimed at competing with the iPhone -- Google executives took several swipes at Apple in their on-stage remarks -- analysts said Android rivals like Samsung Electronics could be the biggest victim if the Pixel takes off. Google’s strategy of licensing Android for free and profiting from embedded services such as search and maps made Android the dominant mobile operating system with some 89% of the global market, according to IDC. But Apple still rules the high end of the market, and Google has long been frustrated by the emergence of many variations of Android and the inconsistent experience that has produced. Pushing its own hardware will likely complicate its relationship with Android licensees, analysts said. ALL-PURPOSE ASSISTANT Google kicked off the event Tuesday by touting the Google Assistant, the company’s voice-activated artificial intelligence system and its answer to Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. The presenter showed how customers could make a restaurant reservation with a few phrases spoken into the phone. The assistant will be embedded into the Pixel and Home products and is being positioned as the central feature in a family of integrated hardware and software products. It is one of a handful of similar assistants that are vying for supremacy as more people search the Web and make purchases online using voice commands, which may eventually supplant keyboards and touchscreens as the primary means of controlling digital devices. While Google is often cited as the leader in artificial intelligence, Amazon stole a march on the company with its Alexa-powered Echo home speaker system, a surprise hit. The Home device and the Echo have many of the same features. Google’s “Daydream View” virtual reality headset, meanwhile, puts the company in competition with Facebook, Inc., owner of Oculus. The device, which works with an Android phone, is far cheaper and simpler. It will be available in November for $79, in time for the end-of-year shopping season. Home will also be available in November for $129, including a six-month trial of ad-free YouTube. -- Reuters    MORE STORIES Snapchat parent secretly files for one of the biggest tech IPOs Review: "Moto Z: Best modular phone?"

(Reuters/Gary Hershorn) Share Written by Max de Haldevang Obsession Borders October 05, 2016 If you’re outraged by Donald Trump’s reported avoidance of federal taxes for 18 years, then make sure you’re sitting down. America’s biggest companies—including some whose products you’re probably using right now, such as Apple, Microsoft and Nike—hold nearly $2.5 trillion of accumulated profits in offshore accounts to avoid paying US taxes, according to a report by the advocacy group US PIRG. US PIRG estimates that the US government is missing out on $100 billion a year in federal taxes from at least 367 Fortune 500 companies because of these tax havens. While many of these companies do not disclose what they would expect to pay in US taxes if they did not hold those profits offshore, US PIRG extrapolates from existing information to estimate that they would have to pay $717.8 billion in federal taxes if all that money were repatriated all at once. Some stats to give you an idea of just how much that $717.8 billion would mean to the United States: It’s over six times the annual cost of Obamacare (estimated at $110 billion in 2016) It’s around 30 percent more than the total annual cost of all US elementary and secondary schools It’s around 20 percent over the US defense budget ($595bn in 2016) If that pool of unpaid federal taxes were a country’s GDP, it would be the 19th largest in the world (above Switzerland, Saudi Arabia and Nigeria) The money is held in over 10,000 subsidiaries, in tax havens including the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Luxembourg, Ireland, and the Netherlands. Update: Nike said in a statement: “We fully comply with tax regulations, and we rigorously ensure our tax filings are fully aligned with the economic substance of how we run our business.” Apple, Microsoft, Citigroup and Oracle all either declined to comment or didn’t reply to emailed requests for comment this afternoon. Apple was hit with a $14.5 billion tax bill by the European Commission this year for funneling its profits into a stateless shell company and paying absurdly low taxes on them. Apple has said it will appeal the decision. CEO Tim Cook has also said it will only repatriate money to the US and make it subject to federal taxes once the country undertakes tax reforms. In a report published today, Standard & Poor’s Global suggests incentivizing companies to repatriate their offshore money by offering a one-off relief on taxation but requiring them to invest 15 percent of repatriated funds in bonds to upgrade ailing US infrastructure. The issue has also come up in the presidential campaign, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton advocating an “exit tax” on corporations, and Republican Donald Trump suggesting cutting the corporate tax rate to encourage companies to keep their money in the US, and incentivizing them to repatriate money that’s overseas. As Trump has asserted regarding his own tax situation, these companies haven’t done anything illegal–so why does this matter? Well, apart from the fact that it forces ordinary people and smaller companies to pay more taxes to keep up the roads, schools, and military, it also makes a mockery of trickle-down economics. Former British opposition leader Ed Miliband adroitly explained this after reams of information about how wealthy people and companies use tax havens were exposed in the Panama Papers leak: If the top echelons of society and business stockpile their cash offshore and don’t pay taxes on it, there’s very little to “trickle down” and enable social mobility of the rest of us. “For 30 years, since Reagan and Thatcher, the basic view has been, ‘Be nice to the super-rich and their wealth will trickle down,’” Miliband told the Guardian. “That is the big lesson of Panama for me. It doesn’t trickle down; it gets stashed.” This story was updated with a comment from Nike. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Both macOS Sierra and iOS 10.1 public betas can be downloaded over-the-air through Apple’s Software Update mechanism on devices enrolled in the beta program. iOS devices must have the proper certificate installed to run public betas. iOS 10.1 includes a beta of Portrait mode in the stock Camera app for taking depth of field photographs with the bokeh effect on the dual-lens iPhone 7 Plus devices. There’s also a brand new switch in Settings that allows you to turn on the Reduce Motion feature without disabling bubble and screen animations in Messages. iOS 10.1 beta 2 was seeded yesterday to Apple’s registered developers. macOS Sierra beta 3 was pushed to developers on Monday. When it releases for public consumption, macOS Sierra 10.12.1 will bring support for a dedicated Portrait album in the stock Photos app. The Portrait album is where any bokeh images taken with the iPhone 7 Plus’s dual-lens camera will be stored.

(Photo: File) 93 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE OAK HARBOR - When attending the 38th Annual Oak Harbor Apple Festival, there's no surprise finding apples for sale. But apples are involved in almost all phases of this festival, according to Oak Harbor Chamber of Commerce Director Valerie Winterfield said. The festival opens at 9 a.m. Saturday in downtown Oak Harbor, with the 2016-17 Royalty Contest planned for 9:30 a.m. on the Main Stage, continuing until 10 p.m. A second full day of activities is planned for Sunday from 11 a.m. until 5 p.m. Additional activities are scheduled for Friday night starting with the judging of six categories of apple baked goods, Winterfield said. "They usually have 50 to 60 entrants," she said. Contestants bake everything from apple pies to apple bread and apple cupcakes plus there is a juvenile division. "People who want to come can taste test and have coffee," she said. The contest is held at 6 p.m. Friday  in the Oak Harbor Municipal Building. Tasters can make donations toward the festival and the trophies that are handed out during the weekend. Chamber leaders said the festival relies on two area apple orchards, Bergman Orchard in Catawba and Moore Orchard which bring in their apples. For 2016, two new events were added to the lineup and one, of course, is an apple event. There will be chainsaw carving and an apple sculpture contest, which allows artists to create using any medium and the design must include an apple theme. "For the most part, we stick with the events that everyone loves," Winterfield said. The biggest event is the Grand Parade at 2 p.m. Saturday, which draws thousands of people. Other major draws are the beer tent and its live entertainment, this year featuring Corduroy Road followed by The Junk on Saturday night. On Sunday, the big draws are the Apple Festival Car Show, noon to 4 p.m. and the Apple Festival 5K Run at 2 p.m. Winterfield said the apple theme is also incorporated into the awards. "All our trophies have apples on them." Plus, everyone who runs the 5K receives an apple to eat at the end. Then there the food vendors at the festival. "There are a couple apple dumplings; there are apple fritters, apple cookies and apple-steamed items available," Winterfield said. With the orchards participating, there are also apples for sale and the local Boy Scouts cook a kettle of apple butter to sell on Saturday and Sunday. The chamber director said that with the local orchards, it makes sense for the festival to have an apple theme.

vator vatorX vatornews Register Log in Newsroom Innovation series Interviews Lessons learned Trends & news Should Apple buy Netflix? Bernstein analysts say no Apple should partner with Netflix on a subscription service, rather than buying it outright Financial trends and news by Steven Loeb October 5, 2016 | Comments Short URL: http://vator.tv/n/477c These days it seems like Twitter is sucking up most of the oxygen in the M&A conversation, so it's easy to forget that there are plenty of other game-changing deals potentially in the works. In fact, there's another private company that's currently undergoing its own round of acquisition speculation. There have been multiple reports in the last week or so of Disney being a possible buyer for Netflix, thanks to the company's slowing subscriber growth and its weaker than expected second quarter. Much like Google and Twitter, there's another company that's always lurking in the shadows whenever a potential Netflix takeover starts looking likely: Apple. It's one of those rumors that's been out there for years, and now that Netflix is slumping a bit, and with Disney's interest becoming a real possibility, of course Apple's name would come back into the conversation. With Apple being the most profitable company in history, it could of course buy Netflix if it wanted, but should it? The answer, according to a note from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein on Wednesday, is no. Such a deal "would be highly out of character for Apple on many fronts," he wrote, since the company "historically has not done large deals" and "it does not purchase and run established  businesses." That doesn't mean there aren't some compelling reasons why Apple might view Netflix as a potential target.  "We think buying Netflix to run exclusively on iOS and AppleTV is not a value-creating thesis and could not possibly justify a $50B price tag. More plausibly, Apple could buy Netflix and continue to run it as it does today, believing that it could create meaningful revenue accretion or cost reduction through its brand, marketing reach, and operational prowess," Sacconaghi wrote, noting that it would all $8 billion to Apple's revenue. The more important reason for Apple to buy Netflix would be to use the service to shift toward a subscription-based model, something that the analysts at Bernstein would like to see happen.  "We believe AAPL could and should look to build a subscription offering of features and services that could be bundled with its hardware offerings, analogous to what Amazon does with Amazon Prime. Netflix (at a discounted price for only iPhone or iPad users who buy Apple hardware as a subscription) could be a key element of an attractive services bundle," it says in the note.  Rather than buy Netflix, though, Sacconaghi thinks it would make more financial sense for the two services to partner.  "Overall, we do not see a compelling rationale for Apple to acquire Netflix, and believe Apple will more likely partner or compete with Netflix than acquire it. That said, it is very hard to estimate its likelihood and potential impact on Netflix’s fundamentals. As a result, we do not believe the potential for a partnership or acquisition by Apple justifies owning NFLX." That covers the potential deal from Apple's point of view, but what about Netflix? Why would the company want to sell? Most likely it doesn't, but the rumors have been spreading thanks to the company's down performance so far this year. In the second quarter, the company added 1.7 million subscribers during the quarter, including 160,000 memberships in the U.S. and 1.52 million internationally. That was below its own expectations of 2.5 million, which included 500,000 members in the U.S. and 2 million internationally. As a result, Netflix shares dropped 15 percent in after-hours trading. Netflix had seen its stock drop 14 percent year-to-date by the end of September, but it has since been bouyed a bit by speculation of a takeover. It is now down 7.75 percent year-to-date. It is up 3.52 percent in regular trading on Wednesday, to $105.94 a share. Netflix will be releasing its third quarter numbers on October 17. VatorNews reached out to Netflix and Apple for comment, but neither was available at this time.

After successfully funding its third Kickstarter campaign, smartwatch pioneer Pebble started shipping the first wave of Pebble 2 watches to its backers on Sept. 30. The new watch features a heart rate sensor -- a first for the company -- and the same PebbleOS features we first saw introduced and expanded upon since the introduction of the Pebble Time lineup in early 2015 Outside of the heart rate sensor, Pebble 2 doesn't add much in terms of features to the Pebble experience, which has left me searching for a reason to recommend it. Specifications Battery: Up to 7 days Sensors: Heart rate, 3-axis accelerometer, Ambient light Display: 1.26-inch ePaper liquid crystal with LED backlight Compatibility: Android 4.3 and up; iOS 8 and up Dimensions: 39.5mm x 30.2mm x 9.8mm thick, with additional 1.4mm bump for heart-rate sensor on bottom. Similar design, just refined I met with Pebble CEO Eric Migicovsky in May 2016 in his company's offices in Redwood City, Calif. As we sat in a conference room across the table from one another, Eric removed a single device from a black Pelican case and handed it to me. Read this Smartwatches aren't the next big thing. The next big thing is already here One chart shows why it's going to be an uphill battle for smartwatch makers to convince buyers to hand over their cash. History is repeating itself, while the real gadget innovation is coming from another direction. Read More I recall him telling me something along the lines of "This is Pebble 2," yet the words didn't quite register with me. Despite his proclamation, I immediately thought I was holding the original Pebble smartwatch. After a few seconds, I began to notice small differences between the two devices. Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 The side buttons on the Pebble 2 don't stick out as far and are closer together. The watch is also thinner than its predecessor. And you can't help but notice the optical heart-rate sensor on the back, emitting green light in a rapid pattern searching for a pulse. During the last week as I've worn it, that nostalgia hasn't left me. It's a comfortable watch to wear, light enough for me to to often forget I was even wearing it until the next alert arrived and the gentle buzz reminded me it was there. You can still swap out bands on the Pebble 2 with your own 22mm bands. An immediate downside to refining the old design, instead of completely rethinking it, is the size of the display on Pebble 2 at 1.25 inches. After wearing the 42mm Apple Watch for the past few weeks, with a screen size of 1.65 inches, the Pebble 2 screen looks tiny. It's all about heart As competition grew among smartwatch manufacturers, Pebble was often criticized for not doing enough with its product portfolio. With the Pebble Time lineup, the company launched Pebble Health to count steps and monitor sleep, but heart rate activity was still missing. That changes with Pebble 2, with the company using an optical sensor similar to what you'd find on a Fitbit or even the Apple Watch. Users can pick a watch face that displays regular heart-rate readings, or view a graph of readings within the Pebble app on an Android or iOS device. I pitted the Pebble 2's heart rate sensor against Samsung's Gear IconX earbuds and the Apple Watch Series 2, with all three devices often capturing nearly identical readings in controlled tests. Meaning, I was sitting still, with Workout mode active on all three devices to ensure constant heart-rate recordings. Gallery: Pebble 2 + Heart Rate SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 12 NEXT PREV Outside of those few tests, I found a few random reports of my heart rate jumping to over 150 beats per minute (bpm) for a reading, then go right back down to my normal resting rate between 70 and 80 bpm when wearing the Pebble 2. One reading of 197 bpm was in the middle of the night, while I was sleeping. I hope I would wake up if my heart was beating that fast in the middle of the night. Looking through previous heart-rate recordings from the Apple Watch or older Fitbit devices, I've yet to find a reading that high, especially while I was asleep. On another occasion, I removed the Pebble 2 from my wrist in the middle of the day and placed it on my desk. Later that afternoon, I put it back on, and then noticed it recorded the time it was sitting on my desk as a nap. Only, I wasn't sleeping. I wasn't even wearing the watch. After mentioning the issue to Pebble, a representative informed me the watch cannot detect if you are or aren't wearing it, and to prevent false sleep recordings when you take the watch off, it should be placed on its charger. It's unapologetically Pebble, but is that enough? Pebble's Timeline feature, shortcut to favorite apps, and quick launcher all come preinstalled on the Pebble 2. Battery life tops out at seven days, according to Pebble. In my experience, I was able to get five days out of the battery. The display is easy to read in the sun, as is expected with ePaper technology. The buttons are firm, yet not too hard to press, and voice commands were reliable. So the Pebble 2 gets good marks across the board when it comes to performance, but the kicker is that it's the same experience I get from my Pebble Time watch. Same notifications, apps, display quality (plus color!), battery life, voice commands, and overall experience. Well, except that heart-rate sensor. Buy now, or wait? The longer I've used the Pebble 2, the more I struggled when coming up with a recommendation. At $129, the Pebble 2 is a steal whether you view it as a fitness band or a smartwatch. Here's where I landed: for someone who is unsure if a fitness tracker or smartwatch is right for them, the Pebble 2 is an inexpensive device to test the waters with. It gets the basics right and doesn't break the bank. With that said, Pebble will begin shipping the $199 Pebble Time 2 in November, with a nearly identical feature set to the Pebble 2. Only, Pebble Time 2 gains a color display that is 53 percent larger than the current Pebble Time display (making it roughly that much larger than the Pebble 2 display). For someone who wants a bigger battery and improved display, the Time 2 is the Pebble smartwatch you're looking for.

War on Apple, war on Amazon, war on Samsung. War, even, on perceptions of what the search engine giant is capable of in the consumer space. At Tuesday’s much hyped event, Google made its strongest ever declaration that, more so than any other competitor, it is best positioned to become ubiquitous in every aspect of a person’s digital life. Competitors, allies, and security concerns be damned. It started with a relaunch. Or, rather, a rebirth. Nexus, Google’s homegrown smartphone brand since 2010, is no more. Instead, we now have Pixel. Nexus devices were built in cooperation with Android manufacturers to be reference devices, something developers and users alike could enjoy for their “pure” software experience and their mid- to high-end specifications. It was all served in reasonably attractive designs and for reasonably attractive prices (2014’s Nexus 6 notwithstanding). Pixel changes that. Brushing aside Android manufacturers — mainly Samsung — who compete to take on Apple’s iPhone, Google has decided to do things itself. With that move goes any pretence of sharing branding. HTC (who built the first Android device way back in 2008) might be constructing Google’s new phones, but their name appears nowhere on the Pixel and its larger sibling, the Pixel XL. These are “made by Google,” as advertising claims, from the inside out. Google Pixel, Photo: Google On the face of it, Google’s strategy is sound. They alone are best positioned to tackle the strongest aspect of the iPhone: Apple’s control over every aspect, from hardware to software. Google develops Android. Google designed the Pixel devices. The parallels are glaringly obvious. That makes it all the more surprising — or, perhaps, appropriate — that Google’s first foray into Apple-style smartphones should be so derivative. At a glance, neither the 5-inch Pixel nor the 5.5-inch Pixel XL could be described as beautiful. Parallels with the iPhone abound, from the large bezels to the antenna bands, the curved sides to the glass and metal backs. If Google truly wanted to stand out, they should have made the anti-iPhone. Last year’s Nexus 6P had Cylon chic. The Pixel feels familiar — and not in a good way. The Pixel feels familiar — and not in a good way. Google at least ticked most of the boxes that mattered when it came to specs. Apart from the smaller Pixel having a 5-inch, 1080p display and the larger adding half an inch and Quad HD resolution, their internals are identical. The latest Qualcomm processor, 4GB of RAM, up to 128GB of storage, AMOLED displays, rear-mounted fingerprint sensors, tough Corning Gorilla Glass 4, and USB Type-C fast charging that can add 7 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes. While Apple embraces dual cameras, Google is touting that its single 12.3 megapixel sensor is currently the best in the world — as measured by independent tester DxOMark. It’s got large, light-absorbing pixels, a smarter Auto HDR+ function, and a revised camera app that launches faster and takes photos quicker and more accurately. To bolster their claims, anyone who buys a Pixel phone will get free, unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos. Google Pixel and Pixel XL, Photo: Google Running everything is Android 7.1, Google’s latest version of their homegrown software. But unlike Nexus devices of old, Google has abandoned offering “pure” Android and instead developed a skin on top that adds new icons, a new app launcher, easier access to Google’s search app, and various other improvements and tweaks for usability. There’s even 24/7 support by either phone or chat, with users able to share their screen with Google’s engineers to diagnose any problems that arise. The smaller Pixel starts at $649. The larger Pixel tops out at $869. That’s iPhone money. Unfortunately, the Pixels aren’t perfect. There’s no microSD card support, no waterproofing, their batteries aren’t the largest, their profiles aren’t the slimmest, their design is certainly far from the best out there (that’s currently a toss-up between the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 Edge). This would be fine if Google were charging Nexus money, but they’re not. Pixel is Google’s premium brand, appearing previously on a Chromebook and Android tablet. The smaller Pixel starts at $649. The larger Pixel tops out at $869. That’s iPhone money. It took Samsung six generations of Galaxy and five generations of Note to justify charging what Apple can for its smartphones. Google is doing so right out of the gate. That’s a bold assumption, not just that its devices are worthy of the price tag, but that consumers, who’ve thus far opted for Galaxy over Nexus, will be willing to pay that much for a phone with a Google logo on the back. So, where’s the value? For Google, it’s seemingly in Assistant. Google Assistant is the search giant’s rival for Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana. It’s a powerful, knowledgeable, constantly-learning AI that can engage in conversational search queries with users to facilitate their day-to-day activities. And it’s built into both Pixel phones. Ask your phone to find movies in your area and it will. Tell it “I need to bring my kids” and Google’s conversation ability will connect your statement to the previous search and then filter films by rating. Check your schedule, plan for lunch, and Google Assistant will find a restaurant, book a table and add it to your calendar, all without opening an app. It’s Google’s attempt to elbow into an area where users would previously have had to open multiple apps and input multiple fields of data just to get things done — and all without needing to know specific voice commands. Just tell Assistant what you need and it’ll do it, Google claims. Google Assistant, Photo: Google It’s something that conveys to Google’s other big announcement, Google Home, their answer to Amazon’s Echo. Two years after Amazon first launched its Alexa-powered speaker, Google is finally ready to do battle, but they’re seriously behind. Echo has 3,000 apps that allow users to search, buy, order, question, and command various aspects of their life. Home won’t launch with the same level of third-party support. Instead, it’ll focus on the basics: answering questions, controlling smart home products such as lights, playing music from Spotify, YouTube Music, Google Play and other sources, and setting timers, creating shopping lists and offering traffic updates, among other things. It’ll also connect with Google’s other products. If you own Google’s Chromecast streaming dongle, wake Google Home with “OK Google” and ask it to show you videos of John Oliver. It’ll connect to your Chromecast, automatically turn on your TV, load up YouTube and stream Last Week Tonight — all without pressing a button. Google Home, Photo: Google The $129 Home, which launches in November, offers support for multiple devices and will intelligently respond depending on which Home is closest to the person speaking. But it’s the potential for the future that is most impressive. Google is changing its core mandate — search — from something universal into something personal. Google’s event wasn’t really about Pixel, or Home, or its Daydream View virtual reality headset, or its Wifi routers, or its new, Ultra HD Chromecast. It was about Assistant. And it was about positioning Assistant as something that will become pervasive in a person’s life. With Assistant on a phone, learning a person’s daily routine, detecting the locations they visit, liaising with the apps they install, responding to them and planning their lives, that’s a lot of data for Google to process. It’s data that can be shared directly with Home. Or with any other system that integrates Assistant, such as cars or computers in future. Google’s new products, Photo: Google Google is changing its core mandate — search — from something universal into something personal. It’s no coincidence that teasers for the Pixel launch showcased a Google search bar transforming into the outline of a phone. Assistant is Google search everywhere, in all parts of our life. Is that a security concern? For some, absolutely. They’ll worry about Google knowing too much about them, using data to drive advertisements or personalize products. But the potential is, without doubt, tempting. An ever-evolving AI, smarter than Siri, more instant than Google Search, always ready to help. Apple trades on its exemplary hardware. Samsung trades on offering an alternative to Apple. Amazon is pushing into the home to get people hooked on its purchasing platform. Google’s Pixel phones are expensive, relatively uninteresting, and undoubtedly polished, while Home is a fledgling but promising smart home speaker system. But it’s Assistant that Google will be trading on in future. Google, everywhere, all the time. What remains to be seen is whether consumers buy into it. Or whether its inevitability doesn’t hinge on people buying a potentially overpriced “made by Google” smartphone anyway. Assistant is the future, whether we want it or not. Pixel, Pixel XL and Google Home are available to pre-order now directly from Google. Feed Your Email News, Reviews, Contests, Coverboy, Discounts and More!

Lee Oct 5, 2016, 1:40pm EDT tweet share Google CEO Sundar Pichai Ramin Talaie/Getty Images Google’s Android dominates the smartphone market overall, but Apple has attracted a disproportionate share of high-end users — and consequently an outsize share of smartphone profits. At a Tuesday event, Google unveiled a two-pronged strategy to change that. Part one was the Pixel, the first smartphone that will be designed and manufactured by Google. Google is betting that building its own phone will allow it to offer the same kind of seamless user experience Apple provides its own users. But the second prong of Google’s strategy is more original and received more attention on Tuesday. The company wants to make voice-based artificial intelligence a much bigger part of how people interact with their smartphones. Google envisions a future where you’ll make restaurant reservations, look up photos, and play music by talking to your phone instead of tapping and swiping on its screen. This article is part of New Money, a new section on economics, technology, and business. Obviously, this isn’t a totally new idea, as all the major smartphone platforms have had voice-based personal assistants — Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana — for several years. But Google says it’s about to make this technology a lot better — so much better that people will use it a lot more. If anyone can pull this off, it’s Google. Making AI really good requires a lot of data to “train” sophisticated machine learning algorithms. Wrangling large amounts of data has always been Google’s specialty. But even if the company can build a voice-based AI that can really understand a wide variety of requests, I’m still skeptical it will change the smartphone game as much as Google hopes. Apple’s knack for design is a big advantage in the smartphone market Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Apple has a designed-focused culture and is known for its polished, elegant, and user-friendly user interfaces. By contrast, Google has a culture that’s focused on delivering fast and reliable online services. Google’s business model for Android puts it at a further disadvantage in the user interface department. Apple designs both the hardware and software for the iPhone, allowing it to guarantee users a seamless experience. Google, by contrast, licenses Android as open source software to dozens of smartphone manufacturers, many of which customize it themselves, leading to a cacophony of different and often mediocre user interfaces. The iPhone’s greater polish is a big reason the iPhone is disproportionately popular at the high end of the market, and why Apple is able to charge a healthy premium for the iPhone. Android has the biggest market share in the smartphone business overall, but Google earns much less in profit from the smartphone business than Apple does. Many iPhone users nevertheless enjoy Google services like search, maps, and Gmail. But the fact that the iPhone’s operating system sits between Google and many of its users gives Apple a lot of leverage. In 2014, Google paid Apple $1 billion to maintain its status as the default search engine on the iPhone. Google is trying to build a truly useful voice-based assistant Google’s Mario Queiroz shows off Google Home, Google’s answer to the Amazon Echo. Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The executives onstage never said so explicitly, but several of Google’s announcements on Tuesday were clearly aimed at knocking Apple from its high-end smartphone throne. Most obviously, the Android Pixel is Google’s most direct challenge yet to the iPhone. Google’s earlier line of Nexus phones were designed and manufactured by third parties; by contrast, Google is planning to bring most of this work in house for Pixel. The hope is that by owning the whole “stack” — software, hardware, and online service — Google will be able to match the seamless user experience Apple has long offered to its users. But Google doesn’t just want to ape the iPhone; it wants a way to differentiate its products from the iPhone. Google believes its real secret weapon is a new user interface based on voice recognition and artificial intelligence. In a sense, this is just a souped-up version of Google’s existing voice recognition feature, Google Now. Apple and Microsoft have their own competing versions, Siri and Cortana. And these products don’t seem to have had a big impact on the market. But Google believes that’s just because the technology is not good enough yet. Google has been working to improve its voice feature in three directions: Google is planning to improve the voice recognition capability itself, improving accuracy of the speech recognition and increasing the complexity of requests it can understand. Google has been working on other AI-based technologies — like advanced image recognition — to expand the range of requests Google’s personal assistant can handle. Google is expanding its personal assistant to more devices, particularly Google Home, a new wifi-connected speaker that competes with the Amazon Echo. An example can help to illustrate what Google has in mind here. Right now, if you want to look at photos from a vacation you took last summer, you’d open your photo app and scroll back until you find the date you want. Google envisions a totally different approach. You’d say, “Okay, Google, show me pictures from my vacation last July.” Android would understand the request and call up the photos. Google’s Photos app demonstrates that Google is already well on its way to developing the image recognition technology to make this work. You can already ask Google Photos to show you photos that contain snow, or a dog, or a particular friend. Google hopes to bring these capabilities — and more — to its personal assistant, so you can ask complex queries like, “Show me pictures from 2014 that have Aunt Lisa and dogs in them.” It’s easy to be skeptical of this kind of thing, since the existing smartphone “personal assistant” technologies aren’t very good. They get confused often enough that it’s usually easier to just do things the old-fashioned way. But artificial intelligence technology is advancing rapidly, and Google insists that it will soon be good enough that voice-based personal assistants will “just work.” If voice-based search becomes capable enough, it could reach a tipping point where it’s easier to just ask the voice assistant for the information you need than to open up the appropriate app and find it the old-fashioned way. This would be particularly good news for Google because it would play to the company’s strengths. It would essentially be putting search back at the center of the user experience. Making this kind of smart voice assistant work will require oceans of information. Computer scientists have found that tasks like image and voice recognition work best when they have huge numbers of examples they can use to “train” the algorithms. A smart AI system also needs to know lots of facts about the world so that it can respond to complex queries. Collecting and organizing information has always been one of Google’s strengths — after all, Google’s mission statement is to organize the world’s information. At the same time, it would downgrade Apple’s big strength — the ability to make elegant, user-friendly devices. If the main way people interact with smartphones is by asking them questions, the particular device will become less important — just as the advent of the web made the difference between PCs and Macs much less important. Google is also hoping to continue the shift toward more and more user data stored online instead of on users’ local devices. Pixel buyers get unlimited, free storage for their photos and videos. That’s a good selling point for the Pixel, but more importantly, it will mean that Google can offer users access to their content from any device. Google envisions a future where users ask their Google Home smart speaker to put photos from their vacation on the TV. That kind of future would play to Google’s strength — managing massive quantities of data online. Why AI might not be the secret weapon Google is hoping for Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images It’s easy to understand why Google would like to essentially make voice-based searches a central part of how people interact with their phones and other devices. But even if Google manages to build a sophisticated voice assistant that can respond to a wide variety of requests, I’m skeptical that will give Google a significant leg up in the smartphone wars. The canned demos in Google’s presentation were impressive, of course — canned demos usually are. But the question to ask is how much of the time we spend interacting with our smartphones would be improved by a smart voice assistant. One problem is that talking to your phone isn’t always convenient. There are many social settings — at the office, in line at the grocery store, on the bus — where people around you are likely to be annoyed if you’re constantly barking commands at your phone. In those situations, you’re going to want to discreetly type or scroll your way to the information you’re looking for, so people are still going to care how user-friendly the old-fashioned touch-based interface is. But more importantly, a lot of the time people spend on their phones — perhaps most of it — just wouldn’t be improved by a personal voice assistant. People spend a ton of time scrolling through posts on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, reading text messages, swiping through Tinder profiles, and so forth. Even with a task like finding photos, scrolling quickly through photo thumbnails will often be an easier way to find photos than trying to describe the photo you’re looking for. Often if you’re looking for an old photo, you don’t remember exactly when it was taken or what was in the photo. It’s helpful to scroll back to roughly the right time, look at a few photos at random, and use that to jog your memory about the context of the photo. This kind of browsing will probably always be faster on an old-fashioned touch-based interface than with voice-based queries. Disclosure: My brother works at Google. Was this article helpful?

A newly awarded patent describes technology that is capable of scanning fingerprints almost anywhere on the screen of an iOS device - making the home button obsolete. The latest application suggests using a special lens behind the display that connects the screen and sensors, allowing the device to capture an accurate print reading. Scroll down for video  Apple killed the headphone jack and its next victim could be the home button. A recent patent describes a special lens behind the screen that scans fingerprints anywhere on the surface. Rumors of Apple doing away with the iconic home button isn’t groundbreaking news - many believed the firm would leave it out of the iPhone 7 design. A ‘person familiar with the matter’, told Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Gareth Allan last month that fingerprint sensors would be built into the screen, which was also speculated to be a larger, all-glass design. But many, if not all, iOS users know that wasn’t the case. And now analysts say the iPhone 8 is the one to wait for.

Share this article Share 18 shares END OF THE HOME BUTTON?  Apple's latest patent reveals technology that places the home button underneath the display. The innovation uses an electrostatic lens that connects the connect the screen and sensors, allowing the device to accurately read fingerprints on the screen. Depending on the position of these lenses, relative voltage and shape, the layer or layers are able to shape or bend the electric field associate with the user’s finger, reports AppleInsider. These specially designed lenses would also reduce the spreading of the electric field of a user’s finger when placed on the screen, as this type of bending can sometimes offset a fingerprint’s natural dispersion. Next year's handset may feature a wider display that reaches from one edge of the device to the other and a home button integrated into the screen. Apple’s recent patent, entitled ‘Capacitive fingerprint sensor including an electrostatic lens’ was filed in September 2014 and awarded Tuesday October 4, when it was first spotted by Patently Apple. Images in the document suggest the capacitive ‘fingerprint sensor with electrostatic lenses, one or two pattern conductive layers, which would detect fingerprints on the entire display or a portion of it’. Depending on the position of these lenses, relative voltage and shape, the layer or layers are able to shape or bend the electric field associate with users' fingerprints, reports AppleInsider. These specially designed lenses would also reduce the spreading of the electric field of a user’s finger when placed on the screen, as this type of bending can sometimes offset a fingerprint’s natural dispersion. A patent from May shows another method to kill the home button. This innovation also places the sensor under the display, but instead uses ultrasound imaging to find the user’s fingerprint - which could mean a handset that is 'all screen'. Pictured is a concept drawing  As noted by Apple, electric fields associated with the finger can be described as cones. ‘Electrostatic lens may shape the electric field associated with a user's finger, altering unshaped cones to produce shaped cones, which represent the reduced spread of electric field information from user's finger due to the use of example electrostatic lens,’ explains the patent. Depending on the position of these lenses, relative voltage and shape, the layer or layers are able to shape or bend the electric field associate with users' fingerprint. This bridges the gap between the screen and the sensor These specially designed lens (pictured) would also reduce the spreading of the electric field of a user’s finger when placed on the screen, as this type of bending can sometimes offset a fingerprint’s natural dispersion Although it is not clear whether Apple will ultimately kill the home button, this is not the first patent the firm has filed with technology that suggests they will.   A patent awarded to Apple in May suggests the firm may be working on another method as well. This innovation also places the sensor under the display, but instead uses ultrasound imaging to find the user’s fingerprint. SHOULD YOU WAIT FOR THE IPHONE 8? While details on the iPhone 8 are scarce, new reports suggest it will have a totally different look from previous handsets and will come with better cameras. An unnamed employee at an Apple site in Herzliya, Israel, where hardware is being developed for the iPhone 8, has leaked some details about the new handset. Given that 2017 will be the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, it would make sense that Apple has something big planned. But the unnamed employee told Business Insider that the iPhone 8 would be 'different' from previous handsets, which have been critiqued as being too similar. If those rumours are true, the iPhone 8 could rival the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge which came out in February this year. n January, Apple revisited a patent filed in 2013, which proposed a curved 'glass' case made from an intricate fusion of metals melted together. The design - made from Bulk Amorphous Alloy, which is a mix of titanium, nickel, copper and zirconium melted together - is said to have the smooth texture of glass and the rigid sturdiness of rubber. Despite widespread excitement over the unique design, it still hasn't reached the general public. Apple usually releases a new model, and then an 'S' version of that model the next year, so some people were expected an iPhone 7S to be released in 2017. But the worker used the term 'iPhone 8' unprompted during the conversations, suggesting Apple may be skipping the 7S entirely.  Apple recently killed the headphone jack and its next victim could be the home button. Rumors of Apple doing way with the iconic home button isn’t groundbreaking news, but many believed the firm would leave it out of the iPhone 7 design This new method means that the chunky bottom bezel of the iPhone could be transformed into a sleek extension of the screen.  The patent, titled ‘Man-machine interface for controlling access to electronic devices’, was filed on March 5, 2015. ‘The man-machine interface device comprises an electronic display apparatus that is capable of presenting graphic text, images, icons, and other data typically shown on a screen, while further including a transparent finger touch sensor region that is seated above the display apparatus,’ reads the patent published by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Its pages discuss the three common sensors used to capture fingerprints: optical, captive and ultrasonic. Each of these combines hardware and software, or firmware controller, to locate and read prints. The patent points out that the current sensors aren’t completely perfect, as people have shared different ways to work around the fingerprint ID sensor. For example, a recent account occurred at the Mobile World Congress when researchers demonstrated just how easily these sensors can be bypassed by lifting another person's fingerprint with common modeling materials. However, most accurate, but least used finger-scanning technology is ultrasound imaging and this is what the tech giant suggest it could use in the future. Apple’s solution is two transducers positioned on the x- and –y axes of a glass plate, the receiving and transmitting ends, which would ultimately emit and receive ultrasound waves. Its pages discuss the three common sensors used to capture fingerprints: optical, captive and ultrasonic. Each of these combines hardware and software, or firmware controller, to locate and read prints By placing your finger on the screen, it would obstruct the waves and allow the sensor to analyze fingerprints. This technology is fairly new and has not gone through extensive testing, but early results have showed promise. ‘It combines the large plate size and ease of use of the optical scanners with the ability to pervade dirt and residue on the scanner, an advantage of capacitive scanners,’ states the patent. This patent isn’t the first source that suggests Apple might ditch the physical home button in future variants – and many artists created concept drawings for what they believed the iPhone 7 would look like.

Home Advertisements Employment Print Editions Story Ideas? Staff News Features Sports Entertainment Home » Entertainment, Technology Outnumbered sex Submitted by Jack A. Webb on October 5, 2016  12:00 pmOne Comment Apple recently held a keynote address in San Francisco on Sept. 7 to unveil the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, Apple Watch Series 2, and Airpods, Apple’s latest attempt at pushing wireless headphones. It seemed as if this event gave us everything that Apple fans, like myself, have been asking for for years: a water resistant iPhone, built in GPS on the Apple Watch, and wireless headphones designed by Apple. Everything that graced that Bill Graham Civic Auditorium stage had been speculated about for months. It’s what didn’t get much stage time that caught my attention. Apple, who prides itself on being inclusive and diverse, had only three women address the excited crowd (and even less people of color). According to Mic, this attributes to about 7% of the speaking time for women during the keynote. Of the 19 executives at the top of Apple’s leadership, only three are women. Two women serve on Apple’s eight-member board of directors. Why is this I often wonder? Given the fact that women largely outnumber men in college and account for roughly 60% of bachelor’s degree holders in the United States, according to Fortune Magazine. The answer may lie the good old-fashioned stereotype that ‘boys are better at science and math than girls’ and the lack of encouragement that girls receive in pursuing STEM careers from those around them. Whatever the case may be, gender diverse companies, not only look better, but their teams have greater creativity and make better decisions, according to researchers at the University of Castilla la Mancha, Spain. Companies with the highest female representation outperformed competing companies by 42%. Facebook’s COO Sheryl Sandberg, author of “Lean In” said, “No industry or country can reach its full potential until women reach their full potential. This is especially true of science and technology, where women with a surplus of talent still face a deficit of opportunity.” Apple understands this need to grow more diverse and they have made efforts to improve this. Their global female team has increased from 31% to 37% since 2014. I believe the world will benefit when all ideas are valued and everyone has a seat at the table. One Comment » James says: October 19, 2016 at 3:20 pm I absolutely love the iPhone 7, I think Apple did a great job and if I might say an even better job on the iPhone 7 plus, well for me at least. I think the employment of women in general is on the rise. I work in fast-paced retail and it was definitely obvious to see the company just preferred employing men. So this catch 22 cycle happened for a number of years. Women were perceived as not being able to do the job and so women were not given the chance to show that they could do the job. Unfortunately this mentality still exists in the company but I am starting to see it slowly fade away, if all be it not fast enough. Apple should definitely look more to the strengths on women innovation, in-fact some of the best apps I have used for exercise have been designed by women. A pretty big thing to be missing out on for Apple I would say. Thanks for the great information, let’s hope we see changes sooner, rather than later.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Pebble 2 reviewed: Proof that a heart rate monitor doesn’t make a fitness tracker $130 may get you a HRM, but that doesn't mean it's a serious fitness device. by Valentina Palladino - Oct 5, 2016 5:00 pm UTC Login to bookmark 47 Video shot/edited by Jennifer Hahn. When Pebble made its last big product announcement, the company clearly wanted to focus on fitness. The new Pebble 2 and Time 2 devices are the first Pebble smartwatches to feature built-in heart rate monitors. Pebble also announced the tiny Core running computer. The Core has yet to be released, but customers who’ve been eager for a Pebble device with more fitness features are probably excited about these new watches. In addition to the embedded heart rate monitor, the Pebble 2's UI is different from its predecessor as well. The new interface gives Pebble Health the same level of attention as its Timeline interface and adds on-watch text and call replies. Although the $130 Pebble 2 + HR integrates these new features well, the new watch still leaves much to be desired when it comes to fitness. Design: Nods to the original The Pebble 2 looks like a slightly modernized version of the original Pebble Classic. Measuring 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.4 inches, the rectangular smartwatch is made of polycarbonate with a hint of glass fiber, and it comes in a number of two-toned color options. My review unit is the aqua/white model that uses white throughout most of the case, sides (where the buttons sit), and the bezel, while the silicone band is in aqua. Weighing a mere .07 pounds (31.7 g), the Pebble 2 looks and feels like a toy, but not in a bad way. Anyone who was enamored with the original Pebble and didn't feel like springing for the upper-tier metal options (like the Time Steel) will enjoy this retro design. Each Pebble 2 ships with its own 22mm soft-touch band, but the case can support any standard 22mm watch band. Since this is the first Pebble device with a built-in AMS optical heart rate monitor, those silicone bands are ideal for intense activity (as compared to more fashionable leather bands). The heart rate monitor is continuous, taking your pulse every few minutes throughout the day and in real-time while recording workouts. The Pebble 2 is water-resistant up to 30 meters, and The heart rate monitor will stay on while you're swimming, too. But keep in mind that swimming is not an activity included in Pebble Health for tracking; you'll have to use a third-party app like Swim.com to track that. The monochrome, 1.26-inch, e-paper LCD complements the Pebble 2's design—the fancier Time 2 has a color display, but I found the black-and-white scheme balanced out the bright colors of the device itself. The scratch-resistant display is covered with Gorilla Glass 3, so it can withstand small bumps and dings. Most of the days I spent testing the Pebble were rainy and cloudy, so I cannot speak to its visibility in direct sunlight. However, the display was easy to read under the bright lights at my gym. Hugging the sides of the device are four buttons: the back button on the left side, and the upper, middle, and lower scroll-and-select buttons grouped on the right. You might be wondering what happened to those "smart straps" that Pebble announced a while back. So am I. Pebble laid out guidelines for its developer community to create smart straps for its watches that could add features to the existing watch. So far not many have come out, and the Pebble 2 is only partially compatible with smart straps and doesn't provide power over the smart strap port. Pebble has also stated the slight bulge from the heart rate monitor may interfere with some smart straps, so the company is working on releasing 3D CAD files for those who want to make new smart straps. However, the Time 2 (without the heart rate monitor) is fully compatible with those developer-made straps. Pebble has always been good about packing as much battery life into its watches as possible, and the Pebble 2 is no different. The company claims the watch can last up to a week on a single charge, and even with recording at least 30 minutes of exercise per day, my Pebble 2's battery was only down to 40 percent on day six.

Features: A balancing act between fitness and life organization Like I said before, the Pebble 2 is the first Pebble watch to be outfitted with an optical heart rate monitor, so it must be the company's way of answering requests for a more fitness-focused device. If you've used any other devices with optical heart rate monitors before, the Pebble 2 is really no different from the rest. It tracks your pulse throughout the day by taking periodic measurements that you can see at any time by pressing the upper select button that opens Pebble Health. The first screen shows your current step count, and you can press the middle select button to see calories burned, distance traveled, and activity bars that show how much you've been active each day for the past week. Pressing the upper select button once more brings you to the heart rate screen, which shows you the last heart rate score the watch took and how many minutes ago it was taken. The monitor was always within 3 bpm of my manual reading. It also handled high heart rates decently: during a 30-minute run using both the Pebble 2 and the Apple Watch Series 2, Pebble's monitor was typically within 5 bpm of that on the Apple Watch. The Pebble 2 consistently read my heart rate as lower than the Apple Watch, and it was slow to catch up to Apple's smartwatch at times. For example, when the Apple Watch showed my heart rate as a steady 180 bpm in the midst of a run, the Pebble 2 took about five to ten seconds to level off at 175 bpm. Pebble Health's Workout app is in the default list of apps on the watch, accessible by single-pressing the middle select button. I was disappointed to see that the only recordable exercises are running, walking, and "workout," which I just ended up using for anything that wasn't running or walking. Compared to the $370 Apple Watch Series 2—with its slew of workout profiles including an entirely separate list under "other" that includes sports and weight training choices—and even compared to Fitbit's newest $150 Charge 2, Pebble is seriously lacking in workout options. The Pebble 2 follows the archaic notion that fitness trackers are just running trackers or glorified pedometers, which has been disproven by devices like the aforementioned Apple Watch and Charge 2 and others like the (now discontinued) $200 Microsoft Band and the $250 Atlas Wearable. To record a workout on the Pebble 2, just choose the type of exercise you're doing and press the upper select button to start. The Pebble's display shows you real-time heart rate measurements and the duration of the workout, but that's it. There are no extra screens either, so the device is limited in what you can track (and the data that you can see) in a workout. If you want more data, you have to download a third-party activity app from the Pebble app store within the general Pebble app. Popular app makers like Runtastic and Endomondo have a few programs available, but you will need those mobile apps installed on your smartphone to use them on the Pebble 2. Aside from activity tracking, Pebble added some new software features. The new "smart actions" feature that was detailed when Pebble announced the new watches now appears to be lumped under Quick Launch in the UI. Customizable via the Settings app, Quick Launch lets you assign functions to all four of the Pebble 2's buttons that will then be accessible via a long-press. You can choose full apps or actions for the buttons, so you could have a long-press of the middle select button open the Yelp app while a long-press on the top select button lets you compose a text message. Using the buttons to open your four most-used tools frees you up to make tasks like putting the watch in quiet mode (preferably every night before you go to bed) much quicker. In a way, the new Pebble setup is similar to the Apple Watch's new dock in watchOS 3, but you're not limited to four apps on that device. To accommodate Pebble Health access via the upper select button, Pebble's Timeline interface has changed slightly. Now you can only see events that are in your future by pressing the down select button; you used to be able to see past events by pressing the upper select button, but that feature is gone now. Some might see that as inconvenient, but I found myself only concerned with what meetings and events I had to look forward to that day, not what had already passed. When synced to your smartphone, the Pebble 2 receives all your notifications. The app has a page where you can turn on or off notifications for each specific app, which is great if you only want to receive certain alerts to your wrist. Alerts fill up the entire watch face, and you can scroll to read the entire notification by using the side buttons. However, the most recent alert will stay on your watch display until you do something with it: you can dismiss it by pressing the middle select button, but that will only dismiss the most recent alert. If you have more than one in your notification queue, the next one populates the display immediately after you dismiss the first. To dismiss all of the alerts, you can long-press the middle select button. I ended up doing that a lot because I often wanted to check the time, but my last alert just sat there on the screen in my way until I got rid of it myself. There are now also "peaking" notifications that are specific to your Timeline: when an event is coming up, the bottom third of the Pebble 2's display shows an alert for that event. That way you don't have to flip to the Timeline to check if you have something scheduled, but you also won't have a huge notification monopolizing watch face space. I enjoyed these peaking alerts, and I wish you could choose certain apps to present their notifications as peaking alerts. A big new feature on the Pebble 2 is its ability to respond to and compose text messages. When you receive a text, it looks like a regular alert on the watch's display. Pressing the middle select button brings up a menu where you can respond via pre-fab messages, emojis, or by using voice dictation. You can edit your canned responses via the Pebble app, and I recommend using those rather than voice. When I tried to respond to one of my mother's texts using voice, the text was always a little off from what I said: "That's good, not watching anything" (my mom is always interested in what show I'm watching on TV) turned into "It's good I'll watch anything." Compared to the voice recognition on the Apple Watch, Pebble's is nowhere near as accurate or convenient. Also, you can't make phone calls from the Pebble 2, but you can send canned messages when someone calls you and you're unable to pick up. The text reply feature has a few limitations that Pebble explains on its website: "Sending text or voice replies works with most major Android apps including SMS, Hangouts, Gmail, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp and hundreds more. Text or voice reply features for iPhone users are currently limited to SMS and only available to AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile users in the US and mobile customers in Australia, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom." Another feature of note is music control, which lets you play, pause, skip, and control the volume for any music app you use, including Spotify.

Gardner, who directed development for various iPod and iPhone models, remembers being struck by “an immediate realization of the impact of Steve Jobs on creating the company and changing the world.” “Sadness and appreciation,” is how Gardner, now CEO of Pearl Automation, sums up his feelings from that day. That sentiment also describes how much of the tech world feels on the fifth anniversary of Jobs’ death. On Wednesday, Apple employees, customers and members of the media paid tribute to the visionary cofounder and CEO who remains one of the most influential figures in Silicon Valley. “I think the industry has been feeling the impact of the lack of his presence,” says Andy Grignon, a former senior manager at Apple who helped launch the original iPhone. The industry, he adds, is still trying to fill the “void” of a “true product visionary that could assemble the pieces into [products] people felt they had to have.” Walt Mossberg, a veteran technology journalist who knew Jobs, echoed that sentiment. “I miss him. The tech industry misses him. He and his work are still guideposts,” Mossberg wrote on Twitter. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, remembered his predecessor and friend with one of his many powerful quotes. Apple set up a dedicated page on its website to highlight messages it has received from friends, colleagues and customers about Job’s death. “Over a million people from all over the world have shared their memories, thoughts, and feelings about Steve,” reads a post on Apple’s website. “One thing they all have in common — from personal friends to colleagues to owners of Apple products — is how they’ve been touched by his passion and creativity.” One post on Apple’s site from a man who identifies as a former employee of Pixar, a company Jobs sold to Disney, called Jobs a “champion” for “those of us that believe in our core that everything we do should matter — that in everything there is a sacred art.” “People have spoken of you as the Thomas Edison of our time, but perhaps they have it wrong,” a fan wrote on the site. “Thomas Edison was the Steve Jobs of his time.” Jobs died at the age of 56 from complications of pancreatic cancer. His final years as CEO were marked by the tremendous success of new devices like the iPad and especially the iPhone. Apple’s market cap has skyrocketed to more than $600 billion since Jobs’ death thanks in large part to the iPhone. However, Apple’s remarkable 13-year run of year-over-year sales growth is now in danger as iPhone sales start to taper off. Under Cook, Apple has become more socially responsible, but employees say the company is also becoming more bureaucratic and less innovative. Cook and Apple have worked to move beyond the Steve Jobs era while simultaneously trying to protect Jobs’ legacy. The founder’s office at Apple remains intact. Top Apple execs have also pushed back against certain books and films claiming to tell Jobs’ story. The fight to protect Jobs’ legacy may be a losing battle, however. “Steve Jobs” is now shorthand for any entrepreneur or business leader looking to stand out from the pack — for better or worse. Twitter and Theranos, two tech companies that have been front and center this year for their corporate struggles, are each run by CEOs who have very clearly fashioned themselves after Jobs. Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of blood test startup Theranos, is fond of dressing in black turtlenecks like Jobs and applying his focus on total secrecy around products. That didn’t stop her from getting banned from owning or operating a lab for two years. Jack Dorsey, the cofounder and CEO of Twitter, has borrowed so many lines from Jobs that there used to be a Tumblr collecting them all. He is now running two companies at once as Jobs did, but one of those companies, Twitter, is said to be on the chopping block.

It's been three weeks since iOS 10 was released to the public. Beta testers who have signed up for Apple's beta testing program will receive the new iOS 10.1 beta update over-the-air after installing the proper certificate on their iOS device. Those who want to be a part of Apple's beta testing program can sign up to participate through the beta testing website, which gives users access to both iOS and macOS Sierra betas. Betas are not stable and include many bugs, so they should be installed on a secondary device. iOS 10.1 introduces a “Portrait” mode for the iPhone 7 Plus, which takes advantage of the dual cameras in the device. Portrait mode is designed to mimic the kind of shallow depth of field images that can be taken with a high-end DSLR, with a front subject that stands out over a blurred background. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. The two cameras in the iPhone 7 Plus capture images, which are scanned by the built-in image signal processor to create a depth map. Machine learning techniques are used to recognize people and/or foreground images, keeping people and main objects in focus while applying an artful blur or "bokeh" to the background. The 10.1 update also includes bug fixes and performance improvements to address issues discovered since the release of iOS 10 and it features some tweaks to the Messages interface, replacing dots that represented each installed app with a scroll bar. iOS 10 is a major operating system update that includes features like a redesigned Lock screen, a Siri SDK to allow third-party apps to integrate with Siri, and a completely overhauled Messages app with stickers, a full App Store, Digital Touch, Bubble Effects, and more. Other new additions include a dedicated “Home” app for HomeKit users, new facial and object recognition capabilities in Photos, and redesigned Maps and Apple Music apps.

Curiously, a notice posted on the Apple Investor Relations website earlier this week has moved up the upcoming earnings call with Wall Street investors by two days to Tuesday, October 25, over what Apple describes as a simple “scheduling conflict”. Longtime Apple reporter Philip Elmer-DeWitt speculates that the move might mean that Apple could be planning to hold a launch event for new Macs on October 27. For sure, there must be a good reason for moving up the already scheduled earnings call by two days. It’s interesting that Apple already rescheduled its second fiscal 2016 earnings report so its executives could attend the memorial service of the Silicon Valley icon and former longtime board member Bill Campbell, who died at age 75 in April 2016. 9to5Mac’s Ben Lovejoy offers another reason for changing the date of the earnings call: Apple doesn’t want its shiny new Mac launch to be overshadowed by what are likely to be disappointing iPhone sales. So, a Mac keynote on the Tuesday followed by the announcement of declining sales on the Thursday would lead to a brief celebration followed by gloom. Doing it the other way around presents a story of challenges followed by the excitement of what we all expect to be a significant revamp of the MacBook Pro, perhaps accompanied by a new MacBook Air, iMac and 5K display (and maybe a new Apple TV for good measure). For what it’s worth, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman recently reported that Apple may be gearing up to refresh Macs and launch a 5K-capable standalone display this month.

The new store, located on Nicosia’s Makarios III Avenue and Evagoras, has been designed with the aim of bringing Cypriot consumers closer to the full range of their favourite Apple-branded products and authorised service centre. iStorm’s objective is to become a benchmark for all Apple fans on the island, where “it will offer consumers a wide variety of peripherals and accessories, targeted and integrated services, and also receive specialised knowledge, and technical support from the Apple experts.” The official opening which is set to start at 7pm will have many offers and gifts and the celebrations will feature a live performance by popular singer Demy, the store announced on Wednesday. The new store has met the stringent international standards set by Apple for distribution outlets promoting its products. “We are delighted that the first iStorm store in Cyprus becomes a reality as the Cypriot market is extremely important to us, Apple products are very high on the Cypriot consumers’ preferences,” said iStorm Retail Manager Costas Papayiannis adding, “iStorm aims to allow consumers in Cyprus to experience the original ecosystem of Apple, always combined with a top shopping experience that only iStorm knows how to offer.” The new iStorm store is operated under the umbrella of the Quest Group, which has six other stores in Greece.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive UPDATE: Apple Valley Unified, Victor Valley Union High school districts on alert after 'clowning' threats Wednesday Oct 5, 2016 at 9:28 AM Oct 6, 2016 at 3:10 PM Jose Quintero Staff Writer @dd_jquintero APPLE VALLEY — The Apple Valley Unified and Victor Valley Union High school districts were on alert Wednesday due to “clowning” threats, a nationwide phenomenon that has apparently hit the High Desert. AVUSD spokeswoman Kristin Hernandez told the Daily Press on Wednesday morning that the district is aware of social media threats posted Tuesday night and there is an increased police presence at schools throughout the district. “The safety of our students, staff and families is our top priority and the district will remain vigilant,” the district said in a statement. “All schools are open and will operate under normal Student Early Release Day (normal Wednesday) schedule.” Hernandez said “clowning” included dressing up as a “scary” clown and terrorizing or harassing people. “Not happy, but very scary, and harassing and terrorizing neighborhoods and communities. It can vary from just staring at people, to making threats,” she said. “The original threat was very vague and referenced clowning in the area. A second post referenced shooting up Phoenix Academy. At this time we don't have a whole lot of details beyond that. But we wanted our families to be aware of what we're doing, what precautions we're taking.” There have been reports of "clowning" threats made across the country, with at least one student in Texas being arrested for making the threats on social media. Local San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department officials are aware of the threats and said they are actively investigating in Apple Valley.  Apple Valley Sheriff’s Station Sgt. Mark Bracco said detectives have been investigating the threats since Tuesday night. Bracco said the threats do not appear to be credible and residents should not have any concerns yet. “At this time we’d say no. If it does become a credible threat residents will be notified,” Bracco said. “It’s a vague threat and there is nothing definitive. But we are taking it serious and looking into it. Multiple detectives are investigating and search warrants are being written.” Apple Valley Sheriff’s Station units received a report of a person in a clown costume and armed with a gun near Otomian and Symeron roads at approximately 3:45 p.m. Bracco said the report was unfounded as units, including a helicopter, several detectives and officers were unable to find a person in a clown costume. Bracco confirmed the station received two other clown sightings Wednesday, but those were also unfounded. Bracco said each call is taken seriously and authorities will respond to each report. “We have a responsibility to check the area and make sure there is not any criminal activity going on,” he said. VVUHSD officials said Wednesday afternoon that they were aware of a online threat against Victor Valley High School. “The individuals claimed they would be at Victor Valley High today,” the district said in a statement. “VVHS school security and other staff members were notified about the post before school began today, and staff will remain vigilant as we proceed with the school day. Local authorities have been notified about the post and are collaborating with the district to ensure the safety of our staff and students.” Victorville Sheriff’s Station spokeswoman Mara Rodriguez said the station was contacted by the district about a possible threat. Rodriguez said deputies were briefed and will be “vigilant, as always.” “We have no reason to believe there is any cause for alarm. We have been aware of the so-called ‘clowning’ that has been going on in the Eastern regions and have not had any situations occur here in (Victorville),” Rodriguez said. “We will continue to monitor the issue and work closely with the schools to keep our kids and community safe.” Hesperia Sheriff’s Station spokeswoman Karen Hunt said she was unaware of any threats in Hesperia.  Hernandez said if residents notice anything suspicious to contact the AVUSD police at 760-961-0672.

Amazon, Roku and now Google with the Chromecast Ultra, have 4K streaming solutions, whereas the 4th-gen Apple TV can only handle 1080p HD content making it a tough sell for those upgrading their home entertainment set-up. Well that might be about to change soon, given Apple is retiring the old campaigner, the 3rd-gen Apple TV with the simple silver remote. The four-year-old device has been discontinued by Apple, with Apple Store links now redirecting to the current model. According to 9to5Mac, Apple has since confirmed to employees and educators that the streaming box is on its way to Silicon Heaven. Related: Best new tvOS features for Apple TV Rumours throughout 2016 have suggested Apple will indeed launch a 4K capable Apple TV, that would double up as Siri-powered Amazon Echo-like device. During a recent earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook revealed the company has “something bigger” planned for the Apple TV ecosystem. "I don't want to be more precise than that but you shouldn't look at what's there today and think we've done what we want to do. We've built a foundation that we can do something bigger off of,” he said. Perhaps we’ll see that bigger device unveiled alongside the rumoured MacBook Pro refresh at some point this month?

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Google Introduces Pixel the Smartphone and other Hardware Devices Squarely Aimed at Amazon and Samsung | Main | On this Day we Respectfully Remember Steve Jobs » October 05, 2016 The Google Manifesto: The Arrival of the AI Revolution   Yesterday Patently Apple posted a report titled "Google Introduces Pixel the Smartphone and other Hardware Devices Squarely Aimed at Amazon and Samsung." The report was a simple peek at Google's newly released hardware products covering their all-new new Pixel smartphone, Google Home, Google Wifi and more. Closing out that report I touched on Artificial Intelligence because a Gartner analyst speaking to the Guardian about the Google event was saying that Apple was late to market with AI and that Apple was quickly dropping behind Amazon and Google. It was the same false argument made by a Forbes contributor months ago. This is the narrative that Google is engineering when talking to journalists. It's the propaganda that they want consumers to hear about to put Apple in the rear view mirror of the AI revolution. Remember that Apple and Steve Jobs was at the forefront of the personal computing revolution and that they were also at the forefront of the mobille revolution with the iPhone and iPad. So hell if Google wants Apple to lead the next revolution regarding AI. So yesterday Google took off the gloves and simply decided to take up the AI mantle.   In yesterday's report I tried to be diplomatic in wishing Google all the best in their venture, especially if they could challenge Samsung's product line. But Business Insider's writer Mat Rosoff didn't hold back in slamming Google's big splash last night by saying that Google is a follower not a leader and hit them on every front imaginable.   But just don't say that to Google's CEO Sundar Pichai's face because he sees things much differently. In fact, forget yesterday's new product launches. If you focus on that you missed the boat entirely. Yesterday's event was really about delivering Google's manifesto. The AI revolution is the next wave or the next phase in computing and Google was at the forefront. They were leading it and that was the end of that discussion.   When Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone in 2007, it truly was a moment in time that marked the beginning of the true mobile revolution with true smartphones, modern apps and the internet in your pocket.   Yesterday, Google's CEO tried to seize that moment in time for Google. A moment in time where they were bringing the next revolution to the public: The AI Revolution.   Whether we'll look back and see that moment of the event in that light only time will tell. But make no mistake about it – Google's CEO was basically making that claim. He believed this was Google's shining moment, because to date, no one, not even Apple was ready to make such a claim.   To mark this moment. Patently Apple has transcribed about 90% of Pichai's keynote so that it's on record and quotable for future reports. This is what Pichai stated:   Google's CEO Keynote on the AI Revolution   "We're at a seminal moment in computing. If you step back and think about it, computing has always had big shifts every ten years or so. It all started in the eighties when the personal computer reached the mainstream. It was the first time that computing touched the lives of many people and revolutionized the way they worked.   Roughly a decade later, in the mid-nineties, the Web arrived. It is arguably the biggest platform shift that we've seen in our lifetime. It brought the internet to many more people, radically changing the streets (?), fundamentally changed the way people interact and connect with each other.   About ten years later, in the mid-2000's, with the advent of smartphones, we had the mobile revolution. That brought computing to about half the world's population – and it's profoundly changing people's lives; and the shift continues.   In fact, when I look ahead at where computing is headed, it's clear to me that we're heading, evolving from a mobile-first to an AI-first world.   What do I mean by that? In this world computing will be universally available, it will be everywhere in the context of a user's daily life. People will be able to interact with it naturally and seamlessly than ever before. And above all else, it will be intelligent. It will help users in more meaningful ways.   At Google, we're very, very excited about this shift and we've been working for a long time towards this shift. At the heart of these efforts, is our goal to build a Google Assistant.   We've spoken about Google Assistant earlier at Google I/O this year. The vision to our Assistant as a two-way conversation, a natural dialogue between our users and Google to help them get things done in the real world. The Assistant will be universal, it'll be available when the user's need it to help them. And our goal is to build a personal Google for each and every user. Just like we built a Google for everyone, we want to build each user his or her own individual Google. To capture our vision for what the Google Assistant is, we put together a short video [noted below], let's take a look."     So as you can see that's an early vision of how we want to build a Google Assistant. We're just getting started but in many ways we been working hard to solve this problem ever since Google was founded 18 years ago. We've invested in deep layers of computer science. Today, our knowledge graph has over 70 billion facts about people, places and things [a tag which was firsts used by Apple/IBM regarding Taligent's "People, Places and Things], and we can answer questions based on that.   Our natural language processing is what helps us make Google truly conversational with our users and we've built state of the art machine translation, image recognition and voice recognition systems and each of these areas is being turbo charged by the progress that we're seeing with machine learning in AI.   A few months ago we captured the World's attention when DeepMinds AlphaGo won the world's 'Go' championship against [South Korea's] Lee Sedol, one of the finest players of our generation. It showed the external world that the moment for AI had arrived. But for us, the progress has been continuous and the strides are huge. In fact, in the three months since AlphGo played that game, we've had meaningful launches and how machine learning is impacting the products we build.   Let me talk about three examples, all of which we've talked about in the past three months since the AlphaGo moment. First, 'Image Captioning." Image Captioning is how computers try to make sense of images they look at. And we first launched our machine learning system in 2014, a state of the art sytem, and our quality was around over 89%. Our newer machine learning systems now the quality is now close to 94%. Four percent may not sound like much to you but first it's really hard to increase quality at these levels because we're trying to approach human level accuracy.   And Second, every single percentage point translates into meaningful difference for our users. So for example if you take a look at the picture behind me [see above] – about two years ago we use to understand this picture as 'a train is sitting on the tracks." Now, we understand the colors so we describe it as 'A blue and yellow train traveling down train tracks.'   Or if you look at this picture [below], two years ago we use to understood this picture as 'A brown bear is swimming in the water.' Now, we can count, the computing system can count, so we understand this as 'Two brown bears sitting on the top of rocks.'   Advances like this is what helps us when you're in Google Photos find the exact pictures that you're looking for and be a better Assistant for you.   Another example, machine translation. We've been doing machine translation for a while and historically, our systems are statistics based, and we translate at a phrase by phrase level. So we translate individual phrases and combine them to form a translation. So if you look at this Chinese to English translation, you can see it makes sense but it's not quite the way humans would translate it. Just recently we've just announced our first end-to-end self-learning, deep learning translation systems.   Rather than working at a phrase level, they take entire sentences and models sentence outputs; and that's what you see in the middle. And you can see it is approaching human level translation. You can look at this qauntitatively, and if you look at our previous phrase based system, it was quite far from the human system and we've closed a significant gap with our new machine learning systems.   Google's CEO Sundar Pichai painstakingly drilled down into details about the progress or their AI and went on to talk about Text-to-Speech and how over time their AI will be able to understand various dialects within a country and to understand emotion and reflect that in translations and conversations with the Google Assistant in any language around the world.   Pichai then handed over the keynote to those presenting Google's new Pixel smartphone and Google Home which have Google Assistant at the heart of these products.   A Steve Jobs Moment in Time it was Not   In truth, the AI revolution really hasn't hit the market with any degree of success as of yet. Thus far it's all been super-hype in a bottle with gimmicks as thick and corny as Brylcreem ads of yesteryear. In fact, there isn't a single runaway product that we can point to today that has delivered on this promise that counts or has sparked the imagination of the public to rush out and buy it.   When Apple's late CEO Steve Jobs first introduced the iPad, it quickly racked up sales of over 100 million units. It was the fastest selling product in history. Has Amazon's Echo hit anything close to that yet? Of course not. Will the new 'Google Home' device hit that 100 million mark by this time next year? Don't' be ridiculous. Both will probably have the success that Apple did with their first Apple TV – Something that Apple simply called a hobby product.   At the end of the day, Google's CEO gave it his best shot – but a Steve Jobs moment in time it was not – even though he gave it his best shot. Apple has been working on a new Siri home product for years and there are patent filings proving that out. So it's not just Apple-speak, marketing voodoo or a fanboy's wishful thinking. So Apple has a lot of time to get on board with a new home product with Siri for every room. For now, Apple has just introduced their intelligent assistant Siri for macOS and already have it running soundly on the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. Where's Google Assistant? Right, it's just starting to roll out.   True, the AI revolution is coming. But sorry Pichai, as dramatic as you tried to make it, it didn't arrive yesterday during your keynote.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

But we haven't seen any major innovations since Steve Jobs' death By: Lana Jelic | Business, Financial & Legal News | Posted: Oct 5, 2016 4:20 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Many thought that the death of Steve Jobs five years ago would mark the end of Apple as we knew it. The man who has defined Apple has left an indelible mark on the company and the technology world.     Today Apple has great financial results, their products are still in high demand, but there is also a sense that something is missing...   They were revolutionaries   Under Jobs' leadership, Apple was a revolutionary company that changed the world. Macintosh was the first commercially successful computer with a graphical user interface and mouse, and Apple II was also a great success.   Jobs' return to Apple brought new changes, and the colorful iMac has shown that computers don't have to be boring gray boxes. In the following years, Jobs launched the iPod, MacBook, iPad and iPhone - Apple's most recognizable product. These products were revolutionary in their time and they set the standard. Whatever you think of Apple, these products were a huge success thanks to Jobs.   Five years after Jobs' death, Apple is still making great products, but it's hard to resist the impression that the revolutionary aspect or Jobs' vision are missing.     Over the years the iPhone became bigger, but in the past two years we saw three nearly identical phones. The iPad varied in size, and MacBook Air evolved. In the past five years Apple followed the market and adjusted accordingly. The only practical new product that came from Apple since Tim Cook took over is Apple Watch, that became better in its second series, but it doesn't have the status or impact as other Apple devices. Even though Apple is now the second largest watch maker in the world in terms or revenue.   Apple is a big successful company, there's no doubt about it. But we haven't seen any major innovations since Steve Jobs' death.   They are opening up to new areas   Steve Jobs once said to Tim Cook that he doesn't want him to ask himself what he would have done, he should do what he thinks is right. Cook has followed his advice and never looked back. Apple's revenue and earnings are two times higher than five years ago.   Cook increased the investment in research and development to 4% of Apple's total revenue. It was 2% under Jobs. Cook also did what Jobs refused - he paid dividends to shareholders.   Like many companies, Apple today examines emerging markets in search of the next big thing. They are offering streaming services and mobile payments, and apparently they are working on autonomous vehicles and virtual reality.   Commenting on the new fields where we could soon see Apple, Cook said that he is very excited about augmented reality... Perhaps we will see something new in that area from Apple soon... Recommended for You Amazon 2016 Black Friday sales include some HUGE deals... Apple's new $300 design book doesn't include 3.5mm...

Mello Jr. Oct 5, 2016 9:00 AM PT Google on Tuesday unveiled a new smartphone and home hub that squarely aim at products from market leaders Apple and Amazon. The company's new branded smartphone, called "Pixel," marks a departure from past efforts. Up to now, Google's Nexus phones were made by a variety of manufacturers that sold them under their brands. "Google is trying to position itself as a complete supplier rather than simply offering Nexus-branded handsets that were rebatched by another company," said Jeff Orr, senior practice director for mobile devices at ABI Research. Google announced Pixel, along with its home entertainment and smart device hub, called "Google Home," at a launch event at Ghiradelli Square in San Francisco. At the forum, the company emphasized the unity of the ecosystem behind its new hardware offerings. "That's more of a challenge to a device leader such as Apple than an announcement of the next generation of Google-branded handsets," Orr told TechNewsWorld. Next Big Innovation Google needed to go into hardware to address an information explosion, said Vice President for Hardware Rick Osterloh at the launch event. "These informational changes mean that technology needs to be smart and just work for you. This is why we believe the next big innovation is going to take place at the intersection of hardware and software with AI at the center," he explained. "Hardware isn't a new area for Google, but now we're taking steps to showcase the very best of Google across a family of devices designed and built by us," Osterloh added. Google's new devices can provide new experiences for users. "The announcement of Google's phone comes into a market where we're seeing growth slow down in the premium segment," observed Ross Rubin, principal analyst at Reticle Research. That said, "they're bringing experiences to the phone way beyond the typical interaction we have on smartphones today," he told TechNewsWorld. Fast-Charging Battery In moving from providing an operating system -- Android -- to offering hardware for sale, Google is emulating another big tech player, noted Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research. "Google is using the strategy Microsoft used with its Surface tablets," he told TechNewsWorld. "They're trying to make a statement with their brand." Microsoft isn't the only big tech player Google is cribbing notes from. "What Google is doing is trying to show how they can integrate all their software, services and hardware in a unified way -- in the same the way Apple does," O'Donnell said. "It's definitely a page out of Apple's book in that regard." Google's Pixel phones come in two models. The chief differences between them are the screen and battery sizes. The Pixel has a 5-inch AMOLED screen with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels (441 pixels per inch), while the Pixel XL has a 5.5-inch AMOLED with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels (534 ppi). The Pixel has a 2,770 mAh battery, while the Pixel XL's is 3,450 mAh. Both batteries have a quick-charge feature that gives the phone seven hours of runtime on a 15-minute charge. Highly Rated Camera Both Pixel models have f/2.0 12.3 megapixel rear-facing cameras with large pixels -- 1.55 microns -- and support for 4K video. Their front-facing cameras are 8 MP with an f/2.4 aperture and support for HD video. The front-facing camera received high marks from testing outfit DxOMark. "With an overall DxOMark Mobile score of 89, Pixel, the latest Google smartphone, is the highest-rated smartphone camera we have ever tested," wrote reviewer David Cardinal. "Its image quality scores are impressive across the board, but it is particularly strong in providing a very high level of detail from its 12.3MP camera, with relatively low levels of noise for every tested lighting condition," he continued. "It also provides accurate exposures with very good contrast and white balance, as well as fast autofocus," Cardinal added. Pricing for the Pixel models starts at US$649 with 32 GB of memory. Units will be sold exclusively through Verizon, although unlocked versions of the phones will be offered through the online Google Store. Customers can preorder the Pixel now in the United States, UK, Canada, Australia and Germany. Google Home Pixel users who want to dabble in virtual reality will be able to do so with another new product introduced at the Google event. Daydream is a fabric headset that allows Pixel to be used as a VR screen. It will sell for $79 starting in November. Google also rolled out a competitor to Amazon's Echo home hub. Called "Google Home," the unit is voice-controlled and can play music, communicate with other devices in the home, provide anticipated information, and assist in everyday tasks like creating shopping lists, making dinner reservations and buying concert tickets. Google Home will sell for $129 -- about $50 less than Echo -- and it includes six months of the YouTube Red premium service for free. It is available now for preorder at the Google Store, as well as at Best Buy, Walmart and Target. Despite already owning an Echo, Tirias Research Principal Analyst Kevin Krewell already has preordered a Google Home. "The search on Echo is no way near as effective as plugging into Google search," he told TechNewsWorld. "When it comes to search, there is really no one better than Google at it."

The OS on the device wasn't called tvOS at the time; instead, it was just called 'Apple TV', and was updated alongside iOS. But in June 2015, the company announced Apple Music, which later arrived for iOS devices in iOS 8.4. Unfortunately, the Apple TV never received such an update, even though it was the firm's current entertainment box. iOS 9 was announced on the same day, but sure enough, that update didn't arrive for the Apple TV either, despite Apple promising to deliver it to all devices that ran iOS 8. That September, Apple finally launched the fourth-generation model, but continued to sell its previous device, even though it was clearly unsupported. Today, the company has finally removed its listing for the device from its website. Indeed, there is no longer a budget option for the Apple TV, with the cheapest model coming in at $149. The device really shouldn't be missed, as it doesn't even offer an App Store, and there are much more capable set-top boxes on the market now for a less expensive price.

In an email sent out today to education partners and employees, (obtained by 9to5Mac), Apple confirmed that it has killed this model, shifting its focus to the newer fourth-generation model. In the email, Apple states that the Apple TV 3 has “reached end of life” and is going to try to fulfill its backlog. Effective immediately, Apple TV (3rd generation), MD/199LL/A, has reached end of life and is now discontinued. The Apple Supply team is going to fulfill all shippable backlog. This isn’t the first time we’ve heard of the discontinuation of the third-gen Apple TV. Last month, Apple effectively pulled the model off of their store shelves and made it near impossible to purchase online. While not surprising, Apple has yet to comment on the removal of the third-generation model. However, it makes sense as the model was originally introduced in 2012, four years ago. One could assume a new fifth-generation model is on the horizon.

Yesterday, the service rolled out to its tenth country, Russia, with support for Sberbank initially. That’s in addition to the following countries: Australia, Canada, China, France, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland, the UK and U.S. Apple’s next step in terms of country support is likely Taiwan, with reports earlier this month noting banks are making preparations to support the service. Here’s the list of new banks and credit unions: American Heritage Bank Bank of Gravest Bank of Zachary Chain Bridge Bank Citizens Bank of Kentucky Citizens State Bank of Paola City National Bank of Colorado City Desjardins Bank First Bank of Missouri First Community National Bank First Credit Union First Flight Federal Credit Union First Guaranty Bank First National Bank (IA) First National Bank (MN) First National Bank (SD) First Savings Bank Grandpoint Bank HomeTrust Bank Merrimack Valley Federal Credit Union New Resource Bank Philadelphia Federal Credit Union Settlers Bank Shift Financial, Inc.

Ramin Talaie, Getty Images Advertisement Google is embarking on a wholesale revamp of its mobile phone strategy, debuting a pair of slick and powerful handsets that for the first time will go head-to-head with Apple Inc.’s iconic iPhone. Alphabet Inc.’s Google unveiled the Pixel and larger Pixel XL on Tuesday afternoon, the first phones that were conceptualized, designed, engineered and tested in-house. The Pixel handsets feature a Siri-like virtual assistant, flashy camera features and are the first to boast Android’s new Nougat 7.1 operating system. Their debut signals Google’s push into the $400 billion smartphone hardware business and shows that the company is willing to risk alienating partners like Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc. that sell Android-based phones. “Google is now the seller of record of this phone,” said Rick Osterloh, chief of the company’s new hardware division. He notes that the company is now managing inventory, building relationships with carriers, sourcing components, making supply chain deals and managing distribution. Google is even making accessories, including cases and cables. Until now, Google had satisfied itself with dipping a toe into the smartphone hardware business with the six-year-old Nexus program, a co-branding effort that outsourced the vast majority of development to other smartphone makers. While well regarded, Nexus handsets were mostly a way for Google to experiment. But along the way, executives began to see the benefit of the Apple approach: a unified portfolio of consumer electronics products that show off its services better than partners can. Popular Now These Industries are the Future of Additive Manufacturing Ford Sees Bumps Ahead with Used-Car Glut, Trump Presidency Tesla Seals $2 Billion SolarCity Deal A Home speaker device, a virtual reality headset, a Wi-Fi router system and an updated video streaming stick were also unveiled on Tuesday at an event in San Francisco. Getting into the hardware business is a big, risky financial and operational commitment. But Google needed its own handset to ensure distribution for its web services, and more complex offerings like virtual and augmented reality. So in the summer of 2015, CEO Sundar Pichai approved the Pixel project; development began last fall. “The difference with this device is that we started from the beginning,” says Dave Burke, who runs Android engineering. By contrast, Google’s contributions to Nexus phones typically didn’t happen until they were 90% done. When Osterloh, 44, came on board in mid-April, he brought Google’s hardware groups into one division, shuttering projects he didn’t see contributing to Google’s future. Now the engineers and designers from Google Glass, Chromecast and Pixel all work together. Keeping them separate, he says, made it “hard to drive toward the goal of portfolio strategy and focus.” Reflecting long-held ambitions to build an Apple-style supply chain, the hardware division now has a supply-management team, drawing on the expertise of the Nest smart-home unit acquired by Google nearly three years ago. Google declined to say how much it’s spending on the effort. However, Jason Bremner, a former Qualcomm Inc. executive who works on Google’s hardware products, put it in context. "Part of being the seller of record means that inventory, that supply chain risk — you know, hundreds of millions of dollars on the line on any given day — that’s on Google now," he said. Now that Google is designing phones itself, the company can at long last put together a product roadmap going out several years. For example, last month Burke was able to see a photo taken by a Google handset that won’t debut until next fall. That “would have never happened with Nexus,” he says. Going forward, more and more of the phones’ guts will be developed in-house. Burke says the company will eventually be able to ship its own custom “silicon,” a buzzword for customized processors that make devices work better. Love tech? Keep up with the manufacturing technology world with the M&T Newsletter, in your inbox every Friday morning It’s a very different setup from Osterloh’s previous Google gig, when he ran the Motorola division. “While we were part of Google, we were very arm’s-length,” he says. Now his team gets early access to the company’s advances in machine learning and innovations from the Assistant group. The Pixel phones will also be the first to run the next version of Android, Nougat 7.1, complete with Google tie-ins like pro camera effects, instant chat support, and a service that automatically frees up phone storage via the cloud.  Still, Google has deliberately built a firewall between the hardware and Android divisions so other phone makers’ proprietary technology doesn’t leak. Hiroshi Lockheimer, who runs the Android unit and is a longtime Osterloh pal, says his group will treat the hardware team like any customer. “Samsung is a very important partner, as is LG, Huawei and so on,” he says. “Rick is an important partner. Samsung tells us confidential information about their product line, their plans. We won’t tell LG that, and vice versa. That continues. Everyone is treated the same, including Rick’s team.” When Osterloh demonstrated the Pixel phones at Google’s Mountain View, California, headquarters recently, it was immediately clear the craftsmanship is light years ahead of the flimsy $1,500 Google Glass headsets and plastic Chromecast media players of yore. With their metal frames and precisely honed bezels and edges, the Pixels (which come in silver, black and limited-edition blue) have more in common with the elegant gear from Nest. The phones feature cameras that can snap photos quicker than the blink of an eye, app speeds once reserved for laptops and battery life that bests last year’s non-Google made Nexus phones. Osterloh proudly showed how one can twist the phone mid-air to activate the selfie-camera. Also notable is a fingerprint scanner that doubles as a trackpad (other Android phone makers will get to enable this, too) and software-enhanced gyroscopes that reduce shakiness in recorded video. The new phones are made up of off-the-shelf components from several suppliers, including a Snapdragon processor, and are assembled in Taiwan by HTC. But there is still custom work inside this first version, including wireless modem technology that has evolved from earlier experiments with Nexus. The Pixel also has chipsets optimized by Google that makes photo-taking and touchscreen response times much faster than any Android device yet built, Burke says. While Google has contracted HTC to assemble the Pixel phones, Osterloh says the approach is no different than Apple’s partnership with iPhone builder Foxconn. Flip the Pixel over and you’ll see “Made by Google,” another tip of the hat to Apple, which has long made much of the fact that its phones are “Designed by Apple in California.” Osterloh says Google will never say the Pixel is co-engineered with anyone else. He proudly proclaims, “It’s ours.” By Mark Gurman Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Food Daily Dish How to make apple hand pies for breakfast, dessert and anything in between Apple hand pies Bob Chamberlin / Los Angeles Times Apple hand pies. Apple hand pies. (Bob Chamberlin / Los Angeles Times) Noelle CarterContact Reporter Tender apples, pecans, rum-soaked raisins and a touch of cinnamon — can flavorings get much better when it comes to a fall fruit pie? Work the fillings into a smaller hand-held version and you’ve got a great treat that works for dessert, breakfast, a bagged lunch or simply a quick snack when you’re on the go.  KITCHEN TIP: Ever wonder how the pros roll their pie and cookie doughs so evenly? The trick is rolling from the center of the dough — not only does it allow for even thickness, but it gives you more control over the dough as you roll it. Check out this quick video for more tips: Los Angeles Times Test Kitchen Tip: Rolling Dough Los Angeles Times Test Kitchen director Noelle Carter shows how to roll dough. Los Angeles Times Test Kitchen director Noelle Carter shows how to roll dough. See more videos APPLE HAND PIES Total time: 1 hour, 20 minutes, plus chilling time for the filling and pies | Serves 12 1/2 cup raisins 1 cup rum, brandy or water 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter 4 large tart apples, such as Granny Smith, peeled, cored and diced into 1/4-inch pieces 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 cup toasted pecan pieces Prepared pie dough for 2 single crust (9- to 10-inch) pies, 36 to 40 ounces (see related recipe) 1 beaten egg Coarse or decorating sugar for garnishing the pies 1. Rehydrate the raisins: In a small saucepan, combine the raisins with the rum, brandy or water, and heat over medium heat until the raisins are softened and plump. Drain the raisins before adding to the apples. 2. In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Stir in the apple slices, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt, and cook, stirring frequently, just until the apple starts to soften, 3 to 4 minutes (the slices should still be crisp). Remove from heat and stir in the raisins and toasted pecans. Spread the apple mixture onto a baking sheet to stop the cooking process and allow the apples to cool quickly, then cover and refrigerate until needed. This makes about 4 cups filling, slightly more than is needed for 12 pies; the extra filling can be eaten right away or used later to flavor pancakes or muffins or as a topping for ice cream. The filling will keep for up to 4 days, covered and refrigerated. 3. Divide the prepared pie dough into 12 even pieces, about 3 ounces each, and shape each into a small disk. On a lightly floured board, carefully roll each piece into a circle about 6 inches in diameter and about one-eighth -inch thick. The dough will be flaky and will probably crack on the edges; without working the dough too much, gently mold the dough with your hands as it's rolled to form as perfect a circle as possible. Carefully set the circle aside and continue rolling until all of the circles are formed. 4. Brush the inside of each circle with a very light coating of beaten egg, going all the way to the edge of the circle. Place roughly one-fourth cup of the apple filling in the center of each circle, slightly off to one side (to make it easier to fold over the dough to form the hand pie), but leaving a 1-inch border around the edge on one side. Carefully — this can be tricky — fold over half of the dough, lining the edges up to form a half-circle; you may need to support the dough as it's folded over to keep it from cracking. Gently press the edges down to seal the pie. Trim the edges to clean them up, or gently brush the top of the edge of each pie, then fold the edge in for a cleaner-looking edge. Continue until all 12 pies are formed. 5. Place the prepared pies on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets and refrigerate them, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 400 degrees. 6. Remove the chilled pies and brush them with the egg wash. Use a small knife to slash 2 to 3 small steam vents in the top of each pie. Dust each pie with a sprinkling of coarse sugar. 7. Bake the pies, 1 sheet at a time (refrigerate the other sheet until ready to bake), on the center rack until the pastry is puffed and golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Rotate the pies halfway through baking for even coloring. Cool on a rack. The pies can be served warm or at room temperature.

Cabral/Lexington (North Carolina) Filed on October 5, 2016 | Last updated on October 5, 2016 at 07.58 pm Share More > Vote Google unveiled Pixel phone during an event on October 4 in San Francisco. (AFP) Pre-orders for the Pixel and Pixel XL - which start at $649 (Dh2,400) and $769 (Dh2,825), respectively  Could be long overdue, but better late than never. Internet titan Google on Tuesday threw its hat into the hardware device war with the launch of a slew of products, led by a new smartphone that it hopes will challenge - or at the very least, disrupt - the dominance of Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy devices. The Alphabet subsidiary unveiled the Pixel mobile phone, the Google Home smart speaker, the Daydream View virtual reality headset and Google Wi-Fi - all aimed at its rivals from Tim Cook and Co to South Korea to Amazon and even manufacturers who make devices running the Android operating system. The launches are Google's strongest signal that it is ready to butt heads with the industry's leaders. Mountain View, California-headquartered Google believes that technology is "evolving from mobile-first to artificial intelligence-first", CEO Sundar Pichai said in his opening keynote. "And we are all very excited about this shift," he added. While not the first device in the range - the Pixel C tablet was launched in 2015 while two Chromebook Pixel laptops were rolled out in 2013 and 2015 - the new Pixel handset touts its 12.3MP camera as the highest-rated "ever" in a smartphone, virtually unlimited storage for files and is the first device to have Google Assistant - the company's answer to Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana and Amazon's Alexa - built in. Coming in five- and 5.5-inch options, the Pixel marks the first time Google is veering off its strategy with its previous Nexus phones; while still manufactured by a third-party in HTC, the Pixel was built by Google from scratch. It also has the ability to get seven hours of battery life with just 15 minutes of charging. Taking a cue from Apple's partnership to launch the iPhone on AT&T, Google will be exclusively launching the Pixel with Verizon - a move that paid dividends for Apple. Alphabet shares inched up 0.3 per cent while Verizon slumped 1.2 per cent after the event. Other specs of the Pixel include a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 quad-core CPU, 4GB of RAM, either 32GB or 128GB of storage and a USB Type-C port. Pre-orders for the Pixel and Pixel XL - which start at $649 (Dh2,400) and $769 (Dh2,825), respectively - began on Tuesday in Australia, Canada, the US and the UK; India is slated for October 13. As at Press time, no other timetables have been set for other countries, including the UAE.   All-around assistant Google Assistant was showcased at the event, which started at 8pm UAE time on Tuesday. The company's executives showed how useful and versatile the virtual assistant is, from better translation results to managing media files and conversing with users. Google displayed its capabilities, saying that all you need to do is talk to it and things will be done for you, such as making a reservation at a restaurant by just speaking and doing nothing else. "Wouldn't it be nice if you had Google for your world?", Pichai quipped. Google Assistant featured prominently in the company's other launches. The Google Home speaker system shares several features of its main target, Amazon's Alexa-powered Echo, and can work seamlessly with the Pixel, similar to what Apple has with its iCloud connectivity across its iOS devices. As an example, telling Google Home to add something to a shopping list will sync it with a Pixel device and remind the user wherever he or she may be about it. Pre-orders for the $129 (Dh475) Home also began on Tuesday on the Google Store, as well as US retailers Target, Walmart and Best Buy. A six-month ad-free YouTube service also comes with every order. Complementing Home is Google Wifi, designed to handle multiple devices at the same time, whatever they may be doing, such as streaming or downloading. Multiple Wifi devices may be installed depending on the size of a home, with Google offering a special package for three of them at $299 (Dh1,100). A single unit costs $129. The Daydream View, on the other hand, is Google's venture into the world of VR. It also touts ease of use; an Android phone can be slotted into the headset and both devices will connect wirelessly. It also comes with a remote control, which can be used for a variety of things, from being used as a weapon in games to drawing on the virtual world. It is also designed in such a way that bespectacled users can easily slip it on. Compared to other VR devices like the Samsung Gear VR, it is cheaper at $79 (Dh290); it will be available next month. Google also released an upgraded Chromecast Ultra, which features better reliability, faster performance and streaming in 4K UHD. It will be available in November for $69 (Dh255). - alvin@khaleejtimes.com Share More > Vote MORE FROM Technology Technology Google wages hardware war on everyone Pre-orders for the Pixel and Pixel XL - which start at $649 (Dh2,400) ...

This topic hasn't been widely discussed at all, so don't feel bad if you were unaware of this major change. In all seriousness, Apple decided to remove the dedicated audio port on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus to clear space for other components and to help make the iPhone more water-resistant. The result undoubtedly ruffled some feathers — and Apple's ridiculous "courage" explanation didn't help matters — but there are some ways to work around the issue if you decided to go ahead and purchase an iPhone 7 anyway. Looking to charge your phone while you listen to music? You'll find several different ways to do it laid out in the post below. DON'T MISS: iPhone 7 vs. Galaxy S7 blind camera test: Guess which model hardcore Apple fans picked New headphones Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus ship with Lightning EarPods as well as an adapter that will let you plug regular headphones with a 3.5mm plug into the iPhone's Lightning port. Unfortunately, neither of those solutions will let you charge your phone while you listen to music. So, the obvious first answer to this problem is to purchase new wireless headphones. I personally use the Under Armour UA Wireless Headphones, which are sweat-proof and sound fantastic thanks to JBL audio. You don't need to spend anywhere near that much money to get good quality Bluetooth headphones though. Check out the SENSO ActivBuds, AYL Bluetooth Headphones, Mpow Jaws, Sound Intone P6 and Pantrasamia Premium Wireless Earbuds for more affordable options that are all well-rated. Adapter The Lightning to 3.5mm adapter included in the box with Apple's latest iPhones only has one port, so you can't charge your phone while you have headphones or an aux cable connected. There are some other adapters that include two ports though, thus allowing to you connect headphones and a power cord at the same time. Check out the Fstop Labs Lightning to 3.5mm Adapter, Canada Prime Adapter, Grapestec Charger and 3.5mm Earphone Jack Cable Adapter and Belkin's Lightning Audio + Charge RockStar. Dock When you're at your desk or stationary anywhere else, a dock can be just what the doctor ordered. There are a bunch of options out there but the best solution is probably Apple's own iPhone dock, which is available in space gray, silver, rose gold, gold and black.

How Apple Music, Tidal Exclusives Are Reshaping Music Industry Streaming services have changed the way superstars put out music, but fans are getting left in the cold. Will this new reality last? Streaming exclusives on high-profile albums have proven beneficial for major artists, but troublesome for fans and labels alike. Credit: Getty (7) By Steve Knopper October 5, 2016 More News Listen to 'Rolling Stone Music Now' Podcast: Inside the Streaming Wars Grammys to Recognize Streaming-Only Releases Exclusive Album 'Windows' the Future of Streaming, Sony Says All Stories This year, if you wanted to keep up with new albums by Beyoncé, Drake, Frank Ocean and Kanye West, among many others, you would have had to subscribe to not one but two streaming services. In a strategy that could represent a fundamental shift for the record business, Apple Music and Tidal have sought to pull users from Spotify, the world's biggest streaming service, with a series of competing exclusive releases. As part of the deals, Apple, in particular, funds superstar artists' songs and videos, and showcases them on TV commercials and online radio stations. Related How Apple Hopes to Win the Streaming War Tech giant is opening its checkbook and getting inolved with artists' careers like never before But over the past few months, a backlash has developed against this new reality. The tipping point may have come in August, when Frank Ocean delivered a video album, Endless, to fulfill the terms of his contract with Def Jam/Universal, then gave a superior album, Blonde, to Apple as part of an exclusive deal. (Blonde sold 276,000 copies in its first week – only Drake and Beyoncé have had bigger debuts this year.) Lucian Grainge, chief executive of Universal Music, the world's biggest record label, responded by sending an internal memo banning all Universal artists from making exclusive deals. Then, in September, Lady Gaga became the biggest star yet to come out against exclusives. "I told my label that if they signed those contracts with Apple Music and Tidal, I'd leak all my own new music," she said in an interview with Apple's Beats 1 Radio. On Gaga's side of the streaming debate is Spotify. The service has 100 million users, 40 million of whom pay for premium subscriptions, and an ironclad policy against exclusives. "We think exclusives are bad for artists and bad for fans," says a source close to the service. Spotify has reportedly gone so far as to retaliate against artists who have accepted exclusive deals with other streaming services, deliberately burying them once the exclusive shows up on Spotify, and keeping them out of top playlists. (Spotify reps have denied this.) The dispute over exclusives comes at a time when streaming has asserted its dominance in the music business. After a post-Napster malaise going on nearly two decades, labels finally increased revenues this year, by 8.1 percent, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. At the same time, labels aren't the money machines they were in the CD era, and Apple Music gives artists an alternate revenue source. Over the past year, it has funded videos by Taylor Swift, M.I.A. and the Weeknd, and given artists from Drake to DJ Khaled their own Beats 1 shows, not to mention TV advertising. In September, Travis Scott's Apple Music exclusive, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, became his first album to hit Number One on the charts. Superstar exclusives, in turn, have helped Apple and, to a lesser extent, Tidal generate millions of new customers, intensifying competition with Spotify. Apple, with pop-star-friendly Jimmy Iovine and his staff manning a sort of Record Industry South at the tech giant's new Los Angeles outpost, has learned that it makes sense to throw money at star power, regardless of what labels think. The exclusives "are working. These are successful," says Sean Glass, an ex-Apple Music employee. "But I know these don't contribute to [labels'] bottom lines as much as they would like." For Universal, at least, exclusives started to look like a dubious business proposition. "They were starting to see diminishing returns," says a source close to the situation. "By going to a single platform, you're limiting the audience." But for now, Universal is the only label taking a stand against exclusives. Tom Corson, president of Sony-owned RCA Records, says that after the success of recent exclusives like Bryson Tiller's Trapsoul and The Get Down soundtrack, the label would consider more if the right deals came along. "They're very tricky," he says. "We've used them to our advantage here; on the other hand, they do limit the exposure of the music. It's an ongoing discussion. I don't think we need an ultimatum or policy at the moment." Exclusives may be driving a wedge between some artists and their labels. Almost every artist contract has language that allows a label to release an album however it wants – and deny an exclusive if necessary. But, still, if Beyoncé wants to do an exclusive, label execs might not want to disagree. Perhaps equally alarming for labels, Chance the Rapper achieved massive success this year with an assist from an Apple exclusive – and no label whatsoever. "Exclusives are terrible for the music industry and fans alike." Ocean may have represented a worst-case scenario. Usually, an artist can't leave a contract without a breach-of-contract lawsuit. Reps for Ocean and Universal wouldn't comment on the split, but music-business sources say the label let him walk into Apple's arms – a major-label divorce that Prince and Neil Young were never able to achieve. Ocean had been unhappy at Def Jam for years and was looking to quit the label as quickly as possible. "I couldn't get nobody to pay attention to him," producer Tricky Stewart, who brought Ocean to Def Jam, told a reporter. Another source with knowledge of the situation believes Ocean's departure was inevitable. "Frank Ocean is a unique case," the source says. "He's an eccentric artist [who] doesn't want to be affiliated with a label." What does all this mean for fans? Namely, that they should expect exclusives to continue for the near future. Iovine recently said as much, suggesting that music listeners get used to the idea of having multiple streaming subscriptions, in the same way TV viewers might subscribe to both Netflix and Hulu. The situation partly reflects the vacuum at the heart of the music business – it's a Wild West where whoever invests the most money could win. But some worry that fans will get lost in the struggle. "Exclusives are terrible for the music industry and fans alike," says a music-business source. "The industry has traditionally been terrible to consumers. We drove them to piracy from overcharging for CDs with two good songs attached to 13 album cuts. Now, labels and streaming services are making them pay for a subscription service that doesn't have all of the music they're looking for. It's easy for millionaires like Jimmy to say that people will have multiple subscriptions like Netflix and Hulu. The reality is that half of the country can barely afford gas for their cars or to eat out more than once a month." ***** Scorecard: 2016's Biggest Exclusives These stars partnered with Apple or Tidal – here’s how it worked out. Drake, Views Service: Apple Music Terms: A reported multimillion-dollar deal, including "Hotline Bling" video production and Beats 1 interview First-week sales: 1.04 million Verdict: Apple’s campaign helped Views become the year’s biggest-selling LP so far. "I imagine Apple benefited mightily in new-subscriber trials," says Larry Miller, a former music exec who directs the music-business program at NYU Steinhardt. Kanye West, The Life of Pablo Service: Tidal Terms: West is a Tidal co-owner with a reported three percent equity in the company. First-week sales: 94,000 Verdict: Great album, messy release, disappointing sales – Kanye said it would be available only on Tidal, then reversed course within a few weeks. "Just massively confusing," Miller says. Frank Ocean, Blonde Service: Apple Music Terms: Unknown. But by leaving Def Jam, Ocean gets to keep the profits for himself, including what Forbes estimated to be $1 million in the album’s first week. First-week sales: 276,000 Verdict: By fleeing Def Jam/Universal, Ocean made music fans sympathetic to major record labels. "The optics on that were not perfect for him," Miller says. Beyoncé, Lemonade Service: Tidal Terms: As a part-owner of husband Jay Z’s company, Beyoncé earns additional equity when subscriber numbers rise. First-week sales: 653,000 Verdict: Lemonade was a critical and commercial smash (nearly 1.7 million units sold by midyear), and Tidal briefly shot to the top of the iTunes App Store rankings upon its release. "Flawless execution," Miller says. Sales based on track-equivalent units, including streaming and download numbers, according to Billboard.

Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 5, 2016 at 10:00AM This is Tim Cook's Apple now. Image source: Apple. It's now been exactly five years since Steve Jobs lost his fight with pancreatic cancer. Most observers wouldn't consider five years a particularly long period of time, but the tech world tends to move remarkably fast; five years is an eternity in Silicon Valley. That may be why it feels like Tim Cook has been Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO for so long, taking over just a few months prior to Jobs' death. Here are five notable ways that Apple has changed under Cook's leadership. 1. More collaborative Jobs had famously created internal silos within Apple in his never-ending pursuit of secrecy. There are no shortages of stories about the security measures that Apple used to employ, particularly around top-secret projects. While there should be no doubt that some of these structures are still in place, it's just as clear that Cook has broken down a lot of those walls with the goal of increasing collaboration. The high-profile ouster of former iOS chief Scott Forstall in 2012 was done in the name of collaboration. Forstall didn't get along with many other executives, including Jony Ive. Plus he refused to take ownership of the disastrous Apple Maps launch. Recognizing that in order to achieve the maximum level of integration across hardware, software, and services, it doesn't make much sense to compartmentalize engineers, Cook set about to improve Apple's ability to collaborate. It's probably not a coincidence that Apple's various online services, while not without fault, now perform better than ever before. 2. More shareholder-friendly As more of a traditional MBA-type of CEO, Cook places higher value on shareholders and their opinions. Jobs never had much regard for investors, and merely tolerated them by necessity. Jobs was also always averse to returning capital to shareholders, preferring to hoard cash to an unreasonable degree. He even ignored Warren Buffett's advice on the matter. Apple's massive capital return program is easily the most shareholder-friendly move that Cook has made. The company simply had way too much capital just idling on the balance sheet. Through June 2016, Apple had returned a cumulative total of $177 billion since 2012 between dividends and share repurchases. That's $177 billion more than what Apple returned to shareholders under Jobs. To be fair, Jobs delivered capital appreciation in spades. 3. More engaged with the media For the longest time under Jobs, Apple would mostly stonewall the media. Anytime you read any article about Apple, you could count on the obligatory line that Apple declined to comment. This was a strategic aspect of how Jobs would influence the media -- by using controlled favoritism. Any media outlet getting access to Apple was a big deal. After becoming CEO, Cook wanted to actively change the way that Apple interacts with the media. The company's longtime head of PR, Katie Cotton, retired in 2014 after 18 years at Apple. Officially, Cotton's retirement was attributed to personal reasons, but unofficially there was a clear shift in how Cook wanted Apple to be perceived. Mark Gurman's expose at 9to5Mac (prior to joining Bloomberg) back in 2014 on Apple's media and PR strategy is a must-read. These days, Apple responds to media inquiries and grants executive interviews far more than ever before. 4. More profitable It may also come as a shock to remember how much more modest Apple's financial performance was in 2011, relatively speaking. In the four full fiscal quarters preceding Jobs' death, Apple had sold 72.2 million iPhones, generated $108.2 billion in total sales, and posted $25.9 billion in net income. The company had $81.6 billion in total cash on the balance sheet a few days before his death. Apple has now reached a quarterly record of 74.8 million iPhones, trailing-12-month sales stand at over $220 billion, and net income over the past year has been almost $50 billion. The numbers speak for themselves: Cook has executed tremendously well. 5. More socially responsible Cook has also helped usher in a new era of social responsibility for Apple. From addressing human rights issues within its supply chain, to implementing a charitable matching program, and aggressively doubling down on environmental responsibility, it's clear Apple has grown meaningfully in this department. Not that Jobs' Apple was particularly lacking in social responsibility, but Jobs was more preoccupied with product development. It goes without saying that Jobs is irreplaceable. But you also can't question the contributions that Cook has made while putting his own mark on the company. Here's to you, Steve. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Oct 5, 2016 at 10:33AM iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone SE. Apple's latest iPhone looks a lot like the previous model. Image source: Apple. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has set the bar so high with the iPhone that the company has trouble topping itself. In fact, since it added Siri in the iPhone 4s in 2011, you could argue that the company has not made any truly revolutionary changes. You could also argue that Apple Pay, which was first released in 2014 with the iPhone 6, meets that threshold, but certainly nothing on the 6s or 7 models does. It's not that these are not fabulous phones. Every single iPhone improves upon the last with a faster processor along with other improvements. The 7 and 7 Plus models have better cameras, double the storage space on the entry-level models from the previous standard, marginally better battery life, and a slightly improved look. The problem is that for most consumers these changes are like adding five miles per hour to the top speed of a Ferrari. It sounds nice, and it counts as being better, but very few people will ever take advantage of the improvements. iPhone 7 and 7 Plus may be the best phones ever created, but for the most part, the improvements over the 6s and 6s Plus they replace won't be noticed by most users. The previous-generation phones were so good that nothing short of adding revolutionary new functionality should make upgrading worth it. That's not a problem unique to Apple. Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) faces it, too, when it releases new versions of its Galaxy Phone. Better has become ho-hum and even bad phones are so good that it has become very hard to impress people. Hands-on with the iPhone 7 Plus As an avid iPhone user who covers the technology space, I consider upgrading my phone each year for work. And while I was happy when my order of the iPhone 7 in the new black color arrived, actually using it was a bit underwhelming. Physically, aside from the change in color from my previous phone's space grey, the two units look and feel nearly the same. The new home button and the simulated click work well -- perhaps even a little better than the old one. In addition, 3D Touch -- a feature that allows users to quickly perform certain actions by tapping the screen with varying amounts of pressure -- is conceivably useful, whereas it was entirely useless on my previous iPhone. The improved processor and camera may well be as revolutionary as Apple says they are, but after a week or so of use (and dozens of pictures of my cats), it's hard to notice that anything has changed. Battery life is anecdotally better as on my last iPhone, a full workday of email, pictures, and playing Pokemon Go often left me sub-20% by 5 p.m. Now, after similar usage, I end up closer to 40%, but it's also worth noting that my past experience has shown that batteries tend to perform better when a phone is new. And while I like the new iPhone because it has double the storage of the previous model -- 32GB versus 16GB for the iPhone 6s Plus -- I'm actually more annoyed by the lack of a headphone jack than I expected to be. It's not that the included Lightning headphones don't work and it was nice of Apple to include a dongle/adapter so people can use old ones, but there are unexpected issues. The problem is that I almost never use headphones, but I do plug into my car stereo using the aux port in my vehicle and the headset jack on the iPhone. I can still do that via the dongle, but it's mildly annoying to have to carry the adapter with me or buy a second one to leave in the car. Apple has itself to beat The problem for Apple (and to a lesser extent, Samsung) is that its phones are so great that even an iPhone 5 does more than most people need. This has not been a huge drag on Apple, but iPhone replacement cycles are lengthening, according to research from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), which said: In the year ending with the June 2013 quarter, 66% of old iPhones were either under one year old or from 1-2 years old. By the March 2016 quarter, 51% of old iPhones were either under one year old or from 1-2 years old. The oldest retiring iPhones (those over three years old) increased from 5% of all old phones in the year ending with the June 2013 quarter to 12% in the March 2016 quarter. CIRP cites two reasons for the longer replacement cycle. "The rate of change in iPhone features has slowed," wrote the company. "In addition, phone financing plans now encourage iPhone owners to hold on to their current phone." There's still a certain cultural cachet to getting the latest iPhone or even the newest Samsung device, but there's no performance reason for most people to upgrade every two years, let alone every year. Incremental performance increases are simply not that exciting or even noticeable to most users, If Apple wants to go back to the frenzy created by the early iPhones (or Samsung wants to steal its thunder), it needs real innovation. People will likely hold onto their iPhones longer if the next one, be it the 7s or the 8, simply offers more of the same but a little better. That would be bad news for a company that generates over 60% of its annual revenue from iPhone sales. With iPhone 7, Apple has inched the bar forward and that's just not very exciting. If that keeps happening, consumers will likely start paying less attention to new releases and having the latest model may become even less of a status symbol. Daniel Kline owns shares of Apple.

The "New Mac Candle" created by Twelve South, an online retailer specializing in Apple accessories, sold out from their online store within 24 hours. According to the product description, the $24 candle was Hand Poured in Charleston, SC using 100 percent Soy Wax and features scent notes of mint, peach, basil, lavender, mandarin and sage. "We've always wanted to have some carefully curated corporate merchandise, so yesterday we finally released some things," co-founder Andrew Green told Adweek. "One of them was this crazy idea I had a couple months ago [for a candle] that smells like that smell when you open a new Mac for the first time." The "crazy idea" proved to be a popular one as the sites stock of hundreds of candles sold out within its first 24 hours on sale. The candle's popularity has encouraged Green to increase production of the niche product for fellow Mac lovers before the holiday season. "I can't imagine a better gift for a Mac lover for the holidays," Green said. "It's an idea that's clearly struck a nerve, so we'll make more."

This leaves the $149 Apple TV 4 as the only new option for purchase on the Apple store (refurbished 3rd-gen units are still available for now). This move was not unexpected. With the 2015 release of the 4th-gen Apple TV, it seemed likely that the 2012 3rd-gen TV was on its way out. The product was removed from the Apple website quietly -- the former product page now redirects to the Apple TV 4. Besides refurbished units, of which there are a limited number, consumers can still get a 3rd-gen Apple TV at various distributors for prices near the original tag. How and if Apple continues support for the 3rd-gen TV, however, remains to be seen. In response to questions about Apple's decision, a representative said, "The future of TV is apps and our customers love the experience of controlling the new Apple TV with voice and touch through the Siri Remote ... So we've decided to focus entirely on this app-centered TV experience with the new AppleTV."

Okt 2016 17:34 MESZ Freigeben 0 Twittern 0 Share0 Drucken Firmen: Apple Inc. AKTUELLER KURS Symbol Kurs Veränderung AAPL 109,95 (YouTube/Stanford) Published below is the full text of a commencement speech former Apple CEO Steve Jobs gave at Stanford University in 2005. It's a well-known speech, and one of Jobs' most notable public appearances. It's a short speech, but it still highlights Jobs' considerable strengths as a storyteller and inspirational leader.  On Wednesday, current Apple CEO Tim Cook and other people close to Apple memorialized Jobs, who died five years ago.  Read the speech:  I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories. The first story is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out? It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: "We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?" They said: "Of course." My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college. And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting. It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5¢ deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example: Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating. None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And sinceWindows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later. Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life. My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating. I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me — I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over. I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life. During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together. I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle. My third story is about death. When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right." It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something. Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes. I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and I'm fine now. This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept: No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true. Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960's, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions. Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish." It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. Thank you all very much.

The thing is, wireless is now the present. The technology has finally reached the point where you can safely go wire-free with almost no downsides. Bluetooth headphones are no longer ridiculously over-priced, plus they’re under-performing. For the past six months, I’ve been exclusively using wireless headphones. When it came to get new headphones, I went all-in and invested in a pair of Sennheiser Moment 2.0 (UK). They’re one of the best Bluetooth headphones Best Bluetooth Headphones in 2016 Best Bluetooth Headphones in 2016 Android and Apple phones may dispense with their audio jacks. Bluetooth, on the other hand, may replace wires entirely. So you may want to invest in Bluetooth headphones. But which one? Read More available right now. Since that time, I’ve realized that wireless headphones are miles better than the alternatives. Here are five reasons why. 1. Wireless Is More Fun Until you move to wireless headphones, you don’t really realize how annoying wires can be. I used to use wired earbuds and the cable kept getting caught on door handles or tangled up into knots in my pocket. It was just one of those things that happened so often I barely noticed it anymore. But when I switched to wireless, it quickly became clear how much that sucked. Ads by Google Sennheiser Momentum Wireless - Black Sennheiser Momentum Wireless - Black Closed back, over-ear design featuring Bluetooth technology and immediate pairing to smart devices using NFC connectivity for wireless freedom Buy Now At Amazon $380.10 With wireless headphones, you’re free of all those little annoyances. There are no wires to get caught. You just don’t have to think about it. You’re free to dance, cook, go to the toilet, and move around your house without worrying about yanking out a cable, spilling hot oil on yourself, or accidentally dunking your phone. It’s an absolute dream. 2. Wireless Headphones Last Longer The biggest point of failure in headphones is the cable. I’ve spent way too much time taking apart broken headphones How to Fix Broken Headphones How to Fix Broken Headphones Despite having a reasonable pair of Sennheisers and looking after them, my headphones broke recently — like they always do. Rather than replace them, I decided to repair my headphones. Here's how. Read More and soldering in new wires because it was the only part that didn’t work. Everything else in the headphones was as good as new — it was just that the tiny, millimeter-thin cable couldn’t stand up to daily use. It was even worse with earbuds. I’d get a few months of listening out of them, and if the manufacturer had a good warranty then they might send me a second pair. But at least twice a year I was in the market for a new pair. You can’t buy decent earbuds more than a few times a year without breaking the bank! Since moving to wireless, I haven’t had a single issue. There simply aren’t any cables to break. All the components inside the headphones are rock solid and, as long as I don’t take them swimming, will likely last for years. It’s the same with pretty much all wireless headphones. They’ve removed the only bit that breaks easily. As long as you can look after your things and don’t lose them, they’re going to last a lot longer than equivalent wired pairs. The point of failure is gone. This one advantage more than makes up for any extra upfront cost. 3. Wireless Sounds Good Enough For a long time, wireless headphones used to sound noticeably worse than their wired counterparts. They just weren’t capable of the same quality of playback as a pair of wired headphones. That’s different now, and for two reasons. First, Bluetooth has improved a lot Bluetooth 5: What's New and What's Good? Bluetooth 5: What's New and What's Good? The latest version of Bluetooth has been announced and will be packed full of improvements and new features. Here's everything you need to know about it. Read More over the years. It’s no longer the janky service that failed to connect god-awful earpieces to Blackberry phones. Modern Bluetooth devices from decent manufacturers are seamless and can readily connect to all your devices. I’ve taken potshots at Bluetooth over the years, but it’s finally changed its tune. Second, with the rise of streaming music services The End of Ownership: Netflix, Spotify, and The Streaming Generation The End of Ownership: Netflix, Spotify, and The Streaming Generation Read More like Spotify and Apple Music, the quality of music files that most people are listening to has dropped. Nowadays, only people with incredible ears and even more incredible audio setups can hear the subtle differences in higher audio quality Are You an Audiophile? These 10 Questions Will Reveal the Truth Are You an Audiophile? These 10 Questions Will Reveal the Truth You might think you are an audiophile, but in reality very few music lovers tick all of the necessary boxes. Are you really an audiophile? Or are you just a great pretender? Read More  — and most streaming services aren’t even transmitting those higher-quality details thanks to audio compression. Since the majority of people can’t hear the difference between a high-quality lossy stream and a CD, it makes sense for services to use them. Tidal, which makes a big deal out of their higher-quality files, is struggling to get users Is Jay Z's Tidal Music Worth a Second Listen? Is Jay Z's Tidal Music Worth a Second Listen? We weren't impressed by Jay Z's TIDAL at launch. Now, one year on, we thought we’d check in to see if TIDAL is worth using... Read More . They just don’t make a difference in the real world. A decent pair of Bluetooth headphones is more than capable of playing back Spotify at its full bitrate. You’re not losing any sound quality through the headphones; it wasn’t really there to begin with. There’s just no point listening to a streaming service with a $2,000 dollar audiophile setup — the equipment massively exceeds the quality of the source material. 4. Battery Life Isn’t an Issue Anymore We now live in the age of regular charging. It’s just a thing you need to put up with. Some devices, like Amazon’s Kindle (CA/UK), can last a lot longer, but for the most part people are conditioned to plugging electronics in everyday or, at most, every other day. Wireless headphones have more than enough battery life for daily use. The Sennheiser Momentums that I use have roughly 24 hours of battery life. As in, 24 hours of actual, continuous audio playback. Last week, I flew from Thailand to Ireland — 20 hours of travel time — listening to them non-stop. They were still at 40% battery when I arrived home, tired and jetlagged. They normally last me a week between charges. Even wireless earbuds like Apple’s new Airpods have enough battery life for regular use. They get five hours from a single charge, and the included charging case takes that to more than 24 hours. Most people just aren’t listening to that much audio at a time. Think about how often you need to charge your phone, smartwatch, tablet, laptop, or Snapchat Spectacles Snapchat Spectacles: Everything You Need to Know in a Snap Snapchat Spectacles: Everything You Need to Know in a Snap Over the past few days, Snapchat has rebranded to Snap Inc. and it launched a new hardware product called Spectacles.

It makes far more sense just to accept this as the end of wired headphones for most of us. They’ll always have a place for people on a budget and for audiophiles, but for everyone in the middle, wireless is going to be the better option going forward. It’s Time to Go Wireless! In 2003, cyberpunk author William Gibson wrote that “the future is already here — it’s just not evenly distributed”. For a long time, that’s been true of wireless headphones. They’ve always been around but the drawbacks have outweighed the benefits. That’s now changed.

Despite higher capacity batteries and more energy efficient components, battery technology hasn’t evolved in the same way the rest of your phone has over the past few years. Each iOS update usually brings with it a flurry of complaints about battery life, and iOS 10 iOS 10 Is Here! Why You Should Upgrade Right Now iOS 10 Is Here! Why You Should Upgrade Right Now Apple's tenth revision of its mobile operating system is here. This is how to upgrade right now for free. Read More is no exception. Initial battery tests are positive, particularly on older devices, but there are still a few things you can do to help your iPhone last longer. The Post-Upgrade Battery Hit Straight after you upgrade your phone to iOS 10 (or any other version) you’re likely to encounter shorter battery life. One reason for this is that your phone has to index a lot of new data, particularly if Apple has introduced new features. Is anyone seeing dramatic increase in battery drain after updating to iOS 10? — Prudence Paine (@PruPaine) September 21, 2016 This will take place in the background, whether you’re using battery power or remaining plugged in. After the iOS 10 update, my iPhone 6 drained from 100% to 20% within about 4 hours. It took a day or two for things to settle down, after which battery life seems better than iOS 9. iOS 10’s Photos app also has a lot of work to do when you first upgrade. The new app scans your entire library, looking for faces and recognizable scenes and objects. This only takes place when your phone is plugged in, but the added processor drain will cause your device to charge slower than usual. Ads by Google The other reason you might experience post-upgrade battery drain is down to use. You want to try out new features, play with iMessage apps, send stickers and handwritten messages How to Use All the New Messages Features in iOS 10 How to Use All the New Messages Features in iOS 10 With the arrival of iOS 10, Apple's Messages app received its single biggest update since its introduction. Read More , customize your lock screen, update third-party apps, and try out Siri’s new tricks. You’ll likely be using your phone more during this grace period, which means more battery drain. So is iOS 10 a battery hog? It doesn’t seem so. Anecdotal reports aside, according to ArsTechnica’s own tests, iOS 10 is marginally better on all devices except the iPhone 5s and SE. This is probably down to Apple further optimizing the OS, though benchmarks should always be taken with a grain of salt. Turn Off Widgets iOS 10 moves widgets from the Notification Center to the home and lock screens. You can access them by swiping right, and there are quite a few enabled by default when you first upgrade. More widgets means more processing power, additional requests for data, and increased battery drain. Turn off any you don’t need by scrolling to the bottom of the list and tapping Edit. Many of these (like Apple’s News widget) update in the background, some rely on data stored on your iPhone (like Calendar), others are simply app shortcuts (like Shazam and Evernote). Cut out any you don’t need, like duplicate weather widgets and core iOS services you don’t use. Some third party widgets may not work properly, or simply aren’t that useful. Be brutal and save your battery. Be wary of adding too many widgets that rely on your GPS location, like public transportation apps. This is especially true for older devices, which have less energy efficient geolocation technology. Battery Drain & Display If you have an iPhone 6s, SE, or new iPhone 7 variant, then you can use a feature called Raise to Wake. As you’d expect, the feature turns on the screen when movement is detected. This may result in your screen waking up more often than you’d like, so you can turn it off at the expense of convenience. Head to Settings > Display & Brightness to turn off Raise to Wake. Another feature that you might want to make use of is the Facedown Detection feature introduced with iOS 9. By simply leaving your iPhone facedown on a surface, the screen won’t light up when you receive a notification. It only works on the iPhone 5s, 6, 6s, SE, 7 and Plus models, and it’s worth remembering. Cut Down on Notifications Notifications have long been a battery drain. The more push requests your phone receives, the more data is used. This can lead to serious battery drain over the course of a day, especially if you’re using a cellular connection. iOS 10 makes notifications even more power-hungry by introducing real-time data. Some features are handy, like the ability to see where your Uber is without launching the app. Others are less so, like news apps including rich media purely for the sake of it. n There’s never been a better time to get your Notifications in check Take Control of iOS Notifications on Your iPhone or iPad Take Control of iOS Notifications on Your iPhone or iPad Your iPhone can notify you about just about anything, but left unchecked, this feature can quickly get out of control. Here's how to make notifications useful again. Read More . Head to Settings > Notifications and disable anything non-essential using the Allow Notifications toggle. Free-to-play games, social networks you rarely use, and anything that uses notifications to bug you into opening the app should go. Check Your Usage Head to Settings > Battery to see a breakdown of your iPhone battery usage by application and service.

Here are a few things you can try: Low Power Mode — Enable it in the Settings > Battery menu. Reduces frequency of mail fetch and background app refresh, and tones down iOS eye candy to save battery. Fetch Mail Less Frequently — Adjust this from Settings > Mail > Accounts. Less frequent is better. It uses less data and background processes. Reduce GPS Usage — Revoke permission for any apps that don’t need it under Settings > Privacy > Location Services. Ditch Dynamic Wallpapers — Use a static one to save power under Settings > Wallpaper. Dim Your Screen — Swipe up to reveal Control Center and adjust your screen brightness manually. Ditch Eye Candy — You can turn off parallax backgrounds and visual effects via Settings > General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion. Update iOS — Check that you’re running the latest version of iOS under Settings > General > Software Update for the latest bug fixes.

 Here's the full text of Steve Jobs' famous Stanford commencement speech Kif Leswing Oct. 5, 2016, 11:34 AM 8,743 facebook linkedin twitter email print YouTube/Stanford Published below is the full text of a commencement speech former Apple CEO Steve Jobs gave at Stanford University in 2005. It's a well-known speech, and one of Jobs' most notable public appearances. It's a short speech, but it still highlights Jobs' considerable strengths as a storyteller and inspirational leader.  On Wednesday, current Apple CEO Tim Cook and other people close to Apple memorialized Jobs, who died five years ago.  Read the speech:  I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories. The first story is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out? It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: "We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?" They said: "Of course." My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college. And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting. It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5¢ deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example: Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating. None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And sinceWindows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later. Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life. My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating. I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me — I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over. I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life. During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together. I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle. My third story is about death. When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right." It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something. Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes. I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and I'm fine now. This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept: No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true. Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960's, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions. Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish." It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. Thank you all very much.

The new iPhone 7 is also more powerful than high-end Android handsets, and AnTuTu’s rankings for September show there’s really no contest. DON’T MISS: iPhone 7 vs. Galaxy S7 blind camera test: Guess which model hardcore Apple fans picked AnTuTu released the top 10 devices for the month of September, with the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7 taking the top two spots with scores of 172644 and 170124, respectively. With a score of 160856, the LeEco Le Pro 3 took the third place and Xiaomi’s Mi 5s Plus and Mi 5s is ranked fourth. iphone-7-antutu-top-10-september-2016More What's important to know about the Le Pro 3 is that it sports a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, which is exactly the chip that Google used for its Pixel and Pixel XL phones. That means the iPhone 7 will beat the Pixel in similar tests as well. Geekbench 4 scores that just hit the web confirm as much — Google's Pixels score a 1580 on the single-core test and about 4100 on the multi-core test, while Apple's latest iPhones score 3430 and about 5600. Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 was the seventh fastest smartphone according to AnTuTu benchmarks, with a score of 138373. That’s slightly above the iPhone 6s’ score of 136477, which didn’t make the top 10. The only device that managed to outscore the iPhone 7 in these tests is also an Apple device, the iPad Pro tablet, whose AnTuTu score is 177266. A leak earlier this week revealed that the chips going into next year’s iPads will be even faster than the A10 Fusion. Here’s the September top 10 for all iOS devices: iphone-7-antutu-top-10-september-2016-2More Of course, benchmarks alone never tell the whole story, but real-life tests have also proven that the iPhone 7's rivals are no match for Apple's latest phones. The iPhone 7 is consistently faster than the Galaxy Note 7, and therefore faster than most high-end devices that pack similar hardware.

Sonos speakers have yet to appear on Apple's website in other countries, but they should be added in the coming weeks. Sonos' wireless Wi-Fi-connected PLAY:1 and PLAY:5 speakers can be purchased from Apple for $199 and $499 respectively. Pricing in other countries includes $249 and $649 in Canada, $299 and $749 in Australia, £169 and £429 in the United Kingdom, and €229 and €579 in many other European countries. In line with today's in-store launch, Apple has expanded its free 3-month Apple Music gift card offer with the purchase of a Sonos speaker to several countries, including Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. The free 3-month Apple Music gift card offer is valid between today and December 31.

Go buy sonos Buyer be warned.. you'll start buying a lot more speakers for the house until EVERY room has music. Rating: 4 Votes Cuban Missles 6 weeks ago I just bought two Play:1s and am very happy with them. They had a promo for free shipping and that was enough. Don't plan on ever using Apple music so that would not have been much of an incentive for me. I previously had speakers running through Airplay, but I had three issues. Occasionally the speaker would drop and I would need to re-acquire it. Also, I could not play different music on different speakers. Lastly, I had one speaker on bluetooth and it was always off sync from the other speakers by a fraction of a second. With Sonos, all my issues have been resolved. Rating: 4 Votes dannyyankou 6 weeks ago Wait, they're offering a 3 month Apple Music gift card? Isn't the free trial 3 months? I guess you can start a free trial and add the gift card later, but that's a weak incentive. Rating: 2 Votes ILuvEggplant 6 weeks ago I sort of expect Sonos to be an Apple acquisition and this is the first phase. Think about it - Google/Amazon have similar products, but with their Siri competitors embedded in it. Instead of starting from scratch, acquire a player with similar brand/customer appeal - then evolve it to compete with the others. Plus, can you imagine what a 'speakerOS' on Sonos could be like? More than just streaming music services... They could evolve AirPlay to behave more like the patented Sonos protocol that keeps the wifi speakers in perfect sync. Sonos has stated that their goal is to move the next generation of product towards speech recognition - but why start from scratch? To me it seems like a great fit. good god i hope you are wrong. Apple has destroyed companies they've purchased. They are terrible at software. The proof is in the pudding. Leave Sonos out of it. Rating: 2 Votes spazzcat 6 weeks ago seems odd. it doesn't have airplay.. has a seperate app and ecosystem.. why would apple want to break their E2E experience chain? It doesn't need airplay. Rating: 2 Votes truthertech 6 weeks ago Okay why shop at the apple store when you can buy the same products tax free and maybe at a discount elsewhere online? Forgot to add that you have to drive to the store, park, deal with kids, and a very busy apple store at that... Your comment reminds me of the famous Yogi Berra quote in response to whether he was going to go to a highly regarded restaurant, "Nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded!" Rating: 2 Votes dmylrea 6 weeks ago Sonos makes a very good product so I hope this helps them out. Agreed (have had and still do since first gen product line), and their "no-discount" pricing falls in line with Apple's so it's a great match.

Rating: 1 Votes Bromeo 6 weeks ago Picked up a Sonos kit a week ago including two speakers, and two Connect units to add Sonos to my existing whole house audio. Color me impressed. Should have done this years ago instead of the daily dance with AirPlay, let alone the constant battery drain on my iPhone doing the streaming. Good on Apple and Sonos for the partnership. Apple Music works quite well through Sonos - it plays all day without stopping and even allows multiple streams playing different music in each zone if I want. Tempted to pick up a second Play:1 for my office and take advantage of the gift card. Hmmm! Rating: 1 Votes alfonsog 6 weeks ago Wait, they're offering a 3 month Apple Music gift card?

FOXSPORTS 3 Things Baltimore Ravens Fans Are Insanely Tired Of By Chris Schisler/FanSided via Ebony Bird Oct 5, 2016 at 11:25a ET 0 Shares Sep 25, 2016; Jacksonville, FL, USA; Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco (5) loses the ball after it was stripped by Jacksonville Jaguars defensive end Yannick Ngakoue (91) during the second quarter of a football game at EverBank Field. Mandatory Credit: Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sports Three Things Baltimore Ravens Fans Never Ever Want To See Again… When you sign up to become part of the Ravens flock, you’re signing up for something pretty special. Being a Baltimore Ravens fan is being part of one of the most passionate groups in the world of sports. However it is kind of like an iPhone agreement of terms and conditions. Nobody takes the time to read it and there are some things in there that nobody likes. It’s not like your going to stop using your smartphone, you just hope Apple gets their act together. Like Apple lovers, Ravens fans aren’t going anywhere. They are however, waiting for a nice upgrade.

Oakland Raiders: Bullet Points3d ago Ravens Vs. Raiders: A Conversation With Just Blog Baby3d ago With that in mind here are three things that Ravens fans never want to see again. If you did away with these three things, Ravens fans would see their blood pressure go back to a normal level and all would be good with the world. These three things are the ticket to stressful Sundays and tense muscles. Today we’re going to take a look at the most frustrating and most mind boggling parts of the Ravens experience. We don’t complain just to complain. Today we’re letting it be known that we want our team to step up their game. By telling them the things they need to stop doing, we’re just giving constructive feedback. When you parents yell at you, they don’t stop loving you. Today I’m going to yell at John Harbaugh and company, but I’m not going to stop loving the purple and black. Next: Slow Starts Sep 25, 2016; Jacksonville, FL, USA; Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh (center) talks with wide receiver Steve Smith (89) after a altercation with Jacksonville Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey (not pictured) following a game at EverBank Field. Baltimore Ravens won 19-17. Mandatory Credit: Logan Bowles-USA TODAY Sports 1. Slow Starts: Remember when Brian Billick gave a tutorial on how to go into the Lion’s den? Well the basic principle was that you go into the game with a mission. Starting the game slow makes everything harder. The Ravens are essentially the college student who believes staying up all night to do a paper is a good idea. When the Ravens are pressured to perform they usually do it. When the game starts it seems like they don’t have a sense of urgency. I am of the belief that if you can do it in the fourth quarter, you can do it the entire football game. Why does this team wait for the switch to be flipped to begin playing their best football? To me this is an attitude. Just like necessity is the father of invention, desperation gives birth to a sense of urgency. The 20-2 start against Cleveland is a good example of this. Squandering a 16-7 lead just to get it back at the end in Jacksonville, is a perfect example of this. The Ravens need to eliminate slow starts. They need to never feel comfortable when the game starts. When this team is comfortable the gas pedal isn’t slammed against the car’s floor. Baltimore deserves the purple and black’s best from start to finish. Why did they have to wait until late in the second half to get the Ravens fan base with their hopes up? A fast start against the Raiders may have led to a different result. Next: Running Routes Short Of The Sticks May 28, 2015; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator Marc Trestman walks off the field after the OTA at the Under Armour Performance Center. Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY Sports Running Routes Short Of The Sticks It’s 3rd and 8 so don’t you know what’s coming? The defense certainly does. Marc Trestman, the offensive coordinator that actually makes us miss Cam Cameron, will call a four yard pass and ask the receiver to make a miraculous effort to move the chains. It’s as predictable as a Progressive Insurance commercial. It’s as uneventful as a sitcom that gets canceled after eight episodes. It’s as frustrating as not being able to open an “easy open” container. The concept is to rely on yards after the catch, thinking that the defense isn’t going to allow anything deeper. There is some logic to it but ultimately it is bad math. When eight yards is needed, routes running beyond eight yards is usually a good idea. Four yards plus two after the catch doesn’t equal eight. While we’re on the subject can we stop with the play-action pass to Kyle Juszczyk in the flat? Last year we did it on almost every first down. It’s better this year but it’s still not good. It’s predictable and it’s called too frequently. Maybe we can trow less two yard passes that are set up for nothing while we’re on it. At the very least, let’s actually try to move the chains while passing on third downs. Next: A Lack Of Discipline Sep 21, 2014; Orchard Park, NY, USA; A general view of a penalty flag thrown by a official during a game between the Buffalo Bills and the San Diego Chargers at Ralph Wilson Stadium. San Diego beats Buffalo 22 to 10. Mandatory Credit: Timothy T. Ludwig-USA TODAY Sports 3. A Lack Of Discipline The purple and black were on their way to a huge defensive stop. Instead Terrell Suggs lined up off sides against the Raiders. It’s hard to get on Suggs too much for this because he is one of the greatest players in franchise history. It’s still wildly annoying though. The Mike Wallace taunting penalty was simply frustrating. There’s no need for that kind of thing on the football field. I generally hate taunting as a penalty, but you cannot bring it upon yourself. It just feels like this team has a lack of discipline sometimes. It really boils down to not doing the little things that make it harder to win. Don’t line up over the line of scrimmage, don’t let emotions get the best of you. It’s not the first time we’ve seen things like this in a Ravens game. Next: Ravens Cut Justin Forsett With New Vision For Backfield At the end of the day the Ravens just need to stop doing things that make it harder than it has to be. Getting off to a slow start makes every play more critical. Bad play-calling doesn’t allow talented players to be successful. Stupid penalties are simply unacceptable. The Ravens fans want to see these three things end in Baltimore.

Now it must fix its retail strategy Unlike Apple, company lacks its own retail stores Video Photo Google Pixel phones and the Google Daydream View VR viewer are displayed during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco, California, U.S. October 4, 2016. (REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach) The sculpture of a Google Inc.’s Android mobile operating system mascot sits inside the Googleplex headquarters in Mountain View, California, on Feb. 18, 2016. (Bloomberg photo by Michael Short) By Mark Bergen and Mark Gurman, Bloomberg Oct 5, 2016 at 9:55 am | Print View Google unveiled new hardware from smartphones and smart speakers to wireless routers on Tuesday. It was a yearlong odyssey that involved design, supply chain negotiations and the search for a manufacturing partner. Now the Alphabet Inc. unit must grapple with the equally daunting challenge of getting the gadgets to consumers. It has a history of retail strategies that either struggled or never got off the ground, according to people familiar with the company’s retail efforts. What’s more, it’s inexperienced dealing with returns and recycling. And unlike rival Apple Inc., the company lacks its own stores where it can showcase hardware as it pleases and instead relies on other companies’ in-store displays. This time, the stakes are higher because the latest gadgets are vehicles for Google’s digital assistant, a key product that is chasing Amazon.com Inc.’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri. “We view go-to-market as a clear hurdle to wide acceptance, which will require investments in brand, marketing and distribution to overcome,” UBS analyst Eric Sheridan wrote in a note to investors. Google is selling the new Pixel phones at Verizon Communications and Best Buy stores in the U.S., via its own online store, a temporary physical store in New York City and through its wireless service Project Fi. It’s working with a small number of other wireless carriers and retailers in countries including Germany and India. Google Home, the new speaker, is available at Best Buy, Wal-Mart Stores and Target stores, in addition to Google’s online store. Cutting distribution deals with a handful of carriers and retailers isn’t enough, according to Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson. “Google will have to up its customer-service game and do many more distribution partnerships,” he said. Many of Google’s past efforts at selling hardware have fizzled. When the company started its Nexus brand in 2010 it planned to market the phones online only, but sales never took off. About 200,000 of the first Nexus model sold, short of Google’s target of several million units, according to a person who worked on the device. Then there was Android Silver. Kicked off some time in 2014, the internal project was designed to sell high-end Android handsets with partners to compete with Apple. Google set up a retail lab for the effort, claiming an entire building near its Mountain View, California headquarters, according to former employees. But it never got off the ground. Nikesh Arora, Google’s sales chief at the time, drove the initiative. When he left in July 2014, Android Silver was shelved. One former Google executive called it a boondoggle. The former Googlers didn’t want to be identified discussing private information. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. Such experiments are a contrast to Apple stores that are the envy of the retail industry. Apple considers the iPhone in terms of the product’s complete life cycle, from leaving the factory to when customers stop using the device. Apple offers a recycling program through physical and online stores. Google’s new smartphone unit approached potential wireless carrier partners early this year, according to a person familiar with the situation. Some carriers peppered Google executives with questions about handling phone returns and technical support, the person said. At the time, Google did not appear ready to take on these aspects of the phone hardware business, according to this person. Google executives on the hardware team say the company is on a “journey,” gaining experience and capabilities with each smartphone generation. And Apple only began touting the iPhone’s full life cycle after a few generations. On Tuesday, as a Google event began in San Francisco, new hardware chief Rick Osterloh reassured the audience that the company was serious about the move. “We’re in it for the long run,” he said. About nine months after initial talks with carriers, Google rolled out its flavor of technical support: Pixels have built-in chat support where customer-service reps can take over smartphone screens to identify problems. Google will be responsible for returns and recycling and is building a supply chain that can reabsorb faulty and rejected devices, Osterloh said in a recent interview. Osterloh will be partly judged by how many devices Google sells, a contrast to the Nexus program which showcased Android features for other handset makers to adopt. But the executive was still cagey about the company’s sales aspirations. “In markets where we do business, we’re definitely going to want meaningful share,” he said. “But it’s highly unlikely that the primary driver will be to be in every market with as high as possible volume.” Google still sees software as its edge, rather than retail distribution and customer service. The company spent more time on Tuesday talking about the digital assistant baked into its new gadgets, and how they work together. If Google can get millions of people relying on its assistant, the company may be able to compete with Apple’s devices, according to Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner. “The AI assistant will give them something that Apple has enjoyed for many years: Lock-in to the system,” he said.

That’s good news if you’re sending sterling home — but bad news if you’re living there Image Credit: Reuters A board displays the exchange rates of the euro and US dollar against the British pound at an exchange in London on Tuesday. Published: 16:20 October 5, 2016 Mick O'Reilly, Senior Associate Editor   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Dubai: If you’re British and remitting money back to the UK each month, you’ve just hit a winning streak — sort of. In the past week, the UK pound has hit a 31-year low against the US dollar. And because the UAE dirham is directly pegged to the US dollar, Brits in the UAE have one reason to smile. Yesterday, Dh100 would buy you £21.38. This time last year, that Dh100 would buy you £17.52. Five years ago, Dh100 was worth £17.61. The fall in the pound is directly related to Brexit, the decision by UK voters to leave the European Union. As a result of the June 23 referendum and the subsequent fallout on the ruling Conservative Party, new UK Prime Minister Theresa May is only now beginning to come to grips with the enormous task of disentangling her nation from the 28-member political and economic bloc. And last week, at her party’s annual conference in Birmingham, she said Britain would trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, setting the clock ticking then on two years of negotiations with her counterparts in Brussels. So the fall in sterling is good news then for British expats? Sadly, that’s not the case: Those pounds have less buying power on the main street. Any British shoppers tempted by Apple’s new iPhone are having to dig deeper into their pockets after June’s Brexit vote as the US tech giant raised the price by £60 pounds when the model went on sale on September 16. While US customers will pay the same as last year, the 11 per cent price rise for Britons from the previous model almost exactly matches the amount by which the pound had fallen against the dollar since the vote to leave the European Union. On Tuesday, as sterling slid to a new three-decade low against the dollar, many other retailers are likely to follow Apple, putting a dampener on five years of solid growth in consumer spending that has powered Britain’s recovery since the financial crisis. It’s also part of a perfect storm that British consumers are facing — higher inflation, along with a rise in unemployment and slower wage growth — could reduce growth in household spending to just 1 per cent next year, the Bank of England has said. Related Links The low pound, the high stock market That would be just one third of its pace in the past year. “We know there is a big inflation shock coming from sterling’s depreciation, so it looks like households’ real income will grow only very modestly next year,” said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Even before the referendum, households had seen disposable income grow more slowly, and they were saving the smallest percentage of income since 2008 to bridge the gap. The question now is how rapidly other retailers follow Apple and raise prices. So far the picture is mixed. Associated British Foods, which owns discount clothing retailer Primark, said it intended to absorb the higher cost of imports through its profit margins, to maintain its position as a bargain destination. By contrast, fashion chain Next said it would pass on higher costs to consumers, but not until the spring of 2017 when hedges it took out against currency weakness expire. Next — one of Britain’s biggest clothing retailers — has estimated that the weaker pound will push up its costs by 5 per cent next year if it cannot find cheaper suppliers. Firms across Britain will have to make similar choices. The average cost of imported goods in August was 7.6 per cent higher than a year earlier, the sharpest year-on-year rise since 2011. The BoE estimates about 60 per cent of cost increases caused by a weaker currency are passed on to consumers although there are exceptions in highly price-sensitive sectors. Grocery prices, for example, have fallen over the past two years as the four main supermarket chains — Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons — compete against German discounters Aldi and Lidl. None is likely to want to be the first to break ranks and raise prices. Sainsbury’s has said lower global commodity prices mean prices might not rise at all, although on Wednesday bakery chain Greggs said it faced higher costs. Last month the BoE said it had heard some food companies were trying to use cheaper recipes. Discretionary purchases such as electrical goods and home hardware would be worst hit, and September car sales to consumers have already fallen slightly. For Brits, the power pound means foreign holidays will be more expensive, and imported goods will go up in price. There could even be an exodus of foreign workers, at least those who send money home, now their remittances are worth about 13 per cent less against the dollar since the Brexit vote and almost 20 per cent less than a year ago. For tourists, however, the UK will become more attractive as a holiday destination — even if more British are forced to take staycations. — With inputs from agencies More from UK Terminally-ill girl wins right to freeze body 01:54 pm India and China still receiving British aid Review sees racial bias in UK court sentencing A billion people suffer from high blood pressure With Trump meet, Farage upsets UK establishment Leaked memo points to Brits’ Brexit chaos Brits face a £10 fee to visit Europe Racism growing in US in wake of election tags from this storyUnited Arab Emirates follow this tag on MGNUnited States follow this tag on MGNDubai follow this tag on MGNBrexit follow this tag on MGNTheresa May follow this tag on MGNApple follow this tag on MGNUnited Kingdom follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsNewsEuropeUK tagsUnited Arab Emirates follow this tag on MGN+ MGNUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGNDubai follow this tag on MGN+ MGNBrexit follow this tag on MGN+ MGNTheresa May follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In UKTerminally-ill girl wins right to freeze body Framed Gallery Pics: UAE Tolerance March draws crowd in Dubai Illegal firearms set ablaze in Kenya GNTV Videos PlayDubai Canal opens with fireworks US expatriates in Dubai on Trump's victory Follow us Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Terminally-ill girl wins right to freeze body 02With Trump meet, Farage upsets UK establishment 03Brits face a £10 fee to visit Europe Play Dubai Canal opens with fireworks Nov 09, 2016 Play US expatriates in Dubai on Trump's victory Nov 09, 2016 Play Prince Charles tours Humanitarian City in Dubai Nov 08, 2016 Play Dubai Canal bridge lights at night Nov 08, 2016 24Images Supermoon rises over UAE skyline Nov 14, 2016 19Images Aftershocks rattle New Zealand after big quake Nov 14, 2016 12Images Pics: UAE Tolerance March draws crowd in Dubai Nov 16, 2016 1Image Pakistan, China launch new trade route Nov 14, 2016 Country in Focus United Kingdom Capital:London Population:63.23 million (WB, 2012) Languages:English Head of State:Queen Elizabeth II Follow United Kingdom on My Gulf News+mgn UK Economic Data Select a CountryUnited Arab EmiratesArgentinaAustraliaBangladeshBahrainBrazilCanadaSwitzerlandChinaGermanyEgyptSpainFranceIndiaIranItalyJapanKenyaKoreaKuwaitSri LankaMexicoNigeriaNetherlandsOmanPhilippinesPakistanQatarRussian FederationSyrian Arab RepublicUnited KingdomUSAYemenSouth Africa Select an indexConsumer Price Index: YoYForeign Direct Investment: % of Nominal GDPReal GDP: YoY:Retail Sales: YoY:Total Exports: YoY:Total Imports: YoY: From To     powered by Newsmakers UK theresa maydonald trumpangela merkeldavid cameronboris johnsonhillary clintonjoe bidenmichelle obamanarendra modi UK: Weather today today-weatherLondonManchester weather-volume Celcius Fahrenheit Most Popular on Gulf News UAE announces public, private sector holidays Why expats risk fines to live in bed spaces Jailed, abused, and homeless Viral: Saudi man’s love poem to Ivanka Trump 'Utter devastation' after New Zealand quakes Data of 34 million Keralites leaked Your guide to tonight’s Supermoon Indian embassy to take up expats’ rupee concerns Best airlines to fly with in 2017 Close Recommended For You Dubai Customs to distribute 10,000 booksPUBLISHED ON Nov 18, 2016 Emirates faces issues with new A380 enginesPUBLISHED ON Nov 18, 2016 Woman marries boyfriend in husband’s presencePUBLISHED ON Nov 18, 2016 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

The handsets had been detailed in countless leaks leading up to Tuesday's unveiling, and there were precious few surprises in store when the phones were finally made official. Of course, we don't need to be surprised to be impressed and there are plenty of impressive packed into Google's first smartphones that were "made by Google." Android fans might have to kiss the Nexus brand goodbye, but there's still plenty to look forward to from the Pixel lineup. We already told you about the new phones' 10 best features so in this post, we'll focus on seven areas where Google's new Pixel and Pixel XL outshine the most popular flagship smartphones in the world, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. DON'T MISS: iPhone 7 vs. Galaxy S7 blind camera test: Guess which model hardcore Apple fans picked Google Assistant Google Assistant is the future of Google. The new software product uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to create a turbocharged Siri of sorts, pulling in data from countless sources in order to custom tailor the Google experience to each user's needs. It can be accessed by voice or by text, and it can perform functions ranging from answering typical Google search queries to more personalized ones. For example, "show me photos from my trip to Las Vegas" will open the photos app and show you all relevant images. Assistant will be available across a wide range of devices, including the iPhone 7 at some point. Apple's iPhones will never feature the deep integration that owners of the Pixel or Pixel XL will enjoy, though. Unlimited HQ photo and video storage Every Pixel and Pixel XL comes with free unlimited photo and video storage using Google Photos, and there are no quality restrictions. This is a big deal considering how much space 4K videos and 12-megapixel photos take up. Owners of Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus can get the same feature on their devices with the Google Photos app, but they'll have to pay to keep files at their original quality. Smart storage Speaking of all the storage space that high-quality photos and 4K videos take up, the Pixel phones have a fantastic new feature that will automatically begin deleting photos and videos off of your phone when your internal storage begins to near full capacity. The phones will only remove files that have already been backed up by Google Photos, of course, so users will still be able to access them anytime. Better display resolution The new displays on Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are much better than last years screens thanks to better color response, but the displays still have low resolutions and pixel densities compared to rival phones like the Pixels. Apple's smaller iPhone 7 has 720p resolution compared to 1080p on the Pixel, and the iPhone 7 Plus has 1080p resolution while the Pixel XL phablet packs 2K resolution into the same 5.5-inch screen size. Apple fans will be quick to tell you that resolution and pixel density don't matter, but they'll be singing a much different tune next year when Apple finally releases iPhones with higher-resolution displays. Daydream There are plenty of virtual reality headsets that are compatible with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Check out this $20 VR headset, for example. Finding good VR content to enjoy on your iPhone can be a bit tricky though, since Apple doesn't yet offer its own VR experience and dedicated VR app store. The Pixel and Pixel XL, on the other hand, support Google's Daydream VR platform. They'll work with the Daydream View and plenty of future Daydream headsets, and they'll be able to take full advantage of the new VR platform. Background OS updates The Pixel and Pixel XL get Android updates instantly and directly from Google, just like how iPhones get updates from Apple. But because these new phones ship with Android Nougat, they push things a step further. When Google makes new Android OS updates available, the Pixel phones will download and install them automatically over Wi-Fi without the user even knowing.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Yesterday, Google announced two new smartphones, the Pixel and the Pixel XL. Unfortunately, Google’s plan to copy Apple by releasing its own smartphones is fundamentally flawed and doomed to fail in its current form. Let’s take a step back, in case you missed yesterday’s news. The Pixel smartphones will be sold directly to consumers through Google’s website, in retailers like Best Buy and exclusively through Verizon Wireless for folks who want the phone tied to a contract. Unlike the Nexus devices, which were focused on developers and are now being left in the past, Pixel smartphones are targeted right at consumers. They now run the purest version of Android you can get. Android is at the heart of the problem. What has already been a terribly fragmented platform is now even worse. As I argued yesterday, Google left its most die-hard fans, the folks who bought Nexus smartphones, out in the cold by releasing Pixel with its early access to Android 7.1 Nougat. This action suggests that Google doesn’t care much for the folks who purchased its flagship Android smartphones in the past. Worse, it now suggests that Pixel owners are getting exclusive early access to software, which means Nexus users – once promised to be first in line for these software updates – will receive the updates later. The new software will slowly trickle out to smartphones made by other manufacturers; I wince at the thought of how long it will take to see Google Assistant on my brand new AT&T Galaxy Note 7. Worse, can we trust Google to issue updates to these phones in the future if it already broke its promise on the Nexus program? Apple, by comparison, always updates phones that are several years old, no questions asked, no waiting. Google may be acting a bit more like Apple by releasing two smartphones under its own brand, but that, too, is an entirely different battlefield than the one Apple is on with its iPhones. Apple competes with Android smartphone makers, not itself. With Pixel, Google is now going to try to sell smartphones in a space where its partners are also competing. Samsung is the king of the Android smartphone market, how can Google possibly try to play on that level? Why even try to compete in the same market as your partners? “But Todd,” you might say, “Google isn’t trying to sell millions of these phones. That’s what its partners are for.” Then what is Google trying to do that’s different than Nexus? I don’t fully understand or perhaps appreciate what Google’s end-goal is here. Nexus made more sense to me. That program allowed developers and dedicated Android users to buy pure Android devices. It served, perhaps in some ways, as a sounding board for what Android makers could do with Android, should they choose to do so. Nexus devices were sold through carriers, yes, but the messaging wasn’t so much “This is Google’s phone,” as is the case with Pixel. While the Pixel smartphones look genuinely compelling and feature rich thanks to Google Assistant, Pixel will only live on as a fraction of Android’s user base, one that continues to drive a wedge between Android features available on Google hardware and features available on other Android smartphones. This is going to confuse consumers and break the trust of Nexus users, not draw them toward the new platform. Pixel hasn’t only fragmented Android further, it has fragmented the very idea of pure Google smartphones and hardware.

Resend activation e-mail Infinite Loop / The Apple Ecosystem Apple quietly discontinues the $69 third-gen Apple TV Box's software is two generations out of date and falling rapidly behind. by Andrew Cunningham - Oct 5, 2016 2:18 pm UTC Login to bookmark 109 Enlarge / The fourth-generation Apple TV (left) next to the third-gen model. Andrew Cunningham According to an internal e-mail obtained by 9to5Mac, Apple has completely discontinued the third-generation Apple TV and will stop selling it as soon as it fulfills all current orders for the device. It's the end of a long road for that Apple TV model, which was introduced in 2012, updated internally in 2013, and discounted to $69 in 2015. Apple is still selling the fourth-generation model with no changes to its price or storage capacity. Though it was just removed from sale, it has been well over a year since the third-gen Apple TV received a software update of any great significance. The iOS-based operating system that it runs was still based on iOS 8.4, and though there was some speculation in the run-up to the fourth-generation Apple TV that Apple would build a version of tvOS for the older box, that never came to pass. As it stands, the third-gen model is now two iOS versions behind. It can no longer function as a HomeKit hub, doesn't properly support Apple's new two-factor authentication, can't use features like Apple Music or iCloud Photo Library, and still uses the busted discoveryd DNS service. It can still stream video from its included channels, but it is rapidly falling behind the competition. Though it was time for the older model to go, this leaves Apple without a midrange or low-end TV streaming box to compete against a wave of new and increasingly capable products in that space from its competitors, including Amazon's new Fire TV stick, the just-announced 4K Chromecast Ultra, and both the $30 Roku Express and the 4K-capable Roku Premiere and Premiere+. And while the fourth-generation Apple TV is still more than fast enough for what it needs to do, paying $149 or $199 for a year-old box that can't handle 4K or HDR content is a tough pill to swallow for anyone not deeply embedded in Apple's ecosystem. There's no word of a fifth-generation, 4K-capable Apple TV or a price cut for the current model, but hopefully a refresh is on Apple's to-do list for 2017.

James Martin/CNET Steve Jobs remembered: Apple co-founder, typeface fanatic 0 Share: Tech Industry by Shara Tibken October 5, 2016 7:11 AM PDT @sharatibken Up Next President Obama slams fake news for eroding democracy Enlarge Image Steve Jobs died five years ago after leading Apple through momentous decades. Photo by Apple In the tech world, five years feels like centuries. But for Apple, the legacy of Steve Jobs lives on. The charismatic co-founder of the world's most profitable company died October 5, 2011, after a long battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 56. While Jobs has been gone for five years, he's remained in the public eye through books and films that portray his life, career and personality. Jobs was always a charismatic and controversial leader, beloved by many (including millions of Apple fanboys throughout the world) but hated by those who faced his wrath. On Wednesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook tweeted in remembrance of his predecessor and his impact on the world at large. Here are some memories from others who worked closely with Jobs during his time at Apple. Attention to detail Apple hired designer Clement Mok in 1982 to work on branding for 1984's Mac launch. He became co-manager of Apple Creative Services in 1985 and served as creative director for corporate and education marketing. He's one of the people responsible for the iconic imagery of Apple in its marketing and packaging, including the squiggly line drawings gracing early Mac promotional materials. Another of Mok's duties was to redesign Jobs' business cards when Apple updated its brand identity and logo. Steve Jobs retrospective Steve Jobs stepping down as CEO of Apple marks the end of an era. Come with us on a journey through the ups and downs of his career. From the development of the first Mac in 1984 to the unveiling of the iPhone and iPad, Jobs has changed the face of an industry. 5:13 Close Drag "I was to go over the Steve's office and say, 'This is your new business card. I want you to take a look at it before we send it out to the printers,'" Mok said. Jobs examined the business card closely. "At that point, no one knew he took calligraphy," Mok said. "Jobs was a fanatic about different typefaces. But we had no idea, at least many of us had no idea, that he had an appreciation of typography at that depth we now understand. "He looked at the card and said, 'Shouldn't the kerning [the space between the letters] be tighter here and here? And here is too tight.' I was flabbergasted that he would be so into the weeds on that one little detail," Mok said. "That's how obsessed Steve was with details. I think I gained an incredible respect for him at that point. I thought I could say, 'Hey Steve, here's your card. FYI.' But he took time." By the way, Mok said he agreed with Jobs -- the kerning was off on his original business card design. Walking billboards Jobs' obsession with detail went well beyond his business cards. He also cared deeply about the packaging used to sell Apple's products. The sleek white iPhone and Mac boxes, now iconic, wouldn't have happened if not for Jobs, said Tom Suiter. Suiter served as Apple's first director of creative services and helped launch the Mac in 1984. He was also part of a revamp of product packaging. Steve Jobs unveils an iPhone at an Apple developer conference in San Francisco. Photo by James Martin/CNET "When you think about [Apple packaging] and go into an Apple Store today and buy that package, it's such a delightful experience...It's so gorgeous. Apple's known for that. But I was lucky enough to be around when it was really bad." When Apple launched its products in the early 1980s, "packaging was fragmented," Suiter said. Different divisions had different designers who made their packaging distinct from other groups. That "was costing us a lot of money," he said. Suiter's team was tasked with making a new, universal Apple package design in 1984. They came up with two versions. One was "very cost-effective," the other "at least" triple that price, he recalls. Enlarge Image Apple devices, like 2014's Phone 6, still use the company's iconic white packaging. Photo by James Martin/CNET The cheaper version had two colors on corrugated paper stock. "It was very practical," Suiter said. "There was another version that was absolutely gorgeous. It used all of the six colors of the Apple logo. It had the Apple logo on one side and a black-and-white photo on the box." Suiter's team presented the packaging options to the different groups at Apple. "The difference was dramatic in terms of cost," he said. "[We figured] there was no way we could pay that kind of money, and we'd have to go with that [cheaper] version." But Jobs surprised Suiter. "Steve stopped everybody and said, 'No, here's how we're going to pay for it. We're going to take money from the advertising budget. I believe packages are like billboards. When people are carrying boxes around and putting [them] in their cars, it's a moving billboard for Apple so that's what we're going to do.'" Apple still uses a similar design for its packaging today. Standing up to Steve Jobs was considered a genius by many, but he also had a temperamental side, which his employees knew all too well. "[Steve] would come marching down the hall or skipping down the hall, calling...'What an idiot. I can't believe you did this stupid thing,'" said Debi Coleman, who joined Apple in 1981 as finance controller for the Macintosh. It took her a year to learn how to confront Jobs. Coleman credits Joanna Hoffman, the executive in charge of Mac marketing, as her teacher. "Joanna said, 'Look him in the eye. You've got to stand up.' From that point on -- I'm not saying he wasn't tough, totally demanding and totally critical -- but he was totally wonderful to me." 27 Steve Jobs at Apple: A retrospective (pictures) Coleman became head of Mac manufacturing in 1984 and was one of the highest-ranking women in the tech industry. She took over the role of Apple chief financial officer in 1986. At a November 2015 reunion of women on the Mac team, Coleman attributed a big part of Apple's success to Jobs, saying he made people at Apple believe they could change the world. And even if he was intimidating, he had a softer side, she said. One Sunday morning in the early days of the Macintosh computer, Coleman got a call from Jobs, asking that she meet him at the Mac factory. He wanted to give a tour to his father, Jobs said. "That was a real wonderful experience to see how Steve loved and respected his adopted father," Coleman said. "I never saw anything like it before or since."

Welcome to middle age Jobs recruited John Sculley in the early 1980s to help him grow Apple's business. At the time, Sculley was CEO of Pepsi and had helped it overtake Coca-Cola as the top beverage maker. Jobs famously convinced Sculley to take the CEO role at Apple in 1983 by asking if he wanted to "sell sugar water for the rest of his life" or if he wanted to "come with me and change the world." Sculley, who was close with Jobs before helping to oust him in 1985, served as Apple's chief executive for a decade until being forced out himself. Sculley still remembers the first time he visited Apple's Silicon Valley offices in 1982. "I show up at this address and think I'm at the wrong place because there are no buildings, just houses," Sculley said. He met Jobs in the house used as Apple's executive staff offices, and then the two headed to the Mac building a couple blocks away. "It was a beautiful blue-sky day, and there was a Jolly Roger pirate flag flying from the roof," Sculley said. "Steve was in great competition with the Lisa [computer] group. Lisa was the Navy so Steve wanted to be the pirates." Steve Jobs took a hiatus from his medical leave in early 2011 to debut the iPad 2. Photo by James Martin/CNET Inside the Mac building was an expensive piano for some of the team engineers, as well as a motorcycle. When he walked into the engineering lab, Andy Hertzfeld, an original member of the Macintosh team who designed the system's software, had set up a demo. "Steve had used the ruse that I was not interviewing for a job but I was there as the CEO of Pepsi and interested in Macs for Pepsi," Sculley said. "Andy had put together dancing Pepsi cans on the screen of the Mac. I didn't know that this was really pretty hard to do, was pretty novel. ... I was wondering why Andy was smiling with his Cheshire cat grin. That was the first introduction I had to what Apple was like. It was totally a startup."

 Apple is opening an 'academy' for software developers in Italy Sam Shead Oct. 5, 2016, 9:58 AM 768 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Italian city of Naples.Pixabay Apple is launching an academy for talented developers in Naples, Italy, The Guardian reports. The academy, said to be the first of its kind, will reportedly teach up to 200 students how to build apps and launch them on Apple devices by the end of the year. Apple has pledged to give each student an iPhone, iPad and MacBook at the start of the nine month iOS Developer Academy, which opens for business October 6, according to The Guardian. Demand for the course is said to be high, with 4,000 people applying over 11 days for 200 places. Next year, about 400 students will reportedly pass through the academy. Aspiring app developers will reportedly be able to enroll on the course for free thanks to a joint investment of around €10 million (£8.8 million) that came from Apple and the University of Naples Federico II. The academy — still under construction according to The Guardian — will reportedly be located within Federico II’s new San Giovanni campus. The "large, open plan" classroom that the academy will be run out of has reportedly been designed by Apple in collaboration with university professor Leopoldo Angrisani. A university official reportedly gave a Guardian reporter a tour of the new facility but an Apple representative told them they had to leave when they realised the person on the tour was a journalist.

 Wall Street analysts think Apple's next big opportunity is something called the 'Ambient Paradigm' Kif Leswing Oct. 5, 2016, 9:58 AM 17,784 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook REUTERS/Stringer "Investors don't seem to have much faith in Apple's future," UBS analysts Steven Milunovich and Benjamin Wilson wrote in a note distributed to clients on Wednesday. Simply put, only 11% of Apple's market cap can be attributed to profits projected more than three years out, according to their calculation. It's the classic problem for Apple stock — it trades at a price-earnings ratio much lower than tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Facebook. However, the UBS analysts think this means there's a lot of upside to Apple stock that investors aren't factoring in. Sure, the iPhone is a huge hit and a commercial success, but they see Apple laying the groundwork for "the next era of personal technology — the Ambient Paradigm." "We consider the Apple Watch and AirPods similar transition products today on the way to an integrated user experience based on multiple products seamlessly connected. We call it the Ambient (present on all sides) Paradigm. It is Tim Cook's 'iOS everywhere,'" Milunovich wrote. He sees Apple's "other products" like the Apple Watch and AirPods evolving in coming years, with Siri acting as the glue, and potentially affecting industries like healthcare and education. If you're constantly surrounded by Apple products and services, that presents a huge revenue opportunity for the computer maker, and also increases the possibility that users will feel locked into Apple's ecosystem. The analysts warn that forecasting Apple's long-term future is difficult. After all, "Mac sales in 2001 or iPod units in 2007 didn't have much to say about where the puck was going," they wrote. UBS rates Apple stock as a buy with long-term growth upside, and set a price target for the stock at $127.

S&P Futures 2,185.00 0.75 (0.03%) Dow Futures 18,878.00 9.00 (0.05%) The Latest: Analysts are lukewarm about Google's new gadgets Associated PressOctober 4, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Latest on Google's product event (all times local): 12:45 p.m. Analysts say Google's new lineup of phones, other devices and artificial intelligence services may have trouble attracting consumers in large numbers, at least for now. For instance, so-called intelligent assistants often don't live up to their early promises, says analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. What's more, he warned that Google's service may use some of the information shared by users to create profiles for advertising. Google didn't address that in its presentation Tuesday. And while Google was smart to emphasize the performance of the new smartphone cameras, Moorhead added in an email, he said other features in the new phones don't seem very different from what Samsung and Apple have offered. Gartner's Brian Blau, meanwhile, said the new Google Assistant could help the company tie its various hardware and software offerings together. But he's also skeptical that Google's Pixel phones will dent Apple-Samsung dominance in the smartphone market, especially since Pixels will be more expensive than phones in Google's previous Nexus line. "To be honest, that was one of the attractive points" of the Nexus, he says. ___ 11 a.m. Google is making a greater commitment to hardware in unveiling new phones, a smart speaker and other gadgets. The products announced Tuesday also underscore Google's hope that by designing both hardware and the software — the way Apple has long done — products and features will work better, with little input needed from users. For instance, the new smart speaker called Home will be able to use voice to control Netflix and other video on Google's Chromecast streaming device. Google also hinted that the approach lets Google take full advantage of capabilities it's designing with artificial intelligence and machine learning. It hasn't offered examples, though, on what users will be able to do on its new Pixel phones that they won't be able to do on Android phones from Samsung and others. Another theme running throughout the event: Products will get smarter thanks to artificial intelligence technology developed by Google. The features demonstrated seem similar to what Amazon and Apple already offer with their virtual assistants. Google officials have repeatedly emphasized that its AI technology is in the early stages — so it remains to be seen what this new era for Google will lead to. ___ 10:25 a.m. Google is promoting its new Home smart speaker as a way to access Google's knowledge — hands free. It will suggest the best way to get places, thanks to Google Maps, or find answers from other sources, such as Wikipedia. A feature called My Day will also offer a summary of your upcoming day. You'll need to give Google permission to activate that. Amazon, Apple and Microsoft all have variations of such assistants. Home will work closely with other Google devices. For example, if you have a Chromecast streaming device, you can use Home to control video on your TV. The feature will be limited at first. In some cases, Google will have to fine tune the software to work with specific services. Netflix will be one of the first to work, so you can simply ask Google Home to start the Netflix show "Orange is the New Black." Home will be available for almost $130 and come with six months of YouTube Red, a $10-a-month ad-free subscription. Orders start Tuesday; Home will be in stores on Nov. 4. The cylinder-shaped Echo costs $180, though Amazon also sells a smaller version shaped like a hockey puck that sells for $50. ___ 10:15 a.m. Google is ready to start selling its echo of Amazon's Echo. The Echo is an internet-connected speaker featuring a voice-activated digital assistant. It's moving into more homes and lessening the need to find information on Google's search engine. As a counterpunch to Amazon, Google has built a similar two-way speaker that it simply calls "Home." It will be able to perform many of the same tasks as Echo, including playing music and fielding questions about everything from the weather to what's playing at the local theater. Google Home will also be able to control lights, appliances and other devices around the house, assuming you've installed "smart" versions of them. Read More Google teased the Home device at a technology conference in May and is offering more details Tuesday. Google is betting that the knowledge that it has gained while running the world's dominant search engine will make the computer-powered assistant in Home smarter than Amazon's Alexa in the Echo, which has been on the market since 2014. If you're feeling creepy about a speaker listening to your conversations, Google says you can turn the microphone off. ___ 10:12 a.m. Google is updating its Chromecast video-streaming device for watching Netflix and other online video on big screens. The new device, Chromecast Ultra, will support a higher-resolution format called 4K. That's a feature already offered by larger, more expensive streaming devices such as the $100 Amazon Fire TV. Ultra will cost about $70. Chromecast's low price has won over a lot of households. But you need a companion phone to play, pause and fast forward video, disrupting email, Facebook and other tasks you might want to do while watching TV. Google is facing competition with low-end devices. Roku just announced a $30 Express model that's about the size of a finger, while Amazon just updated its $40 Fire TV Stick. Both of those devices come with a remote, making them suitable stand-alone gadgets. But neither streams in 4K. ___ 10:10 a.m. Google wants to improve Wi-Fi in the home by creating its own router. The company says people use internet differently now, with games, video chatting and more on various devices throughout the home. The new Google Wi-Fi system will be modular — just add new components based on how your home and rooms are shaped. Software will help manage the various access points for you as you move around. It will cost almost $130 for the main device. A three-pack for larger homes will cost about $300. ___ 10:00 a.m. Google has unveiled its own virtual-reality headset, called Daydream View. It will differ from other headsets like Samsung's Gear VR in having a companion motion controller and compatibility with a wide range of phones, including Google's new Pixel phones. Daydream is a challenge to more sophisticated systems from Facebook's Oculus business, HTC and Sony — as well as to Google's own Cardboard effort. Cardboard is cheap — available for as little as $15 — but it doesn't offer much control over VR environments beyond pushing a button on the headset as you move your head. The new wireless motion controller for Daydream can function like a fishing rod, a steering wheel or a pointer to permit more sophisticated VR experiences. Although Google will make its own Daydream headset, it plans to share design guidelines with other manufacturers. Google says 50 partners are bringing apps and games to Daydream, with more on the way. Google services such as photos, YouTube and Street View maps will also come to Daydream. The unveiling came at a Google event in San Francisco on Tuesday. Daydream View and the controller will be out in November for $79. ___ 9:50 a.m. Google is stepping up the marketing of its new Pixel phones, and will offer them through Verizon as well as Google's own online Play store. Previously, Google phones have largely been limited to online orders. The new phones will come in two screen sizes — 5 inches and 5.5 inches. The smaller one will cost about $650, with orders starting Tuesday; the larger version will go for about $750. Google says the camera on Pixel phones will be "excellent." Pixel owners will also get unlimited storage of photos at full resolution. Others get unlimited storage at high resolution of up to 16 megapixels; and anything sharper than that gets reduced in quality to qualify. However, Google's Pixels cameras are 12 megapixels, so they would have qualified under the regular plan anyway. The phones will be the first ones compatible with Google's upcoming Daydream virtual-reality system. ___ 9:40 a.m. Google is introducing a new line of smartphones in its most aggressive challenge yet to Apple and Samsung. The phones unveiled Tuesday in San Francisco will carry the Pixel brand, which Google has previously stamped on a tablet and a Chromebook laptop. The phones will have Google's virtual assistant and artificial intelligence service, Google Assistant, built in. The company says computing is becoming more dependent on AI, not just on being mobile. Google has released a series of its own phones, dubbed Nexus, since 2010. Those phones had limited distribution and were typically embraced by Google purists. Now, the company is casting aside the Nexus name as it aims to become an even more prominent player in the mobile market Google, of course, already provides the Android system software that powers more than 80 percent of the world's smartphones. The new push pits Google against a familiar foe in Apple and its iPhone. But it also poses a new threat to Samsung, the biggest maker of Android phones. ___ 9:30 a.m. Google is taking a page from Apple's playbook by making a bigger push to build its own hardware. Rick Osterloh, head of Google's newly formed hardware group, says that by building hardware itself, Google can take full advantage of capabilities it's designing with artificial intelligence and machine learning. Apple has long taken a similar approach by designing both iPhone hardware and the iOS operating-system software that runs on it. Google has designed hardware before, but Osterloh says Google will now get deeper into it. ___ 9:15 a.m. Google is opening an event in San Francisco with a prediction that artificial intelligence will play a greater role in our lives. CEO Sundar Pichai says computing is transitioning to an artificial-intelligence-first world, just as it moved to a mobile-first world just a few years ago. Pichai says, "Our goal is to build a personal Google for each and every user. We want to build a Google for each user." Google services along those lines include Google Assistant, software that's designed to answer questions and retrieve information, conversation-style. Google Assistant made its debut in a chat app called Allo a few weeks ago. It will also be part of the upcoming Home smart speaker. Google is expected to announce more details at the event. The event — held at the former power plant for a chocolate factory — started with video showing characters from the HBO show "Silicon Valley" bantering about expectations. ___ 7:35 a.m. Google will ramp up its consumer electronics strategy Tuesday as it's expected to announce new gadgets at an event in San Francisco. The products include new smartphones and an internet-connected personal-assistant for the home similar to Amazon's Echo speaker. All are intended to showcase Google's software and online services. Analysts and industry blogs say a virtual-reality headset and a home router could also be on tap. Google makes most of its money from online software and digital ads. But it's putting more emphasis on hardware as it faces rivals like Apple, Amazon and Samsung. Julie Ask at Forrester Research says new devices could help Google keep its services front and center in the battle for consumers' attention.

Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 5, 2016 at 9:00AM Google Home will ship in November for $129. Image source: Google. All we need now is Bob Saget. It's now been about two years since Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) launched the original Echo, its smart speaker powered by its virtual assistant, Alexa. Since then, the e-commerce giant has created a platform with Alexa, allowing third-party developers to integrate with the device, as well as releasing a slew of new Alexa-powered devices that hope to bring Amazon's presence into every room of your house. You can even buy a six pack (buy five, get one free!) of Echo Dots if you want. Alexa has mostly been the only major virtual assistant for the smart home since then, but I'm sure it didn't mind the lack of competition. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) announced Google Home earlier this year at its I/O developer conference, but didn't really give much detail at the time for pricing or availability. With the Pixel event yesterday, Google announced that Google Home will ship on Nov. 4 for $129. Pre-orders started yesterday. That undercuts Amazon's flagship $180 Echo by about $50. And Google won't be the last, either. Last, but not least There's already indication that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is indeed working on a Siri-powered speaker (like I've been asking for) that will accomplish all the requisite tasks that you'd expect. The Mac maker has reportedly been developing the product for about two years, and has now entered prototyping and testing. Some Apple employees are even bringing prototypes home to test them out, and the company may attempt to somehow include facial recognition as a differentiator. If that's the development stage that Apple is currently at, then there's no way that it would be released in 2016, if at all. Apple could very well abandon the project, but I don't think that's likely at this point. Apple wants to be in your smart home, and it can't do it with just the iPhone or the Apple TV. My guess would be that Apple launches this product at some point next year. That would be a continuation of Apple's belief that it doesn't have to be the first to any given market, just the best. Now that Apple has finally started opening up Siri to third-party developers, it's already laying groundwork for third-party integrations. The social network? While there's no official word from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to suggest that it's interested in jumping in, CEO Mark Zuckerberg did just build a virtual assistant for his home in his spare time. Meanwhile, Facebook detailed its own virtual assistant, M, last year. M is still in development and testing and is not available to the general public yet. Facebook looks as if it wants to use M to help third-party developers create chatbots that can deliver service or automate other tasks, not necessarily in the context of a smart home. But considering Zuckdawg's apparent interest in the smart home, it seems conceivable that the social network will eventually make its way in. What it boils down to Amazon had a sleeper hit with Echo and Alexa, but it's possible that it will give up that early lead. Virtual assistants are empowered by data, which drives contextual relevance. The type of data that these assistants need most is the type of data that you store on your primary computing platform(s). Last I checked, the Fire Phone was a flop, Kindle Fire sales are on the decline, and Amazon doesn't make PCs. Consumers don't have Amazon email accounts, sync calendar or contact information with Amazon, or ask it random questions constantly. People go to Amazon to buy things. Not to discount Echo's early success, but the long-term competitiveness and usefulness will be determined by how much user data a virtual assistant can garner, and people generally give far more data to Apple, Google, and Facebook. I just wish I could hire Bob Saget to turn my lights off and set my alarm system before I go to bed. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

In financial terms, Apple has been an unstoppable juggernaut: its profit for the 2015 fiscal year was a whopping $53 billion (roughly Rs. 3,52,647 crores) on revenues of $234 billion (roughly Rs. 15,56,974 crores) - both figures doubled since the final year of Jobs's reign before he died of pancreatic cancer on October 5, 2011. FREDERIC J. BROWN/Getty Images Apple's market value is more than $600 billion (roughly Rs. 39,51,660 crores), below its 2015 highs but more than twice its level of 2011 and holding above Google parent Alphabet as the world's most valuable corporation. Still, some analysts question whether Apple - which redefined the smartphone experience with its trend-setting iPhone introduced in 2007 and created a vast ecosystem of mobile applications - is losing momentum. "It's really hard to keep up the innovation cycle when you have developed a successful product," said technology analyst Jack Gold of J. Gold Associates. "With each successful generation (of a product) it becomes harder. The question becomes, 'What's the next big thing?' and it's not clear what that is going to be." Vivek Wadhwa, a Carnegie Mellon University professor and former Silicon Valley entrepreneur, was more blunt, saying Apple is living off its earlier innovations with little new to offer. Reuters "We have seen no major innovations for Apple" since the Steve Jobs era, Wadhwa told AFP. With the latest iPhone 7, Wadhwa said, "They market it well but it's the same device all over again." Competing with Tesla? Apple has moved into new services such as streaming music and mobile payments, and is believed to be working on virtual reality and autonomous driving technology. But the bulk of its revenue and profits still come from the iPhone. "They haven't figured out what they want to deliver," Wadhwa said. "If they wanted an Apple car it should have been out there now to compete with Tesla." Jobs's successor, Tim Cook, has won plaudits for his performance keeping Apple on a steady path, even though no one sees him as the same kind of leader. Reuters "Tim Cook is an operations guy, he is great in getting the supply chain to churn out things," said Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. "He knows his limitations. He knows he is not the most charismatic presenter. He knows he is not Steve Jobs." Still, Dawson sees Cook as broadly successful in keeping Apple on track. He noted that Apple has doubled its spending on research and development since Cook took over. "They stick to a certain price point and a premium experience, and that hasn't changed from Steve Jobs to Tim Cook," Dawson said. Apple has succeeded not by being first in a market segment but by improving and perfecting certain products. "They weren't the first to make an MP3 player or smartphone or tablet," Dawson said. "Apple bides its time and when it can make a significant contribution to a category it comes in and improves the experience. That was true in the Steve Jobs era as well." Dawson said it is not clear if Apple would be in a different place if Jobs were alive today, with the smartphone market largely saturated and touch competition from rivals. "People look at the iPhone and say nothing else has lived up to that, but there aren't any other technology categories like that," he said. Wadhwa argued however that Cook has had chances to "reinvent" the company and has failed to do so. Reuters "He's basically an operations guy who is living in the past," Wadhwa said. Wadhwa posited that Apple, with its vast cash reserves, could buy Tesla and put its highly regarded chief Elon Musk in charge of the company. "You need a crazy visionary leading the company," he said. "People have shown a lot of patience because we all love Apple. And I love Apple. So it's not too late to save the company."

Apple first knocked Coca-Cola out of Interbrand’s top slot in 2013. Apple is a technology company that leads innovation with their products and software platforms, providing seamless experiences across devices, and empowering people with breakthrough services. The company says that Apple’s ecosystem is the biggest contributor to the value of the brand … The fastest growing businesses in the world, and the strongest brands, are those with the most cohesive business systems […] Apple shows how ecosystems drive value. Analysts have often pointed out that “Apple has superior products.” While true, this opinion undersells the brilliance of Apple’s functionally- integrated model. Its software, hardware, and touchpoints are connected not just by beautiful design aesthetics, but by a level of interoperability that justifies the Apple premium and discourages defections to another platform. And the more data you share, the more personal it becomes— adding new devices is painless and the thought of switching increasingly unpromising. Apple is the Alpha of Cohesiveness in full effect. Interbrand says that tech companies like Apple have helped to redefine the meaning of branding. While the traditional view is concerned with image, identity and marketing campaigns, what companies like Apple deliver is ‘deeply integrated and connected experiences across their products or services.’ Apple regularly tops similar rankings, such as Fortune‘s Most Admired Companies.

"Most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition." Remembering Steve and the many ways he changed our world. pic.twitter.com/ONAuEoq3uU— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) October 5, 2016 Since his death, Jobs' founding and presence at Apple has only become more scrutinized by the public after a string of films and documentaries aimed to depict his life and decisions during both his time at Apple and his years away from the company. Prior to his death in 2011, Tim Cook took the reins of the company as CEO on August 24, 2011, introducing the iPhone 4S, iOS 5, Siri, and iCloud to the public on the day before Jobs passed. In previous years, Apple also updated its website to remember Jobs, creating a two-minute slideshow of his various keynote presentations and most famous audio clips on the one year anniversary of his death. In the days following his passing, Apple started posting "Remembering Steve" comments from fans on its website. The company noted that well over one million submissions came in for the project, all from well-wishing fans in the wake of Jobs' losing battle with pancreatic cancer. Update: An email from Cook to Apple employees has been shared by MacGeneration: Team, I know many of you are thinking of Steve today, as we mark five years since his passing. His presence remains strong here at Apple, and his influence is still felt profoundly all around the world. Personally, I think of Steve every day. His memory is an inspiration and source of strength for me, both in my job and in my personal life. I think of the bold risks he took as an innovator and a leader, and I think of the ordinary conversations we would have almost every day about our company, our customers, our families and friends. They are memories I will cherish forever. More than ever, our daily lives are shaped by the products and ideas Steve brought to life. I wish he could see how popular and powerful iPhone photography has become. And I know he would love the magic and emotion of our new Memories feature in Photos on iOS 10. Apple, the company he built and later rescued, is in many ways Steve’s most enduring legacy. He believed deeply that Apple should inspire us to do the best work of our lives, creating products that enrich the lives of others. Steve made Apple’s values very clear. He showed us how to focus on doing a few things extremely well, and to set the bar incredibly high for ourselves. He demanded that we always strive for simplicity, in our products and our approach. And he knew that by being collaborative within Apple, we could achieve things no other company could do. We owe all of Apple’s success over the past two decades to those basic principles. Steve also taught me that life’s great joy is in the journey, not in any particular occasion or event. It’s not about shipping or selling or winning an award. The real joy is in getting there. Steve was a special, unforgettable person. Thank you for being a part of his legacy, and for joining me on this journey as we carry it into the future.

Desjardins members can use Apple Pay with Visa credit or prepaid cards or Interac debit cards. Desjardins said its MasterCard cards will be supported in 2017. Eligible cards can be added to Apple Pay by tapping the "Add Credit or Debit Card" option in the Wallet app on iPhone 5 and later running at least iOS 8.1. Apple Pay continues to expand to additional banks and countries, with New Zealand, Japan, and Taiwan reportedly set to launch the mobile payments service in the near future. Last year, Apple Pay vice president Jennifer Bailey said Apple is "working rapidly" to expand the service to additional countries in Asia and Europe.

Her 58-minute, 7,000-word speech to Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham was light on policy and heavy on Blue Sky thinking. She made a bold play for the centre ground, but she spoke in broad strokes and already-announced policies. She told party faithful she'd be tough on tax dodgers and illegal immigrants, launched attacks on everyone from the Labour party to Facebook and Apple. Read More Theresa May's speech to Conservative Party Conference 2016 in full But she didn't tell us what Brexit will mean, say anything British steel and only managed to mention the deficit once. Here's everything we learned - and didn't learn - from Theresa May's first keynote Conference Speech. 1. She made a brazen claim for the centre ground (Photo: Matt Cardy) (Photo: Matt Cardy/Getty Images) (Photo: Matt Cardy/Getty Images) The Prime Minister unashamedly tried to take advantage of left-wing Labour's woes by pitching to be "united in the centre ground". “No vision ever clothed a family or fed a hungry child," she said. She would be the woman for "ordinary working-class families." She added: “We applaud success, we want people to get on. But we also value something else. The spirit of citizenship.” She claimed she would "protect and enhance" workers' rights and "intervene" in free markets despite agreeing with them. And she repeated her already tired “economy that works for everyone” catchphrase. “If you’ve been trying to say things need to change for years and your complaints fall on death ears, it doesn’t feel like it’s working for you,” she said. 2. She took a leaf out of Ed Miliband's book (Photo: Roland Leon/Daily Mirror) Intervening in the markets, hitting big business, building a society for all - it all sounds very familiar. Even Theresa May's complaint that "Britain only works for the privileged few" was Mr Miliband's slogan in 2014. Ahead of the speech, Labour's former leader expertly trolled the PM on Twitter, writing: "Marxist, anti-business interventionism in my honest opinion". Read More Ed Miliband just brutally trolled Theresa May ahead of her Conservative Party Conference speech 3. But had real anger at the 'left' (Photo: Carl Court/Getty Images) Mrs May didn't end confrontational politics - launching a heavy-handed attack on lawyers she branded "left-wing". She made the comment as she confirmed a move to exempt Brit troops from human rights law on the battlefield. "We will never again let those activist, left-wing human rights lawyers harangue and harass the bravest of the brave – the men and women of Britain’s Armed Forces," she stormed. Read More Theresa May has absolutely had it with people interrupting her with applause 4. She was Mrs Blue Sky (Photo: Roland Leon/Daily Mirror) The Prime Minister's keynote address to party conference was light on detail. There was no more information on how the Brexit negotiations would be approached - which she sidestepped again by saying the government would not provide a "running commentary." And she didn't actually introduce any new policies in her speech - anything she did mention was either hinting at policy direction, or things that had already been announced earlier in the Conference. These included exempting soldiers from Human Rights laws, increased funding for the NHS and Philip Hammond's new investment strategy. She remembered to mention the deficit though. Once. But that didn't stop the party faithful interrupting her speech over and over again with applause. But as she left the stage to the sound of Mr Blue Sky, by Birmingham legends ELO, many were trying to remember what the Prime Minister actually said. 5. She flipped round her attack on the Tory 'nasty party' Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now Watch this video again Video will play in  Share this video Watch Next The PM brazenly claimed LABOUR is the “nasty party” - 14 years after she used the phrase to describe the Tories. “The Labour party is not just divided but divisive,” she told delegates in Birmingham. “Determined to the embrace the politics of pointless protest that simply pulls people further apart.” She said Labour is “fighting amongst themselves... tolerating anti-Semitism and supporting voices of hate.” With a sneer, she added: “Do you know what some people call them? The nasty party!” She also said Labour expanded the use of the private sector in the NHS more than the Tories did. “Let’s have no more of Labour’s absurd belief that they have a monopoly on compassion,” she stormed. “Let’s put an end to their sanctimonious pretence of moral superiority. Let’s make clear that they’ve given up the right to call themselves the party of the NHS.” She said Labour’s “extreme ideological fixations led them to simply stop listening to the country. They abandoned the centre ground.” Yet there's one very important detail - not once in her 7,000-word speech did she mention Jeremy Corbyn by name. Read More Theresa May brands LABOUR the 'nasty party' in her keynote speech to Conservative Party Conference 6. She launched thinly veiled attacks on Apple, Facebook and Sir Philip Green (Photo: Carl Court/Getty Images) Mrs May launched a thinly veiled attack on Apple, Facebook and former BHS boss Sir Philip Green. She told party faithful she was putting people in positions of power on notice that "a change must come." In a barely disguised swipe at Apple and Facebook, she attacked "household names" who refuse to work with authorities to fight terrrism. It will be seen by many as a reference to both tech giants refusing to allow police and security services access to their encrypted messaging services. Apple refused to help the FBI unlock an iPhone seized from a suspect in the San Bernadino shooting last year.

Yet the chain plunged into administration in April this year, with a £571million black hole in its pension fund. Read More Theresa May launches thinly veiled attacks on Apple, Facebook and Sir Philip Green 7. She put tax dodgers on notice (Photo: Carl Court/Getty Images) Mrs May made an attack down the camera lens on tax dodgers and their "middle men" - in a room full of rich Tories. "We’re all Conservatives here," she said. "We all believe in a low-tax economy. But we also know that tax is the price we pay for living in a civilised society. "Nobody, no individual tycoon and no single business, however rich, has succeeded on their own." She added: “It doesn’t matter who you are. If you’re a tax dodger, we’re coming after you.” 8. She said she'd help industry... but FAILED to mention steel (Photo: Roland Leon/Daily Mirror) The PM reeled off a long list of industries she’d give state support - life sciences, creative industries, tech, car manufacturing. But she failed to mention British steel. And her comments signalled she may not be willing to back the flailing industry and stricken plant in Port Talbot if it’s set to lose money. She warned her strategy would not be about "propping up failing industries or bringing old companies back from the dead". 9. Her new catchphrase left Cameron powerless - literally (Photo: Matt Cardy/Getty Images) She said "a change has got to come" no fewer than seven times. And she said various versions of it a lot more. It's almost as if she wasn't happy with the leadership of David Cameron 's elite "Chipping Norton set". And in a perfect metaphor, the posh Oxfordshire market town was left literally powerless. Power firm SSEN tweeted its apologies for a power cut during the speech and said it was hoping to restore electricity by 2pm.

News Business Business News Casino capitalism, inflation, French tourism: Business news in brief, Wednesday 5th October, 2016 Billionaire investor accuses central banks of turning global markets into a casino; consumers unaware of Brexit price hikes in store; French tourism companies call for special police force. Ben Chapman Wednesday 5 October 2016 13:26 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Bill Gross says ultra-loose monetary policy has turned markets into casinos Rex Central banks have turned markets into casino, says Gross Global central bank policy makers have turned world financial markets into a casino, thanks to their unprecedented monetary policies, one of the world’s most revered investors warned on Tuesday.  In his latest investment outlook titled “Doubling Down”, Bill Gross of Janus Capital said:  “Our financial markets have become a Vegas/Macau/Monte Carlo casino, wagering that an unlimited supply of credit generated by central banks can successfully reflate global economies and reinvigorate nominal GDP growth to lower but acceptable norms in today's highly levered world”. Gross, who oversees the $1.5bn (£1.2bn) Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund, recommended Bitcoin and gold for investors who are looking for places to preserve capital. “At some point investors – leery and indeed weary of receiving negative or near-zero returns on their money, may at the margin desert the standard financial complex, for higher returning or better yet, less risky alternatives,” Mr Gross said. Mr Gross has been lambasting ultra-loose central bank policies for hindering global economies by keeping so-called “zombie” corporations alive and inhibiting “creative destruction”. For several years, he and others have warned that zero and negative interest rates not only fail to provide an easing cushion should recession occur, but they destroy capitalism’s business models. “A commonsensical observation made by yours truly and increasing numbers of economists, Fed members, and corporate CEOs would be that low/negative yields erode, and in some cases destroy, historical business models which foster savings/investment and ultimately economic growth.”  He added: “Our argument is that NIMs [net interest margins] for banks, and the solvency of insurance companies and pension funds with long dated and underfunded liabilities, have been negatively affected and that ultimately, the continuation of current monetary policies will lead to capital destruction as opposed to capital creation.” Reuters British consumers face Brexit-driven price shock Wholesale food prices have already jumped 7.6 % but this has not yet been felt by consumers (Getty Images/iStockphoto) Any British shoppers tempted by Apple’s new iPhone will have to dig deeper into their pockets after June's Brexit vote, as the US tech giant raised the sterling price by £60 when the model went on sale on 16 September. The 11 per cent price rise for Britons almost exactly matches the amount by which the pound had fallen against the dollar since the Brexit vote. On Tuesday, sterling slid to a new 31-year low, meaning many other retailers are likely to follow Apple, putting a dampener on five years of solid growth in consumer spending that has powered Britain’s recovery since the financial crisis. But few consumers seem aware of what is coming, according to one survey of household expectations. Higher inflation could reduce growth in household spending to just 1 per cent next year, the Bank of England has said. “We know there is a big inflation shock coming from sterling’s depreciation, so it looks like households’ real income will grow only very modestly next year,” said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Associated British Foods, which owns Primark, told Reuters it intended to absorb the higher cost of imports through its profit margins, to maintain its position as a bargain destination. By contrast, fashion chain Next said it would pass on higher costs to consumers, by 2017 when hedges it took out against currency weakness expire. Next – one of Britain's biggest clothing retailers – has estimated that the weaker pound will push up its costs by 5 per cent next year if it cannot find cheaper suppliers. Firms across Britain will have to make similar choices. The average cost of imported goods in August was 7.6 per cent higher than a year earlier, the sharpest year-on-year rise since 2011. Reuters French tourism companies want special police force French companies reliant on tourism are feeling the effects of terrorist attacks (Reuters) France’s tourism sector on Tuesday urged French authorities to set up a special police force in Paris to fight criminals targeting tourists as safety fears curb the number of visitors to the French capital. Foreign tourist arrivals to France could fall 4 to 5 per cent this year, following Islamic militant attacks and repeated robberies against Asian tourists, warned Alliance 46.2, a group representing firms that rely on foreign visitors. Its members include department store chain Galeries Lafayette and holiday group Club Med and AccorHotels. “The image of France has deeply deteriorated and it’s likely that 2017 will still feel the impact. The recovery may therefore be long,” it said. An armed robbery against reality TV star Kim Kardashian on Monday only exacerbates the situation. The decline in visitor figures, if confirmed, would be the steepest in 40 years and put up to 30,000 jobs at risk in the struggling French tourism sector, the statement said. Foreign tourists have avoided France since Islamic State gunmen killed 130 people in an attack in Paris last November. In July, a gunman drove a truck into crowds celebrating Bastille Day on 14 July in the Riviera city of Nice, killing 86. Repeated robberies against foreign tourists, notably Asian tourists, have also added to safety worries, Alliance 46.2 said. The tourism sector represents 7 to 8 per cent of France’s gross domestic product and employs about 2m people. Reuters BP’s Clair oilfield still shut following leak (Istock Photo) BP’s Clair offshore field near the UK’s Shetland Islands is still shut following an oil leak. BP, which operates the field, said it wants to be “completely certain” the technical issue that caused the leak on 2 October has been resolved before restarting, so production will remain offline as it investigates. About 95 metric tons of oil, or fewer than 700 barrels, was released into the sea from the Clair platform in a leak that lasted less than an hour, BP said in statement on Monday. The field produced an average of 20,000 barrels a day in the past year, according to data from the UK Oil and Gas Authority. More than 4m barrels of oil escaped into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 following an explosion on Transocean’s Deepwater Horizon rig, which was drilling a well for BP, costing the company $61bn (£48bn). Bloomberg Spain’s ex-IMF boss denies wrongdoing in bank card trial  Former IMF chief Rodrigo Rato (left) in court  at the start of the trial  (Reuters) Rodrigo Rato, a former head of the International Monetary Fund, has told a court he believed a Spanish bank corporate credit card he allegedly misused formed part of his salary and was legal. Mr Rato was answering prosecution questions for the first time on Tuesday in a trial in which he and 64 others are accused of fraudulent administration and misappropriation of Bankia bank funds by using “opaque” credit cards for irregular and undeclared expenses between 2003 and 2012.  Prosecutors are seeking a four-year jail term for Mr Rato, 67, who headed Bankia between 2010 and 2012. The bank had to be bailed out later.  Mr Rato was IMF chief from 2004 to 2007 and a leading figure in Spain’s acting ruling Popular Party from 1996 to 2004.  AP Telecoms giant Ericsson axes 3,000 jobs  Ericsson is to cut 3,000 jobs in Sweden and downsize operations as part of a 9bn kronor (£820m) cost-cutting drive.The Swedish company said the cuts will fall in its research and development, sales and administration departments. It employs 16,000 people in Sweden. Ericsson said in a statement that the changes are required in response to “technology shifts” and to secure the group's “long-term competitiveness”. Chief Jan Frykhammar added: “Ericsson is going through a large transformation. We continue to have a strong focus on research and development, and most Ericsson employees work in software development and services, rather than hardware production. The measures are necessary to secure Ericsson’s long-term competitiveness as well as technology and services leadership.” Bloomberg Krispy Kreme buys back UK business  Krispy Kreme Doughnuts has agreed to buy the brand’s UK business from its private-equity owner, consolidating ownership on both sides of the Atlantic. Closely held Krispy Kreme will make the purchase from private-equity firm Alcuin Capital, which cancelled a planned initial public offering of shares in the British doughnut baker. The companies didn’t disclose the price in a statement on Tuesday, but a person familiar with the matter said it was in the same range as the scrapped IPO, which was expected to value the business at £187m to £212m. The deal consolidates the doughnut brand’s operations after JAB, an investment vehicle of the Vienna-based Reimann family, acquired the US operations earlier this year. JAB has a portfolio that includes Keurig Green Mountain, Caribou Coffee, Peet’s Coffee & Tea and other breakfast and fast-food brands. Bloomberg Carillion wins £350m Nationwide contract Support services firm Carillion said it had signed a seven-year contract to provide facilities management services to Britain’s biggest customer-owned lender, Nationwide Building Society. Carillion, which maintains railways, roads and military bases in Britain, said the contract worth about £350m could potentially be extended for a further three years. As part of the contract, which started at the beginning of this month, Carillion will provide facilities management and workplace services for Nationwide’s headquarters in Swindon, its 15 corporate offices, critical data centres and 700 retail branches in the UK. Reuters Samsung BioLogics may raise $2bn in South Korean IPO Samsung BioLogics, a contract manufacturer of biotech drugs for global pharmaceutical firms, said on Tuesday its initial public raising could raise up to $2bn (£1.6bn) in an offering set to be South Korea’s third largest IPO. Samsung, under new de facto leader Jay Y Lee, has been keen to strengthen its biopharmaceutical businesses as the smartphones-to-construction business empire hunts for new sources of growth. The offering is primarily aimed at funding an ambitious expansion in production capacity to make BioLogics the world’s largest contract manufacturer of biotech medicines. It will also funnel more resources to unlisted unit Samsung Bioepis, which aims to beat rivals to market with its lower-cost copies of some of the world’s top-selling biotech drugs called biosimilars.

Apple's valuation rose 5% to $178.1 billion, ahead of tech rivals like Google, Microsoft, and Samsung, despite iPhone sales declining for the first time this year in line with the company's first revenue decline since 2003. Apple's brand value has steadily risen since 2002, when it was worth $5.2 billion, according to the study. Apple shows how ecosystems drive value. Analysts have often pointed out that “Apple has superior products.” While true, this opinion undersells the brilliance of Apple’s functionally integrated model. Its software, hardware, and touchpoints are connected not just by beautiful design aesthetics, but by a level of interoperability that justifies the Apple premium and discourages defections to another platform. And the more data you share, the more personal it becomes—adding new devices is painless and the thought of switching increasingly unpromising. Apple is the Alpha of Cohesiveness in full effect.However, perhaps more reflective of its recent declines, Apple did not make Interbrand's list of the top growing brands in 2016: Coca-Cola, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, and GE were the only companies outside the technology industry to make the top ten, which also included IBM and Amazon. Coca-Cola's brand value dropped 7% to $73.1 billion, continuing its decline since Apple overtook it for the top spot in 2013, according to Interbrand. Interbrand is one of several brand rankings released each year, with others including Forbes and BrandZ. Apple has consistently performed well in these studies over the past decade as its revenue has ballooned on the strength of iPhone sales. Apple remains the world's most valuable company with a $611 billion market cap.

I read that as saying that all their products work so well together, why would anyone look elsewhere? Fact is, the iphone has a premium feel and is true pick up and play. The people I have asked say they can't be bothered with trying to learn or use Android. Only one (a fellow geek) has said that he loves the Apple ecosystem, or even recognises the existence of one! Accurate as that might be about the interoperability, if the statement about defections was also true then I would also expect to see Mac sales making up a much bigger percentage of the companies revenue. It doesn't though, the iPhone is by faaaaar the biggest product for Apple. This feels almost like sponsored PR puff to me.

Go LATEST MOST POPULAR NEWS VIDEO PHOTO NEWS VIDEO PHOTO HOME JG.TV News Business International Sports Life & Style Opinion INDEX Price of New iPhone 7 in Indonesia Will Be Among Highest Worldwide i The new iPhone 7 and AirPods are displayed during an Apple media event in San Francisco, California, on Sept. 7. (Reuters Photo/Beck Diefenbach) By : Dhania Putri Sarahtika | on 7:46 PM October 05, 2016 Category : Business, Tech, Featured Jakarta. Indonesia is predicted to be the country in Southeast Asia with the second-highest price for Apple's new iPhone 7, according to a recent price study by iPrice Indonesia, local arm of online shopping startup the iPrice Group. The iPhone is manufactured in China, which neighbors Southeast Asia, but according to the iPrice Indonesia study, the iPhone 7 will be significantly more expensive in the region compared to the United States, due to shipment export costs, import duties and taxes, and other fees imposed by governments. According to iPrice, the iPhone in Indonesia will be one of the most expensive worldwide. "For countries where the iPhone 7 has not yet been officially launched, such as Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, the tech savvy have resorted to going abroad in the hope of being the first to own it," iPrice said in a statement e-mailed to the Jakarta Globe by Andrew Prasatya, the company's content marketing executive. "Unauthorized retailers are purchasing the iPhone 7 from Singapore and Hong Kong [where the iPhone 7 has already been launched] and selling them in their home countries at higher prices, which can go up to 14 percent in Vietnam and 49 percent in Thailand," iPrice said in the statement. Apple has not yet announced the official release date for the iPhone 7 in Indonesia. A price comparison for the iPhone 7 in Southeast Asian countries and the average number of days a middle-income buyer needs to work to be able to afford Apple's latest model smartphone. (Infographic courtesy of iPrice Indonesia) How Expensive Can It Go? The study estimates that an iPhone 7 with 128 gigabytes of internal storage will cost about $1,268 when it arrives in Indonesia, making it nearly $500 more expensive than in the United States, from where it originates. As for neighboring countries, buyers in Thailand are expected to pay the most, where a new iPhone may cost up to $1,340. The cheapest is in Singapore at $897, where the iPhone 7 has been available since last month. The study said middle-income Indonesians, with an average salary of $1.80 (or Rp 23,900) per hour, have to work at least 87 days to afford an iPhone 7, assuming that the whole salary is spent on the phone. They may likely think twice before purchasing a 128 GB iPhone since the price is equivalent to the latest automatic scooter by Japanese manufacturer Honda. The price would also be equivalent to three-months' rent of an apartment located in the heart of Jakarta, or 32 bags of rice at 50-kilograms per bag. Highly Anticipated Still, the iPhone 7 is eagerly awaited in Indonesia. And despite negative reaction around the replacement of audio jack with Apple AirPods, the latest model is in demand because of innovations such as increased storage, a new home button and water-resistance, according to reports from various local media and online tech-focused news portals. IPrice said regardless of its fairly high price, the iPhone generally remains popular in Indonesia. It referred to industry data showing that about 61.2 million units of the previous generation iPhone 6 and 6s were sold in the country during the first quarter of 2015. "In addition to the innovation of the iPhone 7, the iPhone is a status symbol in Indonesia where the owners are perceived as being rich, successful and living in luxury," iPrice's statement said.Show More Apple Indonesia smartphone market iPhone 7 iPrice Indonesia Taiwan to Ask for Removal of Uber Apps From Apple, Google App Stores Apple Plans 3 New Innovation Centers in Indonesia   Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The company for months has insisted that it would not share data that would jeopardize the privacy and trust of its millions of customers. iMessage encryption does prevent Apple from accessing the actual content of conversations, but the company maintains for up to 30 days phone logs that contain a range of information, including contacts, IP addresses, and dates and times of conversations, The Intercept reported. The information on Apple's practices was included in a cache of documents The Intercept obtained from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's Electronic Surveillance Support Team, which facilitates the collection of data using controversial methods like the Stingray program, as well as more conventional tools like pen registers. Investigators have requested and used iMessage data, the agency confirmed to the E-Commerce Times. "Florida laws are narrow in scope and FDLE can only request this data when there is a criminal predicate and when authorized by a court," explained spokesperson Molly Best. "We do not keep information on the number of times it has been used." The iMessage data is encrypted, and the agency is able to see only who is communicating, not what is being communicated, she added. Masking Metadata Using encrypted iPhones is a very secure way to protect the content of electronic conversations, but it is possible to glean a great deal of information from metadata, observed Jacob Ginsberg, senior director at Echoworx. "Metadata and information about who you are contacting, when presented in a bulk manner, is incredibly sensitive," he told the E-Commerce Times. "It's nothing to be scoffed at." There are few ways to hide every trace of digital information that a user leaves on a mobile device, even if it has strong encryption built in, like the iPhone does, Ginsberg said. Encryption is designed to protect the data that is embedded in the content of a message, said Gustaf Bjorksten, chief technologist at Access Now. If the communication uses Internet protocols, then routers and servers have to be able to understand that metadata in order to properly deliver the message, he told the E-Commerce Times. There are systems, like the Tor network, that can avoid exposing metadata to public scrutiny. Tor uses a concept called "onion routing": The metadata for each "hop" of a route from sender to recipient is encased in another layer of encryption, and thus is visible only to the two infrastructure devices involved in that particular hop. FBI vs. Apple Feud The revelations about Apple's practices follow a months-long legal fight between the company and the Department of Justice. Department officials had demanded that Apple help the FBI unlock data from an encrypted iPhone used by one of the shooters in last year's deadly terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California. Fourteen people were killed, and another 22 were injured when Syed Farook and his wife opened fire on a local holiday party in San Bernardino. The two subsequently were killed in a shootout with law enforcement officers. FBI investigators were unable to retrieve the data on an iPhone 5c used by Farook, so the DoJ went to court to compel Apple to help it retrieve information that investigators hoped would provide evidence crucial to the case, including whether there were other accomplices in the shooting, and whether it was part of a wider conspiracy. Apple publicly and vehemently declined to help the FBI, arguing that doing so would undermine the trust of its customers and set a dangerous precedent that would open the company to future demands for cooperation. The agency later was able to retrieve the data on its own by using an outside entity to help it hack into the phone. Customers Loyal It's difficult to say assess the long-term impact of the latest revelations on Apple's iPhone business. The phone is coveted by users, but that's at least in part due to the level of security and privacy it provides. "Overall, the details may be a bit too technically obscure for most folks to care about," said Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. "Plus, Apple's truest fans and [most loyal] customers appear willing to forgive the company for any self-inflicted embarrassment," he told the E-Commerce Times. Apple recently has taken heat for hiding billions in overseas tax shelters, and for characterizing its decision to replace the iPhone's industry-standard headphone jacks with highly criticized wireless buds as an "act of courage." The Department of Justice declined our request to comment for this story. Apple did not respond to our request for comment. David Jones is a freelance writer based in Essex County, New Jersey.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) could "easily" acquire Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), but that doesn't necessarily mean it should. Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi explored what an acquisition of Netflix by Apple would look like. For starters, buying Netflix so Apple can run its library of content exclusively through Apple TV or the iOS platform isn't a "value-creating thesis." On the other hand, buying Netflix and letting it continue operating as it is today is a scenario in which Apple will generate meaningful revenue accretion or cost reduction through its brand, marketing reach and operational prowess. Sacconaghi said the "most intriguing" part of any potential deal would be the fact that owning Netflix would add $8 billion to its services revenue and help shift Apple's transactional business model towards a subscription-base model. Related Link: Subscriber Growth Woes Continue To Haunt Netflix; Company Could Be A Legitimate Target For Disney, Apple "We believe AAPL could and should look to build a subscription offering of features and services that could be bundled with its hardware offerings, analogous to what Amazon does with Amazon Prime. Netflix (at a discounted price for only iPhone or iPad users who buy Apple hardware as a subscription) could be a key element of an attractive services bundle," the analyst explained. Nevertheless, the analyst did acknowledge that an acquisition of Netflix is "highly out of character" for Apple because: Apple's history is void of conducting large deals. Apple doesn't buy and run established business. A deal would be 2-3 percent dilutive in a cash transaction and even more so in a stock deal. Apple more likely wants to built an over-the-top (OTTP) content offering including live TV instead of just an on-demand content offering. Finally, Sacconaghi suggested Apple is likely better off partnering with Netflix, which could prove to be mutually beneficial. For instance, Netflix could sell its service for a cheaper monthly price to "Apple Prime" users which would be customers who pay for their iPad or iPhone on a hypothetical subscription basis. "Overall, we do not see a compelling rationale for Apple to acquire Netflix, and believe Apple will more likely partner or compete with Netflix than acquire it," the analyst concluded. "That said, it is very hard to estimate its likelihood and potential impact on Netflix's fundamentals. As a result, we do not believe the potential for a partnership or acquisition by Apple justifies owning NFLX."

By Todd Haselton | October 5, 2016 Share Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple quietly pulled the third-generation Apple TV from its digital store shelves yesterday and, behind the scenes, killed off the product. 9to5Mac was first to report on the news after obtaining an internal email from Apple. “Effective immediately, Apple TV (3rd generation), MD/199LL/A, has reached end of life and is now discontinued,” the email said. “The Apple Supply team is going to fulfill all shippable backlog.” The “end of life” status suggests that Apple will stop issuing patches and other software updates to the third-generation Apple TV, though that has not yet been confirmed. The move makes sense as Apple pushes further with tvOS 10, the new operating system on the fourth-generation Apple TV. Why continue to sell an old platform, after all?

The bad news is that Apple's latest iOS 10.1 beta software still doesn't unlock the sweet new dark mode feature we've all been waiting impatiently for ever since it was found hiding in iOS 10 this past summer. Seriously, Apple, just give us dark mode already! There is good news though, and it's that Apple just released iOS 10.1 beta 2 with a number of bug fixes, refinements, new features and of course Portrait Mode for the iPhone 7 Plus, and we're going to show you how to install it without the need for a developer account. DON'T MISS: iPhone 7 vs. Galaxy S7 blind camera test: Guess which model hardcore Apple fans picked You paid anywhere from $650 to nearly $1,000 for that iPhone you're using, and now you have to pay another $99 for a developer account so you can access the latest and greatest iOS software before anyone else? To be fair, Apple's developer program is for, you know, developers. $99 is a bargain for all of the tools and resources available through the iOS developer program, but regular consumers still want access to Apple's developer betas as well. After all, waiting an extra day for the public betas to be released is completely out of the question. Apple made some changes recently to the way its iOS beta software works, and it's now easier than ever to install beta software without a developer account. All you have to do is install Apple's special iOS 10.1 beta profile — we won't link to it here, but this site does — and the iOS 10.1 beta 2 update will instantly become available to you as an over the air (OTA) update. The video embedded below from YouTube user iCrackUriDevice will walk you through the entire process to make it as easy as possible. The quick iOS 10.1 beta 2 installation walkthrough begins at about 4:04 if you want to skip the intro. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7nVfrdyw0g Trending right now: iPhone 7 vs. Galaxy S7 blind camera test: Guess which model hardcore Apple fans picked More proof the iPhone 8 is getting the revolutionary new feature you’re waiting for Benchmarks from Apple’s next-gen processor just leaked and it’s scary how powerful it is See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Best Buy’s pre-Black Friday 2016 sale is live right now – here are the 20 best deals BGR News China astronauts return from monthlong space station stay Associated Press iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech AirSelfie drone is small enough to stow away in a phone case Digital Trends New hybrid console takes Nintendo on the go Yahoo Tech Walmart’s pre-Black Friday sale starts right now – here are the best deals so far BGR News This smart crib will help your baby sleep safely through the night Yahoo Tech Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

James Martin/CNET Steve Jobs remembered: Apple co-founder, typeface fanatic 0 Share: Tech Industry by Shara Tibken October 5, 2016 7:11 AM PDT @sharatibken Up Next President Obama slams fake news for eroding democracy Enlarge Image Steve Jobs died five years ago after leading Apple through momentous decades. Photo by Apple In the tech world, five years feels like centuries. But for Apple, the legacy of Steve Jobs lives on. The charismatic co-founder of the world's most profitable company died October 5, 2011, after a long battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 56. While Jobs has been gone for five years, he's remained in the public eye through books and films that portray his life, career and personality. Jobs was always a charismatic and controversial leader, beloved by many (including millions of Apple fanboys throughout the world) but hated by those who faced his wrath. On Wednesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook tweeted in remembrance of his predecessor and his impact on the world at large. Here are some memories from others who worked closely with Jobs during his time at Apple. Attention to detail Apple hired designer Clement Mok in 1982 to work on branding for 1984's Mac launch. He became co-manager of Apple Creative Services in 1985 and served as creative director for corporate and education marketing. He's one of the people responsible for the iconic imagery of Apple in its marketing and packaging, including the squiggly line drawings gracing early Mac promotional materials. Another of Mok's duties was to redesign Jobs' business cards when Apple updated its brand identity and logo. Steve Jobs retrospective Steve Jobs stepping down as CEO of Apple marks the end of an era. Come with us on a journey through the ups and downs of his career. From the development of the first Mac in 1984 to the unveiling of the iPhone and iPad, Jobs has changed the face of an industry. 5:13 Close Drag "I was to go over the Steve's office and say, 'This is your new business card. I want you to take a look at it before we send it out to the printers,'" Mok said. Jobs examined the business card closely. "At that point, no one knew he took calligraphy," Mok said. "Jobs was a fanatic about different typefaces. But we had no idea, at least many of us had no idea, that he had an appreciation of typography at that depth we now understand. "He looked at the card and said, 'Shouldn't the kerning [the space between the letters] be tighter here and here? And here is too tight.' I was flabbergasted that he would be so into the weeds on that one little detail," Mok said. "That's how obsessed Steve was with details. I think I gained an incredible respect for him at that point. I thought I could say, 'Hey Steve, here's your card. FYI.' But he took time." By the way, Mok said he agreed with Jobs -- the kerning was off on his original business card design. Walking billboards Jobs' obsession with detail went well beyond his business cards. He also cared deeply about the packaging used to sell Apple's products. The sleek white iPhone and Mac boxes, now iconic, wouldn't have happened if not for Jobs, said Tom Suiter. Suiter served as Apple's first director of creative services and helped launch the Mac in 1984. He was also part of a revamp of product packaging.

Photo by James Martin/CNET "When you think about [Apple packaging] and go into an Apple Store today and buy that package, it's such a delightful experience...It's so gorgeous. Apple's known for that. But I was lucky enough to be around when it was really bad." When Apple launched its products in the early 1980s, "packaging was fragmented," Suiter said. Different divisions had different designers who made their packaging distinct from other groups. That "was costing us a lot of money," he said. Suiter's team was tasked with making a new, universal Apple package design in 1984. They came up with two versions. One was "very cost-effective," the other "at least" triple that price, he recalls. Enlarge Image Apple devices, like 2014's Phone 6, still use the company's iconic white packaging. Photo by James Martin/CNET The cheaper version had two colors on corrugated paper stock. "It was very practical," Suiter said. "There was another version that was absolutely gorgeous. It used all of the six colors of the Apple logo. It had the Apple logo on one side and a black-and-white photo on the box." Suiter's team presented the packaging options to the different groups at Apple. "The difference was dramatic in terms of cost," he said. "[We figured] there was no way we could pay that kind of money, and we'd have to go with that [cheaper] version." But Jobs surprised Suiter. "Steve stopped everybody and said, 'No, here's how we're going to pay for it. We're going to take money from the advertising budget. I believe packages are like billboards. When people are carrying boxes around and putting [them] in their cars, it's a moving billboard for Apple so that's what we're going to do.'" Apple still uses a similar design for its packaging today. Standing up to Steve Jobs was considered a genius by many, but he also had a temperamental side, which his employees knew all too well. "[Steve] would come marching down the hall or skipping down the hall, calling...'What an idiot. I can't believe you did this stupid thing,'" said Debi Coleman, who joined Apple in 1981 as finance controller for the Macintosh. It took her a year to learn how to confront Jobs. Coleman credits Joanna Hoffman, the executive in charge of Mac marketing, as her teacher. "Joanna said, 'Look him in the eye. You've got to stand up.' From that point on -- I'm not saying he wasn't tough, totally demanding and totally critical -- but he was totally wonderful to me." 27 Steve Jobs at Apple: A retrospective (pictures) Coleman became head of Mac manufacturing in 1984 and was one of the highest-ranking women in the tech industry. She took over the role of Apple chief financial officer in 1986. At a November 2015 reunion of women on the Mac team, Coleman attributed a big part of Apple's success to Jobs, saying he made people at Apple believe they could change the world. And even if he was intimidating, he had a softer side, she said. One Sunday morning in the early days of the Macintosh computer, Coleman got a call from Jobs, asking that she meet him at the Mac factory. He wanted to give a tour to his father, Jobs said. "That was a real wonderful experience to see how Steve loved and respected his adopted father," Coleman said. "I never saw anything like it before or since."

Welcome to middle age Jobs recruited John Sculley in the early 1980s to help him grow Apple's business. At the time, Sculley was CEO of Pepsi and had helped it overtake Coca-Cola as the top beverage maker. Jobs famously convinced Sculley to take the CEO role at Apple in 1983 by asking if he wanted to "sell sugar water for the rest of his life" or if he wanted to "come with me and change the world." Sculley, who was close with Jobs before helping to oust him in 1985, served as Apple's chief executive for a decade until being forced out himself. Sculley still remembers the first time he visited Apple's Silicon Valley offices in 1982. "I show up at this address and think I'm at the wrong place because there are no buildings, just houses," Sculley said. He met Jobs in the house used as Apple's executive staff offices, and then the two headed to the Mac building a couple blocks away. "It was a beautiful blue-sky day, and there was a Jolly Roger pirate flag flying from the roof," Sculley said. "Steve was in great competition with the Lisa [computer] group. Lisa was the Navy so Steve wanted to be the pirates." Steve Jobs took a hiatus from his medical leave in early 2011 to debut the iPad 2. Photo by James Martin/CNET Inside the Mac building was an expensive piano for some of the team engineers, as well as a motorcycle. When he walked into the engineering lab, Andy Hertzfeld, an original member of the Macintosh team who designed the system's software, had set up a demo. "Steve had used the ruse that I was not interviewing for a job but I was there as the CEO of Pepsi and interested in Macs for Pepsi," Sculley said. "Andy had put together dancing Pepsi cans on the screen of the Mac. I didn't know that this was really pretty hard to do, was pretty novel. ... I was wondering why Andy was smiling with his Cheshire cat grin. That was the first introduction I had to what Apple was like. It was totally a startup."

Google’s decision to become a full-fledged, vertically integrated device maker — controlling and blending together hardware, software, and ecosystem design — may one day seem inevitable, obvious, or even a little late. But in the short and medium term, it’s a huge, bold move that will pose new challenges for the other major players in the tech industry. That’s especially true because the company made it clear that the array of new Google-made hardware devices it rolled out yesterday — especially the new Pixel phone and Google Home intelligent speaker — are important vessels for the technology it believes is the key to the entire future of tech: artificial intelligence. Google’s hardware is a vessel for AI Every tech company is stressing AI, by which I mean various ways of making machines smart about people and the world, and almost human in their ability to help, and to converse with, people. But Google believes its version, called the Google Assistant, has the power to win that race, even if it concedes the contest is just beginning. And, to do that, it decided, it had to be in control of the whole device. Almost a year ago to the day, I wrote a column laying out five reasons it was time for Google to make its own hardware. I missed the AI angle. Google didn’t. The company’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, called AI "a seminal moment in computing" on a par with the personal computer, the web, and the smartphone going mainstream, at roughly 10-year intervals. "It’s clear to me," he said, "that we are moving from a mobile-first to an AI-first world." But, even with AI merely in its infancy, Google’s move to becoming a full-fledged maker of the most important consumer tech hardware is a huge deal. It will finally give the search giant the chance to match the advantages long enjoyed by the champion of vertical integration, its arch-rival Apple. These advantages are legion, even if you don’t include AI. They range from better battery life, to more easily promulgated software updates, to new features that rely on both hardware and software. For instance, by controlling and integrating the design of the whole device, Apple has been able to make its iPhones, iPads and Macs do much more with seemingly lesser specs again and again. It’s a big reason why, even in a world long conquered by Google’s Android platform, the iPhone has been the leading phone model, with a billion sold. Now, that may change. But Apple isn’t the only company affected. Here’s a quick, early look at how Google’s pivot will pose challenges to the big tech companies. Apple The world’s biggest tech company finally has a fitting rival. For decades, it has battled mainly software platform makers (Microsoft and Google) which had to depend on unrelated hardware partners to showcase their technology. And with hardware makers (Dell, Samsung) which had limited ability to integrate and make the most of others’ software. In the last 15 years or so, it’s done brilliantly in that matchup. Now, it will face a smart, rich rival that aims to do it all. Apple squandered its early lead in integrated AI, with Siri, which still is clumsy so often that many just ignore it. It has similarly lost its early lead in music, waiting too long to embrace streaming and depending on hardware integration to make Apple Music an easier path for iPhone loyalists than Spotify. Another early advantage, its AirPlay system, which beams video and music to TVs and speakers, seems to have been forgotten in recent years, while Google’s Cast system is integrated in speakers and TVs from a variety of other manufacturers and a centerpiece of the new Google Home connected speaker. Apple has never had a competitor quite like this new Google And Apple’s excellent cloud systems for distributing photos, music, messaging, and other content across its phones, tablets, laptops, and Apple TV will also be challenged by Google, which showed off a bunch of cross-device integration for its new products. Also, while there are reports that Apple is building a standalone AI and speaker device, Google is actually launching one. Simply put, Apple has never had a competitor quite like this new Google. That doesn’t mean the iPhone maker will lose. It’s still an amazing company, with great products — Google’s new Pixel phone looks a lot like the iPhone, and Google’s campus is filled with Macs. And it has many hardware advantages Google will have to work hard to match, from a superb supply chain to hundreds of stores that not only sell, but support, its products. Oh, and iPhones are sold by all carriers; the Pixel is Verizon-only. But Google’s pivot does mean that Apple will have to step up its game, on multiple fronts. That’s a good thing for consumers, but a major challenge for Cupertino. Samsung I believe that one reason Google is becoming a hardware maker is that it had become too dependent on Samsung to showcase and sell the full Google app-equipped version of its Android software. There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of device makers using Android. But the Korean giant has been the only one to combine significant global market share, profitability, and a huge marketing budget. And, its priorities haven’t always meshed with Google’s. Now, Samsung will have to compete with its software supplier in the lucrative premium smartphone market, where Apple has been its only real rival. This couldn’t have come at a worse time for Samsung And this development couldn’t have come at a worse time for Samsung, arriving on the heels of the huge recall of its flagship Note 7 phone because it shipped with batteries that caught fire or exploded. That recall, still underway, has damaged Samsung’s brand, and now Google is giving Android fans what looks like an excellent alternative. Google’s new Daydream virtual reality system, which makes use of the new Pixel phone, looks like a strong challenger to Samsung’s Gear VR product, which is based on Facebook’s Oculus platform. Daydream is cheaper, has lots of content because Google owns YouTube, and Google is giving the headsets away for a limited time with Pixel preorders. Like Apple, Samsung can’t be counted out. Its top phones are beautiful, it has lots of hardware chops, and it has its own mobile operating system called Tizen, which Samsung executives have privately described to me as a sort of Plan B if things became too difficult with Google. But Tizen today is no match for Android or Apple’s iOS. So this is a bad week for Samsung, on top of a bad month. It could turn into a bad year. Amazon Amazon has been a hugely successful, widely admired, diversified company. But hardware was never its strong suit after the original, and still popular, basic monochrome Kindle reader. Its tablets are meh. Its smartphone flopped. That all changed when it brought out the beloved Echo, the first successful standalone intelligent speaker, backed by its Alexa artificial intelligence system. The new, much less costly Google Home, which integrates with other new products Google rolled out, is a huge challenge to the Echo and to other devices that use Alexa. Home is backed by the Google Assistant, which has the potential to be much smarter than Alexa, and it’s better integrated with the rest of the Google ecosystem — it can cast audio and video to other Google Cast devices, for example. Amazon is still very much in the game, but, if Google Home proves as good as promised, it could give Amazon a major competitor with even deeper pockets and much more machine learning data to use. Microsoft Microsoft is largely out of the phone business, and it has made AI a huge priority, backed by a deep research team that’s the envy of the industry. But even the Redmond giant will be affected by the Google moves. Its Cortana AI assistant is just getting traction. It makes its own integrated hardware in the Surface line, but sells very little of it, and still depends heavily on the old model of selling Windows and Office to other companies. It doesn’t offer a standalone intelligent speaker. At the very least, the new Google will cause some serious rethinking in Redmond. Facebook and Google are head-to-head in VR Facebook Facebook isn’t a hardware company... yet. But it did swipe Google’s brainy, impressive Regina Dugan, known as a hardware research and development expert, a step that has given rise to speculation that hardware is in the offing at the social network giant. Like everyone else, Facebook has doubled down on AI, and like everyone else, its AI efforts are in the first inning. But Google’s integration of AI into a range of hardware could well cause people to simply say "OK Google" into their devices rather than dig down to use Facebook’s intelligent bots. And Facebook owns Oculus, which is an early leader in VR — so Google’s Daydream platform puts the two companies in a head-to-head fight for the first time in a few years. Bottom Line The tech world hasn’t exactly been turned upside down now that Google has become an integrated hardware maker. But it will be shaken up. And, by embedding AI into hardware it controls end to end, Google is pushing even more boldly into the future all of its rivals agree is vital. Everyone will have to decide how to respond. And while the competition might ratchet up the fanboy wars, it’s ultimately a good thing — the rest of us consumers will be the winners.

Home Industry Tech Google Pixel’s unlimited memory defeats Apple iPhone’s paid storage by miles Google Pixel’s unlimited memory defeats Apple iPhone’s paid storage by miles Google while announcing its new Pixel smartphone, has also unveiled its new feature that should make Apple iPhone extremely worried, and its users extremely envious. By: Sumit Chakraborty | Updated: October 5, 2016 6:29 PM In this new feature called Smart Storage, Google is providing Pixel smartphone users, the option of unlimited storage for pictures and videos, and that too at full resolution. Google while announcing its new Pixel smartphone, has also unveiled its new feature that should make Apple iPhone extremely worried, and its users extremely envious. In this new feature, Google is providing Pixel smartphone users, the option of unlimited storage for pictures and videos. This feature was already available through the Google Photos, but that had the provision of using the storage from the user’s Google account, which essentially meant that after a certain point of time the user might have had to pay for the service. In Pixel, it is all free. However Google photos did have the option of storing pictures for free, but it changed its resolution, lowering it to a certain degree. But in Pixel the user can store anything with the highest original resolution. Meanwhile, Apple’s for its iCloud charges for free storage after the first 5 GB is filled up. iCloud though has reduced the price to $0.99 for 50 GB, still, nothing beats getting it for free, which Google is providing. Also, Google has made the process of transferring the pictures to the cloud storage extremely seamless and automatic, which removes any other concern. This new feature in the Pixel devices has been called by Google as “Smart Storage” as it automatically regulates the background upload process after the user has set it up once. This comes as a pinch to Apple users, who otherwise generally seem happy with their devices.

The worse part is Apple encourages its users to sync the whole ecosystem to the iCloud, which is worse for space.

Top is Apple which since 2009 funneled $214.9 billion to tax havens and would owe $65.4 billion if the profits returned to the US. The report was published just weeks after a European investigation concluded Ireland provided Apple with a favorable tax rate which allowed the company to pay one percent on EU profits in 2003 down to 0.005 percent in 2014. Apple is now obliged to pay $14.5 billion in back taxes. © ctj.org The $215 billion Apple booked offshore through three tax havens last year is bigger than the gross domestic product of Portugal, Greece or New Zealand. If the company returned the earnings to the US and paid the $65.4 billion in tax, it would have been more than economies of Belarus, Uruguay or Croatia.

Number three is Microsoft with five tax haven subsidiaries and $124 billion of profits held offshore. Sneaker giant Nike holds $10.7 billion offshore and would owe $3.6 billion in US taxes. One of the authors of the report, Citizens for Tax Justice, has noted that Nike’s offshore companies in Bermuda are named after its own brands, like Air Max Limited, Nike Cortez, Nike Flight, Nike Force, Nike Huarache, Nike Jump Ltd., Nike Lavadome, Nike Pegasus, Nike Tailwind and Nike Waffle. Goldman Sachs holds $28.6 billion offshore, but “reports having 987 subsidiaries in offshore tax havens, 537 of which are in the Cayman Islands despite not operating a single legitimate office in that country, according to its own website.” Overall, if all the Fortune 500 companies paid taxes on their profits in the US, the country would get an additional $717.8 billion. In 2015, the US budget deficit stood at $438 billion.

Skip to content Philip Elmer‑DeWitt Apple 3.0 About this site Subscribe Sponsorships Account 2 months ago Published October 4, 2016 by Philip Elmer-DeWitt Hey Apple, what’s the scheduling conflict? Because the company wouldn’t say why a big investor event was rescheduled, the Internet came up with reasons of its own. Apple has moved up by two days its final quarterly earnings call of fiscal 2016 due to what Apple Investor Relations calls a “scheduling conflict.” What’s the conflict? Why Tuesday Oct. 25 and not Thursday Oct. 27? Apple didn’t say, and reporters’ inquiries (including mine) were met with silence. Because the Internet—like nature—abhors a vacuum, that silence was quickly filled with imagined conflicts. Among the ones I’ve seen: Google and Amazon’s quarterly reports Gene Munster’s vacation A new Watch band event First game of the World Series Event to announce 100 new emojis Tim’s parents are in town Kanye West concert To allow more iPhone sales That last one makes even less sense than the others. No matter when it happens, Apple will be reporting sales up to and including the last day of the fiscal quarter, Sept.  24. The best guess for the date shift, in my book, was also the most popular: A launch event for new Macs Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Previous Post Munster: Apple can’t make the iPhone 7+ fast enough Next Post Milunovich: Apple’s doom is priced into the stock 13 Comments Jeff F said: The timing works for me: the week after expiration of monthly options, depriving the gamblers a catalyst (e.g. Earnings and new Macs). 0 October 4, 2016 Log in to Reply Fred Stein said: I hope you’re right. Mac line up needs an update. 1 October 4, 2016 Log in to Reply Fred Stein said: Ironically, while we feel starved for info from Apple, the market can barely digest it. The September announcement of 2 iPhones, a new Watch, and AirPods underwhelmed analysts, but overwhelmed consumers (demand exceeds supply) and possibly their personal budgets. This quarterly report’s guidance will likely make stock analysts increase their targets. Besides the Mac line, where rumors abound, Apple may add a Siri enabled speaker. That’s more personal spending, and more for analysts to digest. Finally we’re still waiting for Apple TV media deals. 1 October 4, 2016 Log in to Reply Apple Mac ailesinin yeni modellerini 27 Ekimde tanıtabilir | "alıntı" said: […] Apple’ın toplantı tarihini bir açıklama yapmadan değiştirmesi, doğal olarak çeşitli spekülasyonları da beraberinde getirdi.

Ramin Talaie/Getty Images In tech, it’s a lot better to be early to the next party than late to the last one. With Google’s Tuesday announcement of its new hardware devices, it has managed the neat trick of doing both. The centerpieces of the new #MadeByGoogle line are largely an exercise in me-too: the company’s first-ever self-branded phone, a new connected speaker and smart-home hub, a Google-branded WiFi router, a virtual-reality headset and an updated media streamer. The phone should be no surprise; we’ve long known, going back to the original version of Android, that Google has a bad case of Apple-envy. Now, with the Google Home speaker, we can add the Amazon Echo to the list of things that turn the search giant green. But behind the copycat hardware lies a serious, more forward-thinking bet: that the next major computing platform won’t be a device, but rather an intelligent mesh of data surrounding us wherever we are, always aware of what we’re doing and ready to spring into action at our spoken command. Looked at this way, the new devices are mainly delivery mechanisms for what may be the real star of the show: Google Assistant. It’s a major expansion, powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning, of the current “OK Google” voice assistant on Android phones and in the Google Now app, the equivalent of Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. So critical is Google Assistant to the company’s vision of the future that it has chosen not to entrust it to its already-established ecosystem of hardware partners like Samsung, Motorola and LG. Hence the decision to take control of manufacturing and produce the devices itself, under its own name. There’s little about the new devices that separate them from the competition. Here’s a quick rundown of the new products, with more to come once I’ve had a chance to use them throughly: The Pixel phone. Running the latest “Nougat” version of Android, the Pixel comes in 5- and 5.5-inch models, starting at $649 for the smaller model with 32 gigabytes of storage. Verizon will be the only major carrier to offer the phone initially, but you’ll also be able to buy it, unlocked, directly from Google and use it with the company’s truly awesome Project Fi network. My first, overwhelming impression of the Pixel phone: It’s an iPhone 6s. Which is to say, it’s thin, elegant, made of glass and brushed aluminum, and features both the much-hated antenna bands and the much-loved headphone jack that Apple eliminated on the iPhone 7. Google Home. Google’s answer to the Echo includes out-of-the-box support for music services like Spotify, integration with third-party apps like Open Table, and the ability to control smart-home devices like Nest thermostats and Hue lighting. It’s priced at $129, making it cheaper than the full-fledged Echo but costlier than the Echo Dot and Tap. Google Home offers a couple features the Echo doesn’t, like a touchpad top for manual control and the ability for multiple units to communicate with each other. (If you have more than one Echo, by contrast, each is maddeningly ignorant of any other’s existence.) Google suggests that Google Assistant will make it more intelligent than Echo, though it will have to overcome the latter’s enormous lead in the marketplace. The Daydream View VR headset and controller. This is essentially the ubiquitous Google Cardboard viewer, except it’s made of fabric and other soft materials so it can be used for longer periods. Slide in your Pixel or other compatible phone, launch the Daydream app and you’re off to Neverland. It will cost $79, and passed at least one test: I was able to wear it over my glasses reasonably comfortably. Google WiFi. What can I say? It’s a router. Granted, it’s a slickly simplified router, comparable to the Eero in that you can use multiple units to create a mesh network throughout your home. But it’s still … a router. It’ll cost $129, or $299 for a three-pack, making it if nothing else cheaper than Eero. The Chromecast Ultra. The latest version of the streaming-media dongle costs $69 and does 4K video, among other tricks. When paired with Google Home, it also provides voice-activated access to streaming content, playing YouTube and other videos on your TV. When you get right down to it, there’s little about the new devices that separate them from the competition. If there’s differentiation to be found, it will come from the services and features that Google, with its vast storehouse of general knowledge plus the enormous amount of data it has amassed about each of us, is uniquely positioned to provide. Which is either awesome, or terrifying. No, check that. It’s both awesome and terrifying. Rich Jaroslovsky is an Observer technology columnist and vice president of SmartNews Inc.
