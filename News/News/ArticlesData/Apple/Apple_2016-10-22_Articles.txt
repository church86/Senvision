New iMacs and 5K external display will reportedly not be ready until next year.   ( Stephen Lam ) Advertisement Apple is all set to hold a big event on Oct. 27 and it's expected to unveil its latest MacBooks, including the much-touted MacBook Pro, but no iMac or display. According to trusted analyst Ming-chi Kuo, who proved to be correct with many predictions in the past, Apple will use the upcoming media event to take the wraps off a new 13-inch MacBook, as well as a new MacBook Pro in 13- and 15-inch models. Kuo believes that Apple will not introduce a new iMac or the rumored 5K external display until next year. The 13-inch MacBook should hit the scene as a successor to the 12-inch Retina MacBook that made its debut in 2015 and got an upgrade in April this year. The main attraction of the event, however, is expected to be the 15-inch MacBook Pro, which will reportedly rock some top-notch specs and features. Leaks and rumors so far have indicated that this model will sport a Retina display, Touch ID, upgraded internals and an OLED function row right above the keyboard. You can check out Tech Times' earlier coverage for a more comprehensive roundup of what we know so far about the MacBook Pro. Both the 13- and the 15-inch MacBook Pro models should feature the OLED touch bar and Touch ID sensor, as well as a Thunderbolt 3 port and the same butterfly keyboard design found on the 2015 MacBook. Kuo also added some new details on what he expects to see in the upcoming MacBooks. The analyst says Apple should equip the MacBook Pro with Intel Skylake processors, an oxide panel for better energy efficiency and superior display quality despite the same resolution, and a new 2 TB SSD storage option. Moreover, Kuo also hints at an Apple Watch-like processor to control the OLED touch bar more efficiently, and a USB Type-C and MagSafe-like adapter either from Apple or a third-party supplier. MacBook Pro models aside, it remains unclear at this point just what the 13-inch MacBook will bring to the table. Other than the fact that it will succeed the 2015 12-inch MacBook, little else is known. This model could turn out to be a MacBook Air updated with new USB Type-C ports, but it remains to be seen. Moving on to the desktop scene, Apple is rumored to be working on new iMac models with discrete AMD graphics, as well as a new standalone, external 5K display. According to Kuo, however, Apple will not be announcing the new iMacs or display until the first half of 2017. It's tough to tell for sure whether these predictions are accurate or not, but we'll find out soon enough. Apple's Oct. 27 event is just around the corner and we'll get the real scoop straight from the source, but it's best to take all rumors, predictions and reports with a grain of salt until then.

X Close Regional Home > News > Regional < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 24 October 2016 Indonesian nationalism bites into Apple Jakarta: Apple is battling to gain a foothold in Indonesia after nationalistic regulations hit the US tech giant’s efforts to compete in the booming emerging market against Samsung and other rivals. The iPhone 6S and 7 are yet to be released in South-East Asia’s top economy as Apple struggles to fulfil requirements that phone makers must have 20% “local content” for 4G handsets sold in the country. South Korea’s Samsung has been able to meet the demands and gain a share of the market in Indonesia – a country of 255 million people, with an army of young consumers – over 25 times bigger than Apple. Officials say the regulations that came into force this year aim to support the growth of the local manufacturing industry, which lags behind its Asian peers, and plan to raise the local content requirement to 30% at the start of next year. But to critics, it is just the latest example of misguided nationalistic rules that hamper rather than help business in Indonesia, which is ranked 109th on the World Bank’s ease of doing business index. “The new rules force companies to rethink the entire supply chain and that is expensive for them to do,” Sudev Bangah of International Data Corporation, a consumer technology market research firm, said. Apple has encountered problems in other emerging markets, notably India, where the Silicon Valley giant is facing roadblocks in its quest to open stores instead of selling products through third-party retailers. In Indonesia, meeting the local content rules has been easier for Samsung as it already has factories in the country. But Apple, which makes most of its handsets in China, has not yet met the requirements. Its iPhone 6S was never released in Indonesia, while the 7 seems unlikely to hit the country’s shops any time soon. — AFP Tags / Keywords: indonesia Related Stories Indonesian toddler dies in church attack Four hurt in East Kalimantan church explosion, one suspect arrested Understanding Jakarta’s Nov 4 demonstration Ahok quizzed over insult claims Indonesia's president postpones trip to Australia You May Be Interested Leaders of TPP nations to review options with Obama Skygazers gear up for extra bright ‘supermoon’ tonight Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Where are you on the journey to financial freedom?

 For Microsoft Windows, it's do or die Matt Weinberger Oct. 23, 2016, 6:49 PM 67,808 facebook linkedin twitter email print Microsoft CEO Satya NadellaAP Microsoft is set to unveil a bunch of new hardware on Wednesday, with the star attraction likely to be a new Surface PC to compete with Apple's all-in-one iMac.  Microsoft is billing this event as the future of Windows 10. That's not surprising: The reason Microsoft got into the Surface business in the first place was to push Windows forward into a touchscreen future, whether PC manufacturers wanted it or not. But we're fast approaching a moment in time where Microsoft is going to have to do more than introduce new kinds of PCs if it wants Windows, first introduced in 1985, to stay relevant for the next three decades.  The PC industry is shrinking and Windows is increasingly irrelevant in a mobile world ruled by Apple's iOS and Google's Android. Even worse, Microsoft's own attempts to break into the smartphone realm have landed with a resounding "thud," exacerbating the slow decline of the Windows business (fortunately for Microsoft, its cloud and productivity businesses are exploding, propelling the company's stock to new highs). It's gotten to the point where some, like Infoworld Editor-in-Chief Eric Knorr, have openly wondered whether it would be best if Microsoft put Windows out to pasture now, rather than let it bleed out slowly over the next few years as the world passes it on by. Bill Gates ahead of the Windows XP launch in 2001Microsoft Well, Windows isn't quite dead yet, still accounting for the vast majority of the hundreds of millions of desktop and laptop PCs in the world. And Microsoft has laid out some ambitious master plans for the operating system that have yet to bear much fruit, but have the potential to make a huge impact on the future of the operating system. All of which to say that it's not time to give Windows its last rites yet. But it's definitely time for Windows to do better, or else risk the slow death that otherwise awaits it.  Do Microsoft may have missed out on smartphones, but it's working hard at making sure it never misses any future trend, ever again. With Windows 10, Microsoft has built an operating system that works on PCs, tablets, the Hololens holographic goggles, virtual reality headsets like the HTC Vive, connected devices like this smart hockey table, the Xbox One console, and pretty much anything else, too. Whatever comes next, Windows 10 will be there. More than a year after launch, though, the Windows Store is still underwhelming, to put it delicately. While Microsoft has won the support of its best friends in the tech industry, with the likes of Facebook and Uber providing apps for the Windows Store, it's otherwise pretty slim pickins.  Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer at the launch of Windows 8. It eschewed traditional Windows elements like the Start button in favor of big, touch-friendly buttons.Wikimedia Commons With smartphones growing and PCs shrinking, lots of developers are choosing to focus their efforts on iOS and Android, where users are going in ever-increasing numbers. In so doing, Windows is completely missing out on current-wave apps like Snapchat and Pokémon Go, and thus a whole generation of users. So if Microsoft wants to save Windows from an ignoble fate over a long time horizon, it needs to start pairing its first-rate hardware with a wider range of apps, by any means necessary. Just as the rise of the App Store turned the iPhone from a trendy gadget into an economy unto itself, Microsoft needs a stronger Windows Store to keep users happily using Windows well into the future. There's a glimmer of hope on the horizon: Microsoft has wisely pursued a renewed focus on video gaming with Windows 10, bringing Xbox exclusives like "Gears of War 4" and "Forza Horizon 3" to the PC. Video games are still something that Windows PCs do better than Macs, iPhones, or Android, and Microsoft is doubling down. Die Windows is one year older than I am, to the day. It's very hard to picture a world without it. And yet, while Microsoft's cloud and productivity businesses are booming, as evidenced by its most recent quarterly financial results, the Windows business has been working very hard just to keep revenue fairly flat. And its investments in stuff like using HoloLens and connected devices to push Windows to new markets are risky and unproven. Windows isn't going anywhere in the short- to- medium term. Even though the PC industry is shrinking, Microsoft's Windows 10-powered Surface Pro tablet and Surface Book laptop are very slightly bucking the trend and seeing modest growth.  But Apple and Google are both ramping up their efforts to get in on that action. Apple's iPad Pro points to a future where it's as easy to get work done on iOS as it's historically been on a Windows PC. Similarly, Google's rumored "Andromeda" operating system will take the core of Android and make it more friendly for laptops and tablets. Microsoft Corporate VP of Devices Panos PanayMatt Weinberger/Business Insider No matter what happens to Windows, Microsoft as a company will be fine in the long run. Microsoft Office, still the gold standard in productivity, is available on Windows, Macs, iPhones, iPads, and Android devices, and people are subscribing to the Office 365 service in droves.   And Microsoft Azure, the company's cloud computing platform, provides the crucial backend server hosting and services for lots of popular iPhone and Android apps. As those apps get bigger, so too do the checks they write to Microsoft. In other words, Microsoft increasingly stands to do fine, no matter which way the winds blow. But those same winds carry dire tidings for Microsoft. And while new Surface PCs might accomplish the goal of getting Windows 10 to more places, there's a lot more work to be done.

CASSEL jcassel@casselsalpeter.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Middle-market business owners can improve profitability and customer loyalty by routinely evaluating and enhancing the quality of the experiences their companies provide for two of their most important stakeholders: customers and employees. Consider the success story of Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), which incorporated the right design and branding to turn coffee houses into institutions where people spend hours and pay a premium for what is perceived as the right experience that encourages folks to congregate. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) turned computers and other devices into status symbols by, among other things, using great design and strategically positioning its iconic logo on laptops to face onlookers rather than users. The Apple Store became the poster child of an innovative venue by implementing things like the genius bar for on-site consultations; a welcoming, open design; and an engaging atmosphere. Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is acclaimed for providing employees with uniquely generous benefits, including free meals and access to the latest technology, free massages on campus, permission to bring dogs to work, generous parental leave policies and spousal death benefits, among many other things. Why are these companies going to these lengths? To a large extent, these trends are being driven by the desire to attract and retain loyal customers as well as quality talent. They are particularly interested in a new generation of workers, including millennials, who want the “total package”: innovative, forward-thinking business environments as well as stock options. Recognizing this, middle-market businesses and even more traditionally conventional businesses, such as law firms and accounting firms, are beginning to take steps in this direction. As a middle-market business owner, how can you apply these learnings to help take your business to the next level? Here is some practical guidance based on my experience helping middle-market business owners navigate these questions. While a variety of elements ultimately create your customer experience, addressing the following key factors is a good start: your office layout and design; your company atmosphere and activities; and your marketing and branding. Before doing anything, it is important to engage your key stakeholders and ensure that you have established (a) consensus upfront that a modification of your business experience is necessary or beneficial and (b) an internal committee that will be able to weigh in on the process. Outside firms and consultants can be beneficial. Without this, you are likely to waste valuable time, money and other resources undertaking a process that may not lead to the right result, that may get road-blocked by internal resistance, and/or that may never get implemented due to lack of support for the financial and other investments that may be required. The most important thing is to find the approach that will fit your company’s unique needs. Try evaluating what other companies in and outside your industry have done, and find bits and pieces that are a fit for you. Identify a realistic budget. Not every company can afford to give employees the free meals, unlimited paid time off, and some of the other benefits that a growing number of technology companies are offering today. Work with qualified experts with proven experience helping similar companies in your industry to develop a plan for identifying and creating the right solution for you. It might not be necessary to move your office to a new location or to completely overhaul your culture or your brand; you might be able to get by with just making a few strategic adjustments. These adjustments could include creating special events and promotions to appeal to affinity groups. For example, lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU), which is credited for pioneering the “athleisure” clothing business, has achieved great success by providing free yoga classes at its stores and discounts for yoga instructors and company employees. Your marketing programs also should be continuously evaluated for maximum impact. It is important to work with skilled marketers who can ensure your brand positioning and all aspects of your marketing — including your logo, business cards (if you still use them), messaging, and website — are consistent with the experience you wish to create. With folks relying on their technologies to evaluate companies and make business decisions, it is imperative for your brand across earned, owned and paid media channels to be consistent and effectively support the experience you seek to create. For example, it makes little sense for a company seeking to position itself as high-tech and appeal to consumers on mobile, to have an outdated website that is not optimized for mobile. The key is to work with the right experts who can help guide you through this process and ensure you find the right solution for your needs — and to do so continuously to ensure you are keeping pace with the changing needs of your employees and customers.

Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Oct 23, 2016 at 2:15PM Earlier this month, Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) finally pulled the plug on its Galaxy Note 7 phone, after failing to fix battery-related problems that caused some phones to spontaneously catch fire. Samsung is now recalling all Galaxy Note 7 phones at great cost to itself. It expects the total cost of discontinuing and recalling the Note 7 to be at least $5.3 billion. Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 could have been a big seller. Image source: Samsung. However, Samsung may not be the only casualty from this scandal. Samsung's retail partners will also share in the pain without the Galaxy Note 7 to drive sales this fall. Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) could be particularly hard hit. It could have been a huge success Upon its initial release two months ago, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 won high praise from pundits. The Verge called it "Samsung's best device ever, and arguably the best big phone ever made." In an environment where smartphone sales have been hurt by lengthening replacement cycles, the Galaxy Note 7 was compelling enough to spark upgrades. Now that it's out of the picture, fewer people may choose to buy a new phone this fall. Furthermore, early adopters of the Galaxy Note 7 might just go back to using their previous devices rather than trading in their recalled phone for a new Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Android device. Back in August, Best Buy's management raised its full-year operating income guidance and projected that revenue would return to growth in the back half of the year. Improving phone sales were a critical piece of that forecast. Samsung's inability to solve the Galaxy Note 7's battery problems will weigh on Best Buy's sales in the second half of the fiscal year. Gains by Apple won't help Best Buy Best Buy is particularly exposed to Samsung's fortunes in the smartphone market because it has opened hundreds of Samsung Experience Shops within its Best Buy stores since 2013. These shops, which offer more Samsung-specific product expertise than other retailers, have probably helped Best Buy snag a hefty share of Samsung device sales. Thus, to the extent that consumers switch away from Samsung to other high-end smartphone manufacturers, they may be less likely to buy their new devices at Best Buy. Best Buy has opened numerous Samsung mini-shops within its stores. Image source: The Motley Fool. If Apple capitalizes on Samsung's miscue, it could be even worse for Best Buy. Apple offers third-party retailers like Best Buy notoriously slim margins on the iPhone. Thus, retailers can rack up a lot of revenue from selling iPhones, but unless they can get buyers to pick up high-margin accessories or make other purchases, they won't be making much of a profit. The recall could be costly Finally, Best Buy is likely to incur elevated costs related to the Galaxy Note 7 recall. All of the Galaxy Note 7 devices that Best Buy has sold in the past two months are now going to be returning to Best Buy stores. Processing these returns will use valuable labor, either pulling employees away from their main job (selling products) or forcing Best Buy to increase staffing. It's not clear whether it will get any compensation from Samsung for its trouble. An untimely setback Best Buy stock has rallied since August, approaching its late 2013 high. Best Buy's better-than-expected Q2 financial performance has fueled optimism that the consumer electronics giant can thrive despite the rise of e-commerce. Best Buy Stock Performance data by YCharts. However, it faces a new challenge from J.C. Penney in the appliance market, a key source of sales growth for Best Buy lately. Meanwhile, the consumer electronics market as a whole has been shrinking recently, partially driven by price deflation. These days, Best Buy has to work hard just to generate modest sales and profit growth. Apple devices aren't the reliable growth drivers they were just a few years ago. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 could have provided a nice sales and profit boost for Best Buy this fall. Instead, it has become one more headwind for Best Buy to overcome.

On Sunday morning, the New York Times wrote an article about the recall impact. “For South Koreans, the company’s progression from an assembler of clunky transistor radio sets to the world’s leading producer of flat-panel television sets, computer chips and smartphones is a source of national pride. Last year, Samsung accounted for 20 percent of South Korea’s $527 billion in exports.” <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Nzeiyk1JsY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> The article explained how much the pride has been dented since Samsung recalled Note 7 devices (twice) and decided not to produce any more Note 7 phablets. However, as the article explains, some think the situation was overblown by the American media, who aren’t as favorable with Samsung as they are with Apple. People don’t want to give up their Note 7, despite the fact it can cause serious damage. [Image by Daryl Deino] Despite the recall, BGR reports that there are over a million people still using the potentially explosive Note 7. Columnist Zach Epstein points out that the Note 7 has harmed people and has caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. Samsung has sent Note 7 users several warnings that they should power down the device and immediately return it to local retailer, yet many people refuse to turn in their headsets. Some of the commenters after the article point out that the Note 7 is actually so good that people are practically risking their safety for it. “That people are not abandoning the Note 7 speaks volumes about the excitement and dedication to that device. Note 7 was in a class by itself, light years better than anything from Apple. Too bad the battery was problematic,” says commenter Eric_SB. “I guess it’s clear that Samsung just made a phone that’s so far ahead people are willing to risk their safety then downgrade to another android device or Apple offering,” says Jean Robert Marc. One company who certainly isn’t pouring tears over Samsung’s woes is Apple, who has been selling a lot of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus units despite both not being huge upgrades. Fortune has the news. “The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus combined accounted for 43% of total iPhone sales in the U.S. last quarter, despite only being available for two weeks during the period, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) said on Thursday.” The article adds that many thought the lack of a headphone jack would cause poor sales for the iPhone 7, but that just hasn’t happened. Perhaps the iPhone 7 wouldn’t have sold that well if people still had the option of buying the Galaxy Note 7. PC Magazine is just one of many sources that talks about how the the Note 7’s demise is adding to Apple’s fire. The article talks mostly about how Samsung tried to obey the “thin before everything” mantra, and instead, got burned. Columnist Sascha Segan notes that it’s just too difficult to fit a battery cell with the capacity Samsung sought into the space Samsung provided for it. Samsung and Apple kept chasing each other in order to make the thinnest smartphone, and it ended up that Samsung lost the battle in a way that is extremely damaging. The Google Pixel is said to be a great alternative to the Note 7 or iPhone 7. [Image by Ramin Talaie/Getty Images] However, another phone that will certainly benefit from the demise of the Note 7 is the new Google Pixel. CNET says the Pixel is pure Android at its absolute best. “If you’re wary of Samsung or looking for a worthy iPhone alternative, the Google Pixel is the high-end Android phone to get.” The review adds that the Google Pixel has a great camera that takes great pictures in low light. CNET also likes the design and the fact that Google Assistant has a human approach when answering your voice. They don’t like the fact that the Pixel is dim when in direct sunlight and that the phone is very expensive when compared to others. Did you trade your Galaxy Note 7 in? If so, did you get an iPhone or another device? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section.

Print Email Dan Duggan | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Dan Duggan | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 23, 2016 at 3:33 PM, updated October 23, 2016 at 3:54 PM comments LONDON — Giants rookie cornerback Eli Apple is an awkward position. Apple's mother, Annie, has been highly critical of Giants co-owner John Mara's handling of the Josh Brown domestic violence situation. So, does Apple side with his mother or his boss? "I know she's very vocal about that type of situation and that topic is very important to her, so I can understand where she was coming from," Apple said after the Giants' 17-10 win over the Rams at Twickenham Stadium. "At the same time, I know in my position I've just got to understand that I've just got to do my part and just play football and do what I can do." Annie criticizes Mara Of course, that's not easy for Apple when his mother writes a column on SI.com that says Mara was "insensitive, dismissive and callous" when he spoke on Thursday about Brown's history of domestic violence. While it's certainly uncomfortable to have your mother publicly rip your boss, Apple doesn't expect any negative repercussions from the Giants. Breaking down Giants' win over Rams "I don't think so at all," Apple said. "I think we're good on that front. I talked to them and let them know my mom's reactions sometimes are like that. She's her own person and she's going to do that. I have no control, so I've just got to do my job and that's just play football." Apple wouldn't specify who within the organization he spoke to about his mother's criticisms. "I just made sure I talked to everybody and let them know; whoever was concerned," Apple said. Annie Apple worked as a writer/producer for national news programs on NBC and CNN before Eli reached the NFL. She has since landed gigs with ESPN and SI.com after drawing attention with her social media missives about her son's journey to the NFL. Apple wasn't surprised by his mother's column after he read some of her tweets after Mara's radio interview on Thursday evening. "She has a voice and she's going to use it no matter what," Apple said. "I love her for that. She's a unique woman and she's always going to speak up no matter what. I can't really control that, so I've just got to do what I can do and that's just play football." Annie sounds off Apple, who grew up in Voorhees, N.J., said he hasn't spoken to his mother about her criticism of Mara. "I tried. She's a little upset at everybody right now," Apple said. "I'm probably just going to give her her space a little bit. Hopefully she feels better after this W." Domestic violence is a particularly sensitive issue for Annie, who was in an abusive relationship in her late teens. She finally left the abuser while she was pregnant with Eli in 1995. "I understand my mom's history and growing up that was tough for her and me and the rest of the family," Apple said. "So I understand where she's coming from. All I can do is just try to be supportive of her a little bit and don't get on her too much." Apple said the Brown situation and his mother's subsequent criticism of the Giants hasn't changed his view of the organization. "I'm just here to play football," said Apple, who had three tackles in Sunday's win. "The Giants organization, to me, is a great organization. I'm thankful for the opportunity they gave me and I just want to continue to give back to them and play hard." Dan Duggan may be reached at dduggan@njadvancemedia.com.

The iPhone’s frenetic Chinese growth powered a 33 percent rise in revenue, to $50 billion in the three-month period ending June 27. Marginally softened forecasts for the next few months nevertheless knocked some $50 billion off Apple’s value. Limited information about Watch sales also disappointed. A little patience, however, will go a long way. By Robert Cyran Robert Cyran, U.S. tech columnist, joined Breakingviews in London in 2003 and moved four years later to New York, where he continues to cover global technology, pharmaceuticals and special situations. Robert began his career at Forbes magazine, where he assisted in the start-up of the international version of the magazine. Before working at Breakingviews he worked as a market researcher and reporter covering the pharmaceutical industry. Robert has a Masters degree in economics from Birmingham University and an undergraduate degree from George Washington University. Sales generated in the Middle Kingdom doubled in the latest quarter. The country now represents more than a quarter of the company’s revenue. The biggest driver was iPhones, as more Android users switched to Apple. It hasn’t quelled concerns about China’s slowing economic growth and intensifying competition in the smartphone market. Such devices are, after all, luxury goods for many consumers. And Apple, now with over $200 billion of cash on its balance sheet, is mostly a one-trick pony. The iPhone accounts for 63 percent of revenue and even more of profit. If Chinese demand slows, the gallop will slow to a trot. Chief Executive Tim Cook’s decision to husband detail on Watch sales didn’t help. Apple said it was for competitive reasons. Disappointing sales is more likely the cause. Although the Watch surpassed the iPhone and iPad launches – suggesting at least 3.3 million of them were sold – the company also said revenue from its newest gizmo more than offset falling iPod and accessory sales. It’s not the ringing endorsement Apple devotees desired. It’s nevertheless premature to write off the Watch. Apple has had slow-burning hits in the past. In the first full quarter the iPod was available, the company only sold 57,000 of them. It may take a little longer for users and developers to optimize the modern timepiece. In any case, its significance will remain marginal for a while given the iPhone’s dominance. The next quarter could be tough, as the product cycle causes prospective customers to bide their time until the next iteration, perhaps in the fall. If history is any guide, it probably means the following quarter will be a blockbuster. Cook is also confident China will be the company’s biggest market, implying 50 percent sales growth there. Investors would do well to synchronize their pace with Apple’s. – This article was first published by Reuters Related Posts Robert Mugabe’s Zanu PF abuses history No one denies the importance of history to any society. But history can be both a distractive and destructive weapon.

Is Losing Market Share in China The Motley Fool 10/23/2016 Ashraf Eassa © Provided by Fool Apple Store Shanghai Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) CEO Tim Cook has been quite vocal about the company's iPhone opportunity in China. Indeed, back in 2013, he went on record with a prediction that, at some point down the line, China would become its largest market by revenue. During the iPhone 6 cycle, Apple saw tremendous growth in China, with sales surging a whopping 84% year over year. However, during the iPhone 6s cycle, Apple has seen its sales performance disappoint, as the table below shows: Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 105.71 -2.72 -2.51% Qualcomm Inc QCOM ▼ 65.93 -0.95 -1.42%   FY2015 (billions) FY2014 (billions) % Change FQ1  $18.373 $16.144 13.8 FQ2  $12.486 $16.823 (25.8) FQ3 $8.848 $13.230 (33.1) Based on these numbers, it's clear that Apple lost significant market share in China over the last couple of quarters. And if new research from UBS (via CNBC) is to be believed, the iPhone 7 isn't helping to turn things around in that region. Indeed, UBS' Steve Milunovich says that "iPhone 7 sales are weaker than the 6s was out of the box." The culprit behind that underperformance? The analyst says that Apple is "losing share to domestic handsets." This isn't too surprising The problem that Apple faces in China is simple to understand: Apple's products are generally very good and the company's brand is quite strong. However, many of these China-based smartphone makers are managing to deliver products that are very similar in terms of performance and features to what Apple is selling at just a fraction of the price. Take, for example, the Xiaomi Mi5 smartphone that launched earlier this year. The phone comes with a Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) Snapdragon 820 processor, a 1920-by-1080-pixel display, pleasing aesthetics, and so on. In China, the phone starts at the equivalent of just (approximately) $261, per AnandTech. And Xiaomi isn't the only one. There are many brands in the region that put out some very compelling smartphones at extremely low prices. This is the reality that Apple must deal with. How can Apple compete more effectively? There's no beating around the bush here: Apple has a very serious competitive problem in China, and if it wants its revenue from the region to resume growth, it's going to need to improve its competitive positioning in the market. Apple can do this in one of two ways. The first is that it can work to build products so compelling, so differentiated that these local players can't easily build similar phones and sell them for relatively bargain-basement prices. Apple's phones are already differentiated in several key ways, but based on the comments from UBS, it's apparently not enough to fend off those competitive threats. Apple may simply need to further step up its pace of innovation here, particularly in terms of the look and feel of future devices. Another way that Apple could compete is to simply drop prices. However, this isn't a desirable option for a few obvious reasons, including: Apple would essentially be trading average selling prices for revenue, which could ultimately wind up being profit-neutral at best and profit-eroding at worst. Apple can't just cut prices significantly in one region without slashing them elsewhere. Gaining share in China probably wouldn't be worth it if the company wound up needlessly reducing its profits in other regions. Apple's competition can cut prices, too. Slashing prices is a terrible way to try to drive business, and should only be used as a last-ditch effort by struggling companies. It's much better to try to increase the value delivered with each product while keeping average selling prices flat or up rather than cutting prices. It will be interesting to hear Apple's views on the China market when the company hosts its next earnings call, scheduled for Oct. 25.

CDT October 23, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Harry Potter, Anthony Bourdain, Superman, Bill Simmons and Charles Barkley are all going to work for a phone company. AT&T’s planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner, the New York-based company that owns HBO, CNN, TNT and Warner Bros. film studio, is a huge domino falling in the content business. The deal, which creates a media powerhouse and comes with promises of innovation and cost-savings, will make competitors in the wireless and Internet space like T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon uneasy. The move could also set off a new wave of telecommunications companies and Internet giants, such as Google and Apple, buying or making deals with popular content programmers, further blurring the boundaries among the industries. In fact, Apple has been rumored for months to be a potential acquirer of Time Warner. And Google's interest in buying more premium entertainment content, such as the right to stream NFL games, has been widely reported. Other cable network operators that also could be potential takeover targets, to name a few, include: AMC Networks, best-known for its top-rated TV show The Walking Dead but which also owns BBC America and SundanceTV; and Discovery Communications, which owns and operates Discovery Channel, The Learning Channel, Animal Planet and OWN, in a joint venture network with Oprah Winfrey. The merger, which marries partners in distribution and content, will surely trigger multiple layers of complexity for customers, industry regulators, investors and consumer watchdogs as they sort out revenue possibilities and conflicts of interest. But competitors of Time Warner or AT&T can no longer to afford to stand by idly. Time Warner’s Chairman and CEO Jeff Bewkes intimated as much, saying the deal was partly to get ahead of competitors. “You’re going to see all kinds of distributors following,” he said in a press conference call with reporters Saturday night. “And you’re going to see a kind of revolution in the TV world.” Telecom providers have been shopping for content companies to acquire as their wireless smartphone and broadband Internet service markets mature. "As upside from data usage seems to be increasingly capped, we would not be surprised if other distributors were to potentially embrace larger opportunities in the content arena over time," said Barclays Equity Research analysts Kannan Venkateshwar and Amir Rozwadowski in a recent note to investors. Ownership of Time Warner’s content – including Harry Potter movies, DC Entertainment films, whose franchises include Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman, CNN, NBA basketball on TNT, MLB baseball on TBS, and HBO’s critically acclaimed shows, like Game of Thrones -- guarantees that AT&T can make those programs available on its DirecTV satellite TV service. AT&T can also stream those shows to its Net-delivered and wireless DirecTV-branded streaming services in the works. AT&T bought DirecTV last year for $48.5 billion. With more consumers streaming on their mobile devices, Bewkes, whose company had been wooed by others, pulled the trigger on the deal largely because he was drawn to the idea of delivering his content to consumers on “a multiplatform basis,” he said. Beyond that, AT&T also gets revenue by licensing those movies and TV series to other pay-TV providers and subscription Net TV services such as Netflix.  "Video and entertainment will remain the key driver for the future of consumer-oriented services," said Brett Sappington, senior director of research at Parks Associates. "Video, virtual reality, and other entertainment experiences are data hungry. They will be the experiences that push consumers to higher tiers of broadband or mobile data." Owning content also helps pay-TV providers to avoid costly conflicts over the escalating prices they pay to carry programming, he said. "With content costs continuing to increase, operators are expecting more such conflicts in the future. So, ensuring access to popular content certainly helps AT&T," Sappington said. Moreover, Time Warner's networks, particularly HBO and TNT, fetch some of the highest fees for pay-TV providers. After closing the acquisition, AT&T-DirecTV will not have to pay for Time Warner's content and will be in position to dictate the financial and legal terms of Time Warner's negotiations with other cable competitors. Comcast's acquisition of NBC Universal in 2011 foreshadowed AT&T-Time Warner deal. And regulators’ approval of the deal and Comcast’s continued profitability from its business diversity have emboldened its pay-TV competitors. Since then, Comcast also acquired DreamWorks Animation in April for $3.8 billion. Verizon's announced July purchase of Yahoo for $4.83 billion -- and its May 2015 $4.4 billion deal for AOL -- involved content, as well as Internet advertising, making it "a case of buying what it needed to better monetize the data its network produces," said analyst Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research. "Any media company without a controlling shareholder and other than Disney (because of size) could be a target," Wieser said. CBS and Viacom, despite the recent turmoil surrounding management, could be targets. The controlling shareholders of both companies – principally, billionaire media mogul Sumner Redstone and his daughter, Shari Redstone – have called on the two companies to merge. With a combined market cap of more than $40 billion, a CBS-Viacom would hold not only CBS' various networks including Showtime, but also Viacom's assets such as Paramount, BET, Comedy Central, MTV and VH1. If the merger occurs, it would possess the No. 1 primetime broadcast network and collectively the most number of cable TV viewers. Other standalone media companies, such as AMC, Discovery and Scripps, which owns HGTV and Food Network, will be constant subjects of merger speculation. Meanwhile, Time Warner, until the acquisition is closed, could continue to be the subject of a possible bidding war. But only a few companies have the financial wherewithal to pull it off. "It seems unlikely at the price AT&T is offering,” Wieser said. As the telecom-media landscape turns, regulators will have their hands full. AT&T's Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson told reporters that he doesn't see difficulty in passing regulatory muster since he's buying a "supplier," or in business parlance, a deal of "vertical integration." Anti-trust regulators have been typically more concerned with horizontal integration deals, in which a company buys a rival and gain greater market share. Still, given the size of the deal, regulators will hardly rubber-stamp their approval. They did put some conditions on Comcast's acquisition of NBC Universal -- a similar case of vertical integration -- and the same would likely happen here, Sappington says. "The fact that AT&T is not one of the two largest pay-TV providers in the U.S. market will help," he said. "It makes it more difficult for opponents to claim a monopolistic advantage for AT&T in this merger."

NEW YORK: Chinese consumers spent $1.7 billion on Apple-sanctioned mobile apps in the third quarter of this year. That is about 15 per cent higher than the Americans' spend of nearly $1.45 billion during the same period, a report said. According to mobile analytics and research firm App Annie, the US market had led in Apple app store spending since 2010. "In Q3 2016, Chinese consumers spent more than five times the amount they spent just two years prior in the iOS App Store. Furthermore, revenue growth is set to continue, with China projected to drive the largest absolute revenue growth for any country by 2020," technology website Fortune quoted App Annie's report as saying. More Chinese consumers are buying mobile video games than ever, specifically those considered to be "multiplayer collaborative games" which people can play with or against other users. The report pointed out that blockbuster augmented reality (AR) mobile game Pokemon Go reached $600 million in sales "faster than any app to date". "Pokemon Go was not significantly borrowing time from other games or apps. Rather, its innovative AR gameplay and iconic IP were compelling enough to convince users to spend more time overall on their mobile devices," the report noted. After video games, Chinese consumers are heavy buyers of entertainment and video-streaming apps. Apple recently announced it would open a research and development centre in Shenzhen -- the hardware manufacturing hub for the world. It is the second research and development centre in China announced by the Cupertino-based tech giant lately. "We are excited to open a new research and development centre here next year so our engineering team can work even more closely and collaboratively with our manufacturing partners," an Apple spokesperson told Quartz. Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly met government officials to formally announce the new centre. In May, Apple invested $1 billion into Didi Chuxing, China's biggest ride-hailing platform. Apple and Chinese bank card association UnionPay Shoppers also launched Apple Pay earlier this year. Cook last year said China would be Apple's largest market within two years and that the number of Apple stores in China would almost double to 40 within that time frame.

(Photo: Kena Krutsinger, Getty Images) LONDON — New York Giants rookie Eli Apple defended his mother’s right to criticize the organization’s handling of the Josh Brown domestic violence controversy but steered clear of diving into the saga himself. Annie Apple continued her criticism of Giants owner John Mara in a letter published on Sunday by SI.com. That followed a series of tweets she had published, speaking out about the way Mara handled the case of Brown in the wake of documents that detailed the kicker’s abuse of his ex-wife, Molly. “That topic is very important to her, so I can understand where she is coming from,” Eli Apple told USA TODAY Sports following his team’s 17-10 victory over the Los Angeles Rams at Twickenham Stadium. USA TODAY Eli Apple's mom criticizes Giants owner John Mara for abuse remarks in letter “But at the same time, I know in my position. I have just got to understand that I’ve got to do my part, play football and do what I do. ... She has a voice, and she is going to use it no matter what. I love her for that, she is a unique woman, and she is going to speak up no matter what. and I can’t really control it.” Annie Apple, a former domestic violence victim, described Mara’s comments about Brown — they claimed the Giants were seeking further information before making a decision on the player’s future — as “insensitive, dismissive and callous.” She continued: “Mr. Mara’s comments were unapologetically wrong and hit at a raw place.” Eli Apple said that his mother had not informed him she was preparing to have a public letter published, but that he suspected the issue may gather steam once he saw her initial social media messages. USA TODAY Giants owner John Mara: Josh Brown 'certainly' told us he abused wife “I guess when I saw a couple of tweets, I was like ‘OK ...,' " he said. “And then I saw a couple more, and I was like, ‘She might go and (say something),’ and I was like 'Damn.’ “But she is her own person. She went through something that is tough for her and me and the rest of the family. All I can do is be supportive of her. We are good on that front.” Apple claimed he had spoken to several members of the Giants organization to discuss his mother’s remarks, and that team personnel were understanding. “We are good on that front,” he added. 123 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE

[Via MerlinFTP Drop]  (Photo: Chris Ratcliffe, Bloomberg) But given the size of the deal, regulators will hardly rubber-stamp their approval. They did put some conditions on Comcast's acquisition of NBC Universal -- a similar case of vertical integration -- and the same would likely happen here, Sappington says. "The fact that AT&T is not one of the two largest pay-TV providers in the U.S. market will help," he said. "It makes it more difficult for opponents to claim a monopolistic advantage for AT&T in this merger." The presidential election also could be a variable. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he'd oppose the merger, if elected, saying "deals like this destroy democracy."

We sell refurbished phones, all quality assured by professionals to guarantee they're in impeccable working order, and all at great prices. Wait...does 'refurbished phones' mean 'broken phones'? No, not one bit. Most refurbished stock is due to change-of-mind returns. If a customer sends a handset back within their cooling off period, they can't be sold "as-new". Occasionally we get sent handsets sent to us because of slight cosmetic flaws, but everything is still assessed by experts and all faults are fixed. Whether you're looking for a new mobile phone or iPad, or thinking about switching to a Samsung mobile phone, you can guarantee that everything on our site is in perfect working order. Also, unlike some other sites that sell refurbished mobile phones, all our products are network unlocked. Because of the nature of refurbished mobile phones, your product will most likely get to you in a plain box, rather than branded Apple iPhone or Samsung handset boxes. However, the refurbished products themselves are as good as indistinguishable from new. So, what's the difference? Well, you tell us. That's exactly it! Put a refurbished mobile phone next to a new mobile phone and there's very little to choose between them, save the price tag, and the box. You're still getting incredible tech, a full guarantee, and change left over. Are iPhones still expensive? For years now, Apple has been at the forefront of exciting technological development, beautiful design, and a company ethos that's got the world in the palm of its hands. Of course, their products are pricier as a result. However, the same rules apply with Apple as with other handsets - by picking up a refurbished iPhone or a refurbished iPad, you can get the most recent models without breaking the bank. The same is true with Samsung. Samsung have really upped their game in recent years - Android's operating system has come on leaps and bounds, with many preferring it over Apple, and products like the Samsung Galaxy and Galaxy Edge have been rightly applauded. If you were thinking of switching from Apple to Android, or vice-versa, buying a refurbished phone at a lower price may be the perfect option. Older models Maybe you're thinking, "Hey, I don't need the latest model, I just need to phone, text, and use the internet." If that sounds like you, previous iPhones and Samsung models are available refurbished at an even lower price - they're still great technology, and you've got a guarantee they work perfectly. So what are you waiting for? We get it. You want the most recent tech, you want an upgrade, you want a great looking iPhone, tablet, whatever! You don't want to pay full price, or you can't pay full price. This is the best solution. You get a three month guarantee, a great bit of kit, and you get to save some cash. Browse our models to see what's we can offer; ordering couldn't be easier! We are the UK largest cheapest refurbished mobiles provider In the event that you favor the most recent tech, however would prefer not to pay the maximum, and then look at our renovated bargains.

The Korean brand was well ahead of the second-best brand with a big margin of 33.3 per cent. Nokia came in second at 27 per cent, Apple at 13.6 per cent and Blackberry at 1.8 per cent. The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority, or TRA, has revealed trends monitored in the second quarter ended June 30 on the nation's most popular mobile phone handsets, social networking platforms and application websites. The TRA's report reveals the market share of mobile phones in the UAE by manufacturer and model. While the report does not focus solely on smartphones, it is notable that during the second quarter, 77.8 per cent of all handsets registered on the UAE's networks were smartphones. The top five handsets in use during the period were Apple iPhone 6 with a penetration rate of 4.17 per cent, followed by Nokia 108 which had 2.99 per cent market share. Samsung Galaxy J100H/J1 had a lower penetration rate of 2.45 per cent followed by Apple iPhone 6S at 2.32 per cent and Apple iPhone 5S at 2.29 per cent. During the period, users of smartphones and fixed Internet services in the UAE visited various applications websites. Samsung Apps Store was by far the most visited applications website, followed by Apple iTunes and Android Applications. In terms of social media, UAE smartphone and fixed Internet users made 24 billion visits to social networking websites during the period from April 1, to June 30. Visits to Facebook accounted for 90.39 per cent of total visits to social networking sites, followed by Twitter with 5.18 per cent of visits, and LinkedIn, MySpace and Maktoob. - haseeb@khaleejtimes.com Share More > Vote MORE FROM Business Telecom Samsung trumps Apple in popularity on UAE turf One third of all handsets registered on UAE networks during Q2 were...

By Aaron Brown Aaron Brown PUBLISHED: 09:47, Sun, Oct 23, 2016 | UPDATED: 11:46, Mon, Oct 24, 2016 Apple has included a useful one-handed keyboard in every iPhone since the introduction of iOS 8 back in September 2014, according to iOS developer Steve Troughton-Smith. The hidden Apple keyboard is designed to make typing easier for those with small hands and large-screen iPhones. The keyboard shifts the individual keys across to one-side of the display to make one-handed typing much easier. The little-known Apple keyboard is designed to make reaching across the 5.5inch display more comfortable. Unfortunately, there is a major problem with this keyboard – you’ll never be able to use it. APPLE • TWITTER • STEVE TROUGHTON-SMITHThe hidden keyboard shifts the QWERTY keys to one-side of the screen to make typing easier According to iOS developer Steve Troughton-Smith, Apple has included the helpful one-handed keyboard in the iPhone operating system since 2014, but has never allowed customers to access it. Apple billed iOS 8 as the “biggest change to iOS since the introduction of the App Store” when it launched in September 2014. iOS 8 launched alongside the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus – the first Apple smartphone with a 5.5inch display, so it would make sense for the US technology company to design a keyboard to help those with smaller hands. What makes less sense, is why Apple never decided to make the keyboard available to iPhone owners. Today's fun hack (been there since at least iOS 8); the iOS keyboard has an unused left/right one-handed mode. Activated by edge-swipe pic.twitter.com/zIk7x7CVmu— Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) October 19, 2016 Steve Troughton-Smith claims the only way to access the secret Apple keyboard is to jailbreak your iPhone. However this will void your Apple warranty – so we really wouldn’t recommend attempting it. According to Apple’s website, “iOS is designed to be reliable and secure from the moment you turn on your device. Built-in security features protect against malware and viruses and help to secure access to personal information and corporate data. “Unauthorised modifications to iOS (also known as "jailbreaking") bypass security features and can cause numerous issues to the hacked iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.

Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Oct 23, 2016 at 11:40AM In early 2015, as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was basking in the massive success of the iPhone 6, investors started to learn about the next market Apple planned to disrupt: the car. Details began to leak out about "Project Titan," an Apple product development team that was working on an electric -- and possibly autonomous -- car to rival Tesla Motors' (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles. However, Apple executives finally seem to have recognized the inevitable: It probably doesn't make sense for the tech giant to get into auto manufacturing. Apple is no longer planning to build its own car. Image source: Apple. Apple is still working to develop an autonomous driving platform. The difference is that now, executives are leaning toward partnering with traditional automakers to bring it to market. This represents a much more promising opportunity for Apple and one far better aligned with its strengths. A failure of leadership? Last week, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Alex Webb broke the story about Apple scaling back its car ambitions. They painted a picture of upheaval among the Project Titan team, with various managers bickering about how to proceed. "It was an incredible failure of leadership," according to one of Bloomberg's sources. Longtime Apple executive Bob Mansfield made the final decision to turn the project's focus away from bringing a car to market and toward developing autonomous technology. Mansfield returned to full-time status and took control of Apple's automotive efforts a few months ago, after several years of semi-retirement. Whatever the backstory, hundreds of people from the roughly 1,000-member Project Titan team have left in the past few months. Some left voluntarily, while others were cut because they were working on auto development activities that don't fit with the group's new focus. However, the team's size has stayed roughly constant as Apple hires new talent to help it develop autonomous driving capabilities. Building a car never made much sense A year and a half ago, I warned investors that the Apple car hype was mostly wishful thinking by Wall Street analysts. Automakers tend to have very low profit margins, despite enjoying an average transaction price of more than $30,000 in the U.S. An electric, autonomous car meeting Apple's high quality standards would clearly cost a lot more to build than a traditional vehicle. To generate a healthy profit margin for Apple, it would likely have to command Tesla-like prices of close to $100,000, at least initially. That means the addressable market was never as big as some Apple bulls seemed to think. Apple's only real competitive advantages in auto manufacturing would be its strong brand and ability to offer deep integration with the rest of the Apple ecosystem. Yet premium automakers such as Tesla, BMW, and Mercedes have very strong brands of their own. Meanwhile, Apple could offer a lot of the ecosystem benefit just by partnering with automakers, rather than wading into auto manufacturing itself. Apple would have faced off against many strong brands in the auto market. Image source: Mercedes-Benz. On the flip side, Apple would have remained at a disadvantage relative to traditional automakers in terms of purchasing scale and manufacturing expertise. Even Tesla will have a few years of high-volume production under its belt by the time an Apple car would have hit the market. Software is one of Apple's biggest strengths If Project Titan suffered a failure of leadership, it was that executives weren't quicker to reject the idea of building a car from scratch. Superior software and user interface design is what sets Apple apart from its competitors. By working to develop an autonomous driving platform -- a combination of sensors to provide data about the external environment, software to decipher that data, and a clean user interface -- Apple is now playing to its strengths. If Apple can deliver a good system, it won't have trouble lining up automaker partners. Even with its new focus, Apple may never develop a commercially viable platform for autonomous vehicles. After all, Apple's long-acknowledged interest in building a TV -- a much simpler endeavor -- has not borne fruit. However, Apple has a much higher probability of capturing a portion of the multitrillion-dollar automotive value chain with its new strategy. And if its efforts fail, the financial ramifications will be a lot less significant than if Apple had tried to develop a car from scratch.

Noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities predicts that the revamped MacBook Pro lineup is going to come with a “MagSafe-like” USB-C adapter. Kuo predicted in a note to investors that this new adapter will either by introduced by Apple or a third-party but holds firm on the possibility that the revamped MacBook Pro will feature a USB Type-C port for charging and data transfer instead of a MagSafe port found on previous MacBooks. Apple made the shift to USB Type-C for its notebooks with the 12 inch MacBook last year. The analyst also predicts that the new MacBook Pro lineup is going to be powered by Intel Skylake processors and options will include up to 2TB of SSD storage. Screen resolutions are said to be identical to existing MacBook Pro models. Previous rumors suggest that the new MacBook Pro models will also feature an OLED touch bar, a fingerprint sensor, new keyboard with butterfly mechanism, and Thunderbolt 3. Apple is not expected to announce new iMacs at this event, but who knows what’s going to happen until the company officially announces its new products on October 27th. Fingers crossed!

Her son was picked 10th overall, and she has been an NFL media mainstay ever since. As it turns out, she’s a more essential voice than we ever could’ve known. On Thursday Apple tweeted her staunch disapproval of Giants owner John Mara’s callous remarks regarding his kicker, Josh Brown, who admitted to serial domestic violence against his wife. As a domestic violence survivor, reading these Mara comments makes me sad, angry and completely baffled. He just doesn't get it. This is sad — Annie Apple (@SurvivinAmerica) October 20, 2016 Many NFL and Giants fans expressed their support and their agreement that the league must finally answer for this egregious behavior. But as is always the case with the internet, there were also plenty of detractors; users who lambasted Apple for the supposed hypocrisy of criticizing her son’s employer. Yeah, she wasn’t having any of that. In a heart-wrenching column for Sports Illustrated, published Sunday morning while the Giants and her son played a football game across the Atlantic in London, Apple doubled-down on her criticism of John Mara and the NFL at large. “The comments made by John Mara, owner of the New York Giants, were insensitive, dismissive and callous, wrote Apple. “How are you a so-called champion of domestic violence but lack basic compassion for a victim? Yes, this man signs my son’s checks as I’ve been reminded on Twitter. Mr. Mara owns the New York Giants. He doesn’t own Annie Apple. Wrong is wrong. And Mr. Mara’s comments were unapologetically wrong and hit at a raw place.” Apple nailed it, and while she isn’t the only one expressing this sentiment, she is the only one with a widely-read platform that also happens to be the mother of the Giants most recent first-round draft pick. She went on to detail her horrific, extensive experience with life-threatening domestic violence, and what it took for her to finally escape the nightmare that she lived for years. “I may not recall all the many other violent episodes of abuse but I will never forget the day I finally left: Sunday, Feb. 12, 1995… He was upstairs being verbally abusive; so I decided to come downstairs to wait on my ride. When he came downstairs, he said something to me and I did not respond. I didn’t want to say anything that would set him off because you’re made to feel you’re the cause of your own suffering. He grabbed my head and banged it against the wall, leaving a dent in the drywall. I saw my two little boys looking at me with fear in their eyes. It tore my soul to the core.  Something in me broke. I knew today would be the last day… Even if I didn’t know I deserved better, I knew my kids did… …I told this female minister what was happening to me, that I was leaving him. I will never forget her response. She told me I was lucky to have a man and who else would want me with three kids. I asked her to take me to my mom’s house. She did. I ran up to my old room and I cried. Six months later I had Eli. I never looked back. I never went back.” There is a large portion of our society that believes Apple should be grateful to the Maras for “giving her son a chance” at the kind of life most kids dream of. But what I know, as a woman and a daughter, is that there is one person who is responsible for giving her son the chance at the life he has now: Annie Apple. She is a woman that is unencumbered by the outdated notion that a paycheck from the great National Football League somehow strips her of her right to free speech. What a revelation! The importance of Apple refusing to cow-tow to the NFL’s public relations machine cannot be overstated. The NFL has gotten away with a lot over the years; just as any corporation with that much money and influence generally does. They silenced doctors and former players who claimed for years that CTE and concussion-related illnesses were a real problem. Not only did the NFL was willfully ignore the truth, they simultaneously participated in dangerous practices that led to more injuries and more brain damage. They did not stop until the bubble burst and they could no longer realistically ignore the science, and the word of mouth that the new digital age facilitates. They are now doing the exact same thing with the systemic issue of domestic violence perpetrated by their football players. And countless victims – wives, girlfriends and others – are silenced out of fear and belief that they have no shot of going up against the NFL. Can you blame them? It’s the same league that tried to protect an angry and violent Ray Rice by deliberately refusing to watch video evidence of him beating his fiance and dragging her by her hair out of an elevator. Apple having the courage to speak out against Mara and the league does not make her a hypocrite, nor does it make her disloyal or ungrateful. Apple’s words are a battle cry for change, and with any luck, her voice is one that the NFL can’t ignore. tags: domestic violence Eli Apple New York Giants NFL Roger Goodell Tweet More from SportsGrid Josh Brown Is Proof That The NFL Will Never Take Domestic Violence Seriously Eli Apple’s Mom Crushes Giants Owner For Handling Of Kicker’s Domestic Violence Reveal Annie Apple Isn’t Letting Eli Apple Hog Her Spotlight, Joins ESPN Sunday Countdown NOT BUYING IT: Ray Rice Wants To Join NFL Team So He Can “End It The Right Way” NFL Concludes “Investigation” Of Peyton Manning, Internet Is Suspicious The Hype Is Real For Jets-Giants Preseason Game Tanya Ray Fox Tanya Ray Fox is a sportswriter and producer who has worked for nearly 7 years in both digital and television sports media.

Since the debut of the iOS App Store, the company’s made every effort to keep its wares “family friendly” (read: porn free), often employing a very, very broad definition of what, exactly, constitutes porn. But as iOS has moved more and more into the health space, Apple’s had to contend with the reality that sex isn’t just some seedy business it can push into the corner, but instead an integral, and unavoidable, part of healthy human life. And that’s starting to change the way the company interacts with sex… at least a little bit, anyway. Case in point: take a look at how HealthKit handles sex. Initially, the combination of health tracking app and developer tools was completely sex free, refusing to even acknowledge the existence of menstruation. After pushback from angry female users (who reminded Apple that, even though it involves a vagina, menstruation isn’t some pervy thrill), the Health app was updated to sync with period tracking and fertility apps. In its current iteration, it even allows users to track their sexual activity. Yes, your HealthKit is also a HumpKit. At first glance, the sexual activity tracking function appears to be extremely limited. As one iPhone user noted, it only integrates with period tracking and fertility apps (in spite of the fact that there are plenty of apps specifically designed to track sexual activity itself). Viewed this way, the Health app assumes that boning is purely about reproduction—whether you’re trying to get pregnant, or trying to avoid it—and the only people who need to keep track of when and how and with whom they’re doing the dirty are people at risk of getting pregnant. The updated Health app has more options for reproductive health. But there’s more to Apple’s sexual activity tracker than just app integration. Users have the ability to manually input every time they get down and dirty (noting date, time, and whether or not protection was used), allowing users to create a calendar of when, and how, they’re having sex. While this may seem like nothing more than a virtual bedpost for would-be Casanovas to etch notches into, it’s actually a great step forward for sexual health tracking—and, hopefully, for the tech world’s attitude towards sex. Why would Health app users want to track their sexual activity (aside from the standard baby making or baby avoiding reasons)? Well, for starters, STIs. If your latest health check up turned up a chlamydia infection, it’s helpful to have access to data that allows you to pinpoint when you may have become infected—and how many partners you may have spread that infection to. Although the app does not currently allow users to indicate who they were having sex with (perhaps due to privacy concerns, although existing sex tracking apps like Bedpost have been navigating that issue for almost a decade), having a baseline for when an infection might have occurred is at least a good start. On the flip side of the STI equation, people managing chronic STIs might want to keep tabs on their sexual activity as part of their strategy for keeping partners safe (something that would be even more useful when combined with a log of herpes outbreaks, for instance). And even users in committed, monogamous relationships where there’s zero risk of STI transmission can still find value to keeping tabs on their sexual activity. Just like mindfulness and nutrition and exercise and sleep, sex is an important part of life that has an impact on wellbeing and general health. If the frequency with which you’re having sex is affecting your stress level, or your emotional wellbeing, or your general health and happiness, that’s useful and important information to have. The sex tracker is basic, but still useful. As the app itself notes, “sexual activity can affect both physical and emotional health," and keeping track of when you’re boning can provide a better, broader understanding of what, exactly, is affecting your health. Apple has long viewed sex as something taboo—and when it comes to porn and sexual entertainment, that probably won’t change anytime soon. But the latest iteration of Health is a step in the right direction. And while it could certainly benefit from a bit of expansion—recognition of the possibility of multiple partners, a more nuanced reflection of what “protection” might mean for different users, ability to indicate a partner’s gender, just for starters—it’s still a huge step forward from a historically-sex-unfriendly company. Much as we try to deny it, sexuality is a fundamental and important part of human life. It’s wonderful to see Apple finally allowing it to be truly integrated into our tech as well.

Annie Apple recounted Sunday how a 'charismatic guy' had controlled and abused her not long after she gave birth to her first son aged 16. The abuse, she said, began when he asked her not to wear skirts unless she was with him. He beat her savagely on multiple occasions and once forced her to have an abortion. Apple and her partner got married and had a child together. The abuse kept going until Apple left while pregnant with her third son, Eli. Apple shared her story in response to Giants owner's John Mara's admission that the team knew that kicker Josh Brown had abused his wife - but not to what 'extent'. Annie Apple (pictured left with her son Eli), the mother of Giants rookie cornerback Eli Apple, on Sunday blasted comments made by team owner John Mara (right) about domestic violence Mara said the team knew that kicker Josh Brown had abused his wife but that it wasn't clear to what 'extent'. Apple blasted his remark in a tweet Friday (pictured) Apple further bashed Mara on Twitter Friday, saying that the fact that the team owner signs her son Eli's checks wouldn't keep her from speaking out 'The comments made by John Mara, owner of the New York Giants, were insensitive, dismissive and callous. How are you a so-called champion of domestic violence but lack basic compassion for a victim?' Apple asked in a first-person essay for Sports Illustrated. 'Yes, this man signs my son's checks as I've been reminded on Twitter. Mr Mara owns the New York Giants. He doesn't own Annie Apple. Wrong is wrong. And Mr Mara's comments were unapologetically wrong and hit at a raw place.' RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next NFL players' fury at the league for letting off wife abusing...

'I have physically, mentally, emotionally and verbally been a repulsive man... I have abused my wife,' Brown wrote. The couple has since divorced. The NFL placed Brown on paid suspension this week pending review of the documents in which he admitted the abuse. Apple on Thursday shared another tweet about domestic violence, reminding her followers that it is never acceptable nor justifiable She later spoke out about how difficult it is for victims of spousal abuse to come forward - a theme reflected in her personal essay published Sunday It emerged earlier this week that Giants kicker Josh Brown, 37, had written in his journals that he saw himself as 'God' and considered his wife Molly (pictured with him) his 'slave' The NFL placed Brown (pictured) on paid suspension this week pending review of the documents in which he admitted the abuse Mara told WFAN in New York on Thursday: 'He's admitted to us that he's abused his wife in the past. And I think that's what's a little unclear, is the extent of that.' The idea that there could be varying degrees of spousal abuse revolted Apple. 'The are no levels of domestic violence. It's all bad. And it's all wrong. It's a crime,' she told the New York Post. Apple, who also blasted Mara's comments on Twitter, shared her own story in detail Sunday. She met her abusive partner when she was 16, 10 months after giving birth to her first son. 'I was flattered that he took an interest in me with a kid and all. He told me how beautiful I was. But insisted that I only wear skirts when I was with him because he said I really looked great in skirts and he didn't want other guys looking at me, especially when he's not around,' she wrote. 'I thought the compliments coupled with jealously meant that he truly loved me. I didn't see it as control.' Three months later, he hit her - the first of many instances.  Apple became pregnant a few months later. The man made her have an abortion, even though she didn't want to. 'I was devastated. I had the abortion, and soon after I was depressed. I had lost myself in this idea of love and the overpowering control of this man,' she wrote. Apple graduated high school and got a scholarship to LaSalle University. She was eager to attend and dreamed of becoming a journalist. Her partner barred her from going. Apple (pictured left and right with her son) recounted in a first-person essay how she met her abusive partner aged 16, 10 months after giving birth to her first child She became pregnant again and this time refused to have an abortion. The baby, her second son, was born the day after a night of violence. Apple's placenta erupted during lunch and she needed a C-section and a blood transfusion. 'The C-section came with stomach staples and days after going home with the baby, he kicked me in my stomach, removing the staples and some stitches,' she wrote. She left, but her partner convinced her to come back by apologizing and proposing to her. The violence resumed and Apple experienced terror again. When she got pregnant a third time, the man asked her to abort. She refused, and he became more violent, telling her he wouldn't stop until she had gotten rid of the child. Apple left one day in February 1995. She gave birth to Eli, her third son, six months later. She later got married again to Tim Apple, Eli's stepfather.  Eli changed his last name from Woodward to Apple in December 2012. 'A wise man once stated, "Fatherhood is not biology. Fatherhood is responsibility," Eli said in a statement at the time. 'From the time I was 2 years old, my dad, Timothy Apple, has been my father. He's nurtured, provided and protected our family.' Apple urged readers to lend a compassionate ear to women who experience spousal abuse. 'Usually by the time you hear of a domestic violence victim, she's either dead or barely alive; the rest of us survivors have lived in terror and millions of victims continue to live in terror,' she wrote. 'Domestic violence is not about love; it's about control. If you're in a violent relationship, please get out and get help. It never gets better when you stay.'

Where text used to be bold and dark, which contrasted well with predominantly white backgrounds, now many websites are switching to light greys or blues for their type. Award winning blogger Kevin Marks, founder of Microformats and former vice president of web services at BT, decided to look into the trend after becoming concerned that his eyesight was failing because he was increasingly struggling to read on screen text. My plea to designers and software engineers: Ignore the fads and go back to the typographic principles of print.Kevin Marks He found a ‘widespread movement’ to reduce the contrast between the words and the background, with tech giants Apple, Google and Twitter all altering their typography. True black on white text has a contrast ratio of 21:1 - the maximum which can be achieved. Most technology companies agree that it is good practice for type to be a minimum of 7:1 so that the visually-impaired can still see text. But Mr Marks, found that even Apple’s own typography guidelines, which recommended 7:1 are written in a contrast ratio of 5.5:1. More elderly people are using the internet to stay in touch with relatives  Google’s guidelines also suggest a 7:1 contrast ratio, but 54 per cent opacity of display, which brings the ratio down to 4.6:1. Mr Marks, who has been named one of the Telegraph’s 50 must influential Britons in technology,  said the changes risk undermining the universal reach of the internet. “The typography choices of companies like Apple and Google set the default design of the web, and these two drivers of design are already dancing on the boundaries of legibility,” he warned on the technology site Backchannel. “If the web is relayed through text that’s difficult to read, it curtails the open access by excluding large swaths of people such as the elderly, the visually impaired, or those retrieving websites through low quality screens. “As we rely on computers not only to retrieve information but also to access and build services that are crucial to our lives, making sure that everyone can see what’s happening becomes increasingly important.” How easy-to-read is your font? The changes in typography have come about because, as web design evolved, the numbers of fonts, colours and background began to diverge from the original set of ‘web safe’ fonts which were deemed legible online. The rise in LCD technology and high definition screens has also allowed designers to use increasingly thinner fonts, which, while working on desktops, can be virtually impossible to read on smartphones or tablets. In recent years, reference guides such as the Typography Handbook have also steered designers away from too much contrast, claiming that traditional black on white typography strains the eyes, and made it difficult for people with dyslexia.   And many computers are now set to grow dimmer during the evening to avoid too much blue light after dark, which can keep people awake. But the US based Web Accessibility Initiative, which came up with the original ratio formula in 2008 to help web designers said too little contrast made web pages ‘confusing and frustrating’ Lighter fonts may work well on a high-definition desktop but not on smartphones or in brighter lighting conditions  “Choosing colours with poor contrast makes navigating, reading and interacting a real pain,” said a spokesman. “Good design means sufficient contrast between foreground and background colours. If it’s important enough to be clear. This is essential for people with low contrast sensitivity which becomes more common as we age.” But Mr Marks said that reducing the contrast risked alienating some users. “To arbitrarily throw away contrast based on a fashion that looks good on my perfect screen in my perfectly lit office is abdicating designer’s responsibilities to the very people for whom they are designing,” he said. “My plea to designers and software engineers: Ignore the fads and go back to the typographic principles of print. “You’ll be making things better for people who read on smaller, dimmer screens, even if their eyes aren’t aging like mine. It may not be trendy, but it’s time to consider who is being left out by the web’s aesthetic.” Dr Simon Harper, an experimental Computer Scientist in Human Computer Interaction and Information Systems at the University of Manchester, said: "Black text on a white background may convey a certain harshness, grey text, on the other hand, may convey a softer more friendly feeling.  "But for some, these design choices come at the cost of legibility, fatigue and comprehension. We call this a situational impairment, whereby the user is disabled by the device, design, environment, or context of use.  "Straining to see text will give many a disabling experience. In the new world of cutting edge digital design all of us will at some point become impaired.  "Making sure that controls are present to conform the design to the user, so that the user doesn't always have to conform themselves to the design - sometimes and impossible requirement, is the only viable option."

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Apple event to focus on new MacBooks, not iMac, says analyst Adam Westlake - Oct 23, 2016 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit In case you haven’t heard, Apple has one of its secretive media events scheduled for October 27th, using the phrase “Hello Again” as the teaser. For months now it’s been expected that Apple would hold such a fall event to introduce new, non-iOS related hardware, possibly including anything from the Mac lineup, from the MacBook Air to a new Mac Pro. Well, Ming-Chi Kuo, the KGI Securities analyst with one of best track records when it comes to Apple predictions, has chimed in to say that we should keep our expectations set for new laptops only. Kuo notes that the flagship unveiling will be a new MacBook Pro, touting the much rumored OLED touch bar and Touch ID sensor, along with USB-C ports. This will come in both existing sizes of 13 and 15 inches, and will include the 2015 MacBook’s new butterfly keyboard, Thunderbolt 3, SSD storage up to 2TB, and Skylake processors from Intel. Beyond the new Pro lineup, Kuo expects a refreshed “13-inch MacBook,” which will more than likely be a revamped MacBook Air instead of a slightly larger version of the 12-inch MacBook. Like the Pro, this laptop will be outfitted with USB-C, further cementing Apple’s decision to rely on the new, smaller port. There was hope that this event would also see refreshed iMacs and/or a new stand-alone Thunderbolt Display, but Kuo says that while Apple is indeed working on this hardware, they won’t be seen at Thursday’s event. Instead, he’s predicting new iMacs and a 5K Cinema Display to be announced sometime in the first half of 2017. SOURCE MacRumors Story Timeline Hated MacBook?

Skip to content I Am Jalvis Wondering? Who Is Jalvis? What Jalvis Does? Home Partner Sites Contact Blog More October 23, 2016 by vishaldutia What would you change about Apple Watch Series 2? Now that Apple Watch Series 2 is here, what do you want to see done differently for Series 3? Apple Watch Series 2 launched in September — though many people are still struggling to find them in stock before November — and it brings great new features like a brighter OLED display, full-on swim-proofing for water workouts, longer battery life, GPS for iPhone-free route tracking, and new variants like the upcoming Apple Watch Nike+. But no iteration is ever perfect, so if Apple asked you what you wanted to see in Apple Watch Series 3 hardware, what would you say? Ambient display technology so you can see the current time all the time. Thinner, so it fits under dress cuffs. Larger 46mm casing size for people who like big watches BIG. Round casing for people who don’t like square watches. Even faster Apple S3 system-in-a-package. LTE networking for true iPhone independence. Additional sensors for even better health tracking. Titanium and other new casing materials. Even more designer partnerships, like Hermès and Nike. Yeah, get more available online and in stores faster. Apple Watch Series 2 has been near-depletion since launch and that makes no one happy, not customers, not Apple Store, no one. Now on to the hardware! Personally, I’m not against a round casing but current interfaces are as poorly served by it as a Mac or your TV would be with a porthold-shaped display. If Apple ever went that way, I’d expect they’d take the time to make an interface that not only doesn’t suffer from having its corners cut off, but benefits from it in some novel way. And just because most watches used to be round doesn’t mean smart watches will be. Cars used to be shaped like carriages and phones like bananas, but new technology led to new designs. Much of this comes down to personal taste, though, and the limits of current technology. Make it thinner and you can’t fit as much battery for GPS, much less LTE. Likewise, the more you add, the hotter it gets. It all comes down to finding the right balance. So, putting all software concerns aside, If you had Jony Ive’s ear, what would you ask him to do with Apple Watch 2?

(Alyssa Schukar | AP Photo) Print Email James Kratch | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By James Kratch | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 23, 2016 at 9:50 AM, updated October 23, 2016 at 9:58 AM comments LONDON — Annie Apple, the mother of Giants rookie cornerback Eli Apple, ripped team co-owner John Mara in a column published on SI.com Sunday morning, detailing her personal history with domestic violence and calling Mara's comments about disgraced kicker Josh Brown "insensitive, dismissive and callous." "How are you a so-called champion of domestic violence but lack basic compassion for a victim? Yes, this man signs my son's checks as I've been reminded on Twitter," she writes in the column, later writing, "I am a domestic violence survivor." Giants should be embarrassed for handling of Josh Brown "Mr. Mara owns the New York Giants. He doesn't own Annie Apple. Wrong is wrong. And Mr. Mara's comments were unapologetically wrong and hit at a raw place." Annie Apple criticized Mara in a series of tweets on Thursday night, after Mara told WFAN's Mike Francesa that Brown has "admitted to us he's abused his wife in the past, but what I think is a little unclear is the extent of that." Brown has since been placed on the reserve/commissioner exempt list, putting his Giants and NFL career very much in doubt. The league was forced to make the move after police documents emerged Wednesday, first reported by NJ Advance Media, revealing that Brown offered written admissions that he abused his wife, and those admissions were obtained by police as evidence in a criminal investigation, although prosecutors ultimately declined to press charges.  "[F]or millions of women suffering abuse by someone they love, life is a daily nightmare," Apple wrote. "Domestic violence is anything but domesticated. It's a brutal, savage attack on the body, soul and psyche of the victim." The wild jerseys of London In the column, which you can read here, Annie Apple offers painful details of her own experience as a victim of domestic violence at the hands of a man who was physically violent toward her on multiple occasions, as well as forced her to have an abortion.  Apple closed her column with these words:  What victims need is for someone to stand up for them and defend them because they live defenseless lives; they need someone who will take a stand and say the violence suffered was wrong and criminal. One of the worst things you can do to a domestic violence victim or survivor is to defend the abuser. These abusive men aren't abusing the women in their lives because they're sick. These abusers are not the victims. They're abusing women because they can. These men are not beating their co-workers, neighbors, priests, doctors and teammates. They're abusing their wives and girlfriends because they can. To some with whom I've shared my story, the response is usually: "How could that have happened to you? You're so smart, strong, bubbly and outgoing." Domestic violence is perpetrated on strong women, smart women, poor women, rich women, even bubbly women. It happened to me, and every day it happens to millions of others just like me. Some have called me a distraction because speaking up for a cause the Giants have reportedly championed for years makes me a distraction. Others have called me a hero for speaking up. Honestly, I'm not a hero. I'm not special. I just know that in life, there are times when certain things are more important than your personal comfort or the game of football.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « U.S. Government Sues Two Companies for falsely using Apple & Samsung Trademarks on Products | Main | Apple's iPhone 7 was the top Smartphone in Taiwan for September in Market Share and Sales Value » October 23, 2016 Tech Companies like Apple are unlikely to Assist Europe's Call for Decryption Tools in War on Islamic Terrorism, for now   Back in August Patently Apple posted a report titled "Germany and France Join the War on Encrypted Apps Demanding Tech Companies Comply with Court Orders." Yesterday we learned by way of a Wall Street Journal report that "Anti-terror prosecutors from four nations on the front line of Europe's fight against Islamic State made an urgent plea on Friday for new tools that would allow them to crack encrypted devices and communications."   At a joint press conference in Paris, prosecutors from France, Belgium, Spain and Morocco said jihadist groups such as Islamic State are increasingly using encrypted communications to recruit young people around the world.   'More and more, we see that these applications and new technologies allowing communication with the entire world, which is undeniable progress, are being used to isolate and manipulate fragile people,' said Paris Prosecutor François Molins.   Meanwhile, the inability to access data in encrypted phones is stifling probes and undermining efforts to prevent new attacks, they said. The four prosecutors have been cooperating closely on investigations launched after the Paris attacks of Nov. 13, aiming to disrupt jihadist networks that stretch across Europe to the Middle East and North Africa. 'It's a factor that has paralyzed some investigations,' Mr. Molins said.   The appeal is part of a running battle between law-enforcement officials around the world and the technology industry over encryption, ensnaring tech giants such as Apple Inc.   In France, officials have been particularly worried about a militant named Rachid Kassim, who authorities say has used Telegram to communicate with multiple people involved in terror plots over the summer. Authorities believe Mr. Kassim gave instructions to a group of women who planted a homemade car bomb next to Notre Dame last month.   Tech companies have resisted pressure to introduce backdoors for governments to read encrypted communications and devices. They argue that the rare instances their products are used to commit terror attacks don't justify creating a potentially significant loophole that could be used to compromise their customers' privacy.   The prosecutors said they need legal means to skirt encryption as part of counterterror investigations. Javier Zaragoza, Spain's national prosecutor stated that 'The privacy of communications is not an absolute right.'"   That admission is a very revealing tactic that these prosecutors are likely to use in crafting new legislation to justify the need to demand decryption tools from tech companies in the future.   While Apple was seen as winning the first round with the FBI and DOJ on this issue of encryption, it's assured that this issue is far from over with both sides digging in deeper and preparing for round two.   What's evident is that governments including China, India and now those within the EU are considering tougher measures on smartphone OEM's and messaging app companies regarding encryption. In March, it was noted in the UK that new laws are being drafted. Government documents revealed that internet service providers and technology giants will be obliged to build secret security flaws into their technology to allow them to be accessed by police and the security services on demand.   Everyone in government understands the absolute need for encryption for apps like Apple and Google Pay to safeguard the banking industry and consumers from major hacks. Everyone understands that encryption to safeguard key infrastructure facilities with high-end encryption. That's a no-brainer. No one is arguing the essential reality of using encryption for these purposes. But private communications is a weak point in the encryption argument.   This is why Javier Zaragoza, Spain's national prosecutor stated that 'The privacy of communications is not an absolute right.'" This is where the next encryption battle will be focused on by governments worldwide.   History tells us that tapping into enemy communications won World War II by being able to decrypt German codes and enabling England and their allies, especially the U.S., to intercept German plans and tactics that were effectively sinking important supply ships from reaching Europe. Wikipedia notes that "This was considered by western Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower to have been "decisive" to the Allied victory.   The machine known as the 'Bombe' was designed to break the German's Enigma codes. This was highlighted in the 2014 film titled 'The Imitation Game.' We look back at that breakthrough as a major victory.   Wire tapping through court orders played a major role in convicting many organized crime activities over the last few decades. Breaking into communications has always been one of the top tools in law enforcement and encrypting communications now turns history of fighting an enemy on it's head.   Yet today it's all about individual freedoms and screw the consequences. Without encryption, Hillary Clinton had to bleach her 33,000 emails to hide her questionable activities from Congress. Encryption would have made it so much easier and less costly for her to hide those damming emails. Yes, and all criminals want this coveted right to block the government from accessing their email and exposing their illegal activities.     Sometimes the argument that technology companies are safeguarding our privacy just isn't true. Just think of the Yahoo hack. They couldn't save over a billion of their customers from this hack. And then they didn't even bother to tell their customers of the hack because they were afraid it could have affected their stock price. Now that the company is trying to sell itself it revealed this disaster. So it's funny that there's such disdain and distrust of the government (and rightfully so to a point) but not of tech companies who compromise our identity and private information every year.   For more proof of that just check out Fortune's report titled "Here's who's been hacked in the past two years," or another report that provides a quick and interactive means of checking out hack activities.   Though at the end of the day, no matter which side of the argument that you're on, once one world block, be it Asia, the EU or India decides to put their foot down to outlaw encrypted communication apps, it will be impossible to see how any tech company, especially Apple, could stand on principle alone and allow their shareholders to suffer losing 30% or more of their global value by not complying with new anti-encryption app laws.   With the EU thinking nothing of hammering Apple with the largest tax bill in history even with the US government warning them of retaliation, it's easy to see the EU singling out a few high tech firms including Apple and putting a legal gun to their head over encryption to make them comply.   Yet even Apple's Tim Cook has admitted that even though he views this issue to be a cancer, Apple will abide by the law at some point in time. More specifically, in February Tim Cook said at the end of an interview with ABC news, that if Congress were to pass clear new laws directing technology companies to assist the government in specific cases. then Apple would obey the law.   So it's really just a matter of time before this issue works itself through legislative bodies around the world and becomes the law of the land. This will give tech companies like Apple the ability to say to their customers that they fought the good fight but can no longer disobey the law.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

 Meet the first guy Steve Jobs ever fired at Apple ... and he wasn't even an employee Julie Bort Oct. 23, 2016, 9:00 AM 26,793 facebook linkedin twitter email print Michael Geary in 1976, when he met Steve Jobs. Michael Geary Michael Geary has been a programmer living in Silicon Valley since before the world called it Silicon Valley. And he's got some incredible stories to tell. For instance, he's pretty convinced he was the first person ever fired by Steve Jobs. He was living in Palo Alto in 1976 and shopping in a health food store. "I was a scraggly looking hippie and I ran into this guy in the produce aisle. He was a scraggly looking smelly hippie. I just introduced myself and it turned out we were both into computers," Geary told Business Insider. Jobs told him he just started a company called Apple Computer, and the name comes from "byte" as in "take a byte out of the apple, ha, ha," Geary recalled. (A byte is computer storage term.) "He and Woz were literally working on the Apple 1, literally just the two of them," and he mentioned he needed someone to do some programming for him. "He needed a disassembler for the 6502 chip," Geary said. A disassembler is a computer program that translates the chip's language into assembly language. The 6502 chips were for a new kind of computer, very small ones, not huge mainframes. Geary was working at a company doing programming on mainframes. Michael Geary today. He's still a contract programmer. Michael Geary Back in those days, it was really expensive to buy computer chips to write programs for them. But it was possible to fake having a real chip by using a software program called an emulator, which pretended to be the chip. Geary had access to a mainframe and an emulator at work, so he told Jobs, "I can do that." Geary went home and started to write the disassembler code.  "Steve called me back a few days later and said 'this dissembler, this is for a microprocessor. Your work is all with mainframes. They are nothing alike. All you know is mainframes, forget this whole thing,' " Geary recalls. "When we hung up, I was pretty disappointed. Then I thought, 'Who is this guy telling me I can’t program? I’ll show him. I’ll write a partial proof of concept and I’ll visit him and show him the code,'" Geary said. So he dug up the address to Apple Computer and just showed up there with no appointment. It turned out to be the address of an answering service. Jobs and Woz were still working in the garage. In those days, a garage startup wasn't considered a very reputable office. Apple Inc. "I said to myself, these guys are flakes! They are never going to make it. And I turned around and walked back out the door," Geary said. He stayed fired. And he was obviously wrong. Years later, Geary got asked to do a short contract job at Apple (working on an email client called Diplomat) but the signing of the contract was stalled. And at another health food store, this one in Los Gatos, California, he once again ran into Steve Jobs. Geary approached Jobs again, and they had a laugh about the first time they met. Geary didn't tell him that he wrote the program. Instead, he nudged him to sign the contract. On the following Monday it was signed, though Geary didn't interact with Jobs after that. In fact, Geary didn't see him again for many years. By that time, Jobs was ill. He was at a restaurant in Menlo Park, California, and Jobs was at the next table. "He looked like he vaguely recognized me. I didn’t want to interrupt. I should have said hello. I should have told him I did write that program. I didn’t have quite the guts to talk to him at that point," he said. Jobs passed away a short time later. "In the back of my mind, I'll always regret not talking to him that night," Geary said.

And he's got some incredible stories to tell. For instance, he's pretty convinced he was the first person ever fired by Steve Jobs. He was living in Palo Alto in 1976 and shopping in a health food store. "I was a scraggly looking hippie and I ran into this guy in the produce aisle. He was a scraggly looking smelly hippie. I just introduced myself and it turned out we were both into computers," Geary told Business Insider. Jobs told him he just started a company called Apple Computer, and the name comes from "byte" as in "take a byte out of the apple, ha, ha," Geary recalled. (A byte is computer storage term.) "He and Woz were literally working on the Apple 1, literally just the two of them," and he mentioned he needed someone to do some programming for him. "He needed a disassembler for the 6502 chip," Geary said. A disassembler is a computer program that translates the chip's language into assembly language. The 6502 chips were for a new kind of computer, very small ones, not huge mainframes. Geary was working at a company doing programming on mainframes. View photos Michael Geary.JPGMore (Michael Geary today. He's still a contract programmer.Michael Geary) Back in those days, it was really expensive to buy computer chips to write programs for them. But it was possible to fake having a real chip by using a software program called an emulator, which pretended to be the chip. Geary had access to a mainframe and an emulator at work, so he told Jobs, "I can do that." Geary went home and started to write the disassembler code.  "Steve called me back a few days later and said 'this dissembler, this is for a microprocessor. Your work is all with mainframes. They are nothing alike. All you know is mainframes, forget this whole thing,' " Geary recalls. "When we hung up, I was pretty disappointed. Then I thought, 'Who is this guy telling me I can’t program? I’ll show him. I’ll write a partial proof of concept and I’ll visit him and show him the code,'" Geary said. So he dug up the address to Apple Computer and just showed up there with no appointment. It turned out to be the address of an answering service. Jobs and Woz were still working in the garage. In those days, a garage startup wasn't considered a very reputable office. View photos steve jobs and steve wozniakMore (Apple Inc. ) "I said to myself, these guys are flakes! They are never going to make it. And I turned around and walked back out the door," Geary said. He stayed fired. And he was obviously wrong. Years later, Geary got asked to do a short contract job at Apple (working on an email client called Diplomat) but the signing of the contract was stalled. And at another health food store, this one in Los Gatos, California, he once again ran into Steve Jobs. Geary approached Jobs again, and they had a laugh about the first time they met. Geary didn't tell him that he wrote the program. Instead, he nudged him to sign the contract. On the following Monday it was signed, though Geary didn't interact with Jobs after that. In fact, Geary didn't see him again for many years. By that time, Jobs was ill. He was at a restaurant in Menlo Park, California, and Jobs was at the next table. "He looked like he vaguely recognized me. I didn’t want to interrupt. I should have said hello. I should have told him I did write that program. I didn’t have quite the guts to talk to him at that point," he said. Jobs passed away a short time later. "In the back of my mind, I'll always regret not talking to him that night," Geary said.

The new platform has been adopted by many developers, with Microsoft now adding their own iMessage app to the fray – #movie date. #movie date allows you to create sticker invites to movie dates, avoiding the “awkwardness” and “stress” of asking someone out for a movie (?!)  to Avoid the awkwardness and stress of asking someone out with the #moviedate iMessage extension. Create a fun sticker invite for a movie, and send it to the person you want to ask out. You’re most certainly going to get their attention with the #moviedate stickers! It’s really simple: 1. Select a movie you want to watch 2. Create the invite with fun stickers 3. Send out your invite and wait for the recipient to respond. 4. Respond to incoming invites with easy and funny reaction stickers. While the app appears to be aimed the younger college-going demographic rather than older businesspeople still who comprise the majority of Microsoft’s nonconsumer user base, it still remains a fun way to express creativity through stickers. It goes without saying that Microsoft fans shouldn’t expect to see this on either Windows devices or Android phones due to it being an iMessage app and therefore limited to Apple’s OS.

China rapped over South China Sea, remains defiant (Roundup) China warns US against shows of strength in South China Sea China has "no historic rights" in South China Sea: Chinese consumers spent $1.7 billion on Apple-sanctioned mobile apps in the third quarter of this year. That is about 15 per cent higher than the Americans' spend of nearly $1.45 billion during the same period, a report said. According to mobile analytics and research firm App Annie, the US market had led in Apple app store spending since 2010. "In Q3 2016, Chinese consumers spent more than five times the amount they spent just two years prior in the iOS App Store. Furthermore, revenue growth is set to continue, with China projected to drive the largest absolute revenue growth for any country by 2020," technology website Fortune quoted App Annie's report as saying. More Chinese consumers are buying mobile video games than ever, specifically those considered to be "multiplayer collaborative games" which people can play with or against other users. The report pointed out that blockbuster augmented reality (AR) mobile game Pokemon Go reached $600 million in sales "faster than any app to date". "Pokemon Go was not significantly borrowing time from other games or apps. Rather, its innovative AR gameplay and iconic IP were compelling enough to convince users to spend more time overall on their mobile devices," the report noted. After video games, Chinese consumers are heavy buyers of entertainment and video-streaming apps.

It is the second research and development centre in China announced by the Cupertino-based tech giant lately. "We are excited to open a new research and development centre here next year so our engineering team can work even more closely and collaboratively with our manufacturing partners," an Apple spokesperson told Quartz. Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly met government officials to formally announce the new centre. In May, Apple invested $1 billion into Didi Chuxing, China's biggest ride-hailing platform. Apple and Chinese bank card association UnionPay Shoppers also launched Apple Pay earlier this year.

This was clear at the Pixel launch event, where jokes being made at Apple's expense in every 15 minutes or so. Reuters "There's no unsightly camera bump," hardware chief Rick Osterloh said to laughter from the audience at the phone's debut, alluding to the iPhone's raised camera, a feature lamented by some design aficionados. Reuters Until the Pixel, there were no other competitors in the market, not even the well received OnePlus 3, which could touch the premium segment's leader. Forget the hardware for a second - it is the Google Assistant, the nimble rival to Apple's Siri that marks the contrast. Reuters Google Assistant is clearly designed to outperform Siri. For example, when asked: "Who will win the US presidential election?" Google Assistant displayed poll results by the New York Times, The Telegraph and Independent. Siri could only return Wikipedia and Quora results. Assistant, part of the Google universe, also takes from the precision of maps, capable of finding restaurants and other points of interests much closer than Siri. And Google Assistant is truly an assistant, telling jokes, remembering passwords and even setting the alarms. The  "Pixel Imprint" fingerprint scanner is reportedly faster than the iPhone. Reuters Type C charging (48 minutes for a full 3,450 mAh charge), Snapdragon 821 Quad core processor, 4GB DDR4 RAM (which will get Google's updates first), free unlimited cloud space (instead of paying for more iCloud storage)- there's a lot of clear wins against Apple.  And a new Type C charger won't cost you a third of your salary, unlike the Apple charger. Camera Pixel's 12.3MP rear camera with f/2.0 has been rated the highest ever 89 DxOMark Mobile score. It is very fast, responsive and has a video stabilising mode. As expected, the photos in broad daylight were stunning. Even in "very low light conditions", the camera did not disappoint. Under natural light at 7 pm, the photos clicked without flash had clarity and little grains while the photo taken with flash were sharper. The 8MP camera works fine and while using it with Google's video calling app Duo, the receiver gets a sharper image (as compared to the Nexus 6P). One can even try new gestures, relish the audio output and save unlimited data online in original quality for free. For 67,000 Rupees, Pixel is probably the best premium smartphone in the market at the moment.  Considering falling Apple sales in India, once its strongest market, the Cupertino company has to think fast.

No new iMacs at Apple's big event? by Joe Roberts 23 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments Apple is preparing to unveil a new line of MacBooks at an event next week, but if you were expecting to see some new desktop offerings from the company, you might be disappointed. Reputable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has spoken ahead of next week's event (via MacRumours) to say he expects Apple to introduce only laptops. While the MacBook refresh has been expected for some time now, rumours of a new iMac from the company have been doing the rounds in recent weeks. But if Kuo’s information is accurate, we will just see new MacBooks (or possible a new MacBook Air) and MacBook Pros unveiled, the latter coming with the long-rumoured OLED strip at the top of the keyboard. Related: MacBook Pro 2016 – All we know The analyst also said the new line of MacBook Pros will use Skylake, rather than Kaby Lake chips, come with improved battery life, and up to a 2TB solid-state drive. He also said we should expect to see a new "MagSafe-like" power adapter, which will either come from Apple or a third party. Render of what the new MacBook keyboard could look like And while rumours of a new MacBook Air have also been circulating, all Kuo has to say on the subject is that there will be a "13-inch MacBook”. That could very well mean a new Air model but it could be that we see a new version of the 12-inch MacBook. The supposed lack of a desktop update on October 27 doesn’t mean Apple isn’t working on new iMacs, according to Kuo, who added we can expect to see updated iMacs, alongside a stand-alone 5K display in mid-2017. That should mean the new desktop devices will arrive with the Kaby Lake processors, supposedly missing from the upcoming MacBooks. Of course, none of this has been confirmed, so we’ll have to wait until Thursday to see exactly what Apple has up it’s sleeve. Stay tuned for all the latest from the Apple event, which is set to get underway at 10am Pacific Time on Thursday, 6pm BST.

The TRA has revealed statistics for Q2 2016 on the nation’s most popular mobile phone handsets, social networking platforms and applications websites. Investigating the current state of the market, the TRA’s report reveals the market share of mobile phones in the UAE by manufacturer and model. The TRA’s report also shows that one-third of all handsets registered on UAE networks during Q2 were manufactured by Samsung.  The top four brands were Samsung (33.3 per cent of all handsets registered), Nokia (27 per cent), Apple (13.6 per cent); and BlackBerry (1.8 per cent).

That is about 15 per cent higher than the Americans’ spend of nearly $1.45 billion during the same period, a report said. According to mobile analytics and research firm App Annie, the US market had led in Apple app store spending since 2010. “In Q3 2016, Chinese consumers spent more than five times the amount they spent just two years prior in the iOS App Store. Furthermore, revenue growth is set to continue, with China projected to drive the largest absolute revenue growth for any country by 2020,” technology website Fortune quoted App Annie’s report as saying. More Chinese consumers are buying mobile video games than ever, specifically those considered to be “multiplayer collaborative games” which people can play with or against other users. The report pointed out that blockbuster augmented reality (AR) mobile game Pokemon Go reached $600 million in sales “faster than any app to date”. “Pokemon Go was not significantly borrowing time from other games or apps. Rather, its innovative AR gameplay and iconic IP were compelling enough to convince users to spend more time overall on their mobile devices,” the report noted. After video games, Chinese consumers are heavy buyers of entertainment and video-streaming apps. Apple recently announced it would open a research and development centre in Shenzhen — the hardware manufacturing hub for the world. It is the second research and development centre in China announced by the Cupertino-based tech giant lately. “We are excited to open a new research and development centre here next year so our engineering team can work even more closely and collaboratively with our manufacturing partners,” an Apple spokesperson told Quartz. Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly met government officials to formally announce the new centre. In May, Apple invested $1 billion into Didi Chuxing, China’s biggest ride-hailing platform. Apple and Chinese bank card association UnionPay Shoppers also launched Apple Pay earlier this year. Cook last year said China would be Apple’s largest market within two years and that the number of Apple stores in China would almost double to 40 within that time frame. –IANS sku/py/vt Tags China Chinese development times CanIndia New Wire Service Related Posts US dollar rallies on rate-hike expectations Nov 14th, 201608 New York, Nov 15 (IANS) The US dollar climbed against other major currencies as President-elect Donald...

To recognize the importance of the iPod’s groundbreaking technology and the man behind its success, this day is celebrated as the National iPod Day. Just as the iPod changed the way a person listens to music, the California-based technology giant has introduced a number of different variations of its “Classic,” Shuffle,” “Nano,” and “iPod Touch” — more and more models were released with each passing year. Here's a look at the game–changing iPod's history and its evolution.  2001 The first Apple iPod — 5GB hard-drive-based music player — was sold on Nov. 2001 for $399. Jobs was quoted telling the press, “To have your whole CD library with you at all times is a quantum leap when it comes to music. You can fit your whole music library in your pocket.” An updated version of Apple's popular iPod MP3 player was introduced featuring a larger hard drive and new software at the Macworld Conference and Expo in New York on July 17, 2002. Photo: Reuters/Chip East 2002 Apple comes up with a second iPod with an enhanced 10GB memory, priced at $499. Customers now also had the option to customize their devices by engraving two lines of text with up to 27 characters per line on the back of the iPod for $49. Soon after, it released its new generation of iPods, with a maximum capacity of 20GB, that boasted of a touch pad instead of the earlier scroll wheel. 2004 The company released its business card-sized 4GB new iPod mini in a variety of colors — gold, blue, pink, and green anodized aluminum — for $249. The new iPod Mini is see on display at an Apple Store. Photo: Getty Images/Justin Sullivan Apple then came up with a new generation of iPods to incorporate the “Click Wheel” interface that it had released with the mini. 2005 Apple introduced a flash-based iPod shuffle in 512MB ($99) and 1GB ($149) variants. It also pulled its earlier models a level up by introducing newer capacities for the mini and the iPod Photo, later ending the availability of monochrome-screen in its devices. An employee of Apple Computer Inc. holds the iPod Shuffle at the Macworld Conference and Expo in San Francisco, Jan. 11, 2005. Photo: Getty Images/Bloomberg/Kimberly White Later in the year, the company went on to end its tryst with the immensely popular mini in favor of the newly introduced iPod Nano —2GB and 4GB versions selling for $199 and $249 respectively. 2006 This year was significant for Apple as the company went for a major overhaul of its music players, bringing in second-generation shuffles and nanos. Apple also introduced a red 4GB nano, as part of the Project Red initiative to combat AIDS in Africa. An employee holds the iPod shuffle in the Apple Store Fifth Avenue in New York City, Nov. 3, 2006. Photo: Getty Images/Mario Tama 2007 Apple released its iconic iPhone in 2007 but the iPods did not take a back seat. While newer versions of the nano and shuffle were released, the introduction of the iPod Touch was a step in the right direction for the tech powerhouse. 2008 Along with the release of the iPhone 3G, this year also saw the fourth-generation iPod nano coming to stores. 2009 The 120GB iPod classic is replaced with the 160GB model, along with a much sleeker fifth-generation iPod nano. The new iPod Classic from 2007. Photo: Cate Gillon/Getty Images iPod Nanos are displayed following their debut in San Francisco, Sept. 9, 2009. Photo: Bloomberg via Getty Images/Tony Avelar 2010 Related Stories iOS 10 New Features Explained Apple Shelves iPods Multi-touch comes to the iPod nano with the sixth-generation model, which features the clip from the iPod shuffle but no video, speakers, or camera features. The fourth iteration of the iPod shuffle is also released along with the fourth-generation iPod touch — thinner and with two cameras. Apple introduced a new iPod Touch with high-end features. Photo: Apple The iPods nano and touch have seen further upgrades in the years that have followed to ensure that Apple remains competitive in the music sphere but majority of the company’s focus is now on its flagship iPhones. The phones come with built-in music players, eliminating the need for a separate device. However, no one can take away from Steve Job’s genius in coming forward with the iPod, and this must be acknowledged on the National iPod Day.

In the Kernel release notes for macOS 10.12, Apple indicates that a new ARM HURRICANE chip family is now supported by the kernel. This is likely a custom ARM chip from Apple as the A7 was dubbed Cyclone, the A8 was Typhoon, and the A9 was Twister. It may even be the A10 Fusion processor found in the iPhone 7. The site notes that Apple may have already been taking steps to prepare for a laptop with an ARM processor. It is striking that developers no longer send the final binaries when submitting an app, but a bit code. This bit code is then used by Apple to convert the application to the specific platform. Which means that Apple can easily make the transition to a different instruction set, for example, switching from x86 to ARM without all apps need to be resubmitted. It is probably also one of the reasons why legacy applications have recently been removed from the App Store. An ARM MacBook has been rumored for quite some time. It's believed that A-series chips would be limited to lower-end devices initially, perhaps a future version of the rumored 12-inch MacBook Air would be a possible candidate. Apple is set to unveil a slew of updates to its Mac lineup next month. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

Tuesday 15 Nov 2016 / Tehran - 03:57 / GMT - 00:27 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories Technology Sun Oct 23, 2016 1:4 Apple to Launch New MacBooks next Week, iMac and Display in 2017 Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- Apple won't release a new iMac or external display until the first half 2017, according to a reliable analyst. Apple will use its October event for a new MacBook and MacBook Pro. Apple will use next week's media event to release a new 13-inch MacBook, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and 15-inch MacBook Pro, according to Ming-Chi Kuo at KGI Securities. Likely the headliner of the event, the 15-inch MacBook Pro will feature a Retina display, Touch ID, an OLED function row above the keyboard, and upgraded internals, according to rumors. It's not clear what upgrades the 13-inch version of the MacBook Pro will see. Kuo added some predictions for the MacBook Pro lineup: (1) Intel's (US) Skylake processor. (2) The same panel resolution but better display quality and energy efficiency thanks to an oxide panel. (3) A new option of 2TB SSD storage capacity. (4) adoption of a similar processor as Apple Watch to control the OLED touch bar more energy-efficiently in the new MacBook Pro models; and (5) A Type-C & MagSafe-like adapter rolled out by Apple or a third-party supplier, given positive reviews for the MagSafe charging design. The often-reliable Apple analyst said the 13-inch MacBook will be a successor to the 12-inch Retina MacBook released in 2015 and upgraded in April 2016. Interestingly, Kuo said Apple won't ship its rumored iMac upgrade or external 5k display until the first half of 2017.

Apple's "Hello Again" event is scheduled to start at 10 am PT/1 pm ET on Oct. 27 and will be live-streamed by Apple.

The iPhone 6S and 7 are yet to be released in Southeast Asia's top economy as Apple struggles to fulfil requirements that phone makers must have 20 per cent "local content" for 4G handsets sold in the country. South Korea's Samsung has been able to meet the demands and gain a share of the market in Indonesia -- a country of 255 million people, with an army of young consumers -- more than 25 times bigger than Apple. Officials say the regulations that came into force this year are aimed at supporting the growth of the local manufacturing industry, which lags behind its Asian peers, and plan to raise the local content requirement to 30 per cent at the start of next year. But to critics, it is just the latest example of misguided nationalistic rules that hamper rather than help business in Indonesia, which is ranked 109th on the World Bank's ease of doing business index. The new rules "force companies to rethink the entire supply chain and that is expensive for them to do," Sudev Bangah of International Data Corporation (IDC), a consumer technology market research firm, told AFP. Apple has encountered problems in other emerging markets, notably India where the Silicon Valley giant is facing roadblocks in its quest to open stores instead of selling products through third-party retailers. The Indian government reportedly refused in May to exempt Apple from rules stating foreign single-brand retailers must buy at least 30 per cent of their parts locally to open their own outlets. In Indonesia meeting the local content rules has been easier for Samsung, as it already had factories in the country, and has added assembly lines to the plants to carry out the final stages of production. Other competitors, including Asus, Lenovo, Oppo and Blackberry -- which used to dominate in Indonesia but has seen its market share obliterated -- have also taken steps to fulfil the government's demands. However officials admit that so far the rules are not boosting Indonesia's phone manufacturing industry as they had hoped. Firms have met the demands by getting local vendors to supply simple parts, such as boxes, manuals and chargers, and hi-tech components are still being imported. But Apple, which makes most of its handsets in China, has not yet met the requirements. Its iPhone 6S was never released in Indonesia while the 7, currently being rolled out globally, seems unlikely to hit the country's shops any time soon.

( Trina Rae Wiegers) Sophia Harris Business reporter sophia.harris@cbc.ca Sophia Harris has worked as a CBC video journalist across the country, covering everything from the start of the annual lobster fishery in Yarmouth, N.S., to potash prices in Saskatchewan. She now has found a good home at the business unit in Toronto where she produces for national TV news and writes and shoots and edits video for CBC.ca. Twitter: @sophiaharrisCBC More by this author Related Stories 'Fix my damn phone': Apple faces class action filings over iPhone 'touch disease' Say goodbye to the iPhone headphone jack — the latest version is wireless Update your iPhone: Serious vulnerabilities revealed by spyware discovery What's known as iPhone "touch disease" appears to be spreading and pressure is mounting for Apple to find a cure. However, the tech giant still refuses to talk about it. Touch disease is an affliction of Apple's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models which hit stores in 2014. The theory is that the phones suffer from a design flaw, which can make the screen freeze up and ignore touch commands.   A total of four proposed class-action lawsuits have been filed, two in Canada and two in the U.S., alleging the California-based tech giant knew about the defect and failed to take action. Apple hit with proposed class-action lawsuits over iPhone 'touch disease' New iPhone 7 water resistant, dustproof The first suit, filed in California in August, expanded this month. Three additional law firms and several more lead plaintiffs have been added to the case. Many plaintiffs allege that their phone became permanently or periodically unresponsive to touch and that Apple demanded hundreds of dollars to fix or replace it. "You miss calls, you can't text, it's a horrible piece of crap," said Trina Rae Wiegers from Prince Albert, Sask., the lead plaintiff in one of the Canadian suits. Complaints are also piling up on online discussion sites and social media. The ailment has even inspired a hashtag on Twitter. "#touchdisease it's a thing, it's serious," someone tweeted last week. "You need to take responsibility," another person tweeted to Apple's CEO, Tim Cook.  @tim_cook Could you address 'Touch Disease' on the iPhone 6+ Model? My phone has it and you need to take responsibility. #TouchDisease— @Joshy_Wallis And yet, Apple is remaining mum. Earlier this month, the company told CBC News it has "no comment" on the issue. We contacted Apple repeatedly this week in the hopes it would offer something more, but the company never responded. 'Heartbreaking' end to iPhone "With Apple, they just kind of leave you hanging," says Hawwa Motiwala in Toronto. The 19-year-old high school student claims she's also a victim of touch disease. Motiwala had her heart set on an iPhone but couldn't afford the ticket price. So she bought a second-hand 6 Plus for $750 in February. "It was my first Apple product and I was really looking forward to it." Motiwala only got to enjoy her phone for a short time. She says that in September a flickering grey bar started to pop up on the screen and then the device would freeze up periodically. Hawwa Motiwala says a flickering grey bar appears on her iPhone 6 Plus and then the screen won't respond to her touch commands. (Yusuf Motiwala) After a few days, the phone permanently stopped responding to touch, making it useless, says Motiwala. "It was really like heartbreaking at the moment and really disappointing." "She was crying the first night," reports her father, Yusuf. He says he took her phone to a local Apple store and was told Motiwala would have to pay around $480 for a replacement — money she doesn't have.  "When I later Googled more about the problem, it seems Apple knows about the problem," says Yusuf. He believes the company should offer his daughter a better deal to remedy a defect that appears to be widespread. "Apple should own up to it." Toronto iPhone owner Paul So agrees. 'Let's do a recall'? So bought an iPhone 6 Plus in 2014. He says that soon after his warranty expired, the device started to periodically ignore touch commands. "I'm trying to swipe to answer the call and I can't even swipe," says the IT worker, who uses the phone for his job. "Sometimes I have those instances where I just want to throw it against the [wall]. It's getting frustrating." Paul So in Toronto says his iPhone 6 Plus constantly freezes up and ignores his touch commands. (Paul So) So says he called Apple tech support and was told he'd have to pay about $400 to get the phone fixed. But he refuses to foot the bill for a problem he believes is Apple's responsibility. "They're a big company and they should fess up and say, 'You know what, we made a mistake and let's do a recall.'" A fix — maybe soon? Tech enthusiast Justin Tse believes Apple may very well do that, but is still gathering evidence at this time. "I think Apple is remaining quiet about it because they're likely still trying to determine the actual problems surrounding it before releasing any statements." Tse lives in Victoria where he runs JTechApple, a consumer tech news and review site on YouTube. He says he got his hands on a defective iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in August. After inspecting the devices, he concluded that they were suffering from the dreaded touch disease. Tse believes the problem may be linked to "bendgate." Shortly after the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launched, people started complaining that the thin phone was susceptible to bending. "As a result of the bending, the [circuit] board design causes a very important component to separate," says Tse. That fractured connection could cause the phone to stop responding to touch commands. Apple fans say their skinny jeans are bending the iPhone 6 Plus In the past, Tse says Apple has been very good about addressing defects, such as a malfunctioning camera in some iPhone 6 Plus models. Last year, Apple launched a free repair program for afflicted phones. Tse predicts that the company will also eventually address touch disease. "I would expect that's what they would do and hopefully they end up acknowledging the situation." Meanwhile, Motiwala has already moved on. She's now using an Android smartphone and says she's learned an important lesson from her ordeal. "I know I shouldn't spend too much money on phones."

افكار و احلام A journal at al-Qâhira fî Amrîkâ 10.23.16 Thoughts on the Mac OS X upgrade cycle Posted in Software at 2:43 am by Smokey Michael Tsai recently linked to Ricardo Mori’s lament on the unfashionable state of the Mac, quoting the following passage: Having a mandatory new version of Mac OS X every year is not necessarily the best way to show you’re still caring, Apple. This self-imposed yearly update cycle makes less and less sense as time goes by. Mac OS X is a mature operating system and should be treated as such. The focus should be on making Mac OS X even more robust and reliable, so that Mac users can update to the next version with the same relative peace of mind as when a new iOS version comes out. I wonder how much the mandatory yearly version cycle is due to the various iOS integration features—which, other than the assorted “bugs introduced by rewriting stuff that ‘just worked,’” seem to be the main changes in every Mac OS X (er, macOS, previously OS X) version of late. Are these integration features so wide-ranging that they touch every part of the OS and really need an entire new version to ship safely, or are they localized enough that they could safely be released in a point update? Of course, even if they are safe to release in an update, it’s still probably easier on Apple’s part to state “To use this feature, your Mac must be running macOS 10.18 or newer, and your iOS device must be running iOS 16 or newer” instead of “To use this feature, your Mac must be running macOS 10.15.5 or newer, and your iOS device must be running iOS 16 or newer” when advising users on the availability of the feature. At this point, as Mori mentioned, Mac OS X is a mature, stable product, and Apple doesn’t even have to sell it per se anymore (although for various reasons, they certainly want people to continue to upgrade). So even if we do have to be subjected to yearly Mac OS X releases to keep iOS integration features coming/working, it seems like the best strategy is to keep the scope of those OS releases small (iOS integration, new Safari/WebKit, a few smaller things here and there) and rock-solid (don’t rewrite stuff that works fine, fix lots of bugs that persist). I think a smaller, more scoped release also lessens the “upgrade burnout” effect—there’s less fear and teeth-gnashing over things that will be broken and never fixed each year, but there’s still room for surprise and delight in small areas, including fixing persistent bugs that people have lived with for upgrade after upgrade. (Regressions suck. Regressions that are not fixed, release after release, are an indication that your development/release process sucks or your attention to your users’ needs sucks. Neither is a very good omen.) And when there is something else new and big, perhaps it has been in development and QA for a couple of cycles so that it ships to the user solid and fully-baked. I think the need not to have to “sell” the OS presents Apple a really unique opportunity that I can imagine some vendors would kill to have—the ability to improve the quality of the software—and thus the user experience—by focusing on the areas that need attention (whatever they may be, new features, improvements, old bugs) without having to cram in a bunch of new tentpole items to entice users to purchase the new version. Even in terms of driving adoption, lots of people will upgrade for the various iOS integration features alone, and with a few features and improved quality overall, the adoption rate could end up being very similar. Though there’s the myth that developers are only happy when they get to write new code and new features (thus the plague of rewrite-itis), I know from working on Camino that I—and, more importantly, most of our actual developers1—got enormous pleasure and satisfaction from fixing bugs in our features, especially thorny and persistent bugs. I would find it difficult to believe that Apple doesn’t have a lot of similar-tempered developers working for it, so keeping them happy without cranking out tons of brand-new code shouldn’t be overly difficult. I just wish Apple would seize this opportunity. If we are going to continue to be saddled with yearly Mac OS X releases (for whatever reason), please, Apple, make them smaller, tighter, more solid releases that delight us in how pain-free and bug-free they are.          1 Whenever anyone would confuse me for a real developer after I’d answered some questions, my reply was “I’m not a developer; I only play one on IRC.”2 ↩︎ 2 A play on the famous television commercial disclaimer, “I’m not a doctor; I only play one on TV,” attributed variously, perhaps first to Robert Young, television’s Marcus Welby, M.D. from 1969-1976.3 ↩︎ 3 The nested footnotes are a tribute to former Mozilla build/release engineer J.

The iPhone 6S and 7 are yet to be released in Southeast Asia’s top economy as Apple struggles to fulfil requirements that phone makers must have 20 per cent “local content” for 4G handsets sold in the country. South Korea’s Samsung has been able to meet the demands and gain a share of the market in Indonesia – a country of 255 million people, with an army of young consumers – more than 25 times bigger than Apple. Officials say the regulations that came into force this year are aimed at supporting the growth of the local manufacturing industry, which lags behind its Asian peers, and plan to raise the local content requirement to 30 per cent at the start of next year. But to critics, it is just the latest example of misguided nationalistic rules that hamper rather than help business in Indonesia, which is ranked 109th on the World Bank’s ease of doing business index. Lenovo in sales push for smartphones and tablets The new rules “force companies to rethink the entire supply chain and that is expensive for them to do”, said Sudev Bangah of International Data Corporation (IDC), a consumer technology market research firm. Apple has encountered problems in other emerging markets, notably India where the Silicon Valley giant is facing roadblocks in its quest to open stores instead of selling products through third-party retailers. The Indian government reportedly refused in May to exempt Apple from rules stating foreign single-brand retailers must buy at least 30 per cent of their parts locally to open their own outlets. In Indonesia meeting the local content rules has been easier for Samsung, as it already had factories in the country, and has added assembly lines to the plants to carry out the final stages of production. Other competitors, including Asus, Lenovo, Oppo and Blackberry – which used to dominate in Indonesia but has seen its market share obliterated – have also taken steps to fulfil the government’s demands. Chinese phones from Xiaomi to Oppo go global after pushing aside big-hitters Apple, Samsung However officials admit that so far the rules are not boosting Indonesia’s phone manufacturing industry as they had hoped. Firms have met the demands by getting local vendors to supply simple parts, such as boxes, manuals and chargers, and hi-tech components are still being imported. But Apple, which makes most of its handsets in China, has not yet met the requirements. Its iPhone 6S was never released in Indonesia while the 7, currently being rolled out globally, seems unlikely to hit the country’s shops any time soon. Even before the new rules came into effect, things were not easy for Apple in Indonesia. The iPhone 6 made it into the local market in early 2015, but it was the last country in the world where the model was released as the firm had a tough time getting import licences, according to a source close to the matter. An Apple spokeswoman refused to comment when contacted. Still, government officials pushing the new scheme appear unfazed. Frenchman caught in Indonesian military base hunting Pokemon “With the local content requirement, we hope the component industry can grow,” said Dini Hanggandari, an official overseeing communications technology at the industry ministry, adding that smartphone imports had in recent years contributed to Indonesia’s negative trade balance. Indonesia is attractive for phone makers and more than 30 million handsets are expected to be shipped to the country this year, according to IDC, but Apple’s share of the smartphone market has been languishing at under one per cent. Nevertheless the tech giant is not ready to give up, recently pledging an investment of US$45 million to open app development centres in several Indonesian cities in a bid to meet the requirements, according to a proposal submitted to the government by Apple and seen by AFP. In July the industry ministry relaxed the rules to allow software, such as apps, to be classified as “local content”, senior official I Gusti Putu Suryawirawan said. But the plan has met resistance, highlighting divisions within the government over how to deal with foreign investment. Joko Widodo urged to stand up for LGBT rights after Indonesian government cracks down on ‘gay emoticons’ in messaging apps The barriers being thrown up to smartphone makers fly in the face of President Joko Widodo’s own avowed aim to transform Indonesia into Southeast Asia’s biggest “digital economy” by 2020, by attracting foreign investment in the tech sector and boosting e-commerce. “On the one hand you talk about the digital economy, on the other hand, all the regulations cancel out those intentions,” John Riady of major conglomerate Lippo Group said at a recent forum in Jakarta.

Oct. 23, 2016 Updated 12:01 a.m. By JOEL KOTKIN and MARSHALL TOPLANSKY / Contributing Writers Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF The consumer technology boom, largely responsible for a resurgence in California’s economy after the tech wreck of 2001, seems to be coming to an end. The signs are widespread: slowing employment, layoffs from bell-weather social media companies, the almost embarrassing difficulty of finding buyers for Twitter, the absorption of Yahoo by Verizon and the acquisition by Microsoft of LinkedIn. This is not to minimize the great things which have been accomplished over 15 years of massive investment in these technologies. Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook in 2004, and is now worth some $55 billion, up $15 billion from last year. In 2015, more than 1 billion people globally used Facebook applications every single day. The “app economy” created by Steve Jobs and Apple is equally impressive. What would we have done with our free time if it were not for Farmville, Angry Birds and Pokemon Go? The tech boom has changed the face of wealth in America. Tech oligarchs, mostly clustered in the Bay Area, which dominates some 40 percent of employment in search and web publishing, now account for one quarter of the wealth of the Forbes 400 richest Americans. This tilting of wealth is not going away, and may shape the business world for a generation. Concentration and contraction Overall though, the economic impact of these technologies has been limited. Google’s Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. together employ fewer than 75,000 people, one-third fewer than Microsoft, worth only a fraction its value. Snapchat, the star of Silicon Beach, employs several hundred people, hardly enough to reverse a long-term decline in Southern California tech employment. More troubling still are changes in the Bay Area tech culture. In its 1980s heyday, Silicon Valley was a Wild West of start-ups, new companies and ideas, and lots of jobs. Today, it resembles increasingly the cozy and fundamentally uncompetitive world of Detroit’s Big Three — Ford, Chrysler and General Motors. The Valley is increasingly dominated by a handful of companies — Google, Facebook and Apple — while conditions for startups, even well-funded ones, have deteriorated markedly. Despite the hype surrounding the possible IPO for Snapchat, new firms raised $15 billion in venture capital during the third quarter of 2016 — ending in September — down 28.6 percent from $21 billion for the same period one year ago. The third quarter of 2016 marked the fifth straight quarterly decline in completed financings and the lowest number recorded by PitchBook since the fourth quarter of 2010, signaling that investors are writing bigger checks for fewer deals. Rather than the Wild West, we are seeing consolidation in social media, which depends largely on advertising revenue. Google and Facebook claimed 64 percent of that revenue, according to Pivotal Research. Google scooped up $30 billion and Facebook gathered $8 billion, while other smaller companies have lost market share over the last five years. As promising start-ups are swallowed up at an alarming rate, the likely scenario, as we have seen in other industries, may be secular stagnation. With less competition and innovation, the track record of oligarchies, particularly regionally incestuous ones, is not a great one, as anyone who deals with new Microsoft or Apple operating systems, can attest. Even Sergei Brin, a co-founder of Google, recently suggested that start-ups would be better off launching somewhere else. One door closes, another opens The preponderance of evidence is pointing to the end of the boom era in social media growth. Already, there are clear signs of slowing, with layoffs growing rapidly and more companies looking for space in less expensive, less highly regulated areas. Yet this shift from social media may prove a long-term benefit both to the national economy and California. The sad truth is that for all the billions earned in stock market value, social media, unlike past tech booms, has done precious little to boost economic productivity. According to the Pew Center for Internet, Science and Tech, 56 percent of workers who use social media platforms for work-related purposes agree that social media distracts from the work they need to do, with 30 percent agreeing strongly. Rather than thrilling tweens with their first Tweets, technology companies may be shifting to far more important callings. In the Bay Area and elsewhere, firms are delving into promising fields including autonomous vehicles, machine learning, artificial intelligence, financial technology, biomedical research and even space exploration. These endeavors do more than simply keep people entertained and informed about their friends. They may create the basis for longer-lasting growth in the productive economy, not only here in California, but around the nation. Will California be able to maintain its innovation dominance in this next tech cycle? The Golden State faces the twin headwinds of high housing prices and restrictive regulations. These growing technologies require interfacing with the analog (aka real) world, relying more on 30-something, experienced engineers and data scientists than the millennial hipsters and coders who have fueled social media and casual gaming. California needs to make housing affordable and lessen regulatory burden for business if it plans to lead the next wave. Joel Kotkin is the R.C.

But that has perhaps never more been more true than in this election year, with a presidential contest featuring a Republican nominee seen here as more interested in returning to the past than building the future. It is no understatement to say Donald Trump is unpopular among California’s tech titans. Along with overwhelmingly donating their dollars to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, many are openly campaigning for Trump’s defeat. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Twitter co-founder Ev Williams and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales were among more than 100 people who recently signed an open letter from the tech industry taking a stand against the real estate tycoon. “We have listened to Donald Trump over the past year and we have concluded: Trump would be a disaster for innovation,” the letter read. “His vision stands against the open exchange of ideas, free movement of people, and productive engagement with the outside world that is critical to our economy.” Trump has railed against immigrants, proposed “shutting down” part of the internet as a security move, criticized Apple for making its products abroad and accused online retail giant Amazon of “getting away with murder, tax-wise.” Geoffrey Skelley at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics said the tech sector is also fearful that Trump could start a trade war that would hurt firms with global ambitions. Instead of focusing on the future and technology, Trump appears to his detractors to be bent on resurrecting manufacturing jobs from a bygone era. “Trump is pretty anathema to the things that Silicon Valley wants,” said Melinda Jackson, an associate professor of political science at San Jose State University. “He seems to be backward-looking — to make things like they were before,” Jackson told AFP. “And Silicon Valley is about new innovation and the next big thing.” – Deep Clinton roots – While Google has laid out a mission of making the world’s information freely available and Facebook is striving to connect everyone on the planet, Trump has branded the media an enemy and vowed to build a wall along the border with Mexico to keep people out. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg shot down the idea of a Mexico wall at a developers conference in San Francisco earlier this year. Careful not to make a direct link to Trump’s rhetoric, Zuckerberg nonetheless urged those tailoring software for the social network to “choose hope over fear” and to help people build bridges instead of walls. Another Facebook co-founder, Dustin Moskovitz, and his wife committed $20 million to Democratic causes and backed Clinton in the first-ever political endorsement of a candidate by the power couple. “It is clear that if Secretary Clinton wins the election, America will advance much further toward the world we hope to see,” Moskovitz and his wife said in an online post. “Donald Trump wins, the country will fall backward, and become more isolated from the global community,” they said. Fundraising events for Clinton in Silicon Valley have included one hosted by Apple chief executive Tim Cook — reportedly once touted as a possible Clinton vice presidential pick — and another by the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. “The Clintons, and Hillary’s roots in particular, go deep here,” Jackson said. “She is a known quantity. They trust her for the most part and feel they would at least know what to expect.” – Mirror opposite – Apple skipped providing funding or support for the Republican national presidential convention this year citing Trump’s comments about immigrants, minorities and women. “Trump represents the mirror opposite of everything they believe (in Silicon Valley); welcoming immigrants, a cosmopolitan global world order,” said Gregory Ferenstein, author of “The Age of Optimists,” about how technology transforms lives and politics. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman has been an outspoken Trump opponent, promising to donate $5 million to veterans’ charities if the Republican candidate releases his tax returns, which he has so far refused to do. Trump has also been engaged in a nasty feud with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, accusing him of using The Washington Post, which Bezos bought for $250 million three years ago, as a weapon against him. “He’s using that as a tool for political power against me and against other people, and I’ll tell you what, we can’t let him get away with it,” Trump told Sean Hannity of Fox News. Trump went on to say that Bezos is “using The Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don’t tax Amazon like they should be taxed.” – Trump’s backers – Trump is not completely without support in Silicon Valley. High-profile PayPal founder-turned-venture-capitalist Peter Thiel, an early investor in Facebook, delivered a keynote speech at the Republican convention and has donated significant sums to Trump’s campaign. That prompted former Reddit chief Ellen Pao to sever ties between Project Include, which is devoted to promoting diversity in the tech industry, and Y Combinator, a startup incubator Thiel is involved with. “We are completely outraged to read about Thiel donating $1.25 million to Trump,” Pao wrote in an online post. “While all of us believe in the ideas of free speech and open platforms, we draw a line here. “Giving more power to someone whose ascension and behavior strike fear into so many people is unacceptable,” she said. -AFP simangele RELATED ARTICLES World Poroshenko ‘sure’ Trump supports Ukraine against Russia World Pro-Russian candidate wins Moldova presidency World Kerry in Oman for Yemen peace talks World BBC cancels Morocco debate on Islam and politics World Modi promises to ease cash crunch NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

The men who constructed some of New York’s greatest landmarks, including the Empire State Building and the famous Apple cube on Fifth Avenue, are to be celebrated with a new tourism app. The army of tartan immigrants and their descendants who created more than 50 of the city’s best-loved and most prestigious buildings are to be honoured via a new map and walking tour. Top news stories today End the evil Tory testing, says film man PIP tests say vulnerable CAN work Jackson aims with blazer-guided missile Sheriff rules legal high killed Tony 1 of 4 The novel tourism project is the brainchild of the American Scottish Foundation, a charity who promote ties between Scotland and the US. It will be launched next year. New York may have been founded by the Dutch in 1624 but the modern city was shaped by Caledonian hands. First, second and third-generation Scots are responsible for the world’s most famous skyline, creating landmarks such as City Hall, Columbia University and Carnegie Hall to name but a few. New York architect John Kinnear Architect John Kinnear, a second-generation Scot and a member of the New York branch of the foundation, has given a number of lectures on the city’s Scottish-built landmarks. He said: “The influence of the Scots was such that they didn’t just create a section of the city, like Little Italy or Chinatown, they were the city. The Scots built the Big Apple. Scottish people have been settling in New York since the early days.

We hope to include at least 50 in the app.” Here, John takes us through six of the landmarks. Empire State Building One of the best-known landmarks in the world, never mind New York, the Empire State Building was the work of principal designer William F Lamb, who was of Scots descent. He was also responsible for the Forbes Magazine building on lower Fifth Avenue and for 40 Wall Street, which was the tallest building in the world until his Empire State. Lamb remains one of the most respected architects of all time and one of the biggest contributors to the New York skyline. Carnegie Hall Andrew Carnegie, who was born in Dunfermline and emigrated to the US in 1848, is the ultimate rags-to-riches story in the history of America. His contributions to industry and, in particular, the steel industry, changed the way we build. Through Carnegie’s philanthropy, buildings were constructed and thousands of libraries created around the world. New York became Andrew’s home and he left us many buildings which to this day remain city treasures, such as Carnegie Hall. Morningside Heights Campus of Columbia University Charles McKim, of Scottish descent, was senior partner in McKim, Mead and White, the top architectural firm in the US at the turn of the 20th century. Among his outstanding buildings are the Morningside Heights campus of Columbia University, Morgan Library and Museum and the original Pennsylvania Station. It was the knocking down of his Penn Station that sparked the outcry that led to the creation of New York City’s Landmark Preservation Commission. Apple Store Cube One of the most impressive modernist creations is the Apple cube on Fifth Avenue, which was created by Jon Jackson, an architect of Scottish descent who is a partner with the firm Bohlin Cywinski Jackson. Opened in 2006, it is a relatively new landmark but over time the design – which is an innovation in glass technology – will become one of New York’s cult buildings. American-Scottish architects have really embraced the modernist era and their modern buildings will be around and celebrated for a long time to come. High Line City Park Scot Charles Renfro is a partner in Diller Scofidio + Renfro. His firm were the architects for the High Line, one of the newest city parks built entirely on an abandoned elevated freight railroad that runs along the west side of Manhattan – in some places through the buildings – and is a huge tourist draw. The firm have also done the master plan for the renovation of Lincoln Center and recently re-did the Alice Tully Hall there. City Hall John McComb Jr and his father John Sr were major architects and builders during the reconstruction of New York City after 10 years of British occupation following the Revolution. John Jr is responsible for eight landmarks in New York City, more than any other architect to date. Among them are City Hall, war hero Alexander Hamilton’s home The Grange and St Mark’s Church. He also helped to design Watson House, Commandant’s House and Fort Clinton. John Jr will feature heavily in the new walking tour and app for the city.

Posted 23 Oct 2016 12:48 A man walks past an authorized Apple store at a shopping mall in Jakarta AFP/Bay Ismoyo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A JAKARTA: Apple is battling to gain a foothold in Indonesia after nationalistic regulations hit the US tech giant's efforts to compete in the booming emerging market against Samsung and other rivals. The iPhone 6S and 7 are yet to be released in Southeast Asia's largest economy as Apple struggles to fulfil requirements that phone makers must have 20 per cent "local content" for 4G handsets sold in the country. South Korea's Samsung has been able to meet the demands and gain a share of the market in Indonesia - a country of 255 million people, with an army of young consumers - more than 25 times bigger than Apple. Officials say the regulations that came into force this year are aimed at supporting the growth of the local manufacturing industry, which lags behind its Asian peers, and plan to raise the local content requirement to 30 percent at the start of next year. But to critics, it is just the latest example of misguided nationalistic rules that hamper rather than help business in Indonesia, which is ranked 109th on the World Bank's ease of doing business index. The new rules "force companies to rethink the entire supply chain and that is expensive for them to do," Sudev Bangah of International Data Corporation (IDC), a consumer technology market research firm, told AFP. Apple has encountered problems in other emerging markets, notably India where the Silicon Valley giant is facing roadblocks in its quest to open stores instead of selling products through third-party retailers. The Indian government reportedly refused in May to exempt Apple from rules stating foreign single-brand retailers must buy at least 30 percent of their parts locally to open their own outlets. LOCAL CONTENT RULES In Indonesia, meeting the local content rules has been easier for Samsung as it already had factories in the country, and has added assembly lines to the plants to carry out the final stages of production. Other competitors, including Asus, Lenovo, Oppo and Blackberry - which used to dominate in Indonesia but has seen its market share obliterated - have also taken steps to fulfill the government's demands. However, officials admit that so far the rules are not boosting Indonesia's phone manufacturing industry as they had hoped. Firms have met the demands by getting local vendors to supply simple parts, such as boxes, manuals and chargers, and hi-tech components are still being imported. But Apple, which makes most of its handsets in China, has not yet met the requirements. Its iPhone 6S was never released in Indonesia while the 7, currently being rolled out globally, seems unlikely to hit the country's shops any time soon. Even before the new rules came into effect, things were not easy for Apple in Indonesia. The iPhone 6 made it into the local market in early 2015, but it was the last country in the world where the model was released as the firm had a tough time getting import licences, according to a source close to the matter. An Apple spokeswoman refused to comment when contacted by AFP. Still, government officials pushing the new scheme appear unfazed. "With the local content requirement, we hope the component industry can grow," Dini Hanggandari, an official overseeing communications technology at the industry ministry, told AFP, adding that smartphone imports had in recent years contributed to Indonesia's negative trade balance. THROWING UP BARRIERS Indonesia is attractive for phone makers and more than 30 million handsets are expected to be shipped to the country this year, according to IDC, but Apple's share of the smartphone market has been languishing at under one percent. Nevertheless, the tech giant is not ready to give up, recently pledging an investment of US$45 million to open app development centres in several Indonesian cities in a bid to meet the requirements, according to a proposal submitted to the government by Apple and seen by AFP. In July the industry ministry relaxed the rules to allow software, such as apps, to be classified as "local content", senior official I Gusti Putu Suryawirawan said. But the plan has met resistance, highlighting divisions within the government over how to deal with foreign investment. The barriers being thrown up to smartphone makers fly in the face of President Joko Widodo's own avowed aim to transform Indonesia into Southeast Asia's biggest "digital economy" by 2020, by attracting foreign investment in the tech sector and boosting e-commerce. "On the one hand you talk about the digital economy, on the other hand, all the regulations cancel out those intentions," John Riady of major conglomerate Lippo Group said at a recent forum in Jakarta. - AFP/mz Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Apple's iPhone 6S and 7 are yet to be released in Indonesia as Apple struggles to fulfil requirements that phone makers must have 20% "local content" for 4G handsets sold in the country ©Bay Ismoyo (AFP) Officials say the regulations that came into force this year are aimed at supporting the growth of the local manufacturing industry, which lags behind its Asian peers, and plan to raise the local content requirement to 30 percent at the start of next year. But to critics, it is just the latest example of misguided nationalistic rules that hamper rather than help business in Indonesia, which is ranked 109th on the World Bank's ease of doing business index. The new rules "force companies to rethink the entire supply chain and that is expensive for them to do," Sudev Bangah of International Data Corporation (IDC), a consumer technology market research firm, told AFP. Apple has encountered problems in other emerging markets, notably India where the Silicon Valley giant is facing roadblocks in its quest to open stores instead of selling products through third-party retailers. The Indian government reportedly refused in May to exempt Apple from rules stating foreign single-brand retailers must buy at least 30 percent of their parts locally to open their own outlets. - Local content rules - In Indonesia meeting the local content rules has been easier for Samsung, as it already had factories in the country, and has added assembly lines to the plants to carry out the final stages of production. Other competitors, including Asus, Lenovo, Oppo and Blackberry -- which used to dominate in Indonesia but has seen its market share obliterated -- have also taken steps to fulfil the government's demands. However officials admit that so far the rules are not boosting Indonesia's phone manufacturing industry as they had hoped. Firms have met the demands by getting local vendors to supply simple parts, such as boxes, manuals and chargers, and hi-tech components are still being imported. But Apple, which makes most of its handsets in China, has not yet met the requirements. Its iPhone 6S was never released in Indonesia while the 7, currently being rolled out globally, seems unlikely to hit the country's shops any time soon. Even before the new rules came into effect, things were not easy for Apple in Indonesia. The iPhone 6 made it into the local market in early 2015, but it was the last country in the world where the model was released as the firm had a tough time getting import licences, according to a source close to the matter. An Apple spokeswoman refused to comment when contacted by AFP. Still, government officials pushing the new scheme appear unfazed. "With the local content requirement, we hope the component industry can grow," Dini Hanggandari, an official overseeing communications technology at the industry ministry, told AFP, adding that smartphone imports had in recent years contributed to Indonesia's negative trade balance. - Throwing up barriers - Indonesia is attractive for phone makers and more than 30 million handsets are expected to be shipped to the country this year, according to IDC, but Apple's share of the smartphone market has been languishing at under one percent. Nevertheless the tech giant is not ready to give up, recently pledging an investment of $45 million to open app development centres in several Indonesian cities in a bid to meet the requirements, according to a proposal submitted to the government by Apple and seen by AFP. In July the industry ministry relaxed the rules to allow software, such as apps, to be classified as "local content", senior official I Gusti Putu Suryawirawan said. But the plan has met resistance, highlighting divisions within the government over how to deal with foreign investment. The barriers being thrown up to smartphone makers fly in the face of President Joko Widodo's own avowed aim to transform Indonesia into Southeast Asia's biggest "digital economy" by 2020, by attracting foreign investment in the tech sector and boosting e-commerce. "On the one hand you talk about the digital economy, on the other hand, all the regulations cancel out those intentions," John Riady of major conglomerate Lippo Group said at a recent forum in Jakarta.

Five full weeks, and yet it’s still next to impossible to find the model that everyone wants. The larger iPhone 7 Plus is vastly superior to its smaller sibling this year, and Apple’s new glossy jet black color is obviously the most desirable color of the season. It’s also the most difficult color for Apple’s manufacturing partners to create, and you know what happens when high demand meets low supply. If you want a jet black iPhone 7 Plus, you have two options: you can either stalk your local Apple stores every single morning until you find one in stock, or you can order one online. If you’re not the stalker type and you want your shiny new iPhone before Christmas though, you had better order one right away. DON’T MISS: These are the 2 best iPhone email apps in the world, and I can’t decide which to use As of Friday morning, the soonest shipping estimate for Apple’s jet black iPhone 7 Plus models has now slipped back to December. Apple’s online stores shows a delivery window of six to eight weeks for new orders, which means deliveries are not expected to be made until December 2nd at the earliest and December 16th at the latest. Friday also marks the release of the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in several additional countries, which means supply might not improve anytime soon. On other words, if you want a new iPhone 7 Plus in jet black and you want it to arrive before Christmas, you had better order it right away. If you want one in time for the start of Hanukkah, you might already be too late. Your other option, as we mentioned, is to keep your eye on stores in your area. Stores in big cities have begun to get some shipments of jet black iPhone 7 Plus inventory, but it’s usually sold out by mid-morning. Keep your eye on third-party inventory tracking site iStockNow every morning and be ready to pounce.

But that has perhaps never more been more true than in this election year, with a presidential contest featuring a Republican nominee seen here as more interested in returning to the past than building the future. It is no understatement to say Donald Trump is unpopular among California's tech titans. Along with overwhelmingly donating their dollars to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, many are openly campaigning for Trump's defeat. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Twitter co-founder Ev Williams and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales were among more than 100 people who recently signed an open letter from the tech industry taking a stand against the real estate tycoon. "We have listened to Donald Trump over the past year and we have concluded: Trump would be a disaster for innovation," the letter read. "His vision stands against the open exchange of ideas, free movement of people, and productive engagement with the outside world that is critical to our economy." Trump has railed against immigrants, proposed "shutting down" part of the internet as a security move, criticized Apple for making its products abroad and accused online retail giant Amazon of "getting away with murder, tax-wise." Geoffrey Skelley at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics said the tech sector is also fearful that Trump could start a trade war that would hurt firms with global ambitions. Instead of focusing on the future and technology, Trump appears to his detractors to be bent on resurrecting manufacturing jobs from a bygone era. "Trump is pretty anathema to the things that Silicon Valley wants," said Melinda Jackson, an associate professor of political science at San Jose State University. "He seems to be backward-looking -- to make things like they were before," Jackson told AFP. "And Silicon Valley is about new innovation and the next big thing." - Deep Clinton roots - While Google has laid out a mission of making the world's information freely available and Facebook is striving to connect everyone on the planet, Trump has branded the media an enemy and vowed to build a wall along the border with Mexico to keep people out. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg shot down the idea of a Mexico wall at a developers conference in San Francisco earlier this year. Careful not to make a direct link to Trump's rhetoric, Zuckerberg nonetheless urged those tailoring software for the social network to "choose hope over fear" and to help people build bridges instead of walls. Another Facebook co-founder, Dustin Moskovitz, and his wife committed $20 million to Democratic causes and backed Clinton in the first-ever political endorsement of a candidate by the power couple. "It is clear that if Secretary Clinton wins the election, America will advance much further toward the world we hope to see," Moskovitz and his wife said in an online post. "Donald Trump wins, the country will fall backward, and become more isolated from the global community," they said. Fundraising events for Clinton in Silicon Valley have included one hosted by Apple chief executive Tim Cook -- reportedly once touted as a possible Clinton vice presidential pick -- and another by the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. "The Clintons, and Hillary's roots in particular, go deep here," Jackson said. "She is a known quantity. They trust her for the most part and feel they would at least know what to expect." - Mirror opposite - Apple skipped providing funding or support for the Republican national presidential convention this year citing Trump's comments about immigrants, minorities and women. "Trump represents the mirror opposite of everything they believe (in Silicon Valley); welcoming immigrants, a cosmopolitan global world order," said Gregory Ferenstein, author of "The Age of Optimists," about how technology transforms lives and politics. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman has been an outspoken Trump opponent, promising to donate $5 million to veterans' charities if the Republican candidate releases his tax returns, which he has so far refused to do. Trump has also been engaged in a nasty feud with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, accusing him of using The Washington Post, which Bezos bought for $250 million three years ago, as a weapon against him. "He's using that as a tool for political power against me and against other people, and I'll tell you what, we can't let him get away with it," Trump told Sean Hannity of Fox News. Trump went on to say that Bezos is "using The Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don't tax Amazon like they should be taxed." - Trump's backers - Trump is not completely without support in Silicon Valley. High-profile PayPal founder-turned-venture-capitalist Peter Thiel, an early investor in Facebook, delivered a keynote speech at the Republican convention and has donated significant sums to Trump's campaign. That prompted former Reddit chief Ellen Pao to sever ties between Project Include, which is devoted to promoting diversity in the tech industry, and Y Combinator, a startup incubator Thiel is involved with. "We are completely outraged to read about Thiel donating $1.25 million to Trump," Pao wrote in an online post. "While all of us believe in the ideas of free speech and open platforms, we draw a line here. "Giving more power to someone whose ascension and behavior strike fear into so many people is unacceptable," she said.

REUTERS/Robert Galbraith Apple announced its new music streaming service on Monday, dubbed Apple Music, entering a hotly competitive market but offering a product that comes with tremendous strengths. Calling it a “revolutionary music service,” legendary music industry figure Jimmy Iovine took the stage at the company’s annual conference for developers to unveil what had been widely expected ahead of the event. Apple Music includes a service to connect artists and fans and what the company described as a global radio station called Beats 1. While late to the streaming music business, Apple has strong advantages: deep relationships with music companies; a global brand; and hundreds of millions of customers – and their credit cards – through iTunes. Apple Music’s $9.99 a month price takes effect after a three-month free subscription period. The company is also offering what it calls a “family plan” for $14.99 a month for up to six family members. Earlier in the event, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook announced that so-called “native” apps will be introduced in the next version of the operating system for its Watch that should make apps for its latest gadget speedier and help untether it from the iPhone. The company also unveiled new details about its Apple Pay service, saying it was already supported by more than 2,500 banks and will surpass 1 million locations accepting it next month. In addition, the company said it would roll out the service to the United Kingdom next month. In a related move, Apple said it would rename Passbook, its app for credit and debit cards and boarding passes, to Wallet. Apple Inc shares were down 0.5 percent at $128.05 in afternoon trading. The company also unveiled the next version of its operating system for Macs, El Capitan, continuing the company’s theme of naming key updates to the software after California landmarks. The software will be available in the fall. Like other Apple products, the Watch’s commercial success will likely hinge on a compelling collection of apps. But early apps for the timepiece have been tethered to the iPhone, placing some limits on what developers could do.The expanded software kit should lead to better and faster watch apps, said Bob O’Donnell, an analyst at TECHnalysis Research, in an interview before the event. But it was the music service that was the highlight of the event. The company behind the iPod and iTunes has long been a leader in digital music, but it has lost ground in recent years as subscription services such as Spotify have caught on with consumers. – Reuters Related Posts Tough times ahead for Zimbabwe telecommunication companies Harare - Analysts have forecast a tough financial year ahead for Econet Wireless and the other smaller mobile operators in Zimbabwe, with voice revenues and profitability likely to take a ...

Less than two months after the European Union ordered Ireland to claw back a record 13 billion euros ($14.2 billion) from Apple Inc., saying the nation illegally allowed the iPhone maker to reduce its tax rate, the European Commission will propose legislation for a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base on Tuesday. A 2011 initiative failed to muster the unanimity needed largely because of opposition by Ireland and the U.K. Follow @Brexit for the latest news, and sign up to our Brexit Bulletin for a daily roundup. With Britain preparing to quit the 28-nation bloc, the fresh CCCTB proposal risks leaving Ireland politically isolated when national governments start getting their teeth back into the nitty-gritty. The tax proposition, aimed at strengthening the European single market that Britain has championed, highlights the limits of the U.K.’s commitment to the EU and the extent to which political ideology can trump the country’s economic goals. The plan would save cross-border companies the cost of complying with different rules in each EU country where they file a tax return by establishing a single method for calculating taxable profits.  The U.K. and Ireland have opposed a common EU tax base for fear it would open the door to a harmonization of rates, which both countries say must remain their sovereign right to decide. For Britain in particular, European tax initiatives over the years have been deeply unwelcome because they’re politically toxic domestically. The Brussels-based commission denies the proposal would be a first step toward harmonized rates in the EU, arguing the goal is more tax transparency and fairness. Ireland risks further isolation because the common tax plan is also aimed at hindering those trying to avoid paying levies, and the Irish government is already under fire for allegedly cutting the sweetheart deal with Apple. Ireland and Apple both vowed to fight the decision in the EU courts. SWITZERLAND The impact of Brexit will also be felt this week in another small European country, this one outside the EU: Switzerland. Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker is due to talk to Swiss President Johann Schneider-Ammann on Friday to try again to reconcile the country’s 2014 referendum on curbing immigration with a 1999 EU-Switzerland agreement on the free movement of people. While Switzerland is seeking to enact the plebiscite with a “light” plan that would sidestep quotas for newcomers from EU nations in favor of a requirement that job vacancies be listed at Swiss unemployment centers, the bloc has expressed reservations about procedures for settling any future disputes. Those draft measures, the EU argues, unfairly favor Switzerland. Before the U.K.’s June referendum in which 52 percent of voters opted to leave the EU, the bloc might have been more willing to fudge over the relatively obscure issue of dispute settlement. In the wake of the Brexit vote and U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May’s vow to give priority to regaining national control over immigration, such flexibility would pose risks. The other 27 EU countries and the commission are keen to avoid setting a precedent that could undermine their fundamental common position toward Britain: retaining privileged access to the European single market requires accepting the bloc’s tenet on the free movement of people. The underlying threat is that a failure to settle the EU-Switzerland disagreement over the Swiss immigration plan would jeopardize a total of seven 1999 agreements between both sides including the one on the free movement of people. That’s because there’s a “guillotine clause” that foresees the end of all if one is terminated. After abandoning what would have been flagrant challenges to the free-movement pact and coming a long way to meet EU demands, Switzerland is now talking tough. Its finance minister, Ueli Maurer, on Oct. 20 dismissed the need for further talks with the EU should the parliament in Bern stick with the plan currently on the table. A commission spokesperson declined to comment on Maurer’s remarks. Juncker’s response to Schneider-Ammann on Friday may signal just how determined the EU is to use Switzerland as an example for the upcoming Brexit negotiations. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

October 22 AAPL: 116.60 -0.46 Research team develops portable iPhone-powered lab that can detect cancer with 99% accuracy Chance Miller - 3 weeks ago @ChanceHMiller iPhone Health View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit It’s no secret that Apple has ambitious plans for iPhone and Apple Watch in the health industry, but it’s not the only company looking for ways to integrate smartphones in the medical field. Recently, a research team from Washington State University, under the leadership of assistant professor Lei Li, developed a portable laboratory that’s powered by a smartphone and capable of detecting cancer nearly instantly… Announced on Washington State University’s website, the laboratory is able analyze up to eight different samples at once, giving it unprecedented accuracy. Li says that the portable laboratory is able to detect human interleukin-6 (IL-6), a known biomarker for lung, prostate, liver, breast and epithelial cancers. It works with a spectrometer analyzing the amount and type of chemicals in a sample by measuring the light spectrum. Li’s spectrometer could have a huge impact on cancer detection and research around the world. In addition to being useful at hospitals and clinics in the United States, the lab is portable enough that it can be used around the world in areas where accurate cancer detection is hard to come by. “With our eight channel spectrometer, we can put eight different samples to do the same test, or one sample in eight different wells to do eight different tests. This increases our device’s efficiency,” said Li, who has filed a provisional patent for the work. “The spectrometer would be especially useful in clinics and hospitals that have a large number of samples without on-site labs, or for doctors who practice abroad or in remote areas,” he said. “They can’t carry a whole lab with them. They need a portable and efficient device.” While other smartphone spectrometers exist, the ability to measure up to eight samples at once is what sets Li’s apart. This capability gives it a 99 percent accuracy rate. At first, the device was used primarily with standard lab-controlled samples, but now it is being applied in real world situations. Li has tested his design with an iPhone 5, but is working on an adjustable version that will work with any smartphone. The diagram above offers a more detailed look at how the machine works and how the smartphone’s camera is integrated: More information regarding Li’s research can be read in the journal Biosensors and Bioelectronics.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     KGI: new MacBook Pros and 13″ MacBook next week, iMacs & 5K Cinema Display in 2017 By Christian Zibreg, Oct 22, 2016 Tweet 22 Comments According to revered Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, Apple’s media event next Thursday will serve as a launchpad for a long-awaited update to the aging MacBook Pro notebook lineup, which will see “many” noteworthy upgrades. Apple will also announce a brand new model of the new MacBook with a screen measuring thirteen inches diagonally, Kuo wrote in a note to clients. Some observers think this machine is actually a thirteen-inch MacBook Air with new USB-C ports. As you know, the current Retina MacBook has a 12-inch Retina display. Next-generation iMacs, as well as a rumored 5K resolution display won’t be unveiled at the event because they’re apparently not ready yet. According to the report, the upcoming MacBook Pro refresh will include two models: one with a thirteen-inch screen and the other with a fifteen-inch one. The new machines should have an OLED touch bar replacing the function key row with programmable shortcuts that change from one app to another, Touch ID sensor (likely integrated into the power button), USB-C, Thunderbolt 3 and the same low-profile keyboard with butterfly mechanism like the new MacBook, among other features. The OLED touch bar would be controlled by a new dedicated chip which Kuo claims bears resemblance to the processor that powers the Apple Watch. From the report: Our new predictions also include: (1) Intel’s (US) Skylake processor; (2) the same panel resolution but better display quality and energy efficiency thanks to an oxide panel; (3) a new option of 2TB SSD storage capacity; (4) adoption of a similar processor as Apple Watch to control the OLED touch bar more energy-efficiently in the new MacBook Pro models; and (5) a Type-C & MagSafe-like adapter rolled out by Apple or a third-party supplier, given positive reviews for the MagSafe charging design. The iMac, Apple’s popular all-in-one desktop, as well as its rumored external display with a 27-inch screen featuring 5K resolution (likely matching the resolution of the 5K iMac) should be expected in the first half of 2017, according to the analyst. We also expect Apple to launch new iMacs (21.5-inch and 27-inch) and Cinema Display (27-inch) in mid-1H17. We cannot say for certain whether Apple will announce the new iMacs and Cinema Display on October 27 as the shipping schedule is not imminent. Although the next iMac and 5K display won’t ship this year, Apple could choose to announce and preview them at Thursday’s event. A few years back, the company previewed the radically redesigned Mac Pro even though the powerful desktop computer wouldn’t start shipping until six months later. Speaking of which, Kuo makes absolutely no mention of any Mac Pro-focused refresh. I hope Apple won’t disappoint its loyal fan base of creative pros who need a powerful desktop, Unfortunately, it’s been increasingly difficult to justify dropping more than three-thousand dollars on the Mac Pro’s three-year-old hardware. The Mac-focused “Hello again” media event is scheduled for October 27 and we will be providing remote coverage of the announcements as they happen.

CAIO MARIZ® Quad Core Kaby Lake doesn’t exist yet 5723alex . Kaby Lake is a crappy CPU. Hope Apple won’t use it. Rolf Bause Yeah, but they are coming in the beginning of 2017. We are waiting for 2 years now with the new MacBooks, without any update, not even a processor update… Might as well wait a few months longer now and at least catch the Intel release cycle. All the other big manufacturers already have Skylake… howcome they are able to do this, and Apple isn’t? CAIO MARIZ® Kaby lake will not support Intel Iris Pro Graphics, so worse battery, they will jump Kaby lake Rolf Bause from what I’ve read they will have an Intel HD Graphics 620… CAIO MARIZ® Less powerful than current Haswell Iris Pro, Broadwell Iris Pro and Skylake Iris Pro Rolf Bause Ok, in this particular case Skylake is probably really the better choice then (what r they thinking at Intel)… But when did this ever happen, that the next gen was worse than the previous? My main point was: Why the hell aren’t they able to synchronize their release cycles better for christ sake? Apple is (as far as I know) Intels biggest buyer of chips… you could really expect better imo. CAIO MARIZ® I don’t know why they can’t synchronize their release cycles with the intel’s ones Jack Wong Other than i5 and 2013 mid MacBook Air, I don’t even remember what is the name of my processors?! Does it really matter? Rolf Bause Yes it does. Jack Wong Would you mind to list one to two benefit of that? Rolf Bause The benefit is that you know if you got the latest technology or not and if you got screwed or not 😉 And you probably have a Haswell btw Jack Wong I don’t really concern about the CPU anymore, how powerful it could be on a laptop. I would rather have 16GB ram, longer battery life and more cheap SSD storage on the Air since the task I am doing the most are just browsing, remote into other computers and word/excel file. I don’t convert video that often. But it seems like Apple doesn’t want to give that 16GB RAM to the MacBook and MacBook Air line… Rolf Bause You don’t need 16GB of RAM for any of this 😉 But in general I’m with you there. The RAM and SSD upgrade option are just ridiculous… it’s pure greed. If Xiaomi develop their Mi notebooks some more (idk, v2-3 or so :D)… I’ll maybe give it a shot and make a hackintosh :D. They give you all these things: removeable ssd, 2nd ssd slot – for half the price. Jack Wong Yes/No, I am trying so hard to utilize the ram usage on the Virtual Box, plugins and browsers… Just like do we need 1TB SSD storage on laptop?! Yes/No, I would be more lazy to organize if I have 1TB storage but like you said… the upgrade price for SSD is ridiculous… I have 8GB ram and 512GB SSD, 256GB originally, but I got really lucky to get a 512GB SSD(pulled from MacBook Pro) from eBay for $375 last year then sold the 256GB for $200. If I want any Mac laptop with 512GB… it would cost me 1.5k+… I guess… I can only have 1 wish for my next laptop, either USB-C chargeable or 16GB ram. Rolf Bause Transcend has some decent SSD upgrades (Transcend JetDrive). 500gb cost a little less than 300 bucks… 1tb around 500. Jack Wong Those are not as fast, no thank you. If there is no new laptop that I can afford/like on this Thurs, then I would get a new battery for the current Air, I will also go for OEM instead of third party. Rolf Bause The PCI-e based ones aren’t as fast… the SATA drives are supposed to be fine. askep3 “The OLED touch bar would be controlled by a new dedicated chip which Kuo claims bears resemblance to the processor that powers the Apple Watch.” This way the main processsor doesn’t have to handle the touch bar! Alan Aurmont So, the lineup: Air is dead Mini will be dead soon It all leads to the following naming: iPad – iPad Pro iPhone – iPhone Pro (next year with iPhone 8) Mac – Mac Pro MacBook – MacBook Pro Now, the size is where I’m not quite sure what’s gonna happen. 13″ MacBook makes it all confusing. Will they revive 11″ and kill 12″? If they do, we may have 11″/13″ MacBook and 13″/15″ MacBook Pro. 12″ alongside 13″ just wouldn’t make any sense.

October 22 AAPL: 116.60 -0.46 Apple continues its focus on fashion, will again sponsor the annual Met Gala Chance Miller - 3 weeks ago @ChanceHMiller Jony Ive Gala Jony Ive at 2016 Met Gala View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit The Metropolitan Museum of Art has announced its annual Costume Institute exhibition and gala and Apple again will be one of the sponsors for the event, according to Vogue. The 2017 Met Gala theme will be “Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons.” For those unfamiliar, Res Kawakubo is a prominent fashion design, while Comme des Garçons is her label. Apple sponsored its first Met Gala earlier this year, with Jony Ive serving as a co-chair alongside Taylor Swift. Last year’s theme was a bit more in Apple’s wheelhouse being “Manus X Machina” and focusing on the convergence of fashion and technology. Nevertheless, it doesn’t appear that Apple was pushed away by this year’s more fashion-centric theme. In addition to Apple, Condé Nast, Farfetch, H&M, and Maison Valentino will also sponsor the event, while Katy Perry, Pharrell Williams, and Anna Wintour will serve as this year’s co-chairs. The 2017 Met Gala will take place on May 1st and feature a variety of different clothing pieces from Kawakubo, according to Vogue: The exhibit will feature about 120 Comme des Garçons womenswear designs by Kawakubo, dating back to the label’s first runway collection in 1981, all the way to her most recent shows. The pieces will be arranged by contrasting themes (East/West, male/female, past/present), which touch upon Kawakubo’s fascination with “in-betweenness.” The mannequins featuring Kawakubo’s designs will also be more accessible than ever, as they will be placed at eye-level without any glass or other physical barriers between them and the viewer. Since the introduction of the Apple Watch, Apple has expressed a heightened interest in fashion, working with boutiques around the world to sell its wrist wearable, as well as large department stores like Macy’s. Additionally, the Apple Watch itself was showcased by Vogue two separate times. It’s unclear if Apple executives will again attend the Met Gala as it doesn’t have anyone representing as a co-chair. Last year, however, Jony Ive, Tim Cook, and Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Steve Jobs, were all in attendance. Jony Ive also opened the event with a speech last year.

Fall Drinks Pumpkin Spice Latte The PSL is by far one of Starbucks’ most popular seasonal beverages. This year marks the PSL’s 13th year; handcrafted with espresso and steamed milk, topped off with whipped cream and a dash of pumpkin pie topping, it’s easy to see why the PSL remains a crowd-pleaser. Salted Caramel Mocha The Salted Caramel Mocha is once again listed on Starbucks’ fall menu, made from a blend of toffee nut syrup and mocha sauce combined with coffee and milk, then topped with sweetened whipped cream, caramel drizzle, and a blend of turbinado sugar and sea salt. Chile Mocha The Chile Mocha joined the PSL this fall to bring a little heat to the spice party. Made with espresso and steamed milk infused with a cocoa and cinnamon powder, topped with a dollop of whipped cream and finished with a sprinkle of Chile Mocha topping, consisting of ancho and cayenne chile pepper, cinnamon, paprika, sugar, and a touch of sea salt. The Chile Mocha is also available as a Frappuccino, or as a coffee-free hot chocolate. A sip for every shade of the season. Pumpkin Spice Latte, Chile Mocha, Salted Caramel Mocha. ???? #FallFavorites pic.twitter.com/lfLcyn1BSP — Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) October 19, 2016 Extras Almond milk Starbucks’ customers can now enjoy customized beverages with Starbucks Almond milk. Starting Sept. 6, more than 4,600 stores will offer Almond milk as a non-dairy alternative. Nature’s Sweet Nature’s Sweet is Starbucks’ first Stevia-based, zero calorie sweetener. Need Something More? PSL season may be back, but I guarantee you’ve never heard of these drool-worthy fall concoctions. “At the beginning of the season, we saw a lot of excitement around fall flavors, especially after we introduced Starbucks Almond milk,” Sarah Spencer, Starbucks marketing manager said in a press release. “We wanted to tap into our baristas’ beverage artistry by giving them the opportunity to create new fall-inspired drink recipes to share with customers in their stores.” Feast your eyes upon Starbucks’ “unofficial” fall menu created by the baristas themselves.

The report says Apple will be releasing three Mac laptops at the event, a new 13-inch MacBook, 13-inch MacBook Pro and 15-inch MacBook Pro. It goes on to say that Apple will not be releasing a new iMac or Apple External Display this year, and should be expected in the first half of 2017. However, KGI does not know if Apple will be announcing new iMacs or new Cinema Display early at the event, but is confident that they aren’t ready for prime time. If you’re looking for a new Mac mini or Mac Pro, don’t hold your breath as Ming-Chi Kuo does not know or mention the products at all. While KGI says that the new MacBook Pro will pack “many” upgrades, it does not go into detail. It’s not guaranteed that all features will be available across all 13-inch or 15-inch models. If history is any indication, we should expect Apple to pack more features into the larger 15-inch model. Another product that KGI mentions is the new “13 inch MacBook”, a successor to the existing 12-inch Retina MacBook, released back in 2015. It does not specifically mention any updates to the MacBook Air line. Personally, I was looking forward to a 14-inch MacBook as the successor to the 12-inch MacBook. Having two variants of a 13-inch notebook, let alone having the screen size so close to the 12-inch seems peculiar.

Fall Drinks Pumpkin Spice Latte The PSL is by far one of Starbucks’ most popular seasonal beverages. This year marks the PSL’s 13th year; handcrafted with espresso and steamed milk, topped off with whipped cream and a dash of pumpkin pie topping, it’s easy to see why the PSL remains a crowd-pleaser. Salted Caramel Mocha The Salted Caramel Mocha is once again listed on Starbucks’ fall menu, made from a blend of toffee nut syrup and mocha sauce combined with coffee and milk, then topped with sweetened whipped cream, caramel drizzle, and a blend of turbinado sugar and sea salt. Chile Mocha The Chile Mocha joined the PSL this fall to bring a little heat to the spice party. Made with espresso and steamed milk infused with a cocoa and cinnamon powder, topped with a dollop of whipped cream and finished with a sprinkle of Chile Mocha topping, consisting of ancho and cayenne chile pepper, cinnamon, paprika, sugar, and a touch of sea salt. The Chile Mocha is also available as a Frappuccino, or as a coffee-free hot chocolate. A sip for every shade of the season. Pumpkin Spice Latte, Chile Mocha, Salted Caramel Mocha. ???? #FallFavorites pic.twitter.com/lfLcyn1BSP — Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) October 19, 2016 Extras Almond milk Starbucks’ customers can now enjoy customized beverages with Starbucks Almond milk. Starting Sept. 6, more than 4,600 stores will offer Almond milk as a non-dairy alternative. Nature’s Sweet Nature’s Sweet is Starbucks’ first Stevia-based, zero calorie sweetener. Need Something More? PSL season may be back, but I guarantee you’ve never heard of these drool-worthy fall concoctions. “At the beginning of the season, we saw a lot of excitement around fall flavors, especially after we introduced Starbucks Almond milk,” Sarah Spencer, Starbucks marketing manager said in a press release. “We wanted to tap into our baristas’ beverage artistry by giving them the opportunity to create new fall-inspired drink recipes to share with customers in their stores.” Feast your eyes upon Starbucks’ “unofficial” fall menu created by the baristas themselves. Salted Caramel Pumpkin Frappuccino Ask for: A Grande Pumpkin Spice Frappuccino Blended Beverage with toffee nut syrup (two pumps), topped with whipped cream, caramel drizzle, and sea salt.

Compartir Twittear Compartir Compartir Imprimir Enviar por mail Rectificar AT&T Inc. está presionando para alcanzar un acuerdo de compra de Time Warner Inc. el lunes, con miras a cerrar la puerta a otros posibles postores, según una persona familiarizada con la situación. Las negociaciones entre las compañías se han acelerado desde que Bloomberg informara el jueves por primera vez que ejecutivos se habían reunido en las últimas semanas para analizar potenciales combinaciones comerciales, indicó la fuente, quien solicitó que su nombre se mantuviera en el anonimato porque las conversaciones son privadas. Parte de la preocupación de AT&T es que otros postores como Google de Alphabet Inc. o Apple Inc. podrían involucrarse, dijo la fuente. La oferta sería por US$ 110 la acción, lo que equivale a US$ 86 mil millones. Comprar Time Warner daría a AT&T – que ya es uno de los principales proveedores de televisión de paga, telefonía móvil e internet de Estados Unidos – programación prémium para ofrecer a sus millones de suscriptores, desde HBO hasta la NBA y Cartoon Network. El CEO Randall Stephenson está transformado a la empresa telefónica de Dallas en un gigante de medios y entretenimiento, y ahora tiene en la mira a uno de los principales estudios cinematográficos de Hollywood y productores de TV. “El mercado está cambiando rápidamente y AT&T quiere ser líder”, dijo Roger Entner, analista de Recon Analytics LLC. Las acciones de Time Warner, el dueño de CNN, HBO y los estudios Warner Bros., subían en la cotización del viernes, avanzando hasta 14 por ciento a US$94,44. Eso da a la compañía una valuación de mercado superior a los US$70.000 millones e impulsa a la acción por encima de los US$85 por acción que en 2014 ofreció sin éxito 21st Century Fox Inc. de Rupert Murdoch. AT&T, la mayor compañía estadounidense de televisión pagada gracias a que posee DirecTV, cayó hasta 4,4 por ciento a US$37,38. Es improbable que Apple presente una oferta por Time Warner, según una fuente con conocimiento de la materia. El jefe de contenido y servicios de Apple, Eddy Cue, analizó la idea de un posible acuerdo con el jefe de estrategia corporativa de Time Warner, Olaf Olafsson, a fines del año pasado y comentó en una discusión en un podio el jueves que era un gran fanático de Home Box Office, propiedad de la compañía. Google no respondió de manera inmediata a la solicitud de comentarios. AT&T y Time Warner declinaron hacer comentarios. “Siempre hemos creído que la combinación de contenido y distribución tiene sentido”, dijo un analista de la industria. Time Warner “ha sido el mayor productor de contenido de películas y televisión. Dada la rápida evolución del universo de distribución, creemos que el poseer contenido podría ser beneficioso”. El máximo ejecutivo de Time Warner, Jeff Bewkes, está dispuesto a vender si recibe una oferta que considere justa, señaló una de estas fuentes. AT&T se ha centrado en objetivos de medios de comunicación y entretenimiento que valgan entre US$2.000 millones y US$50.000 millones, indicaron a comienzos de este mes fuentes familiarizadas con los planes.

In line with long-standing rumors, Kuo believes the highlight of the event will be a redesigned MacBook Pro in both 13-inch and 15-inch sizes, adopting an OLED touch bar and Touch ID sensor, USB-C, Thunderbolt 3, and the same butterfly keyboard design introduced on the MacBook in 2015. Kuo also adds several new tidbits to the rumor mix: Our new predictions also include: (1) Intel’s (US) Skylake processor; (2) the same panel resolution but better display quality and energy efficiency thanks to an oxide panel; (3) a new option of 2TB SSD storage capacity; (4) adoption of a similar processor as Apple Watch to control the OLED touch bar more energy-efficiently in the new MacBook Pro models; and (5) a Type-C & MagSafe-like adapter rolled out by Apple or a third-party supplier, given positive reviews for the MagSafe charging design.Beyond the MacBook Pro, Kuo says Apple will also be introducing a "13-inch MacBook," a claim he has shared previously. Rather than being a slightly larger version of the current 12-inch MacBook, however, this is likely to be a MacBook Air, which would align with other rumors claiming that only the 13-inch MacBook Air will be seeing an update with new USB-C ports. On the desktop side, rumors have indicated that Apple is working on updated iMac models with discrete AMD graphics options, as well as a new standalone external 5K display, but Kuo says those products will not be ready until the first half of next year. It is still possible, however, that Apple could announce them at next week's event. We also expect Apple to launch new iMacs (21.5-inch and 27-inch) and Cinema Display (27-inch) in mid- 1H17. We cannot say for certain whether Apple will announce the new iMacs and Cinema Display on October 27 as the shipping schedule is not imminent.Apple's event is being held at the company's Cupertino campus and kicks off at 10:00 AM Pacific Time on Thursday. MacRumors will have full coverage both here on the site and on our @MacRumorsLive Twitter account, and Apple will be offering a live video stream of the event.

Thankfully, we won’t have to endure Apple’s stale and stagnant Mac lineup for much longer. Earlier this week, Apple sent out invitations for a special media event set to take place on October 27. Apple, in typical fashion, hasn’t told us what’s on the agenda but it’s no secret that the event will focus primarily on new Macs. It’s also no secret that the star of the show will be a completely retooled MacBook Pro with a number of snazzy new bells and whistles. DON’T MISS: Google’s new Pixel XL is no match for iPhone 7 Plus in one key area If you’ve been in the market for a new Mac, you certainly won’t want to miss next week’s event. And to get you primed for what will hopefully be some compelling new products, we’ve put together a list highlighting everything we know about Apple’s upcoming MacBook Pro. First things first, the killer feature on Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro will reportedly be the addition of an OLED display panel located towards the top of the keyboard. Rather than expanding the existing keyboard, it’s believed that the OLED panel will be located where the function keys typically reside. This past May, photos purporting to be from Apple’s new MacBook Pro leaked online and, surprise surprise, note the empty space where the function row keys usually are. As to the inherent advantages of such a design, an OLED display on the keyboard would allow the keys to dynamically change to more appropriately fit whatever app you happen to be using. As an illustrative example, designer Martin Hajek earlier this year produced a number of tantalizing concept images which showcase how the feature might operate. The images below, for example, show what the OLED display might look like with Spotify running. These are just concepts, remember, but the possibilities of an OLED display offering up app-specific shortcuts is certainly compelling. All the more intriguing are reports that users will have the ability to customize app-specific shortcuts to their liking. Late this August, the French site Consomac unearthed code from Apple’s Pages app which strongly hints that the shortcuts on the OLED display — which Apple internally calls the Dynamic Function Row — can be tweaked by users. Imagine, for example, selecting a block of text and with the tap of a button instantly formatting it to your liking without having to go sifting through a maze of menus. We would imagine that Apple will have more appealing examples to show us come next Thursday. Another intriguing detail about Apple’s forthcoming MacBook Pro models is that they will have Touch ID integrated into the keyboard itself. This should be particularly useful given that users running Mac OS Sierra can now take advantage of Apple Pay on the web. As for other details, Apple’s new MacBook Pro will reportedly be a little bit thinner than its predecessor, will feature a larger trackpad, and will include a keyboard based on the butterfly mechanism Apple first introduced us to with the 12-inch MacBook. If this particular rumor pans out, expect the keys on the new MacBook Pro to have a slightly larger surface area. Apple touts the benefits of its butterfly mechanism thusly: Traditional keyboards use a scissor mechanism, which tends to wobble around the edges. This creates a lack of precision when you strike anywhere except the center of the key. We needed to reduce key wobbling for a keyboard this thin; otherwise, striking a key off-center could result in the keycap hitting bottom before a keystroke registers. So we designed a unique butterfly mechanism, which is wider than the scissor mechanism and has a single assembly made from a stiffer material — allowing for a more stable, responsive key that takes up less vertical space. This innovative design improves stability, uniformity, and control — no matter where you press on the key. Additionally, don’t be surprised if the trackpad on the new MacBook Pro is completely stationary a’la Apple’s current 12-inch MacBook. As far as ports are concerned, consumers can likely kiss the beloved MagSafe adapter and traditional USB ports goodbye and instead say hello to new USB-C and Thuderbolt 3 ports. While Apple may very well just include one USB-C port, one would imagine that Apple would outfit its Pro notebook with more than just USB-C port. With respect to internals, we can naturally expect to see some great speed and graphics improvements. Specifically, the new MacBook Pros will reportedly house Intel Skylake processors which should make the machines much more power efficient, a welcome perk on a Pro device that will likely be used as a workhorse by many. On the graphics front, don’t be surprised to see a GPU which takes advantage of AMD’s Polaris architecture. Size wise, Apple will reportedly release two MacBook Pro models, one in a 13-inch form factor and another in a 15-inch form factor. While there was some concern that Apple might do away with the headphone jack on its new MacBook Pros, the leaked chasis below should help alleviate any concerns in that regard.   Last and not least, expect to see Apple’s revamped MacBook Pro hit store shelves in 2016, presumably before the busy holiday shopping season kicks off.

Time Warner, una de la mayores fábricas de producción de películas y programas televisivos, decide ponerse así en manos del operador de móviles AT&T, una de las principales empresas que controla el acceso a Internet y a los canales de televisión de pago. La operación está valorada en 108.700 millones de dólares cuando se incluye la deuda. MÁS INFORMACIÓN AT&T pacta la compra de DirectTV AT&T ultima la compra de Time Warner Apple planteó a Time Warner la idea de una fusión Rupert Murdoch hace una oferta por el conglomerado Time Warner Jeff Bewkes, consejero delegado del conglomerado de entretenimiento, llevaba tiempo abierto a negociar siempre que la oferta fuese justa. AT&T valora con su propuesta a Time Warner en unos 85.400 millones de dólares (78.000 millones de euros). En concreto, paga 107,5 dólares por título, a partes iguales en efectivo y acciones. Además asume 24.000 millones de deuda. Así Bewkes procede a forjar la operación empresarial más importante del año, que supera los 66.000 millones que desembolsó Bayer por el control de Monsanto. AT&T, por su parte, mueve ficha para evitar que tecnológicas como Apple o Alphabet le tomen la delantera en un momento crucial y en su mayor compra desde Bell South en 2006. La firma electrónica de Cupertino ya se aproximó a Time Warner hace unos meses. Como hizo Comcast con la compra de NBC Universal, la compañía de telecomunicaciones de Dallas tendrá acceso a cadenas como la CNN, TNT o la HBO. También contará con sus propios estudios de producción de películas y series, con Warner Brothers. Las informaciones que circulan desde el jueves sobre la maniobra de AT&T hizo que el valor de las acciones de Time Warner superara los 85 dólares que puso sobre la mesa Rupert Murdoch hace dos años para fusionarla con 21st Century Fox tras separarla de News Corporation. No se espera que Apple, Alphabet o Fox vayan a mover ficha en esta ocasión. Entre otros motivos, porque AT&T lleva casi tres décadas forjando acuerdos y es por lo tanto con la que mejor encaje tiene. La fusión convertirá la segunda mayor compañía de telefonía móvil de EE UU en un conglomerado de medios y entretenimiento que ofrecerá a la vez servicios de conexión a Internet en los hogares y programas de televisión. El camino lo abrió Randall Stephenson hace un año, con la compra del proveedor de televisión de pago vía satélite DirectTV. Time Warner era el mejor activo que tenía ante sí para cumplir su plan de transformar AT&T. Respuesta a los cambios Las dos compañías llevan un siglo respondiendo a los cambios que viven sus respectivas industrias. AT&T, fundada en 1885, fue partida hace tres décadas para repartir el monopolio de las telecomunicaciones. Pero desde hace unos años, los operadores tradicionales están sumidos en un proceso contrario de consolidación. Cada vez más consumidores consumen entretenimiento a través de sus móviles y de dispositivos en sus televisiones conectados a Internet. La misma combinación se observa en los proveedores de televisión de pago, que lidera AT&T con cerca de 25 millones de abonados. Le sigue Comcast y Charter Communications, que acaba de adquirir Time Warner Cable por 56.000 millones, antigua filial de Time Warner hasta que se separó en 2009. Cablevisión se fusionó también este año con la europea Altice, mientras que Viacom está en conversaciones con CBS para integrar sus respectivas plataformas. Todas estas maniobras entrecruzadas entre operadores de telecomunicaciones y distribuidores de contenido buscan prevenir que los abonados se descuelguen de sus servicios por alternativas más baratas que encuentran en la red como Netflix o Amazon. AT&T, como Comcast y Verizon, será así propietaria del contenido que podrá emitir tanto por la conexión del cable o en los teléfonos móviles. La amenaza de Trump La operación tendrá que ser aprobada por los reguladores. AT&T ya se vio forzada hace unos años a abandonar la compra de su rival T-Mobile USA. Ese bloqueo la obligó a buscar alternativas para poder crecer, integrando otros negocios como el de la televisión y medios digitales. Verizon optó en paralelo por hacerse con AOL y Yahoo. Las nuevas normas para garantizar el acceso neutral a la red dan sentido, además, a la combinación de contenido y distribución. El candidato republicano a las presidenciales, Donald Trump, amenazó este sábado en un mitin de campaña en Pensilvania con bloquear la operación si el 8 de noviembre llega a la Casa Blanca. Considera que este tipo de transacciones “destruyen la democracia”, al concentrar “tanto poder en unas pocas manos”. En este sentido, hizo referencia a la fusión de Comcast con la NBC Universal, que “nunca debió ser autorizada”. AT&T tenía el viernes una valoración de mercado próxima a los 230.000 millones. La operación, sin embargo, provocará que se endeude todavía más un año después de desembolsar 48.500 millones por DirectTV. Su apalancamiento asciende a los 120.000 millones, a los que se suman los 24.000 millones de Time Warner. La compañía tiene ya la tercera nota crediticia más baja. Para esquivar la categoría de bono basura y conservar liquidez, podría rebajar el dividendo a los accionistas.

October 22 AAPL: 116.60 -0.46 KGI: Apple to release new 13-inch MacBook plus two MacBook Pros at next week’s event, new iMac & 5K Display coming next year Benjamin Mayo - 3 weeks ago @bzamayo Feature MacBook Pro View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Reliable Apple analyst KGI has published a report on Saturday outlining their predictions for Apple’s Mac roadmap ahead of the media event on October 27th. The report says that Apple will launch three new MacBooks at the event, a new 13 inch MacBook, a new 13 inch MacBook Pro and a new 15 inch MacBook Pro. It goes on to say that new iMacs and the Apple external display will not be shipping this year; those should be expected in the first half of 2017. KGI does not know if Apple will announce early the new iMacs or new Cinema Display (detailed as having a 27 inch panel) at the event, but Ming-Chi Kuo seems confident that they are not ready to release. If you are waiting on a new Mac Pro, then the outlook is still murky: Kuo simply does not mention the product at all. 9to5Mac has previously reported that Apple is developing a new external 5K display with an integrated GPU. The news on what KGI does expect Apple to announce and ship is interesting, three new Mac laptops in total across two product lines. The new Retina MacBook Pro, expected to include Touch ID, an OLED function row above the keyboard and new internals, will be debuting in both 13 inch and 15 inch screen sizes. The new OLED screen panel is mocked up in our hero image above; rumor mill suggests the screen will show contextual commands and shortcuts depending on the currently-used app. A Macotakara report says the new laptops will feature only USB-C ports (backed by Thunderbolt 3) and will not use a MagSafe power connector for charging. The KGI report says the new MacBook Pro will have “many” major upgrades, but does not go into specifics. It is not guaranteed that all the features will be necessarily available across both the 13 inch and 15 inch sizes. If Apple follows tradition, the highest-spec options will be reserved for the 15 inch form factor only. New MacBook Pros are long overdue; the currently-sold models use generations-old Broadwell chips. The other product KGI says is coming is a new “13 inch MacBook”, as a successor to the 12 inch single-port Retina MacBook first released in 2015. By the way, this is not the first time that KGI has said that Apple is developing a 13 inch version of the Retina MacBook. KGI makes no mention of any changes to the MacBook Air line. It would be somewhat strange to have both a 12 inch and a 13 inch Retina MacBook in Apple’s lineup simultaneously as they are so similar. Unfortunately, KGI does not elaborate about what the 13 inch MacBook might bring to the table that the 12 inch does not. Maybe the 13 inch version is more powerful, boasting better internal specs in a slightly larger total chassis. I guess we’ll have to wait and see for Apple to announce these things for real at a media event on its campus this Thursday. If you believe KGI, we’ll see at least three new Mac products shipping by the end of the month including the long-awaited update to the MacBook Pros … which are likely to be the stars of the show. 9to5Mac will have full coverage of all the announcements as they happen.

Time Warner, una de la mayores fábricas de producción de películas y programas televisivos, decide ponerse así en manos del operador de móviles AT&T, una de las principales empresas que controla el acceso a Internet y a los canales de televisión de pago. La operación está valorada en 108.700 millones de dólares cuando se incluye la deuda. MÁS INFORMACIÓN AT&T pacta la compra de DirectTV AT&T ultima la compra de Time Warner Apple planteó a Time Warner la idea de una fusión Rupert Murdoch hace una oferta por el conglomerado Time Warner Jeff Bewkes, consejero delegado del conglomerado de entretenimiento, llevaba tiempo abierto a negociar siempre que la oferta fuese justa. AT&T valora con su propuesta a Time Warner en unos 85.400 millones de dólares (78.000 millones de euros). En concreto, paga 107,5 dólares por título, a partes iguales en efectivo y acciones. Además asume 24.000 millones de deuda. Así Bewkes procede a forjar la operación empresarial más importante del año, que supera los 66.000 millones que desembolsó Bayer por el control de Monsanto. AT&T, por su parte, mueve ficha para evitar que tecnológicas como Apple o Alphabet le tomen la delantera en un momento crucial y en su mayor compra desde Bell South en 2006. La firma electrónica de Cupertino ya se aproximó a Time Warner hace unos meses. Como hizo Comcast con la compra de NBC Universal, la compañía de telecomunicaciones de Dallas tendrá acceso a cadenas como la CNN, TNT o la HBO. También contará con sus propios estudios de producción de películas y series, con Warner Brothers. Las informaciones que circulan desde el jueves sobre la maniobra de AT&T hizo que el valor de las acciones de Time Warner superara los 85 dólares que puso sobre la mesa Rupert Murdoch hace dos años para fusionarla con 21st Century Fox tras separarla de News Corporation. No se espera que Apple, Alphabet o Fox vayan a mover ficha en esta ocasión. Entre otros motivos, porque AT&T lleva casi tres décadas forjando acuerdos y es por lo tanto con la que mejor encaje tiene. La fusión convertirá la segunda mayor compañía de telefonía móvil de EE UU en un conglomerado de medios y entretenimiento que ofrecerá a la vez servicios de conexión a Internet en los hogares y programas de televisión. El camino lo abrió Randall Stephenson hace un año, con la compra del proveedor de televisión de pago vía satélite DirectTV. Time Warner era el mejor activo que tenía ante sí para cumplir su plan de transformar AT&T.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion MacBook Pro 2016 Release Date, Latest Rumors: MacBook Pro on Event, OLED Display Panel, Butterfly Keyboard By Neal A. Lasta Oct 22, 2016 | 12:50 PM Apple fans are eagerly anticipating the latest version of the MacBook Pro. Many are in agreement that the MacBook Pro needs a high order revamp and that a 2016 version is much needed. Because of this, there have been rumors about the MacBook Pro 2016 its specs, features and release date over the past couple of months. Fortunately, there have been news from the Cupertino-based company itself that may indicate the MacBook Pro 2016 will be introduced very soon. Apple has officially sent invitations to its October 27 event. Although many people already know that the event will most likely occur, this time it's truly official. New MacBook Pro on Event Apple, like always, didn't reveal what the agenda for the event is, but the invitations offered clues that point to a MacBook Pro 2016. For example, the title of the event is "hello again," which, theoretically, could mean we're going to see the MacBook Pro again, which hasn't received any key update for the longest time. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit New Features: OLED Display Panel If rumors and reports are true, then one of the most anticipated features of the MacBook Pro 2016 is the OLED display panel which can be found above the keyboard. This doesn't mean that the keyboard size will be expanded due to another panel; rather, the OLED panel will replace where the function keys used to be. There have been leaked photos, such as the ones found here, that show this OLED display panel may be more than just a rumor. In a couple of these photos, one can see that there is an empty space where the function keys are located in a standard keyboard. The OLED display panel is said to offer various types of functions depending on what app is running. For example, if your MacBook Pro 2016 is running Spotify, then the play, back and forward symbols along with the volume bar may appear on the panel. Another leak shows code that indicates the shortcuts that appear in the OLED display panel can be customized by the users. Specs: Butterfly Mechanism Keyboard Other reports indicate that the new MacBook Pro will be much thinner than the previous version. It will also have a bigger trackpad. It will also have a butterfly mechanism-based keyboard. This butterfly mechanism isn't new to Apple keyboards; in fact, it was introduced in the 12-inch version of the MacBook. The MacBook Pro 2016 is also rumored to have USB-C ports, Thunderbolt 3 ports, and much improved performance and speed. The speed and performance upgrades are due to the addition of Intel Skylake processors, AMD Polaris and many more. Previous rumors indicate that the MacBook Pro 2016 will no longer have the headphone jack. But there are leaked images that show that this is not the case; perhaps this is good news to many Apple MacBook users. These are just some of the rumored specs and features of the MacBook Pro 2016 which may be introduced on October 27. While we can only speculate, the actual event is only a few days away, and Apple fans are excited about what the company has to offer next.

Tuesday, November 15, 2016 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Berita Sarawak Berita Sabah Berita Nasional Berita Iban Sukan thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Other Columns  Such is human nature October 23, 2016, Sunday Barry Kee APPLE polishing – currying favour through flattery or obsequiousness – is an old practice. Ever since the first animals set foot on the planet and evolved a hierarchical system, the practice had taken hold. During the Age of Chivalry, court jesters were an integral part of the royal setting. Their specific duty was to provide amusement but, more precisely, to butter their neurotic despots. Monarchs who ruled by divine right expected nothing less not only from fools or jesters such as Wamba in Sir Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe but also the entire retinue of titled hangers-on. The inner sanctum of absolute monarchs adhered to the strictest code of dinduct, decorum and speech. Anyone within this kingly circle who so much as appeared to step on a royal toe, could lose his or her head. “Boss, don’t you think SIX is enough?” During the reign of the Tudors, questioning King Henry VIII’s intention to take wife No. 7 in such brazen manner was a surefire way to commit suicide. Those foolish enough to do it would certainly have ended up suffering the same fate as Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII’s second wife, said to be still haunting the Bloody Tower of London today – with her head tugged underneath her arm. Egotistical medieval dukes, earls and barons demanded just as much adulation from their henchmen, serves and slaves. Even among the gentry, the harsh exploits of the wicked stepmother are legendarily infamous. Apple polishing is especially prevalent in high places and corridors of power. And in the hands of shrewd manipulators, it can work with deadly effect. Human nature being such, people need to feel important and loved. These two great human needs provide fertile breeding grounds for apple-polishing which feeds the human ego in fulfilment of the human need to feel important and loved. The accomplished apple-polishers will invariably get the attention and business of those they suck up to. And the suckers are usually conceited people who never hear anything but praise! According to one account, a student discovered that poor performance might be ignored in proportion to the favour presented to the teacher. As the story goes, in Sumer, an ancient region of Babylonia, the daily life of the Sumerians was well recorded on clay tablets. One day, while smoothening his tablet and copying his lessons for the day, the student appeared to have done something wrong and was repeatedly flogged. In desperation, he asked his father to invite the teacher over for an evening meal. The father agreed – and the teacher was dined and wined and even given a new garment. The scheme worked. As he was leaving, the teacher, beaming from ear to ear, said the boy was already “becoming a man of learning.” Scientists, translating the tablet, refer to this account as the earliest case of apple-polishing – at least 4,000 years ago. Apple-polishing has been variously defined as beggarly, bootlicking, grovelling, slavish and synophantic. A couple of local definitions are tripod and three-legged horse. Another one, coined by an ang tau chendol seller at the old Open Air Market at Power Street, Kuching, consists of three Teochew words. They are impolite to divulge. I will give you a hint – the initials are LPK. The polishers will ingratiate themselves to get what they want such as job promotions, business deals and benefits in some other forms while the polished will purr at each shower of praises, even if delivered in snivelling manner, as it fulfills their need to feel important and loved. The mode of conveyance matters little. Apple-polishing can also be said to be paradoxical – some just love doing it and are so good at it that they move up fast in life while others puke at the mere mention of it and are such a disaster at it that in the boss’s books, they will not get to pass Go nor get out of jail free. On the scale of 10 – by the boss’s reckoning – the opportunity for the latter to attain their full potential will at best hover around one or two. Any further movement up or down the scale will depend on whether or not they choose to continue playing hard ball. In the corporate world, some call it managing up but kissing up is better known. As one of the most intractable problems of corporate culture, kissing up can move the goalposts and alter the playing field. Some of the polished get so intoxicated with the praises showered on them that they hardly notice they are being rolled while the polishers climb the corporate ladder and saw off the rungs behind them. One behaviour analyst sees corporate scandals like harassments, bullying or wrongful dismissals as associated fundamentally with the kissing up culture. The victimised are usually those who know the emperor has no clothes but refuse to cover it up. “Even the biggest CEOs need to be loved. But expecting praises as of right from your subordinates can be like a virus. If carried too far, it will poison your judgement and debase your character,” the analyst said. In Bhutanese society, apple-polishers are categorised into three groups – the shakam (supplier), the omnipresent (yes boss) and the sneaky informer. According Norbu Wangchuk, a Bhutanese writer, the shakam (supplier) will not miss any opportunity to make gifts to the boss. He will know the sixth birthday of the boss’ fourth son. He will also make sure he buys a present for his boss on his return from a visit in Kuala Lumpur. The omnipresent (yes boss) will stick like a leech to his boss. He will be the first to pull the chair for the boss and will wish the boss “good day” a dozen times a day. Wangchuk says: “Shoving aside the personal secretary and the security, he will rush to open car door and straighthen his boss’s kabney (a silk scarp worn as part of the gho, the traditional costume of Bhutan) and patang (a type of Asian sword traditionally produced in Bhutan).” There is nothing he will disagree with the boss over. Black is white and white is black – yes boss, if you say so. Everything the boss does or says is perfect. The omnipresent (yes boss) will gladly exchange his soul  with a place in the boss’s good books. As for the sneaky informer, he is like a serpent which occasionally finds a hole to squeeze himself into the boss’s chamber. “He wields classified information on the conduct and performance of other workers. He thrills the boss with what others in the organisation think of the boss and what they would do and not do. “He will even have access to the thoughts and expectations of his boss’s boss – which comes as a vital weapon for his boss,” Wangchuk adds. The sneaky informer is ably portrayed in movies by thespians such as Hong Kong actor Paul Wei Ping-ao who is adept at playing the typical kan syn (hyprocrite, brown noser, sycophant) on the silver screen. Fortunately, as Wangchuk points out, boss-employee relationships, driven by ulterior motives and hidden agendas, are superficial and soon exposed and weakened because they are based on flimsy foundations which are antithetical to the long-term organisational goals. But if there is a clear understanding of the boss and the employee as being two imperfect and fallible human beings with their own personal and organisational goals, then there is a better chance of approproate relationships being established that will enhance productivity and effectiveness. Wangchuk’s characterisation of the apple polishers fits snugly into the psychological niches of most western and Asian societies, especially in the political arena and from both sides of the political divide, including ours. Running after the higher-ups for favours will only entrench the culture of apple-polishing. This, in turn, will render business communities spineless and retard economies over the long term. A man of lofty principles will not stoop to underhand methods. But not all men – regardless of their positions in society – are endowed with the mettle of staintly righteousness to take the moral high ground and such inadequacy of character gives apple-polishing a strangehold on mankind’s destructive character flaws such as vanity, ego, self-centredness and greed, and allows the practice to perpetuate. For after all, what employee would not relish being the apple of the boss’s eye or what second in command would not love being the blue-eyed boy of the commander in chief – even if it takes apple-polishing to get there. Both genders do it and though the practice is, generally,  looked upon with contempt, even by those being polished, if it’s overdone, it’s still the most favoured weapon used to manipulate and titilate the ego. There are few exceptions, if any. The underlings polish the higher-ups with sugar-coated embellishments, never taking the eye off the pie, while the latter enjoy the polishing, ready to share the pie if it has a generous spread of butter.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Why is the Google Pixel graded on a curve when the iPhone isn’t? Yoni Heisler BGR NewsOctober 22, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share During the original iPhone introduction, Steve Jobs referenced a favorite quote of his from legendary computer scientist Alan Kay: "People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware." This philosophy has formed the bedrock of Apple's business strategy for decades now, save for that brief dark period during the mid-90s when Apple sanctioned an ill-fated Mac clone initiative. Apple's devotion to both software and hardware is part of the reason why the iPhone often outclasses every other smartphones on the market. Undeniably, the ability to fine tune software and hardware to work together seamlessly and efficiently is a huge competitive advantage. That being the case, I've been especially intrigued with the Google Pixel as it marks Google's most serious effort to date to exert strict control over the entirety of the Android experience, from both a software and hardware perspective. We've seen Android flagships before, no doubt, but the Google Pixel was designed by Google from the ground up. DON'T MISS: iPhone 7 Plus vs Google Pixel speed tests: Closer, but Android was still crushed in the end As Google's Rick Osterloh explained to Bloomberg not too long ago, the Google Pixel has Google "managing inventory, building relationships with carriers, sourcing components, making supply chain deals and managing distribution." When reviews of the Google Pixel first started appearing online, I was excited to see if the hype behind the Pixel was real. Because competition is often a necessary component and driver of innovation, I was eager to see if the Google Pixel was a device that could potentially force Apple to step up its game. Most of the Google Pixel reviews I came across where overwhelmingly positive, but I couldn't help but notice that Google's smartphone, in many respects, was being afforded a pass that Apple's iPhone rarely, if ever, receives. Whereas the iPhone is seemingly criticized for minute and arguably petty reasons, some of the Google Pixel's shortcomings were curiously and conveniently glossed over with gusto. Touching on this very point, Rene Ritchie has a great piece up on iMore where he explains how the Pixel was graded by tech reviewers on curiously favorable curve. Remember: Google is a serious player in the smartphone business and the Pixel is priced as a premium handset. Consequently, one would imagine that the Pixel would be held up to the same level of scrutiny as the iPhone. Alas, this was hardly the case. The design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s was lambasted mercilessly, and rightfully so given those unsightly antenna lines. In fact, many even brought up said design as evidence that Apple had lost its innovative edge along with its eye for industrial design. Meanwhile, the Google Pixel borrows many design elements from Apple's 2014 iPhone design and nobody bats an eye. It strikes me as odd that in 2016, an iPhone and an Android phone can look extremely similar and evoke completely opposite sentiments from reviewers. The Google Pixel by and large looks like an iPhone but some reviews viewed this as a positive because it was "familiar."  Meanwhile, if Apple doesn't introduce a groundbreaking new iPhone design every year, it's a sign that there's trouble in Cupertino. So, everyone who'd been criticizing Apple and iPhone design immediately called Google out for aping it? Not so much. Well, at least they called Google and Pixel out for the same things they called Apple and iPhone out for? Again, not so much. Bizarrely, some of the subtle improvements Apple incorporated into the iPhone 7 that were immediately categorized as minor or insignificant are completely missing from the Google Pixel. Ritchie writes: Surely they drew the line at Google's 2016 flagship missing optical image stabilization — not just in the regular-size, but in the Plus XL model as well — stereo speakers, and water resistance — things that were pointed to last year as indicators Apple was falling behind? I'm not saying that Apple should be immune from criticism, but it'd be nice if other companies, especially big players like Google, were held to the same set of expectations and standards that Apple has to live up to. Taking a look at any number of Pixel reviews, Google is given a pass for items that the press would absolutely obliterate Apple for. Read More Take Walt Mossberg's review, for example. Calling the Google Pixel "first rate" and the best Android phone he's ever tested, Mossberg quickly mentions that that the device's battery life was disappointing relative to Google's advertised specs. "It also isn’t water resistant, and is exclusive to only a single carrier, Verizon," Mossberg mentions before quickly moving on. And then there are the Google Pixel headphones. Oh wait, the Pixel doesn't come with any headphones. Speaking of earbuds, there’s good and bad news. The good: Google retained the industry-standard 3.5mm headphone jack. The bad: it doesn’t supply any earbuds for a $649 phone. The company says it assumes everyone has many pairs of buds lying around. I wound up using an old Samsung pair. Can you imagine the vitriolic outrage that would have resulted if Apple shipped an iPhone of any model with no headphones? It's also interesting that Google's new AI feature -- Google Assistant -- is being heaped with praise mostly because of its underlying potential. Google Assistant does seem to be a step up from Siri since it can handle contextual queries much more ably, but is it really that compelling of a feature in its current form? Mossberg writes: Here’s a series of questions I asked about the state where I live, without ever saying the state’s name except in the first question. The Assistant answered every question but one with a vocal reply, and answered all quickly and accurately: — What’s the population of Maryland? — Who’s the governor? — What’s the average household income? — What’s the land area? — Show me the state flag. — What’s the biggest county? I’m pretty sure I could have gone on. When I tried this with Siri, it handled the first one nicely, vocally and with a Wikipedia page. It answered the second by displaying an article defining the term governor. That's a nice perk for the Pixel, but is this really a huge selling point? As far as I can tell, the AI that Viv Software showed off is far more impressive. Besides, there are things that Siri can do that Google Assistant can't do quite yet, like reserving an Uber or Lyft. Still, not everyone was a fan of Google Assistant, as evidenced by this review from Michael Nunez of Gizmodo. I was particularly disappointed with Google Assistant because it’s such a promising concept. Google is moving attention away from the search bar more than ever. Instead, the company wants you to “Google” by using the messaging app Allo or voice search in Google Assistant. Ultimately, the Pixel and Pixel XL are gateways for feeding the Google brain more information about yourself. As Google’s AI gets smarter, the Assistant will become more helpful. While some people might find this creepy, I think the idea is exciting, and it’s a letdown that the tech isn’t there yet. In fairness nobody has it, and Google’s is better than what’s offered by competitors like Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana. The point is that as a whole, smartphone assistants aren’t smart enough to be defining features. They’re gimmicks, and Google unwisely decided to build a phone around one. Meanwhile, another Pixel review on The Verge was quick to call Google's smartphone a "home run." Almost comically, one of the first few paragraphs reads: The Pixel is not waterproof, which is dumb and annoying. I should also note that a very short fall managed to crack the screen on the smaller Pixel during our review. A sample size of one is obviously too small to say that these devices are less durable than they ought to be, but it's not a great sign. All that said, I think it's great that Google released the Pixel. It's nice to see some solid competition in the premium smartphone space from a company not named Samsung. The Pixel seems like a compelling device, but let's be honest, the grading curve for Android is still a whole lot more lenient than it is for the iPhone.

Our Paper Paper Archive Our Apps Daily Horoscope Home News Sport Showbiz & TV Life & Style Travel Tech Pics Casino Gaming Reviews Tech News Home Tech Tech News Apple includes THIS hidden feature in EVERY iPhone - but good luck trying to use it Apple includes THIS hidden feature in EVERY iPhone - but good luck trying to use it APPLE has included an awesome one-handed keyboard in every iPhone – but doesn’t let you access it, according to a report by prominent iOS developer Steve Troughton-Smith. By Aaron Brown / Published 22nd October 2016 GETTY SECRET: Apple has included the redesigned keyboard in your iPhone software since 2014 Apple has bundled a useful one-handed keyboard in every iPhone since the introduction of iOS 8 back in September 2014, according to iOS developer Steve Troughton-Smith. The hidden Apple keyboard is designed to make typing easier for those with small hands and large-screen iPhones. It shifts across the keys in the on-screen QWERTY keyboard to make one-handed typing much easier. The little-known Apple keyboard appears to make reaching across the 5.5inch display a cinch. Unfortunately, there is a major problem with this keyboard – you’ll never be able to use it. APPLE • TWITTER • STEVE TROUGHTON-SMITH ONE-HANDED: The hidden keyboard shifts all of the QWERTY keys to one-side of the screen According to iOS developer Steve Troughton-Smith, Apple has included the helpful one-handed keyboard in the iPhone operating system since 2014, but has never allowed customers to access it. Apple billed iOS 8 as the “biggest change to iOS since the introduction of the App Store” when it launched in September 2014. iOS 8 launched alongside the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus – the first Apple smartphone with a 5.5inch display, so it would make sense for the US technology company to design a keyboard to help those with smaller hands. What makes less sense, is why Apple never decided to make the keyboard available to iPhone owners. Today's fun hack (been there since at least iOS 8); the iOS keyboard has an unused left/right one-handed mode. Activated by edge-swipe pic.twitter.com/zIk7x7CVmu— Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) October 19, 2016 Steve Troughton-Smith claims the only way to access the secret Apple keyboard is to jailbreak your iPhone. However this will void your Apple warranty – so we really wouldn’t recommend attempting it. According to Apple’s website, “iOS is designed to be reliable and secure from the moment you turn on your device. Built-in security features protect against malware and viruses and help to secure access to personal information and corporate data. “Unauthorised modifications to iOS (also known as "jailbreaking") bypass security features and can cause numerous issues to the hacked iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. “Apple strongly cautions against installing any software that hacks iOS. “It is also important to note that unauthorised modification of iOS is a violation of the iOS end-user software license agreement and because of this, Apple may deny service for an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch that has installed any unauthorised software.” EXCLUSIVE: New Apple Store opens in London take a peek inside Thursday, 13th October 2016 APPLE is opening its new flagship store in London and Daily Star Online has had an exclusive tour. 1 / 23 The news comes as a new iPhone prank has been doing the rounds that allows any of your friends to access your phone without ever needing a passcode. The joke works by simply pressing on the home button and activating Apple's personal assistant. Anyone can then ask Siri to send a message directly from the device with the victim left totally unaware anything has happened. As long as you have Siri enabled on the lock screen, and know the names in the iPhone's contact book, the prank works. Worse still, the joke can even be used on Facebook. All any sneaky pal has to do is hit the home button and and ask Siri to update your Facebook status. Then they simply dictate a new post and it will be added to the social media page without ever unlocking the iPhone.

We merely had a cameo of Pepe,’ Treadstone continued. ‘We get banned because it’s a pro-Trump app, but you can have an app only about Pepe and that’s not offensive,'” Nash reports. “In July, Apple’s App Store also rejected a satirical game based on the Hillary Clinton email servers scandal. Apple branded the game as ‘offensive’ and ‘objectionable’ before reversing their decision following a report at Breitbart.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Poor Pepe.

You cannot use the argument that other apps currently in the app store more flagrantly abuse the same copyright. The official response I received was, it doesn’t matter if 1000 similar apps in the app store break , YOUR app appears to use similar imagery to “” and so is rejected. The decision was upheld upon multiple appeals.

And everybody have every right to comment on whatever I or anyone posts. And no, I don’t like Botty because he’s been a rude idiot to me and many people in this forum. He often acts like a troll and he’s never been able to provide a smart answer to anything. And sure, the feeling must be mutual.

First, let’s correct the absolutes (where I will grant you are correct, and will correct myself): He has never been able to proveide a smart answer to anything POSTED IN THIS FORUM. Better now? It’s not absolute anymore. It’s constrained to the current forum. Speaking of absolutes: “an excuse no believes”…. makes you too a grammar champion. Shouldn’t that be “and excuse no one believes”? Oh, also, wouldn’t that also be an absolute? Because, if no one believes it, that sounds like there are no exceptions, or no cases where someone would believe it. That looks like an absolute to me. Man, who’s more clueless? The clueless guy, or the clueless guy who calls another guy that he’s clueless? Let’s leave it there. This is not worth my time. And I’n sure it’s not worth yours. Let’s call it a stalemate. Would you agree? Me2Sense Monday, October 24, 2016 - 7:25 pm · Reply “He has never been able to proveide a smart answer to anything POSTED IN THIS FORUM.” Provide.

It’s like talking to a rock. Do you want to believe I’m dumb? Please do. I don’t know Botty in person. I think everything he writes… oh, excuse me, I will allow absolutes… everything Ihe wrote that I’ve read is nothing but pure garbage. I see no intelligence there. Now, one man’s opinion doesn’t make the man smarter. Maybe I’m the stupid one and you are the smart one. Because you see it that way, and I see it another way. So… since only one of us can be right, and we will never agree, let’s leave it there. Me2Sense Monday, October 24, 2016 - 8:32 pm · Hey clueless, give it up.

Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for and has been for decades. The Trump Plan will retain the existing capital gains rate structure (maximum rate of 20 percent) with tax brackets shown above. Carried interest will be taxed as ordinary income. That is why the Wall Street-, multinational-, and Soros-owned Hillary Clinton is getting massive assistance from the mainstream media (also owned by the establishment) – they want their carried interest deductions to continue.

Our culture is soaked and consumed with progressive leftism, it’s not possible for a “right wing echo chamber” to exist. Those on the right are exposed to both sides of the spectrum. Those on the left are living in the mass-media-wide echo chamber, unless they take the effort to see things from another perspective. Most don’t and prefer to condescendingly spit on everyone else while furthering their lies. Whether or not Trump wins, you won’t be safe from the crowds with torches and pitchforks.

Islam is an evil religion that promotes anti-semitism, slavery and violence. People may say extreme-sounding things, but they’re based on facts. Don’t compare message boards to all of the major broadcast networks, newspapers, magazines and social media sites, which are ALL globalist-progressive.

Either way, an association was building. This May, an “anonymous white nationalist” told The Daily Beast that the shift was intentional: a dedicated campaign to “reclaim Pepe from normies,” or members of the mainstream, by making Pepe so culturally unacceptable that only the fringe Internet would dare to use him. Donald Trump had earlier tweeted an image of Pepe-as-Trump, and then his son posted an image on Instagram that included Pepe.

It all started when the young man left the device under some clothes inside, while he was out surfing. Upon his return, he noticed that something was wrong when he saw all the windows black and smoke coming out. Jones recorded the aftermath of the incident that shows a molten iPhone 7 and the car's interior ruined, blaming Apple's gadget for leaving him without a phone and a car at the same time. The young man said that he bought the device just a week before and hasn’t used a foreign charger or dropped it during this time. Apple has yet to make an official statement, but the tech giant is aware of the complaint, which is currently under investigation.

See also: Every day carry pocket tools and gadgets When it comes to cables and dongles, Apple has a support page with information on what markings to look for and the differences in quality between a genuine product and a fake product. This is useful, but when buying online it doesn't help because you don't get to see the product until it's been delivered, and getting a fake product means having to claim refunds and send products back to the seller, which is a hassle. When it comes to chargers, it's even harder to spot a fake, and Apple doesn't offer any guidance on the matter. The London Fire Brigade has a fun online quiz where you can test your skill at spotting fake Apple chargers (these are UK chargers so they look very different from the US style), but as you'll see if you take the test, it's not easy. So, it's a jungle out there, one where scammers and ne'er-do-wells are happy to make a quick buck from selling you a charger that could burn your house down. Not cool. So what can you do? Here's my advice on staying safe: Only buy Apple-branded accessories from Apple or a trusted authorized Apple dealer. While Amazon is an authorized Apple reseller, it's all too easy to be viewing products that are listed by third-party sellers. Forget eBay. Use of the word "genuine" is usually a dead giveaway for a fake product. If you don't want the hassle of finding a genuine Apple product, then an alternative is to find a decent third-party product. So, for cables you could buy something like an Amazon Basics or Monoprice. For chargers, there are plenty of good third-party options available from companies such as Griffin, Kensington, or Anker. Amazon's own 9W PowerFast charger for the Kindle tablets also makes a great charger for iPhones and regular iPads. When it comes to MacBook chargers, it's best to stick with genuine Apple hardware. If you're using some cheap counterfeit charger, consider replacing it with at least a decent third-party alternative. Must-have iPhone accessories (September...

By Agamoni Ghosh October 22, 2016 13:14 BST Will the iPhone 8 feature a glass design? The last time Apple featured glass was on the iPhone 4 back in 2010. Reuters With the iPhone 7 only just arriving in users' hands, rumours have already begun to swirl about Apple's 2017 flagship, with many expecting an all-new glass look and impressive processing power. We take a look at what else the new handset could be in line to flaunt. Traditionally, Apple releases an S model a year after the release of an iPhone. However, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone it is rumoured the company is planning to jump straight to the iPhone 8. IBTimes UK takes a look at the design and specs analysts are expecting to see from the 2017 iPhone. Design and Build Apple is said to have reserved some of its best technology developed for the mobile platform in the last few years for the 2017 model, which it has hinted will be a game changer. Popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI securities says the company deliberately did not introduce ground breaking changes in the iPhone 7 range as it will do so in the 2017 iPhone. For the design, Kuo expects that this iPhone will feature either glass or ceramic backs with metal frames, as phones with all-glass chassis aren't currently feasible "given technological bottlenecks." He says one of the key reasons Apple wants to move to glass is that producing the glossy finish that's currently used in the popular jet-black variants of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is difficult to manufacture. Another change that could feature on the 2017 iPhone design is the removal of top bezel of the phone, which houses the ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, the front speaker, and the front-facing camera. The assumption for this design alteration came from an Apple patent that suggests the company is looking to move the front-facing sensors including the speakers underneath the display. Since the iPhone 7 range is already waterproof it is expected the future iPhones will also posses the same technology. Screen and Display For the iPhone in 2017, it's likely Apple will stick to its sizing of 4.7in and a larger 5.5in offering, however it's expected to sport an edge-to-edge display. Reports in January had stated that Apple struck a deal with Samsung Display for a new flexible OLED for the iPhone 7. However, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus did not showcase a flexible display as reported. Could it be that Apple is eyeing this flexible display akin to the Galaxy Edge's curved display for an iPhone in 2017? Other rumours have however pointed towards the company using AMOLED screens for the 2017 model of the iPhone. A recent rumour had hinted that Apple supply chain partner TPK is working on a project to produce a glasses-free 3D display - but even this one is a bit wild to believe. While the exact specs for display are still at contention one feature largely expected to be missing from the next iPhone is the physical home button. Just recently Apple asked iPhone 7 and 7 Plus users to not panic if their home buttons were not working as they had an on screen home button back up. This indicates the company already has the technology but is saving it to introduce it at a later stage. It is expected that the TouchID fingerprint scanner will also be housed within the screen. Processor and storage Apple and chip manufacturer TSMC signed an agreement to work together on a 10-nanometer "A11" processor design, expected to go into production later in 2017. This processor will be made exclusively for the next iPhone. There is no solid report on what the RAM capacity of the next iPhone would be but given that iPhone 7Plus has a 3GB RAM, the next model could sport either a 4GB or 5GB RAM. For internal storage, the company already has made a significant step by abolishing the 16GB model altogether and is likely to stick to the same strategy for the iPhone in 2017 as well. Release date and pricing The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were released in September, which has become Apple's common launch month for its phones every year, so expect to see rumours heating up towards this date. The current iPhone 7 costs £599 in UK for the base model however it is far too early to tell if prices will remain the same or increase.

Oktober 2016 Bild vergrößern AT&T will laut Insidern Time Warner kaufen. Bild:  dpa Für etwa 85 Milliarden Dollar will der US-Telekom-Anbieter AT&T Time Warner laut Insidern kaufen. Die Übernahme könnte schon Sonntag bekannt gegeben werden. Auch Apple hat offenbar Interesse an dem Medienkonzern. Die US-Medienbranche steht offenbar vor einer Megafusion mit weitreichenden Folgen für die Zukunft des Sektors. Für rund 85 Milliarden Dollar will der Telekomriese AT&T Insiderinformationen zufolge den Konzern Time Warner kaufen, zu dem die Sender HBO und CNN sowie das Filmstudio Warner Bros gehören. Beide Seiten hätten dazu eine Grundsatzvereinbarung erzielt. Die Übernahme könnte an diesem Sonntag öffentlich gemacht werden, sagten mit dem Vorgang vertraute Personen. Er wäre bereits die zweite Großübernahme von AT&T im Mediengeschäft binnen kurzer Zeit. Erst vergangenes Jahr hatte sich das Unternehmen für 48,5 Milliarden Dollar den Satellitenfernsehen-Anbieter DirecTV einverleibt. Anzeige Ebenfalls 2015 hatte Time-Warner-Chef Jeff Bewkes eine Offerte von Rupert Murdochs Mediengruppe Twenty-First Century Fox über 80 Milliarden Dollar zurückgewiesen. Die Insider sagten nun, der damalige Bieter wolle nicht erneut aktiv werden. Laut „Wall Street Journal“ hatte vor einigen Monaten aber Apple Kontakt mit Time Warner aufgenommen, um einen Zusammenschluss zu diskutieren. AT&T-Rivale Verizon verabredete zuletzt den Kauf des Internetgeschäfts von Yahoo für 4,8 Milliarden Dollar, nachdem er bereits 2015 den Online-Veteranen AOL unter seine Fittiche genommen hatte. Im Jahr 2000 war Time Warner mit AOL zusammengegangen, was mittlerweile als einer der größten Fehlschläge bei Firmenzusammenschlüssen überhaupt gilt. Übernahmegerüchte um Time Warner:  Kommt Apple doch noch ins Fernsehen? Die Apple-Aktie ist in Schwierigkeiten. Kann Konzernchef Tim Cook die Probleme jetzt mit einem Schlag lösen? Eine Übernahme von Time Warner könnte das Wunder vollbringen – im Fernsehmarkt. Aber Zweifel bleiben. Die jüngsten Initiativen spiegeln massive Umwälzungen in den beteiligten Branchen wider. Zuschauer schauen sich Filme oder Sendungen zunehmend übers Internet an. Davon profitieren Online-Videotheken wie Netflix auf Kosten traditioneller TV-Sender. Zugleich decken sich Telekom-Unternehmen verstärkt mit Medieninhalten ein, um mehr Kunden zu gewinnen. „Das funktioniert niemals“ AT&T verkauft von Hause aus Mobilfunk- und Breitbanddienste, hat aber bereits mehrere Standbeine im Mediengeschäft. Außer DirecTV unterhält der Konzern eine Gemeinschaftsfirma, die in der Branche investiert und einen Videostreaming-Dienst aus der Taufe gehoben hat. Time Warner beherbergt neben HBO und CNN auch die Sendergruppen TBS und TNT. Zudem hält das Unternehmen eine zehnprozentige Beteiligung am Netflix-Konkurrenten Hulu. Das Warner-Filmstudio hat die Rechte an Kassenschlagern wie „Batman“ und „Harry Potter“. Mobilfunkunternehmen setzen große Hoffnungen auf die nächste Generation der Übertragungstechnik (5G), die auch neue Medienangebote ermöglichen soll. „Wir glauben, dass 5G ein ganz wichtiger Impulsgeber ist“, betonte Analyst Rich Tullo vom Wall-Street-Haus Albert Fried & Company. Damit könnten die Telekomanbieter den Bezahlfernsehsendern gehörig in die Quere kommen. Andere Experten kritisierten allerdings, dass AT&T viel Geld für den Kauf der Inhalte-Produktion ausgibt statt zu deutlich günstigeren Preisen lediglich Verwertungsrechte zu erwerben. Es sei unklar, welche Einsparungen die Zusammenlegung von Vertriebsinfrastruktur und Inhalten bringen könnte, sagte Doug Creutz von der Investmentbank Cowen and Co. „Das wurde schon probiert und funktioniert niemals.“ Die Kartellbehörden dürften der Fusion nach Einschätzung von Fachleuten nicht im Wege stehen. Die Partner müssten voraussichtlich nur bestimmte Auflagen erfüllen. Den Insidern zufolge will AT&T 110 Dollar je Time-Warner-Aktie zahlen. Der Preis läge damit deutlich über dem jüngsten Kurs, der im außerbörslichen Handel auf 92,50 Dollar nach oben schoss. Damit erreichte Time Warner eine Marktkapitalisierung von rund 73 Milliarden Dollar. rtr Schlagworte: Mergers & Acquisitions M & A Fernsehen Rundfunk Time Warner AT&T Netflix DirecTV Cable News Network AOL Hulu Yahoo Verizon Apple © Sie wollen unsere Inhalte verwenden?

(REUTERS/Dado Ruvic) These days, a new car is basically a computer with wheels. Trunks open automatically. The car parks itself. Rear cameras show you what you can’t see. If you lock your keys inside, you can open the doors by satellite. The flashiest new gadget: a touch screen in the middle of your dashboard. There’s a lot to love about these infotainment systems. Depending on the brand, you can organize your music, program the GPS and dictate text messages. Console screens are as wide as small tablets and they’re easy to read, even when you’re behind the wheel. But there’s a cost: Many of these services require subscriptions for services like in-vehicle Wi-Fi hotspots, Sirius XM satellite radio and live traffic data. You may start with a free trial, grow accustomed to the conveniences and then find yourself paying fees later on. These costs can add up over time, and the final tally might surprise you — especially when you set up automatic payment. You might not realize how much you’re shelling out for car-based infotainment until you look over your credit card statement. How do you avoid getting caught unaware? Here are some preventive measures. Grill the auto dealer Buying a car is an ordeal. Even when we’ve picked our dream car, we tend to drive away from the dealership exhausted. (Tip in a Tip: If you’re hunting for a new car, there’s an app that makes it easy. Click here to find your perfect car. ) The last thing you want to think about is whether the console uses Apple Maps or Google Maps. But this is a critical time, because the dealer may want you to subscribe to as many services as possible. Don’t let salespeople confuse you. There’s no reason to sign up for anything on the first day. All enrollments are voluntary, and these apps will be available whenever you want them. Infotainment systems are still new, and every car company has its own technology and services. Each system has distinct benefits and drawbacks: Volvo’s Sensus Connect has a touch screen you can use while wearing gloves. Ford’s Sync 3 uses a Blackberry-based system, and it’s a vast improvement on earlier versions. Android Auto will appeal to Google and Microsoft users, while Apple CarPlay is designed for Apple fans. Your preference for Apple or Android devices will likely influence your next car’s make and model. On my site, I have information about both systems. Most importantly, click here to see which system is preloaded into different car makes and models. A responsible auto rep will tell you all about these consoles and infotainment services. Ask how long the free trial lasts and how much the subscription will eventually cost. Grill them about cancellation policies, especially for features you’re not sold on. If any of these explanations sound fishy, just decline. Better to learn about your new car and drive it for a few hundred miles before adding features you may never even use. Remember your smartphone When it comes to vehicle infotainment, I don’t use any paid subscriptions. I use my phone instead. The truth is, most upmarket cars come with USB or audio ports that let you plug your smartphone directly into your vehicle’s system. For years, tech-savvy drivers have listened to music on their phones and held hands-free conversations through their car’s radio and speakers. An infotainment system is just a more sophisticated version of these radios and speakers. You can usually connect your phone directly to your infotainment console, which accesses all the music, podcasts, GPS, and streaming services you already have, and you don’t have to pay an extra penny. There is one downside: Using your phone for navigation and streaming services while driving may devour your data plan. The same goes for “tethering” a device to your phone, a technique some passengers use to access the internet during commutes. To avoid a data famine, you can download podcasts or audiobooks ahead of time, especially for long trips. It’s also a good idea to track your data use so you won’t go over the limit.

Cook described it as a center for “deep engineering” and said it will be “very different” from the R&D base Apple plans to build in China. “I cannot tell you the specifics,” he said. “The specific work is very different.”  It does, though, seem that broadening the role played by AI across all Apple products may be the primary focus. Cook said that most people only think of the more explicit examples of machine learning, like Siri, where the reality is that AI runs across all products in all kinds of ways. “We want the AI to increase your battery life” and recommend music to Apple Music subscribers, he continued. As another example, he said AI could “help you remember where you parked your car.” iOS currently relies on the rather crude method of noting a disconnection from CarPlay or an in-car Bluetooth audio unit to detect when you’ve parked your car. Cook is currently touring Japan – surprisingly, his first visit since becoming CEO. He has so far met with Nintendo execs and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. [Update: Nikkei originally reported that the new facility would develop ‘AI and other technologies’ before updating the report to say ‘new component technologies.] Guides AAPL Get the latest AAPL stock and company news View THe Guide Apple Pay Apple Pay is Apple's mobile payments solution first introduced in 2014.

Eurogamer.net Follow @eurogamer Home Reviews iPhone 7/ iPhone 7 Plus review Back in black. By Damien McFerran Published 22/10/2016 It apparently took "courage" to remove the 3.5mm audio jack from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, according to Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller. The company's less kind critics have voiced the opinion that it has more to do with bolstering sales of the new £160 AirPods and the wireless headphones produced by Apple subsidiary Beats Electronics, but whatever side of the fence you happen to sit on, this is a decision that has dominated the headlines and has been in very real danger of completely overshadowing this year's iPhone refresh. Apple's reasoning for ditching a socket which has been commonplace on practically every smartphone for the past decade may be flimsy at best, but where the Cupertino company leads, rivals invariably follow and we could well see an industry-wide shift towards wireless audio in the next year or so. It's almost a shame that this decision has generated such a sizeable reaction online as the products it impacts have a lot going for them. For the first time in iPhone history we finally have a device that can cope with getting wet, while the improved camera on both models and unique "taptic" home button are welcome improvements. However, Apple has chosen to cram all of these elements into a chassis which looks disarmingly similar to the design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S - the first time in the history of the line that the same aesthetic look has been retained for a third consecutive year (the iPhone SE doesn't count as that came over a year after the iPhone 5S ceased being Apple's flagship). iPhone 7/7 Plus specs Akin to 2014 and 2015, Apple has two flagship options this year. Both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus benefit from the increased power afforded by Apple's A10 Fusion chipset, but the latter has 3GB of RAM compared to the standard model's 2GB. This year the 16GB storage option has been retired, with 32GB being the entry level point. The other big difference between the two phones is the addition of a second telephoto lens on the 7 Plus, which gives x2 optical zoom. First up, the iPhone 7 specs: Dimensions: 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm Weight: 138g Chipset: Apple A10 Fusion Processor: Quad-core 2.23 GHz Graphics Core: Six-core graphics RAM: 2GB Screen: 4.7-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD, 750 x 1334 pixels (326 ppi) Storage: 32GB / 64GB / 128GB Camera: 12 MP, f/1.8, phase detection autofocus, OIS, quad-LED flash Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth v4.2, NFC (Apple Pay only) Other Features: IP67 certified, 1960 mAh battery And here's how the iPhone 7 Plus compares: Dimensions: 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3mm Weight: 188g Chipset: Apple A10 Fusion Processor: Quad-core 2.23 GHz Graphics Core: Six-core graphics RAM: 3GB Screen: 5.5-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD, 1080 x 1920 pixels (401 ppi) Storage: 32GB / 64GB / 128GB Camera: Dual 12 MP (28mm, f/1.8, OIS & 56mm, f/2.8), phase detection autofocus, OIS (4-axis), dual-LED flash Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth v4.2, NFC Other Features: IP67 certified, 2900 mAh battery Black is the new "hero" colour of the range this year, with matte and glossy finishes available. This new colour scheme hides one of the big changes to the design, which is the repositioning of the plastic antenna bands to the top and bottom edges of the rear of the device. These bands are now practically invisible, with Apple's design guru Jony Ive claiming that this has resulted in the most "refined" take on this particular design. It's hard to disagree; while it may not be revolutionary when set alongside its 2014 and 2015 predecessors, the iPhone 7 is certainly an appealing slab of technology. There are many aspects to the phone's design that are instantly familiar to iPhone owners. The power button resides on the right-hand side, with the volume controls and silent switch found on the opposite edge. On the bottom there's the lightning port, but the 3.5mm headphone jack you'd expect to see to the left is gone, with the resultant void being filled by a speaker (the phone has two) and the phone's larger "Taptic Engine" force feedback unit. Around the back, the camera bump has become bigger compared to last year's model, but it looks a lot nicer - the metallic lens housing has been replaced by a more gradual raised section that appears to be more like part of the design than something that was hastily tacked on at the last moment. Gallery: Available in matte and glossy black, this year's iPhones will make many nostalgic for the iPhone 3G. The removal of the 3.5mm headphone socket has allowed Apple to fit two powerful stereo speakers, while inside the phone the expanded Taptic Engine allows for system-wide force feedback. Apart from size, the big difference between the two models is the dual camera setup on the 7 Plus. Flipping the phone over reveals the final big change - there's no physical home button this time around. The circular pad remains, but a push with your thumb yields no movement; instead, the iPhone 7's Taptic Engine delivers a pulse that gives the impression of pushing a button. Apple has used the same tech on the Force Touch screen, and it's a pretty convincing system - even if it does take some getting used to initially. By eliminating this moving part, Apple will hopefully have solved one of the biggest problems the iPhone line has faced along the years - a broken home button. While the 3.5mm headphone socket is, in Apple's eyes at least, now a relic of the past, there's thankfully still a way of using your old wired cans. Included in the box is a small connection cable that plugs into the lightning port and features - you've guessed it - a 3.5mm port on the other end. It's hardly an elegant solution and means you can't charge the phone while listening to music, but it should help you endure the transition to wireless audio - just make sure you don't misplace the adapter. The other big news this year is that Apple has finally made its flagship phones water and dust proof. Both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus boast IP67 certification, meaning they're able to withstand a 30 minute dip in the wet stuff to a depth of one meter. Again, there's a game of catch-up being played here - we've had waterproof Android phones for years - but it's a welcome upgrade over last year's offering and should ensure that an unscheduled fall in the sink or (even worse) the toilet no longer means a tragic end for your £600 smartphone. Both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus benefit from backlit LED screens which are brighter and more colourful than before, but they retain the resolution we've seen in the previous two years. The iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch 1334x750 screen while its larger sibling has a 5.5-inch 1920x1080 offering. Compared to what companies like Sony, Samsung and LG are shipping with their flagship devices it's clear that Apple is losing the pixels-per-inch war, but while it's annoying that iPhone fans have not had a resolution bump in the past three years, it matters little in day-to-day use. GFXBench's Manhattan test is a hard workout for the GPU, but the reality is that few games actually test cutting-edge graphics power these days. iPhone 7 iPhone 7 Plus iPhone SE iPhone 6S iPhone 6 iPhone 5S iPhone 5/5C Galaxy S7 Galaxy S6 Geekbench Single-Core 3000 3306 2496 2552 1605 1294 701 2171 1233 Geekbench Multi-Core 5330 5345 4343 4464 2901 2463 1267 6465 3964 3DMark Graphics 63668 62595 44059 41968 22824 19488 5232 32404 22954 3DMark Physics 15267 15231 12871 12998 9385 8042 8099 17730 17795 3DMark IceStorm Unlimited 37352 37015 28638 28067 17304 14797 5669 27370 21565 GFXBench T-Rex 120.1 122.4 79.9 79.7 42.8 28.9 6.9 87.0 58.0 GFXBench Manhattan 62.3 63.2 39.3 40.3 18.1 13.5 - 29.0 25.9 It's already almost impossible to discern individual pixels on this screen and we've long argued that 1080p is the absolute maximum you really need on a smartphone. Anything above that is simply adding strain on the processor (not to mention impacting battery life) for little visible reward - the only genuine use we can foresee for a resolution increase is for phones which are used to power virtual reality headsets, such as the Galaxy S7 and the newly-launched Google Pixel, where the user's eyes are close-up to the display. As the iPhone 7 has no VR application at present, it can't really be included in that argument. While the iPhone is eclipsed by its Android rivals when it comes to screen size, it continues to lead the pack in terms of raw processing power. The fact that the A10 Fusion chip is the first quad-core proposition from Apple might lead you to assume it is comfortably outclassed by competing handsets, but the benchmark results suggest otherwise. As ever, the merits of creating your own chipset speak for themselves; this is an industry-leading handset in terms of grunt. Another remarkable aspect worth noting is that the iPhone 7 has only 2GB of RAM (the 7 Plus has 3GB) yet it is capable of delivering performance levels which shame some of its RAM-obsessed Android challengers. It almost goes without saying that with such formidable specs the iPhone 7 is a solid platform for gaming. There are few titles which really exploit the additional power found within the handset at present but existing releases - such as the lush Zelda Wind Waker homage Oceanhorn and the ever-enjoyable Real Racing 3 - run as smooth as silk with none of the judders and frame-rate headaches seen in their Android equivalents. Mobile gaming doesn't really get any more polished than it does on an iPhone, and the iOS App Store continues to be the go-to platform for developers thanks to the relative lack of piracy when compared to Google's own digital store. Perhaps this is why Nintendo has chosen to bring Super Mario Run to iOS first, a move which will surely make Apple's devices even more attractive to dedicated gamers. Gallery: Incremental hardware upgrades means there's few games which fully exploit the power of the A10 Fusion chipset, but rest assured everything runs like clockwork on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, with not stutter or frame rate hiccups. 3D Touch is supported by some games too, but not as many as we'd like. In terms of software, Apple has launched iOS 10 alongside its 2016 flagship phones. This update brings with it some visual changes - such as bubble-like notifications and the Google Now-style "Today" screen, which sits on the left-hand side of your main Home screen and gives you calendar updates and news stories - but perhaps the most significant difference is how 3D Touch has been embraced more enthusiastically this time around. Introduced in the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, 3D Touch is based around pressure, allowing you to press down on the screen to "peek" at images and access more commands. In iOS 10 it's also used in a new "rich notifications" system, where pressing down an alert bubble allows you to expand it and - in some cases - respond without having to actually open the app in question. As was the case last year, you could argue that a simple long-press would work just as well but 3D Touch appears to be here to stay, at least as far as the iPhone is concerned. Another welcome introduction for iOS 10 is the ability to wake the phone's screen as soon as you pick it up, and lock screen widgets - recently expunged from Android - have been added so you can check vital information without unlocking your device. However, there are times when it feels like Apple's attempts to enrich iOS have been fumbled. The notification system is the main culprit, and remains unwieldy for those who have a lot of apps firing off messages at once. In Android, notifications from the same app are often grouped together so you can see at a glance which one you need to open first, but in iOS each message has its own entry and you often have to swipe through an entire stream of alerts before finding one of any real interest. Worse still, important alerts get buried amid eBay messages, emails and other less urgent notifications, which means they often get overlooked altogether. Granular access is given to this system so you can disable audio alerts for a particular app or prevent it from firing off a message on your lock screen, but it's still a poor second to the way notifications work in Android - an OS which has led the way in this area almost since day one. Another advantage Google has is better overall customisation and flexibility - bonuses which come hand-in-hand with weaker security and an app store which struggles to attract talent due to the fact that any Android user can side-load pirated apps and games without having to pay a penny. Swift to focus and capable of capturing life-like shots, the iPhone 7's camera is perhaps the best on any smartphone right now. Low-light photography is much improved thanks to the inclusion of OIS and a f/1.8 aperture. One area where Apple's phones have enjoyed a particular notable advantage over pretty much every other manufacturer on the market is photography. While the megapixel count of 12 remains unchanged when compared to the iPhone 6S, both of this year's phones has a six-optical lens, optical image stabilisation (reserved for the "Plus" models previously) and a wider f/1.8 aperture. This means shots are less prone to camera shake and low-light shooting is much improved. Apple claims that the camera on the iPhone 7 is 60 per cent faster than its direct predecessor, which is an impressive claim as the iPhone 6S could capture an image in double-quick time. Suffice to say, the camera is insanely swift to focus and snap, and produces images which have excellent contrast and colour replication. Some of the shots look somewhat dull when compared to the vibrant images obtained on Samsung's latest handsets, but they're notably free from oversaturation and unrealistic colours. In terms of video, you can expect 4K capture at 30fps, or if you prefer a smoother frame-rate you can drop down to 1080p60. Slow-motion and time-lapse modes are also included, and the 7-megapixel selfie-camera on the front is now aided by a flash - in reality, the screen simply fires up to illuminate your face. On the 7 Plus, Apple has opted for the dual camera approach seen on Android phones like the LG G5, Huawei P9 and HTC One M8. The phone comes with a 12-megapixel telephoto lens in addition to the standard 12-megapixel snapper seen on the standard iPhone 7 model. This telephoto lens effectively grants the end user x2 optical zoom, allowing you to zoom in on your subject without experiencing the image quality degradation that normally comes with digital zoom. It doesn't end there, though - the iPhone 7 Plus uses its dual-camera setup to create a "depth map", picking out close-up and distant objects. This information is then used to add an artificial bokeh effect to create the kind of depth-of-field you'd normally only get from a DSLR with wide aperture. It's an interesting use of the two cameras and allows for some really effective shots - expect to witness bokeh-overload on your Instagram feed as more people pick up the phone. The 7 Plus has the same 12 megapixel, f/1.8 aperture lens as the standard iPhone 7 but includes a second telephoto lens which allows for x2 optical zoom and realistic depth-of-field shots. The iPhone 7 has a larger battery than the iPhone 6S, and when teamed with the A10 Fusion's two "low power" cores, this should mean improved stamina. However, that isn't the case; the iPhone 7 doesn't seem to offer much of an advantage when compared to last year's model. The iPhone 7 Plus is a different story as the larger frame allows for a bigger capacity battery, but on the whole this feels like another area where Apple has lost ground to competitors. Phones like the Galaxy S7 and Xiaomi Mi5 are similar in size to the standard iPhone 7, yet they have larger power cells and consequently last much longer when away from a power socket. While we rarely got to the end of the day with a dead phone, there were a few times when overzealous usage caused the juice to drop to alarming low levels before bedtime - Pokémon Go usually being the main culprit. The iPhone 7's middling stamina is exacerbated by the fact that it lacks quick-charging and takes around 90 minutes to reach 100 per cent. Again, this is another area where Google has the upper hand; most leading Android handsets have some kind of fast charging capability which can fully boost the battery in less than an hour, while others also offer convenient wireless charging. Expect to see these features come to Apple's devices soon, when they will no doubt be acclaimed as totally ground-breaking. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus: the Digital Foundry verdict While the design might not have altered a great deal, it's clear that some big strides are made with this year's iPhones. Waterproofing is a huge plus point, and the traditional increase in processing power once again puts Apple at the front of the pack. Improvements with the camera and screen give further incentive for existing iPhone users to upgrade, and while the removal of the 3.5mm headphone socket is a pain, the expanded taptic engine does much to make up for it, allowing system-wide vibration feedback which can be felt in everything from scrolling menus to games. Skyrim remastered: What's new, game guides From visual upgrades, to console mods and levelling guides. Ditching the socket has also allowed Apple to include two powerful stereos speakers that sound leagues ahead of any other device on the market. The dual-camera setup on the 7 Plus is also worthy of note, with the secondary telephoto lens allowing for some neat tricks when it comes to composing the perfect image. It's also worth noting that this is the first year that Apple has made 32GB the base storage option - something that has been a long time coming. In terms of the basics, call audio quality is excellent, as is network and wireless connectivity. However, there's no denying that in some key areas, Apple's phones continue to lag behind the competition. Battery life is only a slight improvement over last year's offerings but remains disappointing when compared to rival handsets, and the lack of any kind of fast charging capability is almost unforgivable in 2016, especially on a phone which costs this much. While Samsung and Sony's flagships are in a similar price bracket, the Android sector is awash with much cheaper devices from companies like Xiaomi, Lenovo and Ulefone, many of which offer mod cons that are frustratingly absent on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The trade-off is getting one of the most powerful phones on the market with a well-stocked app store, tightly integrated software features and impeccable build quality. It's a sacrifice millions of users have been making for years, and the iPhone 7 is enough of an incremental update to maintain that pattern - and perhaps pick up a few new customers in the wake of Samsung's regrettable Galaxy Note 7 meltdown. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus review units kindly provided by Mobile Fun.

 Apple might not be able to build its €850 million Irish data centre after all Sam Shead Oct. 22, 2016, 3:43 AM 5,458 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook.Screenshot A small town in Ireland is continuing to give Apple a huge headache. The Californian tech giant wants to build an €850 million (£757 million) data centre just outside Athenry, in County Galway, on the west coast of Ireland. The vast majority of residents support Apple's plans but the company has faced stiff opposition from a small number of local residents and businesses who don't want it "in their back garden." After a lot of toing and froing, Apple finally got the green light from local planning body An Bord Pleanála in August. Apple seemed to be home and dry. However, local residents Allan Daly and Sinéad Fitzpatrick have now launched a High Court bid that threatens to derail Apple's plans once more, The Irish Times reports. They are questioning the means by which planning permission was granted.  Apple is concerned that the project will be delayed by a further 18 months if the High Court permits a full review of An Bord Pleanála's decision to give scheme the go-ahead, according to The Irish Times. The High Court is yet to decide whether to proceed to a full judicial review, but The Irish Times writes that there will be a lengthy delay if Daly and Fitzpatrick are successful with their application. The newspaper also writes that Apple is concerned about the project's future if the judicial review is granted. It has reportedly made its fears known to Irish government officials. Apple wants to use the data centre to store European user data and to help power online services including the iTunes Store, the App Store, iMessage, Maps, and Siri for customers across Europe, according to a press release announcing the development in February 2015. In the press release, Apple also announced a similar data centre in Denmark, which is in the process of being built, according to The Irish Times. A computer-generated image of Apple's Irish data centre.Unknown The Cupertino company was hoping to have the facility up and running by early 2017 but Apple is yet to start any building work. Some 5,500 of Apple's 18,300 European staff are based in Ireland, which is also home to its European headquarters. The company has pledged to hire an additional 1,000 staff in Ireland before 2017. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have also built data centres in Ireland, and Facebook also has one planned. Apple did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

X Intel case could change flavour of €13bn Apple ruling European Court of Justice says Intel decision that led to €1.06bn fine should be re-examined Sat, Oct 22, 2016, 07:30 EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager: has she bitten off more than she can chew? Photograph: John Thys/AFP/Getty Images         Even as EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager was was putting a shot across the bows of a Government still reeling from the scale of the Apple tax ruling, a little heralded legal opinion in another part of the EU apparatus threatened this week to change things. In an interview with Irish Times European Correspondent Suzanne Lynch, Vestager insisted the ruling that Apple must repay up to €13 billion (plus possible interest) to the Irish Revenue – which might then face competing claims from other EU states for portions of this money – was fact-based. It has also emerged that the Irish authorities have submitted a list of 300 tax rulings to the commission as part of a broader enquiry in Brussels into tax rulings. Criticism Down the road in Luxembourg, European Court of Justice advocate general Nils Wahl was throwing a spanner into the works. He said a 2009 case against Intel, after an eight-year investigation – which led to a record €1.06 billion fine – should be re-examined in its entirety because a court erred in ruling against the company’s system of rebates for PC makers using its chips. The ECJ judges are not obliged to follow an advocate’s opinion but more often than not they do. Of particular interest to Apple and the Irish Government, which is planning ECJ appeals against Vestager’s record €13 billion ruling, is the advocate general’s criticism of the EU’s handling of evidence it gathered against Intel, saying the lower court was wrong to rule that regulators could add details of a meeting with a Dell executive long after the fact. Failure to communicate a shift in the focus of the Apple probe and keeping both the company and the Government in the dark unfairly during the investigation are central to the likely appeal against the Vestager ruling on Apple. ADVERTISEMENT In the wake of the AG’s opinion, lawyers in Brussels were suggesting, a confirmatory ruling by the full court could be among the most important decisions by an EU court in 25 years. It remains to be seen if the commissioner has bitten off more than she can chew.       Topics: Cantillon Margrethe Vestager Nils Wahl European Court of Justice Apple Intel AboutCantillon A man with a profound understanding of how money is made and lost, Kerry-born economist Richard Cantillon (1680s-1734) is a fitting namesake for this long-running column.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Prep Football: Serrano takes advantage of Apple Valley's errors Friday Oct 21, 2016 at 12:01 AM Oct 21, 2016 at 11:15 PM Jacob Sundstrom Staff Writer @DPSundstrom APPLE VALLEY — Apple Valley scored first Friday night at Newton T. Bass Stadium. Then Serrano scored the next 25 points on the way to a 25-6 win in a key Mojave River League matchup. The Diamondbacks (7-1, 3-0 MRL) are still very much contenders for the MRL title as they head to Burroughs next Friday. Serrano didn’t play its sharpest game of the season, but the Diamondbacks took advantage of Apple Valley’s (6-2, 1-2 MRL) miscues and turned on the jets late in the game. Brandon Murcio starred both offensively and defensively for Serrano. He picked off Apple Valley quarterback Mossy Bell in the fourth quarter and ran in two touchdowns while racking up 137 yards on 22 carries. “I feel pretty beat up,” he said. “It’s a really physical game and they hit hard, man. We know they play that power ball too so we were prepared for that.” Serrano head coach Ray Maholchic liked what he saw from his team in terms of its tenacity and resilience. “I think they hung in there and held them to 6 points which was fantastic for the defense,” he said. “We made some mistakes and gave them some things but at the end we were able to hang in there and take advantage of some of their mistakes and stretch our lead a little.” Jonathan Ybarra sacked Mossy Bell in the end zone for a safety which gave Serrano a 12-6 lead. That’s when Murcio took over. He scored his first touchdown of the night on the ensuing drive and then picked off Bell on Apple Valley’s next series. The Diamondbacks didn’t score on their next drive but a fumble got Serrano the ball back and Murcio capped the drive with a 6-yard dash into the end zone for his second score. “He was a busy kid,” said Maholchic. “I don’t know if we’ll ever put any weight on him, not when he burns 8,000 calories a game. He’s a great kid, really has a heart of a warrior.” Apple Valley moves past the toughest part of its MRL schedule but very likely needs to beat both Hesperia and Sultana to get a shot at a playoff spot in Division 10. Head coach Matt Rohrbaugh likes his team’s chances. “When you turn the ball over that many times in the second half against a great team like Serrano, they’ll make you pay,” said Rohrbaugh. “I’m so proud of my kids, how hard they played. Lots of big hits tonight.” The sound of plastic on plastic crackled through the stadium all night as both teams delivered the smash-mouth football they’ve long been known for. While big hits were expected, Maholchic was particularly impressed with Apple Valley’s pass defense. “I think that’s the best their pass defense has looked in a very long time,” said Maholchic. That led to Serrano doing most of its attacking on the ground. That suits the Diamondbacks just fine, of course. They finished with 222 rushing yards and 107 through the air while Apple Valley managed 53 rushing yards and 120 passing yards. Apple Valley plays its last home game of the regular season against Sultana on Friday.

The variants are expected to sport a much slimmer design compared to its predecessors. Rumours suggest that the MacBook Pro 2016 will have a larger Trackpad and a butterfly keyboard design. Apple is holding a press event on Oct. 27 at its Cupertino campus. The invites have been sent though it does not reveal anything about the MacBook Pro 2016. Fans expect the MacBook Pro line-up to be the centre of discussion when the event begins. Apple has reportedly made massive upgrades to the line-up in terms of both specs and design. A fully-customizable OLED touchscreen toolbar is rumoured to feature in the MacBook Pro 2016 that has replaced the F keys. The keyboard will reportedly change the keys displayed as per the app running on the computer and even change into a download progress bar. Touch ID feature is set to provide added security to the MacBook Pro 2016. This feature is already present in the iPhone models. The Touch ID is set to be incorporated into the “Power” button so that when a user presses the button it will result in automatic user verification via fingerprint scan, writes Tech Times. As per BGR, the Apple MacBook Pro 2016 is most-likely to boast Intel’s Skylake chipset and AMD Polaris graphics processor. The device may run on the MacOS Sierra that itself is a powerhouse of incredible features. The standard USB ports could be replaced by the much-talked-about USB-C ports and Thunderbolt 3. The Apple MacBook Pro has not received any major overhaul since 2012. It will also bring with it Apple's Siri voice-activated assistant and loads of other exciting features. Recently, a Reddit post appeared showing a prototype of the Apple e-ink keyboard being developed by Sonder. The post has been taken down. Apple has a reputation of taking big leaps that are first criticised but later become the new standard. A similar thing happened with the 3.5mm headphone jack that was dropped from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus devices. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Apple MacBook Pro 2016.

We merely had a cameo of Pepe,’ Treadstone continued. ‘We get banned because it’s a pro-Trump app, but you can have an app only about Pepe and that’s not offensive,'” Nash reports. “In July, Apple’s App Store also rejected a satirical game based on the Hillary Clinton email servers scandal. Apple branded the game as ‘offensive’ and ‘objectionable’ before reversing their decision following a report at Breitbart.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Poor Pepe.

You cannot use the argument that other apps currently in the app store more flagrantly abuse the same copyright. The official response I received was, it doesn’t matter if 1000 similar apps in the app store break , YOUR app appears to use similar imagery to “” and so is rejected. The decision was upheld upon multiple appeals.

They just went along with whoever was pushing whatever agenda. If Donald Trump wants to make America White Again, then Apple should sit on the sidelines and even maybe help kick out anyone that is not a white male citizen unless they belong to a union or the wrong religion. yojimbo007 Friday, October 21, 2016 - 5:41 pm · Reply My view is that its not Apple who should do that… its not their place as a company. every individual though can voice their opinion and place their vote.

And everybody have every right to comment on whatever I or anyone posts. And no, I don’t like Botty because he’s been a rude idiot to me and many people in this forum. He often acts like a troll and he’s never been able to provide a smart answer to anything. And sure, the feeling must be mutual. But regardless, I would defend to death his right to keep posting his opinion, as much as I dislike and disagree with him. Me2Sense Monday, October 24, 2016 - 5:48 pm · Reply “He often acts like a troll and he’s never been able to provide a smart answer to anything.” I guess you flunked grammar class by using absolutes. Wow, are you clueless. And your sarcasm excuse was just that — an excuse no believes. Grifterus Monday, October 24, 2016 - 7:05 pm · Reply Well, allow me to retort. First, let’s correct the absolutes (where I will grant you are correct, and will correct myself): He has never been able to proveide a smart answer to anything POSTED IN THIS FORUM. Better now? It’s not absolute anymore. It’s constrained to the current forum. Speaking of absolutes: “an excuse no believes”…. makes you too a grammar champion. Shouldn’t that be “and excuse no one believes”? Oh, also, wouldn’t that also be an absolute? Because, if no one believes it, that sounds like there are no exceptions, or no cases where someone would believe it. That looks like an absolute to me. Man, who’s more clueless? The clueless guy, or the clueless guy who calls another guy that he’s clueless? Let’s leave it there. This is not worth my time. And I’n sure it’s not worth yours. Let’s call it a stalemate. Would you agree? Me2Sense Monday, October 24, 2016 - 7:25 pm · Reply “He has never been able to proveide a smart answer to anything POSTED IN THIS FORUM.” Provide. You just can’t rid yourself of absolute statements. Botty is much more intelligent, witty and smarter than you. Your partisan HATE blinds you. So sorry. Grifterus Monday, October 24, 2016 - 8:07 pm · Where in my post I mention anything about political parties???? And yes, I had a typo…. And you mention nothing about your own absolutes…. It’s like talking to a rock. Do you want to believe I’m dumb? Please do. I don’t know Botty in person. I think everything he writes… oh, excuse me, I will allow absolutes… everything Ihe wrote that I’ve read is nothing but pure garbage. I see no intelligence there. Now, one man’s opinion doesn’t make the man smarter. Maybe I’m the stupid one and you are the smart one. Because you see it that way, and I see it another way. So… since only one of us can be right, and we will never agree, let’s leave it there. Me2Sense Monday, October 24, 2016 - 8:32 pm · Hey clueless, give it up.

Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for and has been for decades. The Trump Plan will retain the existing capital gains rate structure (maximum rate of 20 percent) with tax brackets shown above. Carried interest will be taxed as ordinary income. That is why the Wall Street-, multinational-, and Soros-owned Hillary Clinton is getting massive assistance from the mainstream media (also owned by the establishment) – they want their carried interest deductions to continue. Thoughtful Voters Friday, October 21, 2016 - 5:29 pm · Reply You’re not convincing anyone here. As you have seen, the voters of the US of A are smarter than you give them credit for and they have already made up their minds. Please go peddle you political crap on a Fox website. Voting for Trump-Pence Friday, October 21, 2016 - 5:33 pm · Reply Election day is Tuesday, November 8th, moron. First 2014, Then 2016 Friday, October 21, 2016 - 5:39 pm · Reply In the interest of ruining your sleep for the foreseeable future: Electoral model: Trump has at least an 87% chance of winning “So hold off on trusting poll-driven proclamations of a Clinton victory just yet. Voters have a way of always getting the last word.” Dave H Friday, October 21, 2016 - 5:48 pm · Reply You’d be a lot more convincing if you hadn’t played the same dismissal of the polls game in 2012. Registered Voter Friday, October 21, 2016 - 5:59 pm · Reply Read the article. That way you won’t be as shocked as the rest of the unthinking-yet-all-knowing establishment Dems on November 8th. Dave H Friday, October 21, 2016 - 6:06 pm · Reply I read it before commenting. It’s pie in the sky wishful thinking at best, complete denial of reality at worst. Outside of your little Right-Wing Echo Chamber and the most rural of rural areas Trump just isn’t seen as credible. BTW, where does this “Trump has at least an 87% chance of winning” BS come from? Not that article. Nick Saturday, October 22, 2016 - 2:29 am · Reply It’s funny to hear a leftist talking about an echo chamber. Our culture is soaked and consumed with progressive leftism, it’s not possible for a “right wing echo chamber” to exist. Those on the right are exposed to both sides of the spectrum. Those on the left are living in the mass-media-wide echo chamber, unless they take the effort to see things from another perspective. Most don’t and prefer to condescendingly spit on everyone else while furthering their lies. Whether or not Trump wins, you won’t be safe from the crowds with torches and pitchforks. Dave H Saturday, October 22, 2016 - 4:12 am · Reply That’s your perception, but one I disagree with. You only have to spend a few minutes reading comment boards on the Internet to see there are millions of people out there that living in a Right-Wing bubble. They repeat misconceptions and outright distortions at each other, over and over again until they utterly believe it. “Obama’s a Kenyan”, “The Government forces your kids to become gay”, “They’re going to take our guns”, “Muslims are ALL evil terrorists” etc. That’s your Right-Wing Echo Chamber. It’s another perspective, but one built mostly on ignorance. Me2Sense Sunday, October 23, 2016 - 3:03 pm · Reply You got it backwards. The left-wing echo chamber robots are dumb as a box of rocks. Nick Monday, October 24, 2016 - 3:44 am · Reply Obama’s own publisher called him Kenyan to promote himself as a speaker. The government does propagandize for homosexuality. Islam is an evil religion that promotes anti-semitism, slavery and violence. People may say extreme-sounding things, but they’re based on facts. Don’t compare message boards to all of the major broadcast networks, newspapers, magazines and social media sites, which are ALL globalist-progressive. Yes even FOX News is on the same team as CNN and the New York Times. DavGreg Friday, October 21, 2016 - 8:27 pm · Reply You should take your meds. Drumpf is likely to get his ass whipped and the GOP is likely to lose the Senate. Thanks to Republican Gerrymandering they are likely to retain the House, but with a narrower margin. If voter turnout is high it will be better for Democrats and if it is lower it will be better for the Republicans. Dave H Friday, October 21, 2016 - 5:46 pm · Reply It’s about time you changed your name again. Next time go for years when the Republicans might put forward someone electable. If you can count that high. YOU GOT THAT RIGHT! Friday, October 21, 2016 - 10:04 pm · Reply Aww… What’s a matter Fisty? Feeling low? Downtrodden? Beleaguered? GOOD. You, and your kind will never win. YOU BUILT THIS. Live in it. Me2Sense Saturday, October 22, 2016 - 5:01 am · Reply So you are supporting the most corrupt pay to play candidate EVER to run for POTUS — and your proud of it? Wow. We are in trouble. Dave H Saturday, October 22, 2016 - 6:53 am · Reply Of course he is. Because Hillary is the better of the two options on offer despite her many many faults. It’s about time you realised that your candidate is that bad. The GOP only needed to put someone electable up and this election was theirs for the taking. Instead the Tea Party types who have infested (yes, infested) the Republicans have put Hillary into the Oval Office. Well done them eh? Me2Sense Sunday, October 23, 2016 - 2:56 pm · Reply What a stupid reply. Nobody’s freedom on this forum requires your permission or approval.

Dave H Sunday, October 23, 2016 - 4:20 pm · Reply It looks like those “dumb and corrupt Dems” only need to sit back now and watch the GOP suffer a major self-inflicted electoral kicking. You might want to think about the reasons for that. Me2Sense Sunday, October 23, 2016 - 5:26 pm · Reply Well, if the corrupt Dems win they have gamed the system. And we all know the media, Hollywood, teachers and unions are working overtime in the Dems corner. So if they sadly win, it’s not because they are pure as the driven snow. Right now, the party of people at one time is the party of the CORRUPT and CONNECTED (Clinton Foundation). Make American Great Again — DT! Look at My Hands Saturday, October 22, 2016 - 11:00 am · Reply What’s going to happen to your moniker after the election? First bullshit, then more bullshit. Your side might go down in historic flames because even the deplorables think you’re wrong. DavGreg Friday, October 21, 2016 - 8:01 pm · Reply Pepe the Frog is well known to have been adopted as a symbol by the alt-right. The alt-right organized around precepts and values that are against the broad multi-cultural view that is widely accepted and in the mainstream through most of the US and developed world. The inclusion of that symbol in a thinly dusguised game to promote the Drumpf Campaign. Apple was right in rejecting it. If you do not like Apple’s decision, do the free market thing and go buy an Android or Windows phone. Apple is a private sector company and nobody is making you buy their stuff. Derek Currie Friday, October 21, 2016 - 8:15 pm · Reply I Guess We Need To Talk About Pepe The Frog …Later, observers began noticing an increase in white supremacist themes in Pepe images — or a rise in Pepe usage by white supremacist accounts. Either way, an association was building. This May, an “anonymous white nationalist” told The Daily Beast that the shift was intentional: a dedicated campaign to “reclaim Pepe from normies,” or members of the mainstream, by making Pepe so culturally unacceptable that only the fringe Internet would dare to use him. Donald Trump had earlier tweeted an image of Pepe-as-Trump, and then his son posted an image on Instagram that included Pepe. Homeandmantel Friday, October 21, 2016 - 11:30 pm · Reply Can’t wait until the election is over and the landslide Hillary captured that the GOP will finally cut ties with the ignorant and racist constituency it has built up over the past decade and a half. Trump will singlehandly turn red states blue after this. The party of stupid has to make a wide turn or die off with all the party senile elderly it clings to as it’s base.

The action continues with Macs finding great favor within IBM. Also, education initiatives via iPads continue. Finally, IBM’s Watson has to be giving Apple some big ideas. This has the signs of becoming one of the most productive partnerships ever, amongst former rivals, in the tech industry. Watson Avatar. A smarter planet. Apple & IBM Synergy This week, I saw three notable articles that punctuate the ongoing partnership between these two companies. 1. “IBM says it is 3X more expensive to manage PCs than Macs.” This is from Jonny Evans at Computerworld. I remember, back in the 1990s, those of us in the workplace who proselytized Macs pointed out that Macs were easier and less expensive to operate. That counsel usually fell on deaf ears because IT mangers were invested in PCs and Windows for reasons that outweighed long term cost savings. To get their way, they argued that Macs were too expensive initially. That was a cost that was in the face of signature authority and hard to brush under the rug. In contrast, ongoing maintenance costs were a bigger, more muddled pie and easier to justify. Today, things have changed a little. IBM is very conscious at a high level, about those cost savings. Author Evans writes: IBM today told the record-setting seventh Jamf Nation User Conference that it is saving even more money by deploying Macs across the company than it thought: each Mac deployment saves the company up to US$535 over four years, in contrast to the $270 per Mac it claimed last year. Fletcher Previn, IBM VP of Workplace as a Service, told the conference: IBM began replacing PCs with Macs in early 2015, when it began giving employees the choice to upgrade to a Mac when their company kit needed upgrading. The data speaks for itself, at IBM an astonishing 73 percent of employees will choose a Mac when they get the chance to choose for themself. Not only has the company been saving between $264-$535 for each Mac deployment over four years, but just 3.5 percent of employees using a Mac will call the company help desk. Give employees the devices they want, manage those devices in a modern way, and drive self sufficiency in the environment.” It’s a remarkable thing to have happen. And when Apple Macs start to ignite IBM employees with infectious enthusiasm, Apple no doubt has taken note. The Mac is hardly dead. Perhaps we’ll see if this IBM effect has influenced Apple’s thinking about the Mac on October 27. IBM ‘s Watson partners with Apple in education. Image credit: IBM Watson Goes to School 2. “First IBM Watson Education App for iPad Delivers Personalized Learning for K-12 Teachers and Students.” This is an IBM newsroom release. From the release: 19 Oct 2016: IBM … today announced the first IBM MobileFirst for iOS education app. The app, IBM Watson Element for Educators, enables a new level of engagement for teachers by providing a holistic view of each student at their fingertips, including data on interests, accomplishments, academic performance, attendance, behaviors and learning activities. As a result, teachers are empowered with data-driven insights to help them address individual needs that can potentially lead to better outcomes throughout student’s K-12 learning experiences. The key here is the heuristics in use by IBM’s Watson to support what’s called “IBM Watson Element.” The operation of this tool is remarkable. IBM Watson Element provides teachers with a holistic view of each student through a fun, easy-to-use and intuitive mobile experience that is a natural extension of their work. Teachers can get to know their students beyond their academic performance, including information about personal interests and important milestones students choose to share. For example, teachers can input notes when a student’s highly anticipated soccer match is scheduled, when another has just been named president for the school’s World Affairs club, and when another has recently excelled following a science project that sparked a renewed interest in chemistry. IBM’s Watson has already been pressed into service to partner with oncologists. No doubt, Apple’s influence on IBM engineers with Macs is being reciprocated with a keen understanding by Apple executives on the payoff derived from IBM’s supercomputer and Watson expertise. I can only imagine IBM’s briefings to Apple on the opportunities. Finally…. IBM’s Watson. Image credit: IBM Medical Research Meets Health & FItness 3. “IBM Is Counting on Its Bet on Watson, and Paying Big Money for It.” This is from the New York Times. IBM is betting big in Watson to fuel IBM’s resurgence, according to the NYT. IBM has invested billions of dollars in its Watson business unit, created at the start of 2014, which now employs an estimated 10,000 workers. Its big-ticket marketing push includes clever television ads that feature Watson trading quips with famous people like Serena Williams and Bob Dylan. And Watson, after a slow start, has shown its mettle by assisting in daunting tasks like diagnosing cancer. … The technology, IBM executives say, has the potential to make precision medicine and tailored therapies available to millions of cancer patients instead of the small number now treated at elite medical centers with genomics expertise. With IBM’s focus on research in medicine and Apple’s enthusiasm for health and fitness monitoring, it may not be too long before Watson is interacting with our iPhones and Apple Watches via HealthKit and Siri in further partnership. The Challenge For Apple Clearly IBM has learned a lot about how to increase productivity and cut costs by giving employees Macs, the best tool for the job. Synergies with iPads in education and the enterprise have now been well documented. The question in my mind is how fast can Apple learn its way around IBM’s supercomputer and AI culture, and what new challenges will Apple take up with that new expertise. The good news? It’ll all be guided by Tim Cook’s character and values. With two tech giants like Apple and IBM working on medicine and education, all kinds of good things will happen next. Most importantly, the concrete work already done greatly outweighs the speculative doomsday scenarios of AI agents run amok. And consider: these companies used to be arch enemies in the long gone PC wars of the 1980s and 1990s. I give credit to Tim Cook’s vision. And we’re just in the relatively early stages of this partnership.

Think of what A-series plus Rosetta could do if Apple decided to do it. October 21, 2016 at 8:37 EST PM OneTokenRingToRuleThemAll October 21, 2016 I’m not sure you can classify IBM as a bitter enemy of Apple in the 1990’s. They did form the AIM alliance together with Motorola to develop, manufacture and implement the PowerPC chip starting in 1991. While it’s great to see them working closely again it isn’t the first time or like they’ve just finally mended fences. October 21, 2016 at 11:01 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

British car auctioneer Coys of Kensington just sold a 1964 Aston Martin DB5 for £825,000, which is a little over US$1 million. That’s the single largest Apple Pay transaction to date. Aston Martin DB5 sold for $1M with Apple Pay Coys said the transaction is the largest in-app purchase ever, and that it was done via the Vero social media platform. According to Coys, The car is one of the highly sought-after right hand drive silver birch models with red leather trim. It has undergone a full restoration—including engine rebuild, suspension and gearbox overhaul following 20 years in dry storage, during which time it was not used. For those who aren’t in the know, unlike the proud owner of this Aston Martin, Apple Pay is Apple’s mobile payment platform that makes credit card transactions more secure. Your card number and personally identifying information aren’t linked to specific purchases. Instead, single use digital tokens act as the go-between for sellers and credit card accounts. Apple Pay launched in October 2014 with the release of iOS 8.1. The iPhone 6 and newer, along with Apple Watch, support using the payment system at credit card terminals through NFC wireless communication. You authenticate purchases with your fingerprint by pressing the Touch ID-enabled Home button. It’s a handy payment system and faster than chip-and-pin credit card readers. Apple Pay adoption is growing around the world, but isn’t yet a defacto standard. It is, however, up to the task of handling a million dollar car sale. Unfortunately, the buyer of this DB5 wants to stay anonymous, so you’re out of luck if you were planning on calling up your long lost cousin for a joy ride.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple How to stop specific contacts from knowing when you’ve read their iMessages Zach Epstein BGR NewsOctober 22, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Apple's iOS 10 software has been available for a while now. In fact, the latest version of Apple's popular mobile platform is already installed on more than two-thirds of all active iOS devices in the world, and we're likely less than a week away from seeing the next major build, iOS 10.1, released to the public. Tens of millions of people use iOS 10 each day, and yet Apple added so many new features to the platform that many people miss things they would actually benefit from a great deal. Among the new features that often go unnoticed by many is the option to control iMessage read receipts on a per-contact basis. That's right, you can stop specific contacts from knowing when or even if you read their messages. In this post, we'll tell you exactly how to do it. DON'T MISS: iPhone 7 Plus vs Google Pixel speed tests: Closer, but Android was still crushed in the end Everyone knows that you can enable or disable read receipts across the board by opening the Settings app and toggling read receipts on or off from within the Messages menu. Most people want to leave them on, but there are always a few contacts who send you messages and you don't want them to know if and when you've read them. This is one of those iPhone and iPad features where, once you find out how easy it is, you want to kick yourself for not having noticed it before. Here's all you need to do: From within the Messages app, open a conversation with the contact in question Tap the "i" in the top-right corner On that screen, you'll see a setting for "Send Read Receipts" — toggle it to off That's it. This setting will override your global setting and this specific contact will no longer know when you open his or her messages.

Busiest day for earnings, GDP and more coming in the next week CNBC 10/21/2016 Evelyn Cheng A flood of earnings, U.S. economic growth and some Fed speakers are set to hit markets in the coming week, and could help add confidence to a picture of moderate growth and an end to the earnings recession.  Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 105.71 -2.72 -2.51% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 719.07 -19.94 -2.70% Alphabet Inc GOOGL ▼ 753.22 -18.53 -2.40% About a third of S&P 500 (.SPX) companies are scheduled to report next week, including Apple (AAPL) on Tuesday. Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google's parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are set to post quarterly results on Thursday, the busiest day of the earnings season. "If nothing changes … we would say we came out of the earnings recession this quarter and that the second quarter was the final quarter of this earnings recession," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Financials, materials and technology are expected to show the most earnings per share growth this quarter, Stovall said, while energy industrials and telecom are forecast to be the laggards.  In the past week, financials were among the top performers after the major bank earnings topped expectations. The S&P 500 gained about 8 points for the week to end at 2,141 Friday. Next week, "I think really the big focus is going to be on earnings," said Casey Clark, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede. "I think we're in a situation where investors are focusing on earnings and traditional drivers of equity markets. Part of that is there's more comfort on global central bank policy." A UBS study in October showed that over the last five years, the S&P 500 moves more in sync with earnings per share than the level of interest rates. The correlation between stocks and earnings was very high, almost 90 percent, vs. less than 40 percent correlation between stocks and interest rates. The average year-end S&P 500 target is 2,198, according to CNBC's Market Strategist Survey conducted in October. But strategists are watching whether earnings growth will sustain further gains in the market.  "Next year's earnings look too high, and that might mean the market is a tad more expensive than it looks, but it's helpful that the third-quarter earnings [are beating so far]," said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at TIAA Global Asset Management, which has about $915 billion in assets under management. "We're still making our way out of this period where energy earnings look weak compared to where they were one year ago," Nick said. Most analysts expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates at its December meeting, but will watch data ahead of the central bank's meeting on Nov. 1 and 2. The Markit manufacturing and services PMI are scheduled for release next Monday and Wednesday, respectively. Three Fed speakers are set to speak Monday ahead of the blackout period heading into the Fed's meeting Nov. 1 and 2. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard speaks on the U.S. economy and monetary policy Monday morning, while Chicago Fed President Charles Evans is set to speak on current economic conditions and monetary policy in the afternoon. Fed Governor Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak later in the day on the future of Treasury market settlement. The first read on U.S. gross domestic product is due next Friday, and the consensus estimate from Reuters is 2.5 percent. The final read on second-quarter GDP showed an annual rate of 1.4 percent growth. A print between 1.5 percent and 3 percent is "probably a number consistent with the Fed passing in November but hiking in December," said John Canally, chief economic strategist at LPL Financial. Other data scheduled for release next week include the Markit manufacturing and services PMI, the employment cost index, consumer sentiment and pending home sales. Overseas, the preliminary estimate on third-quarter U.K. GDP is due for release Thursday, the first full-quarter GDP data since the surprise U.K. vote to leave the European Union. "Brexit negotiations [are] always on slow boil every week and next week is no different," Canally said. "A very weak number on the U.K.[GDP] may weaken Prime Minister May's hand temporarily." European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is scheduled to speak Tuesday in Berlin on "Stability, Equity and Monetary Policy."

According to Eric Smith, Strategy Analytics’ senior tablet and touchscreen strategies analyst, the first PowerBook’s impact “is still shaking the industry today.” Just as the telephone led to people’s demanding TV’s invention, the desktop PC had business users in particular asking when a genuinely portable counterpart would land. As the ‘80s became the ‘90s, Toshiba and Compaq had started on the right track and had taken an early lead in the very nascent laptop market. But Apple loves nothing more than a benchmark to beat. “Apple has done a very good job of letting the market test new technologies for a bit before they refine it and send it through the reality distortion field to make the tech new again,” said Smith. And the PowerBook was the perfect example. It was the lightest and best-looking laptop on the market thanks to some industrial design and miniaturisation input from Sony. But the single feature that made it revolutionary was an integrated trackpad and somewhere for the user to rest his or her wrists while typing so that it was actually comfortable to use. “Apple’s focus on industrial design and mobility paved the way for even slimmer PC designs to the point that tablets and 2-in-1 devices are now powerful enough to handle most day-to-day activities,” Smith said. The computer was an instant hit. For a brief period, the PowerBook owned 40 per cent of the portable computing market. But within a year it was gone because once they’d got the recipe, it didn’t take long for other companies to catch up. And while Apple continued to innovate in the portable computing sphere, it wasn’t until Steve Jobs returned that those ideas — integrated Wi-Fi, titanium shell, USB ports, a widescreen display — would translate into sales and a return to the top of the market for premium products, at least. Since 1991 the notebook has gone from a business device to the de facto computer form. According to Strategy Analytics data, the global computer sales split is currently 65 per cent notebook versus 35 per cent desktop. When the original PowerBook launched, all laptop sales accounted for just 5 per cent of the entire PC market. “What’s particularly interesting is how Microsoft finally turned the tables on Apple with its Surface Pro 2-in-1 device precisely at a time — 2014-to-2015 — when Apple laptops were taking serious market share from PC competitors,” points out Smith. In just three years, the Surface Pro has potentially had as much impact on the world of computing — ushering in the two-in-one form factor — as that first PowerBook. “We estimate 25 per cent of all tablets sold will be two-in-ones in 2020, totalling around 60 million units,” explains Smith. But of course there is also still a big demand for innovative notebook computers and it’s no coincidence Apple is currently gearing up for the launch of its latest-generation MacBook Pro. But will it usher in another revolution? — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Facebook accidentally declares some users dead, including founder Zuckerberg Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Sony seeks to patent method for measuring journalists' accuracy The best action cams for winter sports Consumer drone business stumbles, but commercial markets beckon Apple now sells refurbished iPhones Robotic dinosaur replicas stomp in Tokyo hotel (VIDEO) Best smartphones for holiday 2016 Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Malaysian gaming content exports soar 75pc to RM80m Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Models with Down Syndrome team up with celebrities 'Beauty and the Beast' first full-length trailer Reuters Video: Reflection ‘healthy’ for Democratic party, says Obama Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Reuters Video: Duchess meets movie-star cat, animals go wild Related Articles Samsung seeks redemption with AI-infused Galaxy S8 phone Huawei wants to beat Apple in smartphones in two years Five luxury laptops for stylish and powerful portable computing TAG Heuer invades Apple’s home turf with Silicon Valley office Apple’s new laptop gets more touchy, but not on its screen Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were launched in Thailand yesterday. - + Sales of the highly anticipated iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in Thailand, buoyed by record-high discounts and promotions offered by mobile operators, have exceeded the expectations of local handset distributors. The iPhone 7 Plus has seen much higher demand than expected and is difficult to find in stores, thanks to the appeal of dual cameras, the popularity of the Jet Black colour and the problems endured by Samsung's Galaxy Note 7. Instead of massive lines outside Bangkok's flagship Apple stores as seen in previous handset debuts, only a few people were waiting to buy the new iPhones. Companies operating in Thailand have temporary suspended their marketing and advertising activities to express sympathy after the death of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus feature the same 4.7 and 5.5-inch screen sizes, and will be available in three storage configurations: 32 gigabytes, 128GB and 256GB. Prices of the new iPhone duo with 32GB capacity start at 26,500 and 31,500 baht, respectively. Total Access Communication (DTAC), the country's second-largest mobile operator, is offering the most attractive discount of 6,000 baht on purchase of one of the new iPhones when customers register a 12-month postpaid mobile service for 899 baht a month. Customers, who sign up for a 12-month postpaid service for 999 baht a month or over and make a 3,000-baht payment in advance, will get the next iPhone released if they stay in DTAC's network after one year. Customers migrating from other networks will receive an extra 1,500 baht discount on top of the 6,000-baht discount offering when they register a 599-baht service contract. True Move is offering a discount of 3,000 baht for customers who sign up for a 699-baht mobile service plan for one year and make a 1,500 baht payment in advance. Those who sign up for 899 and 1,099 baht tariff plans will get discounts of 6,000 and 8,000 baht for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, respectively. They are required to make a payment of 3,000 and 4,000 baht in advance, respectively. Mobile leader Advanced Info Service is discounting 2,000 baht for a purchase of an iPhone 7 for registering its prepaid service at 399 baht package for one year. Nutchanon Boonsorn, associate market analyst of IDC Thailand, said the three major mobile operators are making aggressive moves quietly at this time, and not keeping with tradition where fans queued to be among first in the country to get their hands on the latest iPhone.

Time Warner owns the Warner Bros. studio, CNN and the Cartoon Network, is home to Harry Potter and Batman films, TV powerhouses The Big Bang Theory and Gotham, DC Comics and the Time Inc. magazine portfolio (Time, Entertainment Weekly, Fortune.) Apple sees two-thirds of its revenues from the iPhone, but the fastest growing division within Apple is the Services category, which includes iTunes and Apple Music. Wireless provider AT&T looks to be Time Warner's major suitor. Shares of the company rose more than 8% Friday after reports from Bloomberg and the Journal said AT&T is in advanced talks to be acquired by telecom giant AT&T. Beyond wireless plans, AT&T is now also a major player in both broadband distribution, via its U-Verse network, and owns satellite provider DirecTV. There were reports in 2015 that Apple was looking to get into original programming, a la Netflix and Amazon, to feed iTunes, which offers movies, TV shows and music from the major studios and labels. Instead, a production company announced a TV show, Planet of the Apps, produced in association with Apple, that will be an American Idol of sorts for the app world. Actresses and digital mavens Jessica Alba and Gwyneth Paltrow have signed as "mentors." Apple had no comment. Time Warner had $28 billion in revenue in 2015,  vs. $234 billion for Apple's fiscal 2015.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > Apple's First iOS Developer Academy Opens October 6 at University of Naples Apple's First iOS Developer Academy Opens October 6 at University of Naples Wednesday, 5 October 2016 Apple's first iOS Developer Academy is set to open this week at the University of Naples Federico II's new San Giovanni a Teduccio campus, located in a coastal suburb east of Naples, Italy. The campus will see Apple teaching 200 Italian students how to write code to create apps that will run on Apple's iOS devices during the nine month course. Students will be provided with a current-generation MacBook, iPhone, and iPad, along with tuition, all for free. More than 4,000 students applied for 200 spots during an open enrollment program. Next year, more spots will be available, as the university plans to accept 400 students. Leopoldo Angrisani, a professor who has helped get the program up and running, spoke with The Guardian and shared some details on the campus ahead of its opening on October 6. Apple had a hand in the design of the academy, which is housed in one of three modern-looking buildings with glass facades. The layout of the large, open-plan classroom was designed by Apple. "The didactic model is very new [for us]," Angrisani said. Small groups of students will sit at round tables equipped with special acoustic systems so the teacher can communicate with each table individually about their work. All courses will be taught in English, since it is meant to be open to students from around the world. "Competition will be a fundamental part of the class," Angrisani said. Couches and a lounge area are included in the classroom, giving students a chance to rest, and Apple expects collaboration between students will be a key part of the classroom experience. "Apple thinks that all of these activities, learning and rest and so on, have to stay very close to each other, because this is the best way to ensure that the concepts are absorbed and understood very well," Angrisani told The Guardian. During its visit to the campus, The Guardian was shown the classroom where classes will be held, but was not allowed to sit in on a meeting where an Apple official was instructing academy teachers. University officials also said Apple had been "very, very" involved in the work at the academy, down to details like the lighting in the classroom and the color on the walls. In the past, Apple has said the iOS Developer Academy will be expanded to other countries around the world in the future.Tags: Italy, iOS Developer Academy Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: MultiVu - on October 4, 2016< > Embed OKSTATE & NYPhil Reveal Partnership 01:30 Oklahoma State University (OSU) and the New York Philharmonic announced a residency partnership marking the opening of the new McKnight Center for the Performing Arts at OSU in October, 2019.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Hide Your Kids, Hide Your Car – The iPhone 7 Explodes And Sets Car On Fire As Well By Ramish Zafar Posted 3 weeks ago 279Shares Share Tweet Submit As we exit 2016, we’ll have witnessed a lot of controversy. It’s been a slow year for mobile all around, as manufacturers wait for major hardware upgrades next year. For devices, we’ve seen a couple of great flagships and designs. Of the latter, it’s been the LG G5’s year, as the Korean manufacturer becomes the first to present a modular flagship smartphone. For new features, it’s another Korean manufacturer Samsung who brought Iris scanning on top tier devices. Apple took a much subtle approach, with the iPhone’s major changes being less visible. However, when it comes to explosions, both Apple and Samsung aren’t safe from infamy. An iPhone 7 has recently exploded causing significant damage in its wake. Take a look below to find out more. Newly Bought Apple iPhone 7 Catches Fire In Australia Severely Damaging Car In Process As the year ends, a lot of users will be vary of their smartphones. Samsung’s aforementioned Galaxy Note 7 will be the primary reason behind this. The device’s faulty design/batteries have forced the Korean tech giant to suspend production and issue a complete recall. This has affected its brand reputation significantly and has resulted in the device being banned on airlines completely. Now, it’s looking like the Note 7 isn’t the only device that is susceptible to combustion. We’ve been seeing a lot of similar reports surface for the iPhone 7 as well. While the majority of these just might be inauthentic, a couple do look to be the real deal. One of these, which has surfaced today claims considerable damage. It’s from Australia and shows a malfunctioning iPhone 7 that has left a lot of damage in its wake. Advertisement Surfer Matt Jones had purchased Apple’s iPhone 7 only a week back. On one of his trips to the beach, Jones left the smartphone under his clothes in his car. When he returned, he was surprised on two accounts. Both his car and iPhone 7 were on fire, in an unfortunate display of the age old proverb ‘two birds, one stone’. Jones was quick to record the remains of his phone, clothes and car. You can take a look at them in the images above. He believes that the iPhone is the source of the fire, and we’re inclined to concur. Jones also further claims that he hasn’t used any third party charging accessories with the iPhone in question. While this is likely to be an isolated incident, the recent misfortune surrounding Samsung does breed some uncanny correlation. Apple’s taken note of these events and is investigating the matter. It’s been an interesting year folks, with some rather unusual patters. Let us know what you think in the comments section below and stay tuned for the latest.

Home Fe columnist Still forbidden fruit Still forbidden fruit India wants Apple, but bureaucracy won’t let it happen By: The Financial Express | Published: October 22, 2016 6:19 AM In the case of phone manufacturers like Apple, there is very little the company can source since there are no suppliers for parts that it requires and shifting designing, if at all, takes time. (Source: Reuters) Given how desperately the government wanted to woo high-profile US companies like Apple, it is truly amazing how it has allowed itself to be thwarted by the bureaucracy every step of the way. What makes it all the more nonplussing is that the Narendra Modi government was elected on the premise it would change many of the growth-restricting policies brought in by the UPA—the single-brand retail policy was a classic example. The UPA’s 30% local-sourcing norm never made sense since, given a choice, every firm wants to do more local sourcing to cut on both logistics costs as well as import duties which, after the NDA came in, are as high as 11% for phones that are not made in India—what keeps firms from doing more local sourcing is the fact that the local market is simply not developed enough, and developing quality suppliers can take years, if not decades. In the case of phone manufacturers like Apple, there is very little the company can source since there are no suppliers for parts that it requires and shifting designing, if at all, takes time. That is also the reason why, despite all the talk by firms like Foxconn, no real phone manufacturing plant has been set up in the country so far. It took the NDA a year-and-a-half to study what was needed to change the policy. Yet, when it came out in November last year, the policy was vague—it said the government ‘may’ ‘relax’ sourcing norms for products that had ‘state-of-art’ and ‘cutting-edge’ technology and where ‘local sourcing (was) not possible’. The policy offered no clarity on whether the local sourcing would be relaxed or not, what relaxation meant, what cutting-edge and state-of-art were and who would decide whether local sourcing was not possible. But government officials privately said the policy was meant to ensure Apple came in—presumably, Apple was told the same thing since it then applied to set up its own shops here. Yet, the application was rejected by the very government that was wooing Apple. The government went back to the drawing board and, seven months later, it unveiled a policy it chose to describe as full of ‘radical changes’. Yet, the bureaucracy ensured the language was even vaguer. This time around, the local sourcing norms were to be ‘relax(ed)’ for ‘up to three years’, after which there would be ‘a relaxed sourcing regime for another five years’ for firms which had ‘state-of-art’ and ‘cutting-edge’ technologies. Apart from the vagueness of the earlier norms, new ones were introduced—how much was the initial relaxation going to be for, how much relaxation would there be? Naturally enough, though the same officials said Apple would now come in, Apple has not applied under even the NDA’s second iteration of the law. While the government had said that Apple has been told of the changes, the US Trade Representative brought up restrictive single-brand retail norms with the commerce minister on Thursday. If the government doesn’t really want Apple to set up shop here, it should give up the pretence of changing the law to woo it—but if it really wants Apple but is being stymied by the bureaucracy, that’s an even bigger shame.

So much so that they announced that the Apple Watch would be available in high-end departmental stores like the Galeries Lafayette in Paris. However it seems that Apple’s luxury plans could be coming to an end because according to a report from French website Mac4Ever (via 9to5Mac), the Apple Watch booth/store-within-a-store inside the Galeries Lafayette could be closing down soon. The report claims that they are 99% certain that these booths will be closed come January 2017. It also seems that Apple has been reducing the number of staff working in the store, and ultimately it is expected that the remaining staff be redeployed to other Apple Stores in the city of Paris. Apparently this is due to the poor sales of the Apple Watch, although to date Apple has yet to provide exact figures of how many devices they have sold. Third-party analytical reports have suggested that as far as smartwatches are concerned, the Apple Watch is dominating. It also seems that Apple might have figured out that not many people are buying its $10,000 Apple Watch Edition, which is why with the Apple Watch Series 2, Apple has opted for a more affordable ceramic version in place of it.

Not to mention companies would have to partner up with banks and retailers to ensure compatibility. The good news is that if you are living in Germany, it seems that there is a good chance that Apple Pay could be making its way to your country in the near future. This is according to Apple’s website in which Germany was highlighted as one of the markets that Apple Pay is available. However it should be noted that Apple’s website has since been updated and Apple Pay’s availability in Germany has been removed. However we can only assume that based on this, Apple Pay could be eventually announced for the market, and that the image went up ahead of an official announcement. We have no idea when the announcement will take place, but hopefully it will be soon. Apple is hosting an event on the 27th of October to announce their new Macs, but it is possible that Apple Pay’s expansion into other markets could also be announced then, so do check back with us next week for the details.

AP Friday, October 21, 2016 SAN FRANCISCO, CA -- Apple says it has been buying Apple chargers and cables labeled as genuine on Amazon.com and has found nearly 90 percent of them to be counterfeit. The revelation comes in a federal lawsuit filed by Apple against a New Jersey company on Monday over what Apple says are counterfeit products that were sold on Amazon. In the lawsuit, Apple says Mobile Star imprinted Apple logos on cables and chargers that "pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock." It says the chargers and cables were being sold on Amazon as genuine Apple products. Apple says it purchased the products on Amazon and later told the online retailer that they were fake. Amazon then identified Mobile Star as the source. Amazon isn't named in the suit, but said in a statement that it has "zero tolerance" for counterfeiters on its site and that it pursues "wrongdoers" aggressively. Mobile Star didn't return a voicemail seeking comment. Some warnings to look for in phony products include misspellings in product description and the charging cord should plug in perfectly with the charger.

There are plenty of manufacturers trying to take Apple's crown, and while it's a tall order to usurp the biggest brand in tablets, we've found one Best Buy model that more than holds its own against the iPad. It even surpasses the iPad when it comes to start up speed.  The Android model proved to be a nippy machine, and it's worth a look for anyone who wants power but baulks at Apple's prices.  The latest tablets tested by Which?: Acer Switch Alpha 12 Acer Iconia Tab 8 W Acer Aspire Switch 10 E Amazon Fire HD8 (2016) Asus ZenPad 3S 10 Asus ZenPad 8.0 (2016) Asus ZenPad 10 (2016) Huawei Matebook Lenovo IdeaPad MIIX 310 The rise of the tablet/laptop hybrid Also on test this month were three tablets that doubled as laptops, with the addition of a keyboard. We've seen some very impressive models that manage to straddle the two products in our previous testing, but they tend to be pricey. Some of the most recent models, such as the Aspire Switch 10 E and Lenovo IdeaPad MIIX 310 start from as little as £200. On paper it seems a bargain price for 'two devices in one', but does it ring true for these budget models? Read our full reviews to find out. Amazon Fire HD8 Also in the latest batch is the Amazon Fire HD8, a follow up to last years models of the same name. The 2016 version has been give a more powerful processor and had a RAM boost, and the battery life is better too. On the downside, the famously slim tablet has bulked out a little, but not enough to cause concern. Specs aren't everything though, so to find out if these changes actually make for a better tablet, read our full review of the Amazon Fire HD8.
