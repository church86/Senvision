Samsung being the lead in this mobile OLED space, it was known to everyone that the company will be going to order from them. This is not the first, rumors regarding this started to spill on the internet along with iPhone 8 specs. According to few reports of last year, the company had placed an order for around 100 million 5.5-inch AMOLED panels from it's rival for iPhone 7. Recently, there was another report stating that both the companies made an agreement of $4.3 billion OLED supply for some 60 million OLED panels.

David Hsieh, senior director of Research company IHS Markit says, "Apple has ordered 70 million units of OLED panels from Samsung this year, while Samsung is preparing to churn out as many as 95 million for Apple in 2017, in case demand exceeds expectations". He also added, "It is also possible that some of these 70 million handsets will not be shipped to customers this year and be carried over to next year depending on demand". So, nothing is confirmed yet by the company.

While there have been wild rumors over the past several months, it appears now that things have started to solidify. According to Nikkei, Apple has placed an order with Samsung for 70 million flexible OLED displays. This could suggest that the firm could be ready to offer a handset that has a near bezel-less design similar to Honor's Magic. Although Samsung has offered a curved display in its smartphones for quite some time, this would be Apple's first foray into the format. Unfortunately, Samsung declined to corroborate the information obtained by Nikkei, citing privacy of customer orders. Beyond just offering a curved OLED display, the new handset could also include wireless charging and some augmented reality features, both of which would also firsts for Apple. While the handset does sound fantastic, we will have to wait for an official reveal to see what actually manifests later this year.

Tuesday, April 4, 2017 JobsDatingBuy photosLocal BusinessesStar ShopClassifiedsBook An AdDigital Editions Home News Sport Entertainment What's On Business Education Farming Motors Property Family Announcements Notices Directory Business Shropshire Business Ladder for Shropshire Perks: Rewarding your loyal customers City News Money Careers Business Supplement The Farmer Advertise Local Businesses PUBLISHED: April 3, 2017 08:30 LAST UPDATED: April 3, 2017 15:31 Shares in chip firm Imagination plunge 60% after 'worst nightmare' Apple blow Shares in British chip designer and Apple supplier Imagination Technologies have plummeted more than 60% after it revealed that the US tech giant will no longer use its products. Imagination said it will no longer be eligible for royalty payments when Apple stops using the group's intellectual property in its new products Imagination said on Monday that Apple, its largest customer, will cease using the group's intellectual property in its new products within two years, and it will therefore not be eligible for royalty payments. Investors reacted badly to the news, with shares in the Hertfordshire-based group dropping 63% to 99p in afternoon trading. Imagination said in a statement: "Imagination Technologies ... has been notified by Apple, its largest customer, that Apple is of a view that it will no longer use the group's intellectual property in its new products in 15 months' to two years' time, and as such will not be eligible for royalty payments under the current licence and royalty agreement." The firm added that Apple claimed it is working on its own graphics platform to support its products, meaning it will rely less on Imagination's technology. But it said the US firm has "not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination's technology, without violating Imagination's patents". The statement continued: "This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it. "Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights; accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple's assertions. "Apple's notification has led Imagination to discuss with Apple potential alternative commercial arrangements for the current licence and royalty agreement." Imagination's graphics technology has been used in an array of Apple products including the iPhone, iPad and iPod for several years. The loss of its biggest customer will come as a bitter blow and follows on from a tumultuous 2016. Last year Imagination posted a £61.5 million loss, the biggest in its history, and also embarked on a cost-cutting drive which saw 200 jobs axed. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said the situation represented Imagination's "worst nightmare", adding that the firm appears to be hinting at legal action against Apple. He said: "It's the worst nightmare for Imagination. Apple accounts for about half its revenues - you simply cannot easily replace a customer of that scale in a hurry, hence the gigantic sell-off in the stock. But the sell-off might be a bit stretched and we have seen a bit of easing from the worst of it this morning. "Imagination seems to be hinting at legal action, saying Apple would likely be in breach of its intellectual property rights if it walks away. But there could be a compromise, with Imagination stressing 'potential alternative commercial arrangements'. Either way this is about as bad as it can get for Imagination."

Reminder: Ben & Jerry’s Is Giving Away FREE Ice Cream Today How To Get Into Dungeons & Dragons Lessons From Apple's Decision To Make Its Own GPUs Anthony Caruana Apr 4, 2017, 3:30pm ⋅ Filed to:  apple Australian Stories gpus Share Image: Getty Images Apple has been using GPUs from British company Imagination. Well, today, Imagination is a company in crisis as their key customer has decided to move on and roll their own GPUs. Given Apple's acquisition of other chip makers and their desire to "control the whole widget" this is hardly surprising. But there's a lesson for all us about eggs and baskets. Apple has been licensing Imagination's PowerVR GPU technology in the A-series chips used in its iOS devices and Apple TV. And while the Mac uses GPUs from the usual suspects in that market, the S-series chip in the Apple Watch uses licensed tech from Imagination. With news of the switch by Apple, Imagination's market value plummeted by 70 per cent. That's a big hit that highlights the risk of putting all your eggs in one customer's basket. Whether you're a buyer or seller of technology, it's a good idea to spread your risk around so that the impact of one supplier or customer withdrawing doesn't kill your business. I hope Imagination comes out of this OK. They have developed some great tech and had more in the pipeline. But without the funds provided by their biggest customer, their capacity to develop new products may be stymied.

Apple Just Ordered 70 Million OLED Panels from Samsung by AdityaTApril 4, 2017 0 Now Reading Apple Just Ordered 70 Million OLED Panels from Samsung Browse This Page Article Rating Comments Concept by Benjamin Geskin Share on Facebook Share on Twitter According to a new report, a supply chain source familiar with iPhone designs has claimed that Apple has ordered 70 Million displays for the next iPhone, with the extent of the order reaching 95 Million if the demand exceeds expectations of the company. Despite tie-ups with LG in the past, Apple has chosen Samsung as the sole provider of the OLED screens which will most likely be Super AMOLED. Samsung may invest as much as 8 Billion dollars in the next few months to ramp up production of the the OLED displays, to fulfil the order from Apple in time. Increasing the capacity means, that Samsung will also be able to supply to other manufacturers who were at present unable to procure Super AMOLED screens due to limited production and availability. Samsung Electronics declined to comment, saying it cannot reveal customers’ orders. So far rumours have predicted three iPhones launching this year, with a 5.2 inch model which will sport the curved OLED panels from Samsung. The other iPhones with 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches as display sizes will be revisions to the existing iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus. The same source also reports that all three handsets will also sport wireless charging and come with waterproofing just like the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus. The premium model of the iPhone will have a front which is similar to the Galaxy S8 and will not have a home button, this variant will also be priced upwards of US $ 1000 . The next generation iPhone could be the first device to put the fingerprint scanner behind the glass of the display.   likethis What's your reaction?

By: IANS | San Francisco | Published:April 4, 2017 10:45 am Apple has used Imagination’s technology and intellectual property for many years. It has formed the basis of Graphics Processor Units (GPUs) in Apple’s phones, tablets, iPods, TVs and watches. Apple is developing its own graphics technology for iPhones, iPads and watches and will soon stop using PowerVR graphics processors made by British chip designer Imagination Technologies, Apple’s largest customer. In a statement issued late on Monday, Imagination said that Apple has notified them that it will no longer use the Group’s intellectual property in its new products in 15 months to two years time. The development led to shares in Imagination Tech crashing more than 70 per cent. The company was valued at more than $2.5 billion in 2012. Apple has used Imagination’s technology and intellectual property for many years. It has formed the basis of Graphics Processor Units (GPUs) in Apple’s phones, tablets, iPods, TVs and watches. “Apple has asserted that it has been working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination’s technology,” the British firm said in a statement. The development is bad news for Imagination, which gets about half of its revenue from Apple. It will stop receiving royalties on iPhone and iPad devices soon, media reports said. “Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it,” the statement further added. Imagination thinks it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple’s assertions. “Apple’s notification has led Imagination to discuss with Apple potential alternative commercial arrangements for the current license and royalty agreement,” the company said.

This news sparked rumors that iPhones released during that time will have a chip made from the same process node. Now, a new report seems to suggest that Apple will also introduce its own GPU architecture for the future iPhone 2019 edition. According to a recent press release by Imagination, Apple will cease its licensing agreement with the company within two years. This means that Apple will no longer be using Imagination’s PowerVR GPU architecture for its upcoming iPhone and iPad moving forward. The press release also mentioned that Apple is striving to be a lot more independent by implementing an in-house GPU design team. This move, to say the least, is a bit too risky on Apple’s part. For one, it will be very difficult for the company not to infringe any of the existing intellectual property rights that Imagination owns on Apple’s current devices. Furthermore, this is a huge undertaking since it is not exactly an easy task to come up with a totally new GPU architecture from scratch. iPhone 8 concept (via yahoo.com) On the other hand, Apple will have about 15 to 24 months to achieve this endeavour. By then, the Cupertino giant would probably be in the market for the iPhone 2019 or perhaps another version of the iPad. At this point, it is still too soon to say if Apple will succeed in its plans to cut ties with Imagination. However, the former has been known to go out of its way when it comes to its own technology. Case in point, the Lightning Port on current iPhones and iPads. All in all, it seems that Apple is reducing its reliance on third-party technology providers and choosing in-house research instead. This is quite a smart move since Apple will have complete control on what it wants and can do for its product development. For more updates on iPhone 2019, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: April 4, 2017 10:29 am To download Apple iOS 10.3.1 update, go to General in Setting tab. Next, click on Software Update. Here you’ll find the latest update. Apple has started to roll out iOS 10.3.1 update for iPhones and iPads. The update brings iOS 10.3 support for devices running 32-bit processor such as iPhone 5 and 5c. Apple iPhone iOS 10.3 was released a week back and iPhone 5, 5c users faced issues with the software upgrade given the devices run on older 32-bit processor (Apple A6 SoC). “iOS 10.3.1 introduces new features including the ability to locate AirPods using Find My iPhone and more ways to use Siri with payment, ride booking and carmaker apps,” the update reads. Apple Security updates page lists that iOS 10.3.1 is available for iPhone 5 and later, iPad 4th generation and later as well as iPod touch 6th generation and later. To download iOS 10.3.1 update, go to General in Setting tab. Next, click on Software Update. Here you’ll find the latest update. Now click on ‘Download and Install’ to download the update. Remember to take a back up of all your data before downloading. Also, make sure you’re connected to Wi-Fi and there’s at least 50 per cent charge on your iPhone. Apple Security updates page lists that iOS 10.3.1 is available for iPhone 5 and later, iPad 4th generation and later as well as iPod touch 6th generation and later. Further, Apple has already started to drop support for 32-bit apps with its iOS 10.3.2 beta, which was released last week. Apple will now show a pop-up message saying it needs to be updated, every time users open a 32-bit app. Developer Peter Steinberger spotted the message in iOS 10.3.2 beta and posted a screenshot of the same. It reads, “This app will not work with future versions of iOS. The developer of this app needs to update it to improve its compatibility.” Apple iOS 10.3 remains one of the major updates, one that brings support for features such as Find My AirPods, more functionalities for Siri as well as CarPlay improvements. Find My Airpods allow users to find their missing AirPods using the Find My iPhone app at any give time. Siri can now pull out cricket scores and other related statistics. Further, the voice-assistant can schedule rides using ride booking apps, monitor car fuel level, and turn on lights with select automaker apps. CarPlay improvements include new shortcuts in the status bar, curated playlists in Apple Music and support for UpNext option in Apple Music’s Now Playing tab.

Apple Launches App Accelerator in India Last week Apple formally opened its App Accelerator facility in Bengaluru, India’s tech hub. The program allows Apple experts to provide training and guidance to app developers in India. The opening came months after widespread reports that Apple would begin assembling iPhones in India.

Free Wi-Fi for More Railway Stations in India India’s minister of state for railways said it plans to provide free Wi-Fi in 709 railways stations in India by March 2020.

Imagination says that Apple will wind down its usage of PowerVR graphics IP within "15 months to two years time." That move will end Imagination's revenue stream from royalties on Apple SoCs. According to Imagination, the reason for this split is that Apple will be working on its own graphics processor technology for future A-series SoCs. That in-house development "will be reducing [Apple's] future reliance on Imagination's technology," according to the press release. That unusually frank disclosure from an Apple supplier might suggest that Apple's in-house GPU development is yet to come, but we've known that custom development work has been under way for some time already. David Kanter showed that Apple is shipping a custom-designed shader ALU in the A10 SoC's GPU late last year. This parting of ways will likely be rancorous. Imagination doesn't believe that Apple can carry out its mission to bring GPU development in-house without violating or replicating a wide swath of its "patents, intellectual property, and confidential information." Imagination is also skeptical that Apple has the chops to design a ground-up GPU architecture without infringing on its intellectual property. Accordingly, Imagination "does not accept Apple's assertions" that it can carry out this work without relying on Imagination's know-how. Should Apple be able to cut its ties with Imagination, the move would be a huge blow to the firm. Imagination called its Apple contract "essential to the business of the Group" in its 2016 financial report. Of the £120 million in revenue Imagination took in for its fiscal 2016, Apple represented £60.7 million of the pie. Imagination stock is down about 64% as of this writing.

Media sources have confirmed that Dr Dre and Jimmy Iovine will be joining Apple as part of the deal. While discussing the deal yesterday at the Code Conference, Iovine and Apple Senior VP Eddy Cue outlined the three overall reasons behind the deal that had baffled observers for a while. The “no brainer” deal was driven by a need for talent, great headphones and Beats Music. According to Cue the Beats team will be a perfect fit for Apple with Dre being an incredible artist with an incredible ear. Cue also noted that the Beats headphones were a great product and referenced Apple’s keen interest in headphones and speakers. Regarding Beats Music, Cue explained how the music subscription service was the first in its field being done right by effectively curating songs. advertisement Iovine mentioned how the deal was driven by the fact that Apple has respect for music, is keenly focused on quality hardware and respects copyright. Interestingly though, Beats once struck out a deal with HTC, something that Iovine said did not pan out because of a culture clash between the two companies. This stands as Apple’s largest acquisition and judging from the polarised view on the quality of Beats headphones it looks like the deal is leveraged more on the potential of the Beats Music service than any other reason. Apple’s earlier triumphs in music through iTunes have now been threatened by sliding revenues in downloads and the increasing relevance of subscription services such as Spotify. Apple’s own streaming service, iTunes Radio which was launched in September 2013 has not turned the industry on its head in the same way iTunes did under Steve Jobs’ direction. It would stand to reason that a stronger foray into this field with a service that understands music “as it should be consumed” would make better business sense. The acquihire of Dre and Iovine has been stated as, and is of course, a key component of this marriage. The duo have a pulse on the industry that Apple’s entire team would have been unable to match. Iovine’s strong connections in music, entertainment and content creation are also likely to be traded on. His insight into marketing that helped bring a new dimension of youth focused brand strategy at Interscope Records is worth exploiting for Apple’s sake. After all, this is a brand that would benefit immensely from any play that helps them maintain a “cool” factor. share Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Tags: Apple, Beats by Dre, Beats Electronics, Beats Music, Dr Dre, Eddy Cue, iTunes Radio, Jimmy Iovine, Spotify Follow us on Facebook Techzim Previous Post « Exciting presentations lined up for 2014 Broadband Forum Next post Zimbabwe’s average local broadband speed reaches new high » Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Reportedly Orders 70 Million OLED Screens for Premium iPhone That's a lot of premium iPhone screens. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 3, 2017 at 8:00PM According to Nikkei Asian Review, a generally reliable source for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supply-chain leaks, Apple has "placed orders for bendable organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels with Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) Electronics for use in 70 million handsets this year." "The large order suggests that Apple expects its new premium iPhone 7 to launched late 2017 to fly off the shelves," Nikkei Asian Review writes. Image source: Apple. Apple's going to sell a lot of phones Perhaps the most amazing thing about this report is that these orders apply just to the rumored premium OLED iPhone 8 -- not to the total number of new iPhone displays the company is ordering displays for. As you might recall, Apple is also expected to launch iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus smartphones -- essentially upgraded versions of the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus phones -- alongside the new OLED iPhone. Since the iPhone 8 with an OLED display is expected to be priced at a substantial premium to the standard iPhone 7s and 7s Plus, we should expect that Apple's total build plans for next-generation iPhone models will be well over the 70 million-unit mark reported for the iPhone 8. It appears Apple is going to sell a lot of smartphones in this coming product cycle. Not only that, but it also stands to see both significant unit shipment increases in addition to a potential blended average selling price boost thanks to the OLED iPhone. A great cycle for Apple, but... I think it's reasonable for investors to expect that this coming iPhone product cycle is going to be a phenomenal one for the company. And, to be blunt, the rise in Apple's stock this year of more than 24% as of this writing suggests that investors are, in fact, pricing in a great iPhone product cycle for the company. What's going to be much tougher to call is what Apple does to keep the momentum going after this potential "super-cycle." On one hand, I can see a path for Apple to continue to build on a potential super-cycle. If Apple can bring the key innovations of its premium OLED iPhone 8 to the "standard" price points next year while further advancing the premium iPhone with more exclusive features, then Apple's super-cycle could get a second wind. Apple overestimated demand for the 6s after enjoying an iPhone 6-driven "super-cycle." From that experience, Apple has surely learned that it takes a lot of innovation to keep the momentum going. At the same time, though, it's going to be quite difficult to meaningfully top what Apple brings to the table with its OLED iPhone. Many of the pain points with the current iPhone devices -- lack of an OLED display and huge bezels come to mind -- should finally be fixed. What Apple will need to do is to not just improve upon the features already present in the device, although it should do that, but it also needs to find ways to fundamentally improve the user experience with fundamentally new and useful features and functionality. We'll see in the coming years whether Apple's product-development teams have such features in store.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The photo had Coombs flanked to his right by Eli Apple and Gareon Conley with Marshon Lattimore standing on his left. Conley and Lattimore just finished their workout in front of nine NFL head coaches and over 120 pro personnel; Apple was back in town to watch two of his former teammates go through something he did just one year ago. Apple, of course, was selected No. 10 overall in the 2016 NFL Draft by the New York Giants. Lattimore and Conley might be joining him as first-round picks here shortly. If both do — and they’re both projected first-round picks — that would give Coombs three first-round corners in the last two seasons. Go back even further and add Bradley Roby and that would be four over the last four seasons. Quick, someone photoshop Roby into that photo so Coombs can frame it and put it in his office. He’s building quite the resumé. 3 pretty good corners at the Woody for Pro Day today! #lovemyguys #cantwaittoseethemallatthenextlevel! #firstrounderseveryone! #BIA #POU pic.twitter.com/oI451BF2P7 — Kerry Coombs (@OsuCoachCoombs) March 23, 2017 “I think we’re going to do a story at some point on Coach Coombs,” Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer said recently. “I don’t know how many guys — some guys go careers without coaching four first roundings and we’ve had one in [four years], four of them.” When asked about his recent success of developing first-round cornerback talent, Coombs essentially shrugged off the praise and credited his players. “We just have a lot of really good players that come here to play football and they work really, really hard,” Coombs said. “I am blessed.” Coombs came to Ohio State from Cincinnati before to the 2012 season. He’s served as the Buckeyes’ cornerbacks coach since then after he spent five seasons coaching defensive backs for the Bearcats. Prior to working under Brian Kelly and Butch Jones at UC, Coombs was a longtime high school coach at powerhouse Colerain High School in Cincinnati. His ties to the Cincinnati area — and many other places around the country — make him an invaluable recruiter for the Ohio State staff, too. Now, as the Buckeyes continue to pump out these first-round picks at corner, prospects from around the country want to come to Columbus and play for Meyer and Coombs. Ohio State signed five cornerbacks in its 2017 class. Two are from Ohio, two are from Texas and one is from Florida. When players arrive at Ohio State, no matter they come from, Coombs’ expectation is rather clear. "It's just all about working hard and working to be a first-round draft pick," said junior Denzel Ward, who will be Ohio State’s No. 1 corner this fall and has a chance to be next in the pipeline. It was Roby in 2014, Apple in 2016 and now, potentially, both Lattimore and Conley in 2017. That’s pretty much all Coombs has to say when he walks into the home of a cornerback prospect nowadays. The resumé speaks for itself. And if there was any doubt Coombs would miss his two latest pupils hear their names called at next month’s NFL Draft, Ohio State’s cornerbacks coach quickly erased it. Coombs wouldn’t miss this. “You better believe I’ll be there,” he said. “With bells on.” Spring Practice 2017 OSU Football Email this Article Share on Reddit Share on Twitter Share on Facebook 53 Comments View 53 Comments Log in or Sign up to Join the Discussion #beatmichigan Active Discussions NCAA Men's Basketball Championship...

Especially without a beta testing period, this mysterious update naturally raised a few questions. Although Apple would later release a note on what the update fixes, a security issue related to Wi-Fi, it might have left out the equally important part about fixing the update would have broken the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c. iOS 10.3 is filled with new features, which we already detailed in another post. But, for the purposes of this new hotfix, the relevant feature is phasing out support for 32-bit processors. Ever since the iPhone 5s and its A7 CPU, Apple has been using 64-bit processors in its mobile devices. In fact, Apple is credited to have given the needed impetus to get that new phase rolling in the industry. The problem is that iOS 10.3 still supports the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c, Apple’s last 32-bit iPhones. The update, then, would have caused problems for owners of those older phones. Apple quickly yanked the update from its servers for those two models. With 10.3.1, that issue has presumably been addressed. Officially, iOS 10.3.1 also fixes a rather severe security issue, one where an “attacker within range may be able to execute arbitrary code on the Wi-Fi chip.” It definitely sounds rather frightening, especially given that Apple rushed out the patch for it. iOS users should probably brace themselves for a transition period, as Apple pushes 32-bit support out the window. Apps, in particular, will soon carry a big fat warning about how it might not be compatible with future iOS versions. That transition process might already start with iOS 10.3.2, which has gone into beta last week.

While the device offers pretty much the same kinds of subscriptions services and content, it still hasn't been able to quite gain an upper hand against its competitors. Although it has previously tried to secure something unique like TV services, these deals, for the most part, have always stalled. It appears that Apple is now thinking a bit differently and may offer a premium service bundle that encompasses three popular channels. According to the folks at Recode, Apple wants to sell a premium bundle that will include HBO, Showtime, and Starz. Although the firm does offer each of these services separately, it reportedly wants to bundle them together as one big package. While this could be a lucrative offering from Apple, there isn't any information available with regards to pricing, which is perhaps the most critical success factor should the bundle make it to market. Naturally, we will have to wait and see whether Apple can close the deal with these major networks.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « News of Apple Ending their Contract with Imagination Technologies in 2018 Sends Shares Plunging | Main April 03, 2017 Apple Reveals Touch Bar with Touch ID in 6 Patent Filings that Includes a Touch Bar Keyboard for a Future iMac   Last Thursday the US Patent & Trademark Office published a series of six patent applications from Apple covering their new Touch Bar for the MacBook. The patents also describe a Touch Bar destined for the iMac keyboard which likely means an accessory as well. The patents are divided into two distinct camps. The first group covers Apple's 'Adaptive Input Row' which is marketed as the Touch Bar. The second group covers 'restricted-access buttons' marketed as Touch ID, built into the right end of the Touch Bar.   Adaptive Input Row: Touch Bar   Three patent applications numbered 20170090596, 20170090597 and 20170090654 were published last Thursday covering a "Keyboard with an Adaptive Input Row."   The Touch Bar changes automatically based on what you're doing to show you relevant tools you already know how to use — system controls like volume and brightness, interactive ways to adjust or browse through content, intelligent typing features like emoji and predictive text, and more. And for the first time, Touch ID is available on a Mac, enabling instant access to logins and fast, secure online purchases with Apple Pay.   Technically, Apple notes that their invention relates to an electronic device having a keyboard or similar user-input device that includes an adaptive input row. The adaptive input row may include a display used to present a set of indicia or visual cues that correspond to a set of adaptive commands or functions. The adaptive input row may be responsive to a user touch, allowing selection of one or more of the set of adaptive commands or functions. The adaptive input row may be positioned above the set of alpha-numeric keys in the place of a traditional function row on a keyboard. In some cases, the adaptive input row can be used to perform the same functionality as a traditional function row, as well as perform an expanded and diverse set of commands and functions as described herein.    Some example embodiments are directed to an adaptive input row having a display that is configured to produce an adaptable set of visual indicia that correspond to an input mode of the adaptive input row. The indicia on the display may correspond to one or more of the following: a hardware-dependent input mode used to control one or more devices or hardware elements; a software-dependent input mode used to control one or more aspects of a software program being executed on the device; a user-defined mode that is configurable by the user; and other input mode examples which are described herein. The display may be used to present a set of static indicia, one or more animated indicia, or a combination of static and animated indicia.    The display may be integrated with one or more touch sensors and/or force sensors that are configured to detect various combinations of user touch and force input on the surface of the adaptive input row. The touch and/or force sensors may provide a touch-sensitive surface that is configured to detect the location of a touch, a magnitude of a touch, and/or a movement of the touch along the adaptive input row. The touch and/or force sensors may be used in combination or together to interpret a broad range of user touch configurations, including touch gestures, multi-touch input, and variable force input.    Some example embodiments are directed to an input row stack that includes a display positioned below a cover. The input row stack may also include one or both of a touch sensor and a force sensor. The touch and/or force sensor may be used to determine the position of a touch along the length of the row. In some implementations, the input row includes a touch-sensitive region that extends beyond a display region. The extended region may be used to perform dedicated functions or operations.   As noted in the patent figures below, the patents cover general Touch Bar interfaces which highlight that physical F-Keys are now replaced by an multitouch OLED display. One interface noted below as FIG. 2J shows that the Touch Bar could detect a contoured or curved gesture. No explanation is given as to what that gesture will apply to in the future.   Apple's patent FIG. 3 noted above depicts a simplified exploded view of the Touch Bar referred to in the patent as an "adaptive input row" #300 having both a touch sensor layer #306 and a force sensor layer #308 positioned under a cover #302. As shown in the simplified embodiment of FIG. 3, the touch layer may be positioned between a display #304 and the cover #302. The force layer may be positioned on a side of the display opposite to the touch layer.   In some embodiments, the force nodes #318 are formed from a strain-sensitive material, such as a piezoresistive, piezoelectric, or similar material having an electrical property that changes in response to stress, strain, and/or deflection.   Example strain-sensitive materials include carbon nanotube materials, graphene-based materials, piezoresistive semiconductors, piezoresistive metals, metal nanowire material, and the like. Each force node 318 may be formed from an individual block of strain-sensitive material that is electrically coupled to sensing circuitry.   The sensing nodes #316 may be formed by depositing or otherwise fixing a transparent conductive material to a substrate material. Potential substrate materials include, for example, glass or transparent polymers like polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or cyclo-olefin polymer (COP). Example transparent conductive materials include polyethyleneioxythiophene (PEDOT), indium tin oxide (ITO), carbon nanotubes, graphene, piezoresistive semiconductor materials, piezoresistive metal materials, silver nanowire, other metallic nanowires, and the like.   In some embodiments, the force nodes 318 are formed from a capacitive force-sensitive structure that includes at least two capacitive plates separated by a compliant or compressible layer. The force of a touch may cause the partial compression or deflection of the compressible layer and may cause the two capacitive plates to move closer together, which may be measured as a change in capacitance using sensing circuitry operatively coupled to each of the force nodes 318. The change in capacitance, which corresponds to an amount of compression or deflection of the compressible layer, may be correlated to an estimated (applied) force.   Apple's patent application was filed back in QX 201X3. For more details about this invention, click here. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Restricted-Access Button: Touch ID for Touch Bar   The second series of Touch Bar patents cover Touch ID integrated into the bar. Apple notes that the invention "generally relates to buttons that incorporate biometric sensors. A biometric sensor associated with such a button can be used by the electronic device to restrict access to features or functionality of the electronic device associated with that button. Such buttons are generally referred to herein as "restricted-access buttons."   Apple notes that "The electronic device (MacBook) can integrate a primary display into the top portion of the housing, a keyboard into the bottom portion of the housing, a secondary display into the bottom portion of the housing between the keyboard and the hinge, and a restricted-access button abutting an end of the secondary display within the bottom portion of the housing. The restricted-access button can include a biometric sensor, such as a fingerprint sensor.   In these embodiments, the electronic device can obtain an image of a fingerprint each time the restricted-access button is pressed by a user. Thereafter, the electronic device can determine whether the obtained fingerprint image matches that of a previously authorized user, and if so, the electronic device can perform an action.   Apple makes an interesting point about touch ID not having to be restricted to the Touch Bar. According to Apple, "a shutter button of a camera device can be a restricted-access button.   In some examples, the shutter button may be a multimodal button associated with both restricted functions and unrestricted functions. For example, an image capture function may be a restricted function whereas an autofocus function may be an unrestricted function. The camera may change the restriction status of a particular function from time to time. Herein, the phrase "restriction status" refers generally to whether a particular function of a restricted-access button is a restricted function or an unrestricted function.   In many embodiments, a restricted-access button is configured to integrate with other input components of an electronic device. For example, a restricted-access button may be incorporated as a key or keys of a keyboard.   Apple's Touch Bar patents relating to the Touch ID or "restricted-access buttons" were found under the following patent numbers: 20170090593, 20170091515 and 20170091436. All patents were filed in September 2016. The '593 patent could be reviewed here.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Now one of the changes that Apple made to iOS 10 with the update is patch a couple of security flaws, but it seems that they might have missed one, or it did not get patched in time for the release. If you’ve received a notification on your phone that asks you to update to iOS 10.3.1, you probably should because this particular update apparently patches a WiFi flaw on iOS devices. While Apple does not specify what the patch did, the changelog reads, “includes bug fixes and improves the security of your iPhone or iPad”. However it was only after digging through the security document that it was revealed that the update patches a WiFi security flaw that was discovered by one of Google’s Project Zero engineers. For those curious about the flaw, basically it allows hackers to execute arbitrary code on the WiFi chip. Whether or not this flaw has been exploited already is unclear, but judging from the seemingly lack of reports we’re guessing no. However given that it has now been sort of revealed, you might want to patch it lest there are hackers out there who are counting on users who have yet to update their devices.

Roston - Apr 3, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Apple has ordered 70 million OLED panels from Samsung, according to a new report, indicating big expectations on Apple’s part for the upcoming iPhone 8. This isn’t the first time we’ve heard sources claim Apple is nabbing loads of OLED panels from Samsung, but it is the latest, and it comes with a bit more information. The iPhone 8 is claimed to be the first Apple smartphone with a curved display, something competitor Samsung has already embraced with multiple Galaxy handsets. Back in February, a report surfaced from a Korean publication claiming Apple had ordered 60 million OLED panels from Samsung. The information comes from Japanese publication Nikkei this time around, citing ‘a supply chain source’ with the claim that Apple has ordered 70 million displays for use with a device set to launch this year…that is, with the iPhone 8. There are three rumored iPhone 8 models, of which the most premium handset will allegedly feature a curved 5.2-inch display. The other two rumored handsets will supposedly feature 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch LCDs without curves. A source goes on to state that all three will have wireless charging, but that there’s currently an overheating problem that needs to be overcome. The source also states that all three of the iPhone 8 models will be waterproof, and that one or more will sport a 3D sensor with facial recognition technology. Such a feature would be on par with Samsung’s new Galaxy S8, only hopefully better — Samsung’s new facial recognition feature can be easily beat using an ordinary selfie.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Liberty Utilities requests water rate increase and decrease Monday Apr 3, 2017 at 5:15 PM Apr 3, 2017 at 5:46 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — After Liberty Utilities recently announced a rate increase and lengthy rate freeze, the water company has filed to increase rates once again. But company officials said the proposed rate increase, along with a proposed decrease, will actually result in customers paying less on their utility bill. Liberty raised rates for Apple Valley customers by 4.88 percent about three months ago and also announced a 2-year rate freeze. But the water company filed a request with the California Public Utilities Commission last week to impose a 1 percent surcharge. “We’re perplexed by Liberty’s decision to ask for almost a quarter million in additional revenue just six months after publicly announcing a rate freeze,” said Apple Valley Mayor Scott Nassif in news release. “In January, Liberty’s Vice President and General Manager promised transparency and accountability. Springing this increase on residents without any advance written notice certainly doesn’t seem to fit with that theme.” Liberty Utilities officials announced the rate freeze was an opportunity to “better engage customers.” The freeze locked in base rates at 2017 levels for more than two years, the Daily Press reported in January. In a Liberty Utilities “advice letter filing” to the CPUC dated Friday, the water company requests authorization to implement a “temporary surcharge” to water rates in Liberty’s “Apple Valley Service Area.” According to the advice letter, the .065 increase is for domestic metered customers for a 12-month period. “The surcharge is designed to recover the combined under-collection recorded in the 2016 Water Revenue.” Liberty officials told the Daily Press on Monday that water rates will actually decrease from 16.9 cents to 6.5 cents per one CCF (748 gallons) on May 1 after the company submitted the required Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism and Modified Cost Balancing Account annual filings to the CPUC on Friday. “The typical Liberty Apple Valley residential customer uses 11.655 CCF (8,716 gallons) of water each month and will see a net decrease of approximately $2.42 on their bi-monthly water bill,” the Liberty release said. Based on Liberty’s advice letter, $245,482 will be added to the company's revenue if the request is approved by the CPUC. “Liberty Apple Valley has stabilized customer water bills,” said Tony Penna, Liberty’s vice president and general manager. “Approximately 90 percent of our customers pay less than $120 every two months ($60 per month) for their water service. In many cases, people are paying less for water today than they were four years ago. We are proud to serve and be a trusted community partner in Apple Valley.” The Town of Apple Valley is considering whether to protest the advice letter and proposed rate increase, according to its news release. According to Liberty officials, the town does have the "opportunity to protest" the water company's "rate decrease." The public has 20 days to file responses and protests with the CPUC. Protest letters must include the utility company’s name and “advice” letter in subject line. Letters can be emailed to water_division@cpuc.ca.gov or mailed to Tariff Unit, Water Division, 3rd Floor, California Public Utilities Commission, 505 Van Ness Ave., San Francisco, CA 94102.

Problem Solving | 03 Apr 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (1) PDF Problems Continue in 10.12.4, but Primarily Affect Developers by Adam C. Engst Numerous readers have asked me if last week’s macOS 10.12.4 update resolved more of the PDF problems we outlined in “Sierra PDF Problems Get Worse in 10.12.2” (2 January 2017). The previous 10.12.3 update addressed the most serious bug, which caused a PDF edited in Preview to lose its OCR text layer (see “Apple Releases macOS Sierra 10.12.3, iOS 10.2.1, tvOS 10.1.1, and watchOS 3.1.1,” 23 January 2017). Last week, I polled the developers who had commented on the topic for my first article. The consensus was that Apple’s rewritten-for-Sierra PDFKit framework continues to improve, while simultaneously introducing new bugs. Christian Grunenberg of DEVONtechnologies said, “Since January I have added several new workarounds and improved old workarounds. The 10.12.4 release makes only one workaround obsolete and introduces a new bug.” He followed that up a few days later by saying, “In the last 24 hours I received various bug reports related to 10.12.4. In one case a PDF document freezes both DEVONthink and Preview; in another case pages are rendered white (in DEVONthink but also sometimes in Preview and both DEVONthink’s and Preview’s sidebar aren’t rendered at all); and in the last case PDF documents are rendered fuzzy.” Michael Tsai of C-Command Software initially outlined four bugs that Apple fixed in 10.12.4 and four that remain open, and a day later said that one of his customers had reported another crash that’s new in 10.12.4. The story for users is somewhat better because developers are either working around the bugs they find or quietly removing functionality until PDFKit works correctly. Michael Tsai also said that there’s a middle ground of display and scrolling glitches that can’t be worked around or avoided. Nonetheless, users continue to have problems, particularly with large or encrypted PDFs in Preview and other apps that rely on PDFKit for their PDF-related functionality. Nothing seems to be as severe as the OCR text layer deletion bug that 10.12.3 fixed, but if you experience trouble with Preview, try a different app. For merely viewing a PDF, use the free Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. If you need to manipulate a PDF, turn to Smile’s $74.95 PDFpen, which doesn’t use PDFKit and is thus immune from these issues. Similarly unaffected is Adobe Acrobat DC, which requires a subscription that costs either $24.99 per month if billed monthly or $14.99 per month billed annually (that’s $179.88 per year). Acrobat DC is also included in the full $49.99 per month Creative Cloud subscription. To answer those who have asked if they can now upgrade to Sierra, I’d have to say that if you rely heavily on apps built on top of PDFKit for viewing and manipulating non-trivial PDFs, it’s probably worth continuing to hold off. If you mostly just read PDFs in Preview, you likely won’t hit any stumbling blocks unless you work with large or encrypted PDFs. Check out the Take Control ebooks that expand on the topic in this article: Take Control of PDFpen 8 Polish your PDFs with Smile's PDFpen, for a fraction of what Adobe Acrobat costs! Michael E. Cohen explains how you can create, combine, edit, annotate, and protect PDFs. Also learn how to perform and edit OCR, fill out forms, sign forms digitally, make interactive forms, and much more. Covers Mac and iOS versions! Take Control of Preview Apple’s Preview app is bundled with every Mac and yet many Mac users have only a shallow understanding of what it’s capable of. Mac experts Adam Engst and Josh Centers have plumbed Preview’s depths to create a cheerful, colorful book that explains dozens of techniques for importing, viewing, editing, and converting images in Preview. It also puts you in control of reading, annotating, manipulating, and encrypting PDFs.   READERS LIKE YOU! Support TidBITS by becoming a member today!

Several reports going back to 2009 have claimed Apple is getting ready to launch a subscription-based streaming TV service that would offer around 25 channels, DVR, and live-programming. It'd cost between $30 to $40 per month and be available on iPad, iPhone, and Apple TV. However, according to a new report from Recode, Apple has resorted to considering a premium TV bundle that consists of three channels. The bundle will combine HBO, Showtime, and Starz - three channels that cord cutters can already access individually for $15, $11, and $9 a month, respectively. But Apple wants to roll them into a single package that it would market as a standalone product for Apple TV and iOS devices. A deal is not yet in place, and it's currently not known if Apple is trying to offer the bundle with a price discount. Best Apple TV apps to try right now In other words, there's no word if the bundle would cost the $35 per month it already costs to subscribe to each network individually. We can't imagine the networks agreeing to that, considering other networks aren't willing to make concessions and have stalled on past negotiations (to the point where Apple has suggested it's no longer trying to offer a channel service over the internet). Also, networks like Dish and even Sony's PlayStation have already delved into the web TV space, so Apple is facing obstacles on all sides.  Sections Apple TV Source: Recode Philips 4K HDR TV choices for 2017: 9002 OLED, 7502, 6482 and 6412 compared Panasonic 4K HDR choices for 2017: EZ1002, EZ952, EX750, EX700, EX600 compared Samsung 4K HDR TV choices for 2017: QLED Q9F, Q8C, Q7C and Q7F compared Sony 4K HDR TV choices for 2017: A1 OLED, ZD9, XE94, XE93, XE90, XE85, XE80...

The iPhone maker informed Imagination Technologies it will cease using its graphics technology for new products, including phones, tablets, and watches, in 15 months to two years. “This is what we would describe as a black swan moment for the company and investors in Imagination,” said Neil Campling, head of technology research at Northern Trust Securities, in a research note. “We view Imagination as now uninvestable.” The move means Imagination Technologies risks losing future royalty payments from Apple, which considered acquiring the UK supplier as recently as last year. However, Imagination Technologies said it believes Apple will struggle to avoid infringing its intellectual property rights. “Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information,” said Imagination. The companies are in talks over license and royalty agreements. Apple amounts to just over half of Imagination Technologies’ annual revenue. The British company received £60.7m in license fees and royalties from Apple in the year to the end of April last year, and expected to get £65m in such payments in the fiscal year ending this month. The UK company’s revenue for last fiscal year was £120m. “If the group is unsuccessful in challenging Apple’s position, we would expect the group to need to make significant operational changes to align the cost base to the new revenue profile,” said Oliver Knott, an analyst at N+1 Singer. In early 2014, Imagination Technologies said it had extended its multi-use license agreement with Apple for its range of current and future graphics and video chips. In March last year, Apple said it had held “some discussions” to acquire Imagination Technologies but did not have plans to make an offer at that time.

Have we underplayed the importance of mobile apps on our phones? Software has changed the way we interact with our governments, our society, our workplace. This software is often best expressed as apps on our devices. By: Nandagopal Rajan | Published: April 4, 2017 5:38 AM Software has changed the way we interact with our governments, our society, our workplace. This software is often best expressed as apps on our devices. They haven’t really gotten their due, and we often tend to forget that the success of smartphones and their effectiveness as personal computing devices is because developers across the world have made apps that improve our productivity, add colour to our lives and make a lot of things much easier. But there is a larger social and economic impact of these apps that we tend to forget. Think of our lives before some of these apps: The bunch of restaurant flyers that Zomato has replaced, the regular haggling with the local taxi guy which Uber and Ola have ended, and the expensive international roaming calls which voice calls on WhatsApp and Hangouts have replaced. Yes, they have had a drastic impact on our lives and have played a really important role in offering new employment avenues to millions of people. Last week, I had the opportunity to chat about apps and how they are changing our lives with Philip Schiller, the senior vice-president of Worldwide Marketing at Apple, the one company that triggered the app revolution. In Bengaluru to kick off Apple’s first App Accelerator project to help Indian developers, Schiller opened up when I asked if apps can even change nations and economies. “One of the huge possibilities is building through technology for people from diverse backgrounds to get opportunities that might not have existed in old industries. Men and women, people from different ethnic and economic backgrounds … there is a great levelling through apps and technology where none of that matters, what matters is how good is your idea, how good is the opportunity you want to create, and that increases diversity and creativity of people from different perspectives,” he said, adding that the whole world wins when that happens, and the society can often change through that process. Schiller, who oversees Apple’s apps store, among other things, said this change in society was something Apple tries to do with our developer communities “which reach people from all over the world with different perspectives. And they get to influence all of us. I think that is a big way that society changes.” “Every company, every business, every educational institution has something to improve through software and applications,” he told me, adding how there are two magical things that are happening because smartphone technology and applications have become so pervasive in our lives. “One, there is a technology adoption by consumers at a scale seen never before—these are almost supercomputers in our pockets; and at the same time, you have software that can transform everyday businesses and services that we all rely on in new ways.” Schiller reminded how software has changed the way we interact with our governments, our places of work and places of education. And if we pause for a second, this software is often best expressed as apps on our devices. “If you look at it at that scale, we have just begun,” he says, highlighting that the number of apps that are being created, the number of downloads and the amount of revenue being generated in this sector are all measures of the same. Schiller also explained how environments where technology adoption has been weak right now have the opportunity to leapfrog many developed environments to adopt latest technologies, which might take longer for developed markets to accept. “For example, you can see in environments where the number of personal computers per household is very low, the move to smartphone as your primary device can happen quicker. You can see that environments where broadband access is low can leapfrog to cellular networks.” You might also want to see this: Schiller is convinced that the smartphone won’t become secondary to artificial intelligence and voice-based interactions that run on it. He explained that even as voice interaction becomes more prevalent and artificial intelligence becomes better, the value of the screen will remain very strong in our lives. “I can ask Siri for directions, but seeing the map on the screen helps me understand where I am going,” he explained, adding how photography and the written word, as well as the largest app category of gaming, still need the screen.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Sponsor Book → RSS → Apple Pulling Out of Imagination Technologies Relationship » April 3, 2017 ⌘ Permalink Sam Byford at The Verge: Imagination Technologies, the British chip designer that provides PowerVR graphics processors for use in the iPhone and iPad, has said that Apple will no longer be licensing its technology in less than two years’ time. In a statement, Imagination says that Apple has notified the company that it’s “working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination’s technology.” Here’s a bit from that statement: Apple has used Imagination’s technology and intellectual property for many years. It has formed the basis of Graphics Processor Units (“GPUs”) in Apple’s phones, tablets, iPods, TVs and watches. Apple has asserted that it has been working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination’s technology. Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it. That’s some pretty strong language from Imagination Technologies, but I can understand why. According to Byford, its Apple contract makes up about half of the company’s revenue. I have little doubt that Apple is working toward building its own GPUs for iOS devices. Like the A series of CPUs, Apple would be able to fine-tune its own silicon for its own needs and see drastic results.

Published by : CT WEB 2017-04-03 20:34:34 Shares in UK chip designer Imagination Technologies have slumped nearly 70% after it said Apple, its largest customer, would stop using its graphics technology in the iPhone and other new products. This is a major blow to the British company, which relies on Apple for half its revenues. It warned that the US tech firm risked infringing its intellectual property rights. Apple has used Imagination's chip technology under a licensing agreement for many years and is one of its biggest shareholders, with an 8.2% stake. It came close to buying the Hertfordshire-based firm a year ago. Imagination's technology has formed the basis of graphics processor units (GPU) in iPhones, iPads, iPods, TVs and watches. But Apple has been working on a separate, independent graphics design to control its products and has served notice that it will stop using Imagination's technology within 15 months to two years. Imagination has begun talks with Apple as it gears up for a battle over its intellectual property rights. It said they were discussing potential alternative commercial arrangements for the current licence and royalty agreement. The chipmaker said: "Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination's technology, without violating Imagination's patents, intellectual property and confidential information. "Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple's assertions." Imagination received £60.7m in licence fees and royalties from Apple last year, which is expected to rise to £65m in the year to 30 April. The struggling chipmaker has been cutting staff and restructuring its business after a series of profit warnings. Just over half Imagination's 1,200 workforce are based in the UK, with the rest working in Europe, US, China and India. Its head office and main R&D centre are in Kings Langley near London. Analysts at N+1 Singer cut their recommendation on the shares to a "sell", saying: "If the group is unsuccessful in challenging Apple's position, we would expect the group to need to make significant operational changes to align the cost base to the new revenue profile. Given the uncertainty around its largest revenue stream, and current net debt position, we move to sell." The shares plummeted nearly 70% to 85.5p in early trading on Monday.

ALEX BRUMMER on Apple's disdain for good corporate citizenship and it's search for ever greater profits  By Alex Brummer for the Daily Mail Published: 19:26 EDT, 3 April 2017 | Updated: 20:19 EDT, 3 April 2017 e-mail 24 shares 106 View comments There could be no better illustration of the ruthless, unforgiving power of Tim Cook and the digital giant Apple than its decision to pull the rug out from under one of Britain’s chip designing champions, Imagination Technologies. Apple decided without any prior warning to sever its long-term supply contract with Imagination, sending its shares plummeting almost 62 per cent on the stock market. Hertfordshire-based Imagination was a pioneer of the chips which deliver the graphics found in most Apple devices from the iPhone to its TVs and watches. Yesterday its bosses stood helplessly by as the value of a company which was worth £2billion at its peak in 2012 fell to just £250million. Imagination Technologies, pictured, pioneered the chips which deliver the graphics on many Apple devices, but bosses were unable to stop the share price collapse yesterday  Apple holds 8.2 per cent of Imagination's shares and is one of the company's biggest investors What may surprise many is that Apple is one of the biggest investors in Imagination, holding 8.2 per cent of its shares. Indeed, it has long been thought that Apple would do nothing to jeopardise the future of a loyal supplier. Instead, its unprovoked decision to abandon a supplier demonstrates its disdain for good corporation citizenship. It has shown a willingness to sweep everyone else aside in its aggrandisement and search for ever higher profits. Most outrageously it once refused to allow the FBI ‘backdoor’ access to an Apple iPhone used by the gunman allegedly responsible for 14 deaths in the San Bernardino terrorist attack in 2015.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Shares in UK technology firm fall by £500m after Apple axes... The iPhone 8 is coming! Apple orders 70 million OLED screens... Share this article Share The FBI had to call in cyber-security experts from Israel to access information on the iPhone that was critical to the probe. If ever there was a company which believes that rules, regulations and standards of behaviour are for everyone else but not itself, it is Apple. The ditching of Imagination is part of a broader Apple commercial goal of directly controlling as much of production as possible as well as the customer experience. Apple wants its millions of global customers to use iTunes to access music, movies, TV shows, audio books and other entertainment. It takes a cut from every transaction and money which should go to the writers, performers and broadcasters cascades into the Apple coffers. What is really disgusting about the assault on Imagination is its plundering of its patents and intellectual property. Samsung has been challenging Apple for years over alleged infringements of its design and technology. It is Apple’s intention to develop its own independent graphics for products so that in the next 15 to 24 months it can do without Imagination’s innovation and expertise. It presumably knows that if the patent war comes to the courts, a minnow such as the British company lacks the firepower to do lasting damage. The lesson of this episode is that Apple is not to be trusted as a shareholder or a customer for vital components. It is a great pity that consumers continue to worship at the Apple image without thought to the company’s contempt for the norms of corporate and social responsibility.   Share or comment on this article e-mail 24 shares Most watched News videos Horrific moment bullfighter is gored by 1,000lb bull in Madrid Dogs surround shoppers in Bolton before owner leads them away The Hangover actor Mike Epps brings distressed kangaroo on stage Shoppers defend themselves with chairs against pack of dogs Shocking moment dangerous dogs are shot by police in Bolton 'It got Grandma!': Chimp throws poo into grandmother's face at zoo Couple paraded through streets after they become stuck during sex GRAPHIC: Video shows St Petersburg train moments after bomb attack Explosion on the metro in St Petersburg rips through carriage Smokey aftermath after explosion rips through St Petersburg metro Is this Banksy?: Woman claims to have caught the artist at work Las Vegas store clerk shoots 13-year-old would-be robber dead Horrific moment young bullfighter is gored through the...

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 3, 2017 at 3:24PM If you've been paying attention to Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) increased in-sourcing and vertical integration of core technologies over the past few years, it shouldn't come as a surprise that the Mac maker has decided to drop U.K.-based Imagination Technologies. The British company has been Apple's longtime supplier for graphics technology, which Apple licenses and designs into its A-series of processors. For example, the most recent A10 Fusion chip that powers the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus uses a custom version of Imagination's PowerVR GT7600 graphics architecture. Imagination has just made a devastating announcement that Apple is planning on dropping it within a couple of years. A10 Fusion chip, which currently uses Imagination's graphics architecture. Image source: Apple. Imagination's better half Apple has notified Imagination that it will cease using Imagination's intellectual property within 15 to 24 months, at which point the license and royalty revenue stream will dry up. Apple is Imagination's largest customer -- by far -- comprising half of consolidated revenue. License fees and royalties from Apple totaled 60.7 million pounds ($75.7 million) in its fiscal year ended April 2016, a hair over half of the 120 million pounds ($149.7 million) in total revenue. For Imagination's fiscal year that ends later this month, it estimates that revenue from Apple will total approximately 65 million pounds ($81.1 million). Ouch. Getting dropped by Apple has quite literally been Imagination's biggest risk factor for years, and it just happened. It's no surprise, then, that shares are down over 60% today. Apple and Imagination reportedly discussed Apple acquiring the smaller company last year, but Apple decided not to move forward; Apple currently has an 8% stake in Imagination. Can Apple really get away? Imagination doesn't quite believe that Apple can avoid using Imagination's intellectual property (IP), though. The company asked for some evidence that Apple will be able to proceed with its own designs without infringing on Imagination's IP, but Apple has opted not to provide it. Imagination says it would be "extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing [Imagination's] intellectual property rights." Of course, if Apple is subsequently found to be infringing, a legal battle will ensue. Apple has been working on its own graphics technology for quite some time, and has even been hiring graphics chip engineers in the U.K., further underscoring why today's news should not be all that shocking. Don't be surprised if some of Imagination's engineers go ahead and jump ship to Apple; Apple's corporate office where those positions are located is less than an hour's drive from Imagination's headquarters in northwest London. Let the poaching begin. Foreshadowing In addition, consider CFO Luca Maestri's recent explanation for why Apple's R&D spending has risen precipitously in recent years. One important contributing factor has been a strategic focus on bringing more development in-house: The third reason, I think, is a very strategic one and a very important one that allows us to keep our differentiation from the rest of the industry, and it's the fact that today, we do much more in-house development of some fundamental technologies than we used to do a few years ago, when we were leaving more of that to the supplier base. Think of the work that we do around processors or sensors, right? Much more work than we're doing today in-house than we used to. It's very important for us because we can push the envelope on innovation. We have better control over timing, over cost, over quality. And so we look at that as a great strategic investment for us, right? Graphics technology absolutely qualifies as a "fundamental" technology, particularly if you think about how important graphics performance will be for the future of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), which Apple is already actively exploring as we speak. Investors can soon add graphics technology to the long and growing list of crucial ingredients that Apple now develops in-house. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

If you subscribe to cable, you may have the option to buy premium channels like HBO, Showtime, and Starz as a bundle, instead of having to pay for them separately. Some cable providers offer this option, but here's the catch: It's only available if you also have a traditional cable package. Apple, however, reportedly wants to change this and bring premium channel bundles into the digital age. Recode, citing unnamed industry sources, reports that Apple "has approached the three networks about rolling them up into a single package." Apple already offers HBO Now, Showtime, and Starz individually as in-app purchases, but this new bundle would let you buy them together. Apple currently sells HBO, Showtime, and Starz for $15, $11, and $9 a month, respectively, so a bundle would likely be less than $35/month and available on your iOS devices and via Apple TV. Apple would need to strike deals with content providers to make this a reality. Showtime is already available as an add-on for Hulu at a $2/month discount; Showtime and Starz are also available via Amazon Channels for $9/month each. Related Apple's TV Plans Are Still Alive, But Not How You Think Apple's TV Plans Are Still Alive, But Not How You Think Apple, meanwhile, is already putting the finishing touches on two original shows set to debut soon: Planet of the Apps and Carpool Karaoke: The Series. Hosted by Zane Lowe, Planet of the Apps "celebrates the world of apps and the talented people who create them," Apple's description reads. The show features Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow, Gary Vaynerchuk, and will.i.am, who serve as advisors to developers. Carpool Karaoke is based on the beloved segment from The Late Late Show with James Corden. The show will feature celebrities like ames Corden, Will Smith, Billy Eichner, Metallica, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Ariana Grande, Seth MacFarlane, Chelsea Handler, Blake Shelton, Michael Strahan, John Cena, Shaquille O'Neal, and more. Apple in February released trailers for both shows, and said they would arrive "soon" on Apple Music. Back to top Previous : $14M Initiative to Fight Fake News Includes Facebook, Mozill...

According to Nikkei, Apple has ordered 70 million curved OLED display panels from Samsung, which will be the only supplier for this part this year. They will be used inside the new iPhone 8 which will be unveiled in the fall alongside the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. Unlike the iPhone 8, the 7s models will retain the LCD panels of their predecessors, as well as their sizes - 4.7" and 5.5", respectively. On the other hand, the iPhone 8 is said to employ a 5.2-inch OLED screen, and this model could end up costing north of $1,000. Some analysts are predicting that Apple will sell 55 million iPhone 8 units this year alone. Its success should lead to a record year for Apple. Samsung is reportedly preparing to churn out as many as 95 million panels for Apple in case the demand for the iPhone 8 will exceed expectations. One "industry source familiar with iPhone design" says all three 2017 models will feature wireless charging, as well as water and dust resistance. The iPhone 8 is to come with a "3D sensor" that will allow for advanced facial recognition, and this device will also ditch the physical Home button as rumored countless times before. The 7s models will keep the button, but they might sport the 3D sensor for facial recognition too.

Use a VPN Jailbreak Guide: Can I jailbreak?   skip to main content skip to main menu     Get the Hermès and Nike+ watch faces on your Apple Watch with this tweak By Anthony Bouchard, Apr 3, 2017 Tweet 8 Comments Apple limits some of their watch face designs to certain Apple Watch models. For example, the Hermès and Nike editions of Apple Watches offer their own unique faces that can’t be accessed on any other Apple Watch. Or at least, not without an iPhone jailbreak… iOS developer AppleBetas has been trying to port these faces to other models of the Apple Watch for quite some time, and he appears to be demonstrating success in his endeavors. As a result, the jailbreak tweak dubbed SpecialFaces is now in beta. If you’re wondering how to get the Hermès and Nike+ faces on your Apple Watch, this is how. How it works Once installed, the tweak modifies the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, making the Hermès and Nike+ faces available for use on any model Apple Watch you might have, whether it’s the standard stainless steel model, the aluminum Sport model, or the ceramic/gold Edition model, etc… You can select the face you want to use, whether you opt for the Hermès or Nike+ option, or a stock option. They’re enabled in the same way you would enable any other watch face – by dragging them into the order you want. Once applied, it gets pushed to your Apple Watch and takes effect immediately. The caveats Limited support While the unsupported watch faces are fully operational, the Hermès and Nike faces aren’t quite complete just yet. As you can see from some of the examples below, the numerals at the edges of the screen that help you to tell the time are missing from the Nike watch face (boxes are displayed in their place on the Hermès face), and some other minor imperfections are noticeable as well: The developer cites that he’s looking into what could be causing this glitch and is keeping his fingers crossed for a fix, although he can’t guarantee that this will ever be fixed since the Apple Watch itself isn’t jailbroken and can’t be modified. Regardless, the watch hands still move and most people know what a clock looks like, so it doesn’t really hinder telling time. Still, this may or may not turn you off from trying this tweak out for yourself. One could still theoretically tell the time even with the numerals missing just by judging the clock hands, so it’s more of an aesthetic nuisance than a time-telling issue. Redundancy Apple’s watchOS is designed with checks and balances to make sure the software is working right, so you might have to reapply the Hermès or Nike+ watch faces that you enable on your unsupported Apple Watch in this way from time to time. This can happen when you enter editing mode on the watch itself, or when you reboot the Apple Watch. What happens is the unsupported faces “disappear” from the Apple Watch without any warning and the fix is to re-launch the Apple Watch app on your iPhone and simply set your unsupported watch faces back up again. You won’t have to uninstall and reinstall the tweak though, which is good. This step to fix the problem will feel redundant, and honestly it might even feel cumbersome, but how often do you really edit your watch faces or reboot your Apple Watch anyway? Nevertheless, if you want the unsupported watch faces that badly, you’ll find a way to co-exist with the extra hassle. Compatibility One final ting to take note of is that this hack only works on Apple Watches with watchOS 3.0-3.1.1 installed on them at this point in time. This is because you need an iPhone jailbroken on iOS 10.0-10.2 with Yalu to use it. The watchOS 3.0 release was made for iOS 10, the watchOS 3.1 release was made for iOS 10.1, and the watchOS 3.1.1 release was made for iOS 10.2. So these firmware versions are all supported. Unfortunately if you have an Apple Watch running watchOS 3.2, then there’s no way for you to use this tweak with your jailbroken iPhone because this particular watchOS firmware requires iOS 10.3, which has not yet been jailbroken. If you try to pair your watchOS 3.2 device with your jailbroken iOS 10.2 or earlier iPhone, you will get an error like this one: How to get the Hermès and Nike+ watch faces If you’re still excited to try this mod out, then you can follow the steps below to get SpecialFaces: 1) Launch the Cydia app from your Home screen and go to the Sources tab. 2) Tap on the Edit button. 3) Tap on the Add button. 4) In the text field of the pop-up that appears, type in the following repository URL: repo.applebetas.co 5) Tap on the Add Source button and wait for the repository to load into Cydia. 6) Now you can search for and install SpecialFaces from Cydia for free. After installing and respringing, you can open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone and try playing with your Apple Watch faces. Conclusion While the hack certainly isn’t perfect, it’s a step in the right direction. It’s especially surprising that it’s possible to do something like this without jailbreaking the Apple Watch itself. There are a number of caveats to overcome to make the tweak work, but it’s an awesome proof of concept that you can use to show off to your friends or use to get the watch face you want without paying premium prices for the higher-end Apple Watch models.

Apple orders 70 million OLED screens from Samsung for radical new design  New iPhone 8 rumor said Apple ordered 70 million OLED panels from Samsung Massive order was to meet the demand Apple expects when the phone launches Source also revealed only the premium handset will have a curved OLED screen Also shared that all three phones will wireless charge and be waterproof   By Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.com Published: 18:40 EDT, 3 April 2017 | Updated: 18:40 EDT, 3 April 2017 e-mail 63 shares 95 View comments Although when it comes to selling handsets Apple and Samsung are arch rivals, when is comes to supplying screens, it's a different matter. The latest rumor regarding the iPhone 8 has revealed that the Cupertino company ordered 70 million OLED panels from the South Korean firm. The massive request is said to fulfill Apple's expectations that its upcoming flagship smartphone will 'fly off the shelves' once it hits the market. Scroll down for video The latest rumor regarding the iPhone 8 (artist impression) has revealed that Apple has ordered 70 million OLED panels from Samsung. The massive request is said to fulfill Apple's expectations that its upcoming flagship smartphone will 'fly off the shelves' LATEST IPHONE 8 RUMORS Sources told Nikkei Asian Review that Apple has ordered 70 million OLED displays from Samsung.  It is said that Apple believes the iPhone 8 will 'fly off the shelves'. Apple is set to release three phones for the iPhone 8 family – and the premium could cost more than $1,000, as it is said to be fitted with a curved OLED 5.2 inch screen. The other two will measure 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches, and have a liquid crystal display.  Sources also said all three handsets will be designed with wireless charging functions – if suppliers can solve the overheating issues with the technology. And it is said that the trio will also be waterproof. The person also noted that one of the smartphones will have a 3D sensor that lets users access it through facial recognition technology. Only the handset over $1,000 will not have the feature, the person said. The leaked order details were shared by a supply chain source familiar with iPhone designs with Nikkei Asian Review, which said coincides with a previous prediction by David Hsieh, senior director at research company IHS Markit. 'Apple has ordered 70 million units of OLED panels from Samsung this year, while Samsung is preparing to churn out as many as 95 million for Apple in 2017, in case demand exceeds expectations,' Hsieh said. He also noted that Samsung would be the one to supply Apple with OLED displays. However, Samsung declined to comment to Nikkei Asian Review, stating it is unable to reveal customers' orders. The iPhone 7 fell short for some iOS users, as many saw it as nothing more than a refreshed iPhone 6, which may have put more pressure on Apple to step up its game for its 10th anniversary smartphone. Rumors have been floating around the web for months – and the most popular are that the iPhone8 will have an edge-to-edge OLED screen, the Touch ID will be placed either on the back or under the glass. Apple is set to release three phones for the iPhone 8 family – and the premium could cost more than $1,000, as it is said to be fitted with a curved OLED 5.2 inch screen.

Share this article Share 63 shares The other two smartphones are believed to measure 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches, both of which will have the liquid crystal displays. Sources also told Nikkei that all three handsets will be designed with wireless charging functions – if suppliers can solve the overheating issues with the technology. IPHONE 8 TOUCH ID  The latest leak reveals Apple's plans to put the Touch ID on the back of the iPhone 8.  The sleek, black handset appears to show the sensor positioned on the back, just below the Apple logo and about the third of the way down the phone. An image (pictured) surfaced last month that claimed to be 'a late stage iPhone 8 prototype' that was designed with the Touch ID on the back of the handset. And if Nikkei's sources are correct – it could be the premium iPhone 8 model If the report is true, then the new setup could be part of Apple's plan to add facial recognition technology to the device.  It is now believed that Apple will be going with a type of metal material for the back, as 'the glass back prototypes were too prone to shattering when dropped'. And it is said that the trio will also be waterproof. The person also noted that one of the smartphones will have a 3D sensor that lets users access it through facial recognition technology. But those not interested in flipping the bill for the premium model will have a home button – only the handset over $1,000 will not have the feature, the person said. A new image surfaced last month that claimed to be 'a late stage iPhone 8 prototype' that was designed with the Touch ID on the back of the handset. And if Nikkei's sources are correct – it could be the premium iPhone 8 model.  The image was obtained byiDropNews 'from a source with intimate knowledge of Apple's manufacturing facility'. Apple is set to release three phones for the iPhone 8 family (artist impression) – and the premium could cost more than $1,000, as it is said to be fitted with a curved OLED 5.2 inch screen.  The anonymous source from Foxconn noted that other leaks floating around the web do look similar to the final product, but with a few exceptions. Many leakers have stated that the Touch ID sensor would make its way under the display to make room for the larger edge-to-edge screen. But Apple is following in line with its Android rivals and relocating it to the rear of the phone, 9to5Mac reported. And although you will have to pick up the phone to access it – the new setup is believed to accommodate the addition of facial recognition technology. Another rumor that has been debunked by the mysterious source is the 'glass back'. It is believed that Apple will be going with a type of metal material for the back, as 'the glass back prototypes were too prone to shattering when dropped'. The person also noted that one of the smartphones will have a 3D sensor that lets users access it through facial recognition technology. But those not interested in flipping the bill for the premium model will have a home button – only the handset over $1,000 will not have the feature, the person said  Earlier this month it was revealed that users will be able to purchase the iPhone 8 (artist impression) in September, but an analyst note warned that Apple will not be able to meet the demand – leaving some users empty handed at launch  Earlier this month it was revealed that users will be able to purchase the iPhone 8 in September, but an analyst note warned that Apple will not be able to meet the demand – leaving some users empty handed at launch.  The majority of stock may not be available until later in the fourth quarter, according to the latest research from Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O'Malley, and Jerry Zhang.   Other leakers have also speculated a later release day - the source sites October for when the device will officially launch. However, it noted that it is because the iPhone (artist impression) is not going into mass production until September 'Suppliers generally had good things to say about the upcoming iPhone 8 launch (for our purposes iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone Pro) as new features drive a more complicated manufacturing process and higher ASPs,' the note says, according to MacRumours. 'We now believe that all three devices will feature wireless charging and will all be launched in the normal September timeframe, although the majority of iPhone Pro volumes may not be available until Q4.'  Previous speculations have also listed the smartphone as the 'iPhone 8', but the latest report has suggested it will be called 'iPhone Edition'.  LARGER BATTERY  Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has revealed that Apple plans to put a larger battery in the 4.7-inch iPhone 8.  Kuo explained that it will be designed with a 2,700 mAh battery - putting its battery capacity on par with the iPhone 7 Plus.  Another feature rumored to appear in Apple's next iPhone is a larger 'L' shaped battery (middle', which would put battery capacity on par with the iPhone 7 Plus Will use a 'substrate-like PCB mainboard', which will allow the firm to implement an OLED display in the flagship handset.  The new components are believed to be much more expensive in anything used in an iPhone before, which could increase manufacturing costs by 80 percent.  However, it was revealed last week that iOS users should expect to pay a hefty price tag for their next iPhone.   Read more: Here's Why Apple's 10th Anniversary iPhone Will Likely Cost More Than $1,000 | Fast Company | Business + Innovation ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿iPhone Edition¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ | Rumor | Mac ... iPhone addiction bites -- to Apple's benefit- Nikkei Asian Review Report: iPhone 8 to start mass production in September, featuring Apple-custom ¿built-in¿ fingerprint sensor | 9to5Mac Apple redesigns fingerprint ID solution for OLED iPhone, say sources Apple News on iPhone, iPad and Macbooks | Daily Mail Online Report: This year¿s flagship iPhone may be called the ¿iPhone Edition,¿ launch well after announcement | 9to5Mac 'iPhone 8' Still Expected to Launch in September in Limited Quantities - Mac Rumors Sketchy report suggests iPhone 8 will be named ¿iPhone Edition¿, Touch ID moved to rear, vertical dual cameras | 9to5Mac Exclusive 'iPhone Edition' Insider Information Leaked Exclusive: Apple has ordered 70m units of OLED panels: sources- Nikkei Asian Review Share or comment on this article e-mail 63 shares Most watched News videos Horrific moment bullfighter is gored by 1,000lb bull in Madrid Dogs surround shoppers in Bolton before owner leads them away The Hangover actor Mike Epps brings distressed kangaroo on stage Shoppers defend themselves with chairs against pack of dogs Shocking moment dangerous dogs are shot by police in Bolton 'It got Grandma!': Chimp throws poo into grandmother's face at zoo Couple paraded through streets after they become stuck during sex GRAPHIC: Video shows St Petersburg train moments after bomb attack Explosion on the metro in St Petersburg rips through carriage Smokey aftermath after explosion rips through St Petersburg metro Is this Banksy?: Woman claims to have caught the artist at work Las Vegas store clerk shoots 13-year-old would-be robber dead Horrific moment young bullfighter is gored through the...

As rival ANZ trials in-app voice recognition to eliminate branch visits for customers making high-value transfers, NAB has invested $6 million in its central Sydney flagship branch to school consumers in doing things themselves. The Apple Store-style layout - complete with a cafe, open-plan meeting areas, and hands-on tech bars at which staff coach customers in online banking - will be rolled out elsewhere if successful. "We know customers want to do a lot of every day things through digital means if they can just be shown how to do that," said Andrew Hagger, NAB's chief customer officer for consumer and wealth. "For some people, digital functionality is intuitive, for others it's good to have a guiding hand." Mr Hagger said the branch network remained a key asset for traditional banks. "I travel all around the country and what I find on every occasion is a customer walking into the branch and dealing face to face with someone there who really cares for them - the trust is there," Mr Hagger said. "The satisfaction of those experiences is very strong among our customer." Research by DBM Consultants shows NAB is consistently the most likely of the big banks to be recommended by customers. Its net promoter score (NPS) was the only one in positive territory in February - the most recent survey, which was conducted before the banks' recent round of out-of-cycle rate increases. "When we ask what customers see in their banks, NAB customers rate NAB far better on fees and rates than other customers rate their banks," DBM head of banking research Dhruba Gupta said. "Customers also have a high regard for NAB's customer service, its products and its reputation." NAB last month hiked its standard variable mortgage rate by 0.07 percentage points for owner-occupiers, and by 0.25 percentage points for investors. Many lenders also upped their interest-only rates ahead of Friday's move by the banking regulator to cap interest-only mortgage lending at 30 per cent of new residential mortgages. "We respect APRA's analysis and their ability to make determinations," Mr Hagger said. "It's for us to digest that and make that work." Reblog Share Tweet Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

The departure of Stringer comes almost exactly a year after Apple lost another veteran designer to GoPro. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Stringer is a member of Jony Ive’s industrial design team and has had a hand in designing a variety of Apple’s hardware products, including the iPhone. While Ive’s design team is usually draped in secrecy, we know a little bit more about Stringer because of his role in Apple’s never-ending legal battle with Samsung. Stringer played a major role in the case, testifying back in 2012. Long time Apple industrial designer Christopher Stringer is leaving the company in another shakeup to Apple’s vaunted design team. Apple’s design team has gone through multiple changes in the last two years as Jonathan Ive has stepped back from running the team. Richard Howarth now leads the team on a day-to-day basis. Other than the Samsung case, however, Stringer has kept a very low profile, like Ive’s entire team. He’s worked alongside Ive for 21 years, working on the iPhone, iPad, and various Macs throughout the years. It’s unclear as to what his plans are post-Apple. Last April, longtime designer Daniel Coster left Apple to join the team at GoPro as the company’s VP of design. Apple has long prided itself on the tight-knit design team led by Jony Ive, but over recent years some have questioned the inner workings of the team. In 2015, the man in charge of Apple’s design studio departed the company. At the same time, Jony Ive himself took a different role. Ive shifted to become Apple’s Chief Design Officer, handing off most of his managerial duties. Tim Cook, however, has defended the team and Jony Ive’s role: Jony, who I think has the best taste of anyone in the world and the best design skills, now has responsibility for the human interface. I mean, look at our products. So it’s saying, Jony has done a remarkable job leading our hardware design, so let’s also have Jony responsible for the software and the look and feel of the software.

The call will be held at the standard time of 2PM PT/5PM ET, with the earnings release itself being sent out roughly thirty minutes before then. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Apple announced the date on its Investor News Webpage. Apple’s Q2 earnings will follow a strong holiday quarter for the company that saw profits of $17.89 billion on revenues of $78.4 billion. The company sold 78.3 million iPhones, 13 million iPads, and 5.3 million Macs.

After the acquisition, Apple made the app free on the App Store, angering some users who had just purchased the app. To remedy this, however, Apple today has started reimbursing customers who purchased Workflow over recent weeks. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Apple has started sending emails to customers who recently purchased the app, informing them that their refund would be processed through their original payment method. Apple is refunding the full $2.99 cost of the app, as well as tax. Here’s the email Apple has been sending to customers: Dear iTunes Customer, Thank you for purchasing Workflow by DeskConnect, Inc. Workflow is now available for free in the App Store. Since you recently purchased this app, we have issued you a full refund in the amount of $3.21. These funds will be applied to your original payment method and may take up to five business days from the issue date to post to your account. Regards, iTunes Support Team At this point, it’s unclear as to what Apple’s plans for Workflow are. In somewhat of a change from Apple’s previous acquisitions, Workflow is still available on the App Store. Workflow is based around the idea of transforming a process that would normally take a handful of interactions with iOS into a single tap. The goal is to “hide” a complex set of commands under a single, instant tap of a button. Prior to Apple’s acquisition of the app, it ran for $2.99 on the App Store but it has since been made free. Prior to Apple’s acquisition of the app, Workflow had attracted a wealth of attention from Apple. In 2015, the app won an Apple Design Award, something Apple attributes to those accessibility features in today’s statement. If you want to take advantage of Workflow, head to the App Store now and download it for free. @9to5mac Getting a refund from Apple, cause of buying workflow some weeks ago — Joost van den Akker (@joost_akker) April 3, 2017 Chance Miller @ChanceHMiller Chance covers Apple for 9to5Mac and contributes to 9to5Google, Electrek, and 9to5Toys.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Lifestyle / Mobile / iPhone / At least one iPhone 8 is a curvy little number, industry sources claim At least one iPhone 8 is a curvy little number, industry sources claim Paul Taylor 9 hours ago iPhone, Tech News A recent report on Nikkei Asian Review has exposed a Samsung deal with Apple to provide the iPhone-maker with OLED panels from here to kingdom come – 70 million of them. Samsung, say experts, has capacity to squeeze out up to 95 million OLED panels for Apple, in case demand for the iPhone 8 skyrockets. This info has come on the coat-tails of news that Samsung is throwing $8.9 billion at expanding its OLED manufacturing capacity. OLED, the much-hyped display technology under Samsung’s thumb, is more flexible and presents better viewing angles than your run-of-the-mill LED display. However, OLED missed the last iteration of iPhone on what pundits believe to be the technology’s relative immaturity. Now, it seems, it’s ready for prime time. Apple expects to sell iPhone 8 by the literal millions and is said to be celebrating the smartphone’s 10th anniversary with the release of three models of the notoriously popular device: 4.7-, 5.2- and 5.5-inches. While the smaller 4.7-inch and the “Plus”-size 5.5-incher will sport completely flat displays, Nikkei claims the 5.2-inch version will be a premium bendy-phone with a slightly curved OLED screen and a price-tag in excess of $1,000. Quoting a supply chain source, the report also suggests that all versions of the iPhone will be good for a quick dive in shallow water and will finally support wireless charging. Money is on the Qi charging standard, as Apple joined the ranks of the Wireless Power Consortium. On the other hand, Apple is still working on overheating issues from the inductive charging, says the report. Or it could just be taking extra safety precautions to guarantee its devices remain non-explosive. The expected delivery of the components puts the iPhone 8 models on time for launch shortly after Summer, which matches Apple’s usual mid-September-to-early-October launch season. KitGuru Says: What iPhone 7 failed to deliver in terms of innovation seems to have been piled-up for the iPhone 8. With local Chinese brands taking over the iPhone’s top spot in the world’s biggest market, and Samsung giving Apple a run for its money globally, the company needs to pull a massive win here.

Hard hats and construction trucks are beginning to move out of Avalon’s new wing. The city-within-a-city in Alpharetta—a place where someone can work, live, eat and play—will unveil its second phase expansion to the public with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on April 13. But on Monday morning, North American Properties—the developer of the shopping hub—gave a tour of Avalon’s Boulevard East expansion to a few media members and special guests. Apple, Brooks Brothers, Williams Sonoma and other shops and eateries highlight what’s new at Avalon. Here’s a full list of the places that are expected to open on April 13: Apple Williams Sonoma Pottery Barn Levi’s Jeni’s Ice Cream Urban Outfitters Lucky Brand Scout & Molly’s Boogaloos Hammer Made Brooks Brothers Boardroom Brine Seafood Shack South Moon Under MF Bar District 3 Barley Garden Kitchen Rumi’s Kitchen A look down on Avalon's expansion from the top floor of a nine-story office building, where Microsoft and other businesses will have offices.  MITCHELL NORTHAM / MITCHELL.NORTHAM@AJC.COM ﻿READ MORE:Alpharetta’s Avalon building on success ﻿READ MORE:Everything to know about the Avalon in Alpharetta Mark Toro, a top executive for NAP said Apple coming to Avalon had been “under wraps” for more than a year. “(Apple’s) announcements are unique,” Toro said. “I’ve seen the store, and it is spectacular.” The Levi’s store at Avalon will be unique too. Like a select few other locations, the Levi’s at Avalon will offer custom-made jeans for its customers. Because of Avalon’s open-container policy, several of the new restaurants, like Brine’s Seafood Shack, will offer beer to go. Avalon’s expansion will also feature the Veranda, a complex of 276 apartments. The floor plans range from studios to one- and two-bedrooms, and rent runs from $1,525 to $5,000 per month. ﻿MORE ALPHARETTA: City blog named best in Georgia The East Boulevard wing will also feature a nine-story brick and glass office tower. Microsoft will be a tenant there, using the building for regional offices and a training center. A second 10-story office tower, which would be the tallest building in Alpharetta, is also planned. “Our office customers are really flocking to these locations that provide this kind of mixed use,” said John Heagy, a senior managing director for Hines, which helped develop Avalon. “They’re also looking for an urban setting.” Toro added that Starbucks and Sundance—a clothing, decor and accessories retailer founded by Robert Redford—will open stores in Avalon in the near future too. ﻿MORE ALPHARETTA: Man sues skating center after breaking hip The Apple Store will be one of the staples in the Avalon expansion in Alpharetta. MITCHELL NORTHAM / MITCHELL.NORTHAM@AJC.COM While construction will mostly be finished in Avalon East come April 13, work will continue at the only hotel at Avalon. The hotel will feature a conference center, 330 rooms, a pool and a resturaunt. It will be nestled at the end of the East Boulevard expansion and Toro said it will be the only four-star full-service hotel in Alpharetta. The hotel will be affiliated with Marriott, but will be operated independently. Between the hotel, business tower and new retail shops, Avalon will create an estimated 2,500 jobs with this expansion. Still, it feels like Avalon is missing one thing, Toro said. “It hasn’t been discussed at length, but putting a MARTA station right near here would be a no-brainer.” Toro did leave some mystery for the Avalon, declining to unveil what the newest restaurant will be. He said it will be announced on April 12. Said Toro: “It’s someone we have pursued from day one and we finally got them.” Like North Fulton County News Now on Facebook | Follow on Twitter and Instagram Related Alpharetta businessman John Bardis named HHS assistant secretary Details of Avalon expansion: Apple store, four-star hotel among what’s coming Dump your old electronics in Alpharetta this weekend Sandy Springs OKs police body camera contract Roswell to seek $10K grant for ‘Roots’ festival View Comments 0 Sign up for e-newsletters Want more news?

And I hope the dividend increase is six cents (or more). My nest egg is 90% AAPL. Egg has gotten pretty large. :) (Seriously) Consider diversifying. That's far too much risk in a single stock- even this stock. Consider the other old saying about eggs: "don't put all of your eggs in one basket."

Apple has imagined away the future of one of its suppliers of chip know-how. Imagination Technologies lost more than 60 percent of its market value – a hit of over 450 million pounds – after the iPhone maker said it would stop using the UK firm's technology in 15 months to two years' time. Imagination's intellectual property is used in graphics chips found in iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. The loss hits Imagination in two ways. The damage to its business is obvious. In the year to last April, fees and royalties from Apple totaled 61 million pounds. That's about half the British company's sales from continuing operations. Moreover, there are "minimal" direct costs associated with this revenue, according to the company, meaning pre-tax profit, estimated to approach 30 million pounds in the year to April 2018, could flip into a similarly sized loss.

Stringer worked on the first iPhones and iPads and has been a key witness in Apple's legal case against Samsung. Apple’s design team has gone through multiple changes in the last two years as Jonathan Ive has stepped back from running the team. Richard Howarth now leads the team on a day-to-day basis. The shifting leadership precipitated some defections—rare for the group, which inside Apple is known for its loyalty. Apple designer Danny Coster left to join the design team at GoPro last year.

Vasilash Whenever Apple is going to have a new product for sale in its stores, the fanboys line up in such great numbers that it's surprising Ticketmaster hasn't figured out a way to capitalize on the multitude of anxious buyers with credit cards ready to go. When Elon Musk talks about a new car being added to the lineup, there is an analogous group of people, and Musk has cleverly set up a model in which people place deposits for their place in line. The number of deposits (two per customer only, it should be noted) for the Model 3 is some 400,000. Because Tesla is a Silicon Valley company that has a highly desirable, highly designed suite of products for which there is demand the likes of which is completely uncharacteristic for the category, it is often compared to Apple. After all, has anyone gotten into line to buy a Windows phone? Do you even remember the Zune? So it must be that Tesla is like Apple. But there is one nontrivial problem with this comparison: Apple sells its products in mass quantity. Tesla, even though it just had its best quarter ever, delivering a record 25,418 vehicles - up 69 percent over the first quarter of 2016 - is still, when compared to the car industry in general, selling a specialized product. No, the automotive brand most like Apple is Jeep. Just as with Apple's quickly identified design language - either for the physical phones and computers or the interfaces for same - there is no mistaking a Jeep. Like Apple's legion of fans, there are people for whom a Jeep is not merely a form of transportation, but a statement about one's way of life. Like the companies that wish they could have designs that are Apple-like and do their utmost to have a similar objects or appearances (sometimes landing them in court, a la Samsung), is there a single automotive company that wouldn't like to have some of Jeep's magic? While there aren't people who are lined up outside of dealerships when a new Jeep goes on sale, there is probably more interest in the forthcoming Wrangler than in the accumulation of interest in a half-dozen other vehicles from other companies. And like Apple, Jeep is a comparative volume play. Last year FCA US LLC delivered 926,376 Jeeps. Walter P. Chrysler and the Dodge Brothers must be spinning at high velocity in their graves, because the U.S. total for Chrysler brand was 231,972, and Dodge was 506,858. The sum of the two - 738,830 - is well shy of Jeep's sales. On a global basis, Jeep sold some 1.4 million units in 2016. It is looking to increase that number to about 2 million by 2020. Which means that there will be not only a line extension, such as putting a vehicle below the Renegade and one above the Grand Cherokee, but that Jeeps will be sold in greater numbers in places that aren't the US. Realize that, for example, while the all-new 2017 Jeep Cherokee is being produced in four plants, none of them are in the US. Clearly there is a danger here for the Jeep faithful, a danger that Jeeps may become something targeted toward markets that aren't the US, aren't from where they originated. What becomes of the "authenticity"? Because if there is any characteristic that defines Jeep, that's it. Turns out the answer to that question is simple: Nothing. That's the word from Mark Allen, the man who has been designing Jeeps (and trucks) for more than 20 years, the man who heads Jeep Design. In a recent interview, he told me that no matter where Jeeps are built, all of them are - and will be - designed in Auburn Hills by his team. Yes, there are modifications needed to make the vehicles street-legal for other countries - not exactly major things, generally, as he cites license-plate fixture points as an issue they face - but the Jeeps are going to be coming out of the primary Jeep studio. slide-4965351 Jeep Grand One Concept: East Jeep Safari 2017 Image Credit: Jeep slide-4965352 Jeep Quicksand Concept: Easter Jeep Safari Jeep Quicksand Concept: Easter Jeep Safari 2017 Image Credit: Jeep slide-4965353 Jeep Safari Concept: Easter Jeep Safari 2017 Jeep Safari Concept: Easter Jeep Safari 2017 Image Credit: Jeep slide-4965354 Jeep Trailpass Concept: East Jeep Safari 2017 Jeep Trailpass Concept: East Jeep Safari 2017 Image Credit: Jeep slide-4965355 Jeep Switchback Concept: Easter Jeep Safari Jeep Switchback Concept: Easter Jeep Safari 2017 Image Credit: Jeep slide-4965356 Jeep Luminator Concept: Easter Jeep Safari 2017 Jeep Luminator Concept: Easter Jeep Safari 2017 Image Credit: Jeep slide-4965349 Jeep CJ Sixty-Six Concept: Easter Jeep Safari 2017 Jeep CJ66 Concept: Easter Jeep Safari 2017 Image Credit: Jeep slide-4965350 Jeep CJ Sixty-Six Concept: Easter Jeep Safari 2017 Jeep CJ66 Concept: Easter Jeep Safari 2017 Image Credit: Jeep It will soon be Easter. Allen and his team will be in Moab, Utah. They will be taking with them a suite of specially created Jeeps, vehicles they will be showing and demonstrating to the Jeep faithful who go there each year (this is the 51st) for the Easter Jeep Safari. Allen points out that these are capable concept vehicles - as in Jeeps that are capable of doing what Jeeps are supposed to do. Sure, there are clubs for probably every vehicle on the planet. But chances are there is no more dedicated group of individuals around the planet than those who drive Jeeps. That's something that Tesla will never have. Nor will Samsung or Microsoft ever get the love of Apple.

In a recent statement, British chipmaker Imagination Technologies announced the Cupertino titan has notified them it has plans to shift away from contracting third-party manufacturers to build its graphics processors and move production in-house in “two years’ time.” Win a trip to Amsterdam! We've teamed up with Product Hunt to offer you the chance to win an all expense paid trip to TNW Conference 2017! CHECK IT OUT The maneuver will see Apple develop its own proprietary “graphics design in order to control its products and [reduce] its future reliance on Imagination’s technology.” It will also allow the company to cut costs from current royalty and license agreements with Imagination Technologies. This puts the British chipmaker in a rather difficult position as Apple accounts for about half of Imagination’s entire revenue. Reuters reported its stock value has plunged over 70 percent since the initial announcement earlier on Monday. Last year, the Big A confirmed it was mulling acquiring Imagination, but the deal ultimately never panned out. The iPhone-maker does, however, own a small 8 percent stake in the company. There’s one potential hiccup to Apple’s new plans though. Imagination believes it remains highly unlikely the Cupertino giant can develop new graphics architecture without infringing on its patents: Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it. Further, Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple’s assertions. The UK-based manufacturer further remarked it is yet to discuss “alternative commercial arrangements” with Apple, so don’t be too surprised if the two companies eventually patch things up and strike a new licensing agreement. on Imagination Technologies Read next: Apple wants to sell HBO, Showtime and Starz in new premium TV bundle AppleCESGeariPhone Share on Facebook (843) Share on Twitter (255) Mix is a reporter from Amsterdam.

Slide: 1 / of 1. Caption: JOSH EDELSON/Getty Images Skip Article Header. Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Brian Barrett. Brian Barrett Gear Date of Publication: 04.03.17. 04.03.17 Time of Publication: 4:08 pm. 4:08 pm Apple’s Making Its Own GPU to Control Its Own Destiny JOSH EDELSON/Getty Images For years, a company called Imagination Technologies gave Apple the tech behind your iPhone’s Retina-ready graphics and eye-popping image processing. That relationship ended today. From here on out, according to an Imagination Technologies release, Apple will design its own underlying technology for GPUs. The reason is simple: It’s officially too important to entrust to someone else. Losing such a major customer has cratered Imagination Technologies stock; about half the company’s annual revenue came from Apple. But that doesn’t mean Apple’s sudden yen for graphics independence should come as a surprise. In fact, it was inevitable. Graphics Content Graphics are the future. Not only that, but they’re increasingly important in the present: Graphics processors underpin virtually all of the features and experiences that today’s tech companies scramble to lead in. Machine learning? GPUs. Augmented and virtual reality? Likewise. And while it often gets lost in the conversation around glitzier use cases, good old-fashioned, high-resolution gaming horsepower leans heavily on GPUs too. Dips in Chips Brian Barrett The Silicon Shift That’s Transforming How Tech Giants Make Phones Cade Metz How AI Is Shaking Up the Chip Market Chris Kohler Apple TV’s Plan to Succeed Where Other Tiny Consoles Didn’t That’s partly because of how graphics processors work. While traditional CPUs process things sequentially, a GPU can crunch a huge number of calculations in parallel. They’re the multitaskers of the silicon world, adept at the kind of mega-scale data churn that CPUs can only dream of. “The GPU is being leaned on more heavily than it ever has before,” says Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights & Strategy. “With the right algorithm, you can get 10 times the performance per watt [a key measure of computational efficiency] with a GPU on machine learning than you can with a CPU.” You just can’t overstate the importance of that sort of machine learning, in which Apple has been a quiet but important player. As Backchannel reported last year, it’s what gives Siri its smarts and predicts what app you might need at any given moment. It provides the connective tissue that helps your iPhone anticipate your every need. Despite recent inroads, that’s an area in which Apple still lags well behind Google. Apple has even ceded important digital assistant ground to Amazon, whose Alexa currently converses on dozens of devices—including the iPhone. Apple similarly finds itself underdeveloped in augmented and virtual reality, fields that haven’t yet gone fully mainstream but are by now at least mainstream-adjacent. It’s clearly an area of intense focus; Apple CEO Tim Cook recently told The Independent that he sees AR as “a big ideal like the smartphone,” with potentially iPhone-like impact. As for high-resolution, stutter-free graphics, well, those still matter, especially when your years-long quest to conquer the living room coalesces in the Apple TV, a tiny black box that strives to keep up with full-fledged consoles. So yes, graphics are a big deal for every tech giant—and especially for Apple, which appears to have some catching up to do. They matter so much, in fact, that Apple didn’t have any other choice. Going It Alone Apple has, of course, been making its own processors for years. Its Ax series SoC garners the most attention, since it’s the brain behind the iPhone. In recent years, though, Apple branched out: The Sx series supports the Apple Watch. The W1 enables the Bluetooth magic that keeps Air Pods connected. And the T1 popped up in last year’s MacBook Pro, providing an extra security layer for the Touch Bar and its fingerprint-reading Touch ID feature. “In general, Apple likes to own as much of the underlying technology for its products as possible, and it already has a deep investment in chips,” says Jan Dawson, founder of Jackdaw Research. If anything, look at Apple’s move into graphics as a continuation of a trend it helped start. Rather than rely on outside partners for critical components, an increasing number of large-scale tech companies have invested in rolling their own silicon. The advantages are manifold; you can design them to work specifically with your own devices, find novel ways to differentiate, and avoid getting dragged down if something goes wrong on someone else’s watch. Not only that, but Apple’s also good at this. Moorhead notes that the Ax series performance improves around 25 percent every year, a pace that the veteran analyst “never seen before.” That’s not to say that Cupertino will automatically replicate its mobile CPU success in the graphics realm. “I liken GPUs to black magic,” says Moorhead. “It’s really, really hard to get right. And there are fewer people who know how to do it.” In fact, that confluence of factors—difficulty of execution and scarcity of talent—signals what seems to be the biggest potential roadblock to Apple’s new core competence: whether it can design an effective graphics processor without getting sued. A lot. That already seems to be on Imagination Technology’s mind. “Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property, and confidential information,” the company said in a statement Monday. And it won’t be the only rival keeping close eyes on what Apple comes up with. “There is a big question about where Apple will get the patent licenses and so on that it needs,” says Dawson. But both he and Moorhead also suggest that it’s a highly solvable problem. Companies like ARM willingly license out technology, which could provide some legal coverage. Or Apple could apportion out some of its nearly $250 billion cash hoard to snap up a patent-loaded chipmaker. Building up IP quickly takes two things Apple happens to stockpile: ingenuity and money. Besides, even if there is some risk, it’s worth every bit of it for Apple to control its own graphics destiny. It’s going to dig into GPUs as though its life depended on it—because increasingly, it does. Go Back to Top.

Apple now is developing its own graphics processors, which will be used in future products, including the iPhone. The news was announced Monday by Imagination Technologies, the company that currently makes the graphic chips for the iPhone. “Apple has asserted that it has been working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination’s technology,” the company said in a statement. The U.K.-based company said Apple will stop using its products sometime within the next two years. Following the announcement, Imagination Technologies’ stock fell 69 percent, according to CNET. Developing its own processors could be tricky for Apple, however. “Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights,” Imagination said. Imagination said it asked Apple for evidence it can make processors without violating patents, but that Apple still hasn’t provided any. Apple currently is Imagination Technologies’ largest customer, according to CNET.

Smart bulbs can increase energy efficiency, comfort, and ease of use. But that’s not all! As Philips Hue first proved when introducing its color-changing bulbs 4 Ways Philips Hue Can Push Your Lighting to the Next Level 4 Ways Philips Hue Can Push Your Lighting to the Next Level Without Philips Hue, however, the smart home concept might never have gotten off the ground. Here are some cool ways to make use of them. Read More in 2012, smart lighting products can also provide a lot of fun. In this article, you’ll learn about three unique and fun smart lighting products on the market. If you want to turn your everyday home lighting into a work of art or increase its functionality, these products may be the perfect fit for you. These include the Nanoleaf Aurora, Stack lighting, and the Sengled Pulse. 1. Nanoleaf Aurora Nanoleaf has offered green lighting products since 2013. However, it wasn’t until late 2015 that the company introduced its first smart product, the Nanoleaf Ivy Smarter Kit. Building on the success of the Ivy, Nanoleaf next added something entirely different to its product lineup: the Nanoleaf Aurora. This smart light offers color changing and voice control abilities in a unique design. I first saw the Nanoleaf Aurora in October 2016 at the MoMA Design Store online. Almost immediately, I fell in love with its unusual design. Once I read about Nanoleaf’s plans for the product in 2017, I finally brought one into my home. What It Is The Nanoleaf Aurora is made up of triangular panels that attach via small connectors. The Nanoleaf Lightning Smarter Kit comes with nine modular panels and a controller unit. With expansion packs, you can have up to 30 panels with each installation. You can organize your Nanoleaf Aurora smart lighting panels How Smart Lighting Affects Your Health (According to Science) How Smart Lighting Affects Your Health (According to Science) Several scientific studies have indicated many influences of lighting on our mental and physical health. Thankfully, smart lighting can help you achieve all of these benefits in just a few simple steps. Read More into any number of patterns. There are suggestions in the quick start guide, but your options are limitless. Once you decide on your design, use the included double-sided adhesive mounting strips to place your creation on a wall. Be careful here, as you can’t remove these strips quickly without also causing damage to your wall. Want something less permanent? Arrange your Nanoleaf Aurora on a table for easy removal. All About Control To control your lights, use the free Nanoleaf app (iOS and Android). This is where you’ll find an ever-growing list of scene templates. You can also create your own with ease using the Aurora Canvas tool. Nanoleaf Aurora is also compatible with Apple HomeKit Put Apple HomeKit Devices to Good Use With Automation Put Apple HomeKit Devices to Good Use With Automation Have more than one accessory compatible with Apple HomeKit?

Stack Lighting Though it might not have the same “wow” factor as the Nanoleaf Aurora, Stack is a unique lighting solution that may more easily blend in with your existing decor. Stack lights automatically respond to changes in an environment’s ambient light and the time of day. The lights are able to regulate their brightness and color temperature without your intervention. What It Is To achieve this responsiveness, Stack lights focus on four main points: Home awareness — Stack lights turn themselves on and off, depending on your occupancy. It also alerts you when someone enters your home. Circadian lighting — Stack intelligently adjusts the color temperature based on the time of day, which can help to optimize your sleep/wake cycle. Light sensing — Stack automatically dims and brightens each bulb according to the natural light in the room. This feature can reduce your energy costs by up to 60 percent. Initiative learning — Like other smart products on the market, Stack learns your inputs over time, creating a more personalized experience. While Stack strives to minimize user interaction, many of the features found on other lighting solutions remain. For example, with the mobile Stack app, you can change the color temperature and brightness of the bulb and schedule wake-up times. You also have the ability to turn off the occupancy and ambient light sensors as needed. Lots of Control Thanks to IFTTT, you can also link 13 Wacky Ways to Beat Procrastination With IFTTT 13 Wacky Ways to Beat Procrastination With IFTTT Squeeze more out of your work time. Solve the productivity puzzle by keeping distractions and procrastination at bay with these smart IFTTT recipes. Read More other connected lights to your Stack lights. For example, you can use an IFTTT applet to turn on your Philips Hue or LIFX lights every time Stack detects occupancy. Stack lights currently work with Amazon Alexa and Google Nest, and will soon offer compatibility for the Apple HomeKit ecosystem. Looking Ahead One of the reasons I put Stack on this list is because of the emerging Stack Enabled program. With this program, Stack allows other lighting manufacturers 7 Creative Uses for Colored LED Home Automation Lighting 7 Creative Uses for Colored LED Home Automation Lighting Turning on your lights automatically is certainly cool, but it doesn't take advantage of the full spectrum of colors available with RGB lighting. For that, we need to get creative. Read More to embed Stack’s active sensor and signal processing technology into different lighting formats. In other words, the features that make Stack unique could soon show up on many of your other favorite smart lighting products. Stack currently offers two starter packs through its website. The Stack Classic Starter Kit ($89) includes two A19 bulbs and one hub. The Stack Downlight Starter Kit ($99) consists of two BR30 bulbs and a hub. A19 bulbs are priced at $28 each, while individual BR30 bulbs cost $45. 3. Sengled Pulse Every room in your home needs at least one light. Thanks to the Pulse by Sengled, you can now have a speaker in every room too. Pulse combines the energy efficiency of a dimmable LED light with the high-quality audio of a JBL Bluetooth speaker. The result is an extraordinary and practical mix of light and sound. What It Is The Pulse twists into any standard E26/E27 light socket, requiring no extra speaker wires or power cords. You can add as many as eight Pulse bulbs to your setup, depending on the size of your home. Central Control Use the free Pulse app for iOS or Android to control light dimming and sound volume. You can also launch media players like Pandora and Spotify directly from the mobile app. Extra, Extra Want to move beyond streaming music from your mobile device? You can add your existing subwoofer to enhance the bass of your Pulse sound system using the Pulse Amp. With the Pulse Link, you can play sound from your TV or another non-iOS or non-Android device. Something More Sengled also offers the Solo, an LED with a stereo speaker intended for one room use. The company’s newest product, Element, is similar to Stack lighting. It allows you to set the lighting in your home according to the time of day. You can also use the Element app to set lighting remotely. The Pulse starter kit ($150) features a master and satellite bulb and is available in candy apple, white, and pewter. Additional satellite bulbs are $70 each. Something for Everyone Whether you want to install smart lighting that looks like a piece of art, add bulbs that change based on the time of day, or enjoy music across multiple rooms, these unique solutions have you covered. Each can provide years of enjoyment and use. Which of these smart lighting products do you find most interesting? Let us know in the comments below.

This intriguing piece of information comes via a Barclays note which also talks about the handset’s possible 3D camera sensors. To recall, Apple debuted its True Tone tech with last year’s 9.7-inch iPad Pro. It basically adjusts the color temperature according to a person’s surroundings, using four-channel ambient light sensors to automatically change the shade and intensity of the screen for a more natural look. Barclays thinks that Apple will stuff the iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone 8 with a ‘full spectral sensing’ ambient light sensor to grant the handsets a ‘True Color’ panel. This combined with an OLED panel may well translate to the premium model having one of the best displays in the business. Also See: Man nearly electrocuted while charging iPhone in bed Earlier reports have highlighted Apple’s AR and facial recognition ambitions. Barclays now has some fresh details about the innovations, claiming that the company plans to use two custom 3D sensors with structured light cameras on the front and back. The front-facing one may concentrate on scanning for faces, while the rear-facing one might focus on augmented reality experiences. Barclays had previously held that the rear surface would feature a Time-of-Flight sensor for advanced depth mapping but is now changing its stance in light of the new information it has obtained. Speaking of revised iPhone 8 predictions, a recent leak had indicated that the phone would shift Touch ID to the back rather than underneath the panel, feature a metal back instead of a glass one, and be called the iPhone Edition.

He was with the iPhone maker for 21 years, as per a new article Monday by The Information. About a year ago, Danny Coster, another member of Apple’s elite industrial design team, has left the firm for greener pastures at GoPro. The design team at Apple’s gone through multiple changes in the last two years as Jonathan Ive stepped back from running the team, with Richard Howarth taking over day-to-day management of the group. Working alongside Jony Ive for many years, Stringer was heavily involved in the first iPhones and iPads. It wasn’t immediately clear where he might be going after Apple. Apple’s promotional video showcasing its $300 coffee table book offers a unique look at the design studio and some of the tools they use to prototype future gadgets. Stringer’s name is listed on many Apple patents. More important, he was a key witness in the monster Apple v. Samsung trial. Stringer testified about Apple’s painstaking industrial design process, revealing publicly for the first time that Apple prototyped curved-glass iPhones in the past and even contemplated an iPhone with an all-aluminum enclosure akin to iPods.

Apple and Samsung Display, a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics, signed a deal last year to supply 100 million OLEDs for iPhone 8. In February 2017, Apple contracted Samsung to build an additional 60 million OLEDs for a total of 160 million units in 2017. “Apple has ordered 70 million units of OLED panels from Samsung this year, while Samsung is preparing to churn out as many as 95 million for Apple in 2017, in case demand exceeds expectations,” said David Hsieh, Senior Director at research company IHS Markit. Many supposed iPhone 8 features from Nikkei’s report were mentioned previously: 3D sensor for facial recognition as part of new biometric features Active screen size: 5.2 inches High price: $1,000+ No physical Home button Waterproofing Wireless charging The 4.7-inch iPhone 7s and 5.5-icnh iPhone 7s Plus will adopt existing liquid crystal display (LCD) technology without curved screens, said the report. According to multiple rumors over the past few months, other component suppliers are expected to join Apple’s OLED supply chain in 2018, including Foxconn-owned Sharp, LG Display and Japan Display. iPhone 8 concept via Daniel Csonth.

According to a report from Nikkei, Apple has placed an order for 70 million “bendable” OLED displays from Samsung for use in the iPhone 8… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The report cites a supply chain source and explains that while Apple at this point has ordered 70 million panels, Samsung is planning to produce as many as 95 million by the end of the year. Samsung will reportedly be the sole supplier of OLED panels for the iPhone 8 due to having the “most advanced” technology in the field. “Apple has ordered 70 million units of OLED panels from Samsung this year, while Samsung is preparing to churn out as many as 95 million for Apple in 2017, in case demand exceeds expectations,” Hsieh said. Apple has been said to have faced difficulties in sourcing the OLED panels for the iPhone 8, but it seems to have decided on Samsung despite its efforts to look elsewhere and reduce its reliance on Samsung. Today’s report reiterates that the upcoming iPhone 8 will feature a 5.2-inch OLED screen with curved edges, coming in at more than $1000. Additionally, it adds that all three of this year’s new iPhones will feature wireless charging, but notes that suppliers are still trying to work through overheating issues. Furthermore, the report claims that the all three models will be waterproof, while the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will retain the Home button and the iPhone 8 will ditch it. As for 3D sensing, today’s report reiterates that the iPhone 8 will feature support for new biometric technologies such as facial recognition. The industry source familiar with iPhone design says all three handsets will come with wireless charging functions, although suppliers are still trying to resolve overheating issues. They will also be waterproof, according to the source The iPhone 8 is expected to be unveiled later this year and some reports suggest it won’t be available until after September. Apple is reportedly facing difficulties manufacturing the iPhone 8, thus the reason for a possible delayed release. Keep up with everything we know about iPhone 8 here.

The large order suggests that Apple expects its 10th anniversary smartphone to be a big seller. A supply chain source confirmed the size of the order which was in line with an estimate from IHS Markit director David Hsieh. "Apple has ordered 70 million units of OLED panels from Samsung this year, while Samsung is preparing to churn out as many as 95 million for Apple in 2017, in case demand exceeds expectations," Hsieh said. "It is also possible that some of these 70 million handsets will not be shipped to customers this year and be carried over to next year depending on demand." The slightly curved OLED screen on the iPhone 8 is estimated to measure about 5.2-inches. Apple is also expected to release two other handsets with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch LED displays. All models are said to come with wireless charging functions; although, overheating problems are still being worked out. They will also be waterproof. A source also told the site that at least one model will feature a 3D sensor that enables facial recognition. The high-end model will also drop the home button. Apple is expected to unveil its new smartphones later this year. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

Stringer, who is part of Jony Ive's industrial design team and had a hand in designing the iPhone, notably testified in the ongoing Samsung v. Apple legal battle back in 2012. As he's been working alongside Ive for many years, Stringer has had a hand in designing everything from the iPhone and iPad to the Mac over the last 20 years. Ive's industrial design team is notoriously private, so little else is known about Stringer, or where he might be going after Apple. His departure comes nearly two years after Jony Ive took on the role of Chief Design Officer and took a step back from the day-to-day management of the company's design team, a task that now falls to Richard Howarth. Stringer is the second longtime Apple designer to have left Ive's team over the course of the last year. Daniel Coster, who was also on the team for more than 20 years, left in April of 2016 to join GoPro. Despite the changes to the industrial design team, and some mid-2016 rumors suggesting Jony Ive might be on his way out, Apple's design chief is said to be as devoted and involved as ever.

Without Steve job's to lead the team and be the guy who said "No" or "yes" and controlled the people under him, the current leadership team seems to be very stuck in a mindset that They are always right, because they've been right in the past. I think many of the people he picked for the team, without him directing them, are pathetically lost. This is Hubris. The current executive team seems very VERY full of Hubris lately.

Do you really think Steve did such a bad job picking his executive team? He picks Tim to replace him, and while you might argue that was a one-off mistake, you also think the entire rest of the executive team would sit by and let a CEO go rogue? Or perhaps Steve was wrong when he picked the entire team? That his "best and closest friend" Jony Ive wouldn't have had more to say if Tim was focusing only on profits? Let's ask Scott Forstall what he thinks. Forstall had no bad words for the company, saying he was "so proud of the thousands of people I worked with [at Apple] and with whom I remain friends," and adding that "I am delighted that they continue to turn out great and beloved products."

But maybe it's as simple as the guy is burnt out and never needs to work again for the rest of his life. Or maybe there was some jealousy with Richard Howarths promotion instead of him. Stringer has definitely been a key part of Apples design team, so it's really unfortunate to see him go. He was the least geeky looking guy on the team, I always imagined him being the "cool" part of Apple design. But key word is team. There's many other talented designers still committed there, and it might actually be a good thing introducing fresh minds into that exclusive club. The other guy who left for GoPro hasn't really done anything impressive over there, so I'm not really concerned about individuals. The total is greater than the sum of its parts. That team chemistry, as well as the internal culture and environment, are the biggest contributors, not any one individual.

B of A commits $1.5 million to boost Charlotte fintech effort search goes here Amazon Cash's secret weapon is the Apple wallet By John Adams Published April 03 2017, 2:48pm EDT More in Cash Mobile payments Retailers Bank technology Amazon Apple Print Email Reprints Share Share on Amazon is lending its considerable brand and heft to a cash payment model that borrows a vital piece of real estate from Apple Pay. Called Amazon Cash, the feature allows cash-carrying consumers to add funds to their Amazon.com balance by presenting a bar code to a cashier at a network of partner retailers. Users tell the clerk how much cash to add, between $15 and $500 at once, and the funds arrive instantly in an Amazon.com stored-value account. Systems like this are not new, and earlier models relied on consumers setting up a cash load online and then presenting a printed receipt, as was the case when Walmart introduced a similar service in 2012. Amazon's twist is keeping the experience decidedly digital, allowing consumers to store a reusable Amazon Cash bar code in Apple's wallet app or on the home screen of Android devices. Bloomberg News Amazon Cash debuted Monday in the U.S., and the initial retailers include CVS, Speedway, Sheetz, Kum & Go, D&W Fresh Market, Family Fare Supermarkets and VG's Grocery. Besides bearing similarities to Walmart's Pay with Cash service, Amazon Cash also resembles PayPal's MyCash card, which charges a nominal fee upfront for digital in-store prepaid loads to PayPal's account, and is a major part of PayPal's efforts to build a market among underbanked consumers. The key differences for Amazon: There are no consumer fees, and there is no physical card. "It's a bit of a defeat for PayPal, which is increasingly catering to the needs of the unbanked and would had loved to do a deal with Amazon to enable the unbanked to purchase there," said Rick Oglesby, president of AZ Payments Group. Amazon Cash also shares traits with PayNearMe, which works with a similar network of retailers but markets its service more for bill payment than e-commerce. Amazon's service could also be an alternative to prepaid card companies such as Netspend and Green Dot, whose products can give unbanked consumers access to e-commerce. "Amazon's service is open to anyone who has a mobile phone," said Richard Crone, a payments consultant. The system adds authentication through the phone credentials, the Amazon login and the consumer showing his or her phone at the retailer, he noted. "It pushes the entire prepaid market to up its game." Amazon can also pair the program with its strategy to build a brick and mortar footprint by tying some elements of traditional retail with its e-commerce brand. Amazon is building Go, an experimental store that doesn't require a checkout, instead using in-store sensors to charge a user's Amazon account for in-store shopping. Amazon is also opening a chain of bookstores, and is expanding its distribution and fulfillment network in the U.S. Amazon did not reveal terms of its deals with retailers, and did not return a request for comment by deadline. The launch of Amazon Cash comes at an unwelcome time for the traditional brick-and-mortar industry, as Amazon becomes larger than most big-box chains combined, and many big-box chains face traffic slumps and closures. "Consumers can access to Amazon for whatever you want to buy. And if Amazon takes this to its move to open stores, they can squeeze out even more," Crone said. "It would be like Trader Joe's for Amazon." Article Your Top CECL Questions Answered How should banks approach CECL implementation and can existing processes be used as a starting point?

Love visual aspect of news?: Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! NEW DELHI: Apple has been asked to work closely with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) so that the iPhone maker’s plans conform to the government’s current phased manufacturing programme to the maximum extent possible, effectively ruling out any special fiscal sops for the company. In a meeting two weeks ago among Apple, the Revenue Department, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) and electronics ministry officials, the company made a presentation on its plans for component manufacturing in India, flagging concerns over the lack of a supplier base. A senior official present at the meeting told ET that Apple cannot get exemptions outside the purview of the phased manufacturing programme for mobile handsets and tablets but minor adjustments could be made. He was referring to the roadmap that seeks to progressively indigenise items such as chargers, adapters, batteries, mechanics, wired headsets, speakers, printed circuit board assemblies (PCBA) and exclude them from duty benefits. Apple has sought import concessions for suppliers till it has a vendor base in the country. The revenue department will decide on custom duty exemptions for imported components based on the view taken by the electronics ministry, but it’s unlikely that such a concession will be made under the GST regime, which is expected to roll out on July 1. Apple had asked the government for a 15-year custom duty exemption on components. “The matter is in the hands of MeitY now and Apple will have to show it can do phased manufacturing in India for each component,” said the official cited above. “We will not go outside the purview of the present policy.” Apple told government officials about its manufacturing experience in Brazil where the cost of components has become too high due to the duty structure, adding that it does not want to put suppliers in a similar position in India. The company declined to comment on the matter but referred ET to a statement issued in January. “We've been working hard to develop our operations in India and are proud to deliver the best products and services in the world to our customers here,” it had said at the time. “We appreciate the constructive and open dialogue we’ve had with government about further expanding our local operations.” Apple wants to make India a major manufacturing hub after China and Brazil and is set to kick this plan off with the Karnataka plant being set up by contract manufacturer Wistron to assemble 300,000-400,000 iPhone SEs annually. The company wants to scale up manufacturing in India by establishing its supplier base in the country in the long run. Apple currently manufactures and exports chargers through a contract manufacturing facility in Chennai. An inter-ministerial group including senior officials of the industry, environment, IT and revenue departments had met Apple’s representatives to discuss its wish list in January. India provides 20% capital subsidy for units engaged in electronics manufacturing for 10 years under the Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme. Other companies such as Samsung operating in the same sector have started sourcing parts from within the country while also exporting products made at its plants in Noida and Sriperumbudur.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Imagination Technologies’ share price collapses as Apple dumps company Imagination Technologies’ share price collapses as Apple dumps company By Joel Hruska on April 3, 2017 at 3:01 pm Comment Ever since Apple launched the original iPhone, it’s worked closely with Imagination Technologies. Even after Apple began building its own GPU architecture, it relied on Imagination for other building blocks of its total solution. Apple, however, appears to be bringing that relationship to an end, and Imagination Technologies’ stock has cratered as a result. Think less Chelyabinsk and more Tunguska. On Friday, Imagination Technologies was trading at 268.75 pence sterling. As of this writing, it’s trading at ~102 pence sterling. That’s a cataclysmic drop for the company, and it’s driven by a letter IT posted earlier today. It reads, in part: Imagination Technologies Group… has been notified by Apple Inc. (“Apple”), its largest customer, that Apple is of a view that it will no longer use the Group’s intellectual property in its new products in 15 months to two years’ time, and as such will not be eligible for royalty payments under the current license and royalty agreement… Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it. Further, Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple’s assertions. Apple’s notification has led Imagination to discuss with Apple potential alternative commercial arrangements for the current license and royalty agreement. As recently as last year, Apple was reportedly in talks to purchase Imagination Technologies, but those deals fell through. Instead, Apple hired a number of Imagination’s former employees and engineers, which may be part of why IT is taking a rather aggressive stance with its claims that it would be difficult for Apple to develop a non-infringing part. Part of what makes the situation muddy is that Apple may have already built its own custom GPU. Apple’s payments to Imagination Technologies totaled £60.7 through the year that ended in April 2016, and Apple is expected to pay roughly £65 million ($81 million USD) through April of 2017. That’s roughly half of Imagination Technologies’ revenue, which explains why the stock has taken such a beating. Imagination Technologies’ statements about taking Apple to court aren’t an empty threat, but court proceedings aren’t a substitute for ongoing license revenue. Even if IT won a court case against Apple, the appeals and counter-suits could drag on for years. The judicial system isn’t designed to settle these kinds of disputes quickly, and IT isn’t in great shape right now. The company fired 350 people last year and announced it would seek to reduce operating costs after a slump in iPhone sales slugged its bottom line. To-date, Imagination Technologies has tried to protect its PowerVR, MIPS, and Ensigma product divisions from cuts, but that may no longer be possible. PowerVR has provided the bulk of its earnings for years, so we wouldn’t be surprised to see the other segments jettisoned first.

According to tech blog Recode, Apple, which already sells HBO, Showtime and Starz, intends to roll them up in to a single package. Apple has approached the three networks about combining them as premium bundle. Apple currently offers HBO for $15 a month, Showtime for $11 a month, and Stars for $9 a month. However, no potential pricing information about bundle package has been disclosed. No deal has been signed, according to Recode. Although, traditional pay TV operators require consumers to subscribe to a basic level of TV channels before they sell them a premium bundle, Apple could sell the bundle as a standalone product with customers accessing those channels using iOS devices or Apple TV set-top box.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's decision (PDF) found if the Banks were allowed to create their own mobile payment service using iPhones NFC chips it would deliver “a significant public benefit from increased competition, consumer choice, innovation and investment in mobile payment services.” But it also noted that the four banks collectively hold almost two-thirds of Australia's consumer credit card market. The ACCC's decision therefore “considers that the Applicants’ incentives to favour their own wallets will limit the public benefits of increased competition between digital wallets.” The Commission also found that even if it granted access to iPhones' NFC, it would not notably accelerate uptake of mobile payments. The decision also notes that the banks could easily bypass Apple Pay with an “NFC paytag”, an NFC chip on a sticker designed to be slapped onto any mobile phone. Your correspondent’s bank just sent one – they're not hard to come by in Australia. But perhaps the most interesting aspect of the decision is that it says Apple would not have complied with a ruling that forced it to provide access to iPhones NFC chips. “Apple submits that even if authorisation is granted it will not grant NFC access, and therefore the proposed conduct cannot lead to any of the public benefits claimed,” the ruling says. The Act under which the Commission operates allows it to fine those who choose not to comply with its rulings and there's also an avenue of appeal to the Courts. The Register suspects Apple would gladly have taken the second option. Among the downsides to allowing the four banks access, the Commission listed the likely slower adoption of Apple Pay in Australia and the negative effect that would have on iPhone owners. The decision also argued that locking down iPhones to Apple Pay and Apple Pay only is a conscious decision by Apple, made in the knowledge of open access to NFC on Androids, and that it would distort the market to allow open access to iPhones. Here's the Commission's thinking: If the Applicants are successful in obtaining NFC access, this would affect Apple’s current integrated hardware-software strategy for mobile payments and operating systems more generally, thereby impacting how Apple competes with Google. In particular, NFC access may involve modifications to Apple’s software or hardware that lessen the degree of differentiation between the iOS platform and the Android platform. Another argument is that if the banks were allowed access it would skew Australia's mobile payments market to smartphones, making it harder for alternatives to get a toehold. Australian regulators are well-regarded internationally and networked with their peers: The Register is aware of communication and occasional cross-pollination between the ACCC and The UK's Offcom. This decision is therefore likely to be noticed in legal circles if other organisations try to work around Apple. With “disruption” and “fintech” constants in Reg hacks' inboxes, such an effort may already be happening. ® Tips and corrections 19 Comments More from The Register ACCC goes beyond recall, bans 'hoverboards' Ask the French, they'll tell you: Li-ion batteries explode 7 Comments ACCC issues mobile roaming regulation discussion paper Pigeons, meet cat Remember those stupid hoverboards? 500,000+ recalled in the US after they started exploding Vid This Wheel's On Fire 46 Comments ACCC mulls regulating roaming charges Don't even think about it, thunder Telstra, Optus 3 Comments ACCC keeps ADSL services in its grip Suffer in your jocks, Telstra: Regulation to stay ahead of complete NBN rollout Telstra's CRM system breached competition undertaking: ACCC Overall, SSU compliance is improving Whitepapers Dynamic Optimization Technology for Infrastructure Resources and Cloud Services Access this Innovation Insight to read Gartner’s recommendations for incorporating dynamic optimisation technology into your infrastructure and cloud initiatives.

The iPhone 8 (iPhone X) is expected to come with and OLED screen display, with Samsung rumored to be the sole supplier. Last month, a DigiTimes report said Apple would receive 75 million OLED panels from Samsung Display this year, five million more than the figure reported by Nikkei. Read: iPhone 8 Rumors: Himax Technologies Joins Supply Chain For 3D Sensors On Upcoming Apple Smartphone The large order suggests Apple is expecting the iPhone 8 to be a big seller. The number provided by sources to Nikkei also coincides with an estimate by IHS Markit analyst David Hsieh. "Apple has ordered 70 million units of OLED panels from Samsung this year, while Samsung is preparing to churn out as many as 95 million for Apple in 2017, in case demand exceeds expectations," he told Nikkei. "It is also possible that some of these 70 million handsets will not be shipped to customers this year and be carried over to next year depending on demand."

The majority of iPhone 8 devices may not be available until after the fourth quarter, Barclays analysts said in the note obtained by MacRumors.   iPhone 8 Rumors, Features And Price Apple is expected to release two LCD models along with the iPhone 8 this September. Nikkei’s sources said the OLED iPhone 8 will come with a 5.2-inch screen. Like previous rumors, the sources also said the device will come without a home button, however the other two LCD models will keep the home button. The sources said the iPhone 8 will come with a 3D-sensing front camera for facial recognition. Other reports suggest the 3D feature will allow for augmented reality and virtual reality capabilities. The iPhone 8 is expected to be priced at $1,000.

Apple has contributed 11 percent of the S&P 500's gains this year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst Howard Silverblatt. Specifically, the S&P 500 would be up less than 5 percent this year without the contribution from the tech giant. "It's going to run. It's going to continue to move higher," David Seaburg, head of sales trading at Cowen and Co., said Friday on CNBC's "Trading Nation," adding that analysts' numbers are generally too low, and he believes that expectations for the company will continue to be ramped up. Specifically, Seaburg pointed to the expected launch later this year of the new iPhone, and noting China's demand in particular is going to be "off the charts" for the new phone. "I think money can continue to gravitate into this stock, I think it's $155/ $160," he said Friday, adding too that he believes it is trading at a discount relative to the overall market. In terms of sentiment, investors have indeed become more bullish, said Stacey Gilbert, head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna. People have not stayed away from the stock because they think the runup is done, in Gilbert's eyes. "We continue to see positioning for the upside here. I think Apple's a pretty interesting name from just … the tech sector as a whole, that sentiment continues to be bullish," she said on "Trading Nation," adding that the potential for profit repatriation under the Trump administration would be a catalyst for more upside.

This time around, it's the Apple ID page in 10.3, which finally has a more cohesive settings page with access to everything from two-factor authentication to serial numbers on your other devices. Open up the Settings app and you'll immediately see your Apple ID information at the top of the screen. Tap that and you get access to a number of things related to iCloud, your ID and iTunes. Most of this stuff was included in previous versions of iOS, but it's all now accessible on one page. The first thing you can tap on is your name, phone numbers and email. You can also change your DOB and change your settings for different email newsletters if you're getting those. Next up is Password & Security, which used to be buried under a bunch of different pages. Here, you can turn on two-factor authentication, change your trusted phone numbers, and request verification codes to sign into your iCloud account on other devices. Previously, you'd have to tap Settings > iCloud > Apple ID > Password & Security to get to this page, which was cumbersome and awkwardly located. Now, it's super easy to get to. If you haven't turned on two-factor authentication, now is a really good time to do so. Apple Is Adding Two-Factor Authentication To iCloud.com Apple is bringing two-factor authentication to its iCloud.com website and apps, which should make use the web-based versions of its services more secure. Read more The Payment & Shipping section is exactly as you’d expect, as is the iTunes & App Store sections, but the iCloud menu is worth diving into. You’ll now get a nice visual breakdown of what’s taking up storage space in iCloud, and you can easily toggle what apps and services have access to iCloud syncing. This used to be hidden away under a separate iCloud Drive page, so it’s nice to have everything all in one place. Finally, at the bottom of the page you’ll find every other device signed in to your Apple ID, like Macs, Apple Watches or iPads. You can quickly get access to serial numbers, check if Find My Device is enabled, or even remove any old devices you no longer own. Of course, if there’s some device listed here that shouldn’t be, you can remove it, sign out of your account, and then pop back to the Password & Security page to change your password. None of this stuff is revolutionary, but it’s nice to finally have a single place to manage everything related to your Apple ID. Over the years, all of this stuff has bounced around to different oddball pages, or was tucked away in non-obvious places. WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

Search Reviews iPhone Android How To Reviews iPhone How To Auto About Best Best Weight Loss Apps Best iPhone 7 Cases Best Budget Apps Things Apple Watch Can Do Best Alexa Skills Android Galaxy S7 Best Samsung Galaxy S7 Cases Best Samsung Galaxy S7 Deals Best Galaxy S7 Battery Cases Best Galaxy S7 Screen Protectors Best Galaxy S7 Edge Screen Protectors Best Galaxy S7 Edge Cases Deals Best Android Smartphones Under $200 [2017] Best Cheap Android Smartphones [2017] 9 Things to Know About the iPhone 6s iOS 10.3 Update Adam Mills04/03/2017 The iPhone 6s iOS 10.3 update is a massive update for the former flagship and today we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone 6s users need to know about the current version of iOS 10. Earlier this year, Apple confirmed an iPhone 6s iOS 10.3 update with a release into its beta program for developers and the general public. In late March, Apple pulled the iOS 10.3 update from beta and released it for the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. iOS 10.3 is much bigger than its predecessor (iOS 10.2.1) and it’s an update you should have your eyes on as we cruise through the month. If you are coming to iOS 10.3 from the iPhone 6s iOS 10.2.1 update, your download will be substantial, several hundred megabytes. If you’re coming to it from something older than that, your iOS 10.3 update will be even larger thanks to the previous versions of iOS. They’re baked into iOS 10.3. Today we want to take a look at the most important things you need to know if you’re already on iOS 10.3 or if you’re thinking about installing the iOS 10.3 update on the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus. This roundup looks at the iPhone 6s iOS 10.3 update’s performance, the current state of iPhone 6s iOS 10.3 problems, and a quick glimpse at what’s next from Apple and iOS 10. iPhone 6s iOS 10.3 First Impressions   1 / 9 Before we get into the iPhone 6s iOS 10.3 update's performance, a quick note about the iOS 10.3 installation process.  The iOS 10.2.1 download/installation process took us about 17 minutes to complete. This is abnormally long and there's a chance your upgrade will take longer. (We came to iOS 10.3 directly from iOS 10.2.1.) We suggest putting 30 minutes of quiet time aside to monitor the download and the installation process for problems. We didn't run into any issues but there's always potential for trouble. We've been using the iPhone 6s iOS 10.3 update for a week now and the update is currently performing well on our iPhone 6s.  Battery life is holding up and we haven't seen any abnormal drain on the iPhone 6s model we're using to test the iOS 10.3 update. We're still able to get a full day of use when using a mixture of Wi-Fi and LTE.  If you recently installed iOS 10.3 and you're seeing abnormal battery drain issues, give it a couple of days. Sometimes it takes a few days for the battery to settle in. If the problems persist, you'll want to dig into some fixes. Connectivity remains stable as we push away from the update's release date. We've tested the phone and the update with several ISPs, routers and Bluetooth devices and we haven't noticed any major issues with our connections. They remain strong and fast. The iPhone 6s' UI is fast and we haven't experienced any lag, random reboots or freezes during our testing. The iOS 10.3 update feels stable and fluid. So far, the transition from iOS 10.2.1 to iOS 10.3 has been extremely smooth. We haven't run into any significant performance issues at the week milestone. The iOS 10.3 update is certainly worth a look if you're running into issues on an older version of iOS 10 or if you're concerned with your devices security. The iOS 10.2.1 update comes with a mind-boggling number of security patches. It also comes with some brand new features.  If you're coming from an older version of iOS, like iOS 9, you might want to snag a second opinion before installing the update on your device. For more, take a look at our reasons to and not to install iOS 10.3 today.   1 / 9
Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Business Image Source: Apple What happens when a small Apple supplier loses its contract Chris Mills @chrisfmills April 3rd, 2017 at 1:14 PM Share Tweet Until Monday morning, Imagination Technologies was a successful processor technology company going through a bit of a rough patch. The company designed some of the underlying architecture of chips that Apple uses in its iPhone range, and as a result, it earns royalty money from every iPhone sold. It’s a solid business model, so despite a downturn in iPhone 6s sales causing a cash shortage, Imagination was doing well. Emphasis on the “was.” Don't Miss: Apple’s working on a new TV service that might be unlike anything we’ve seen Early this morning, Imagination dropped a bombshell on its investors: Apple is planning a fundamental rebuild of the GPU used in the iPhone, to increase control over the design and to remove the need to pay Imagination royalties. As you can imagine, the result has been ruinous for Imagination. In the hours since the press release dropped, Imagination Technologies stock dropped by 65 percent, as investors bail out hard. It’s a hard result for Imagination: though Apple’s revenue does make up about half of Imagination’s revenue in total, the stock has dropped by more than half. The revenue for Apple relates to patents and designs that Imagination already owns, so the marginal costs required to earn that cash from Apple are minimal. Without the promise of future cheap revenue streams from Apple, Imagination’s core business is left looking a lot more tenuous. But before Imagination’s stock fully craters, it’s worth looking at the press release the company put out in greater detail. Imagination points out that it will be difficult to Apple to completely abandon the design and architecture that it pays Imagination for. Redesigning a new GPU may well reduce Apple’s reliance on Imagination’s design, but cutting out the company’s intellectual property altogether will be difficult. In a statement, Imagination described its reaction to Apple’s news: Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it. Further, Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple’s assertions. Apple’s notification has led Imagination to discuss with Apple potential alternative commercial arrangements for the current license and royalty agreement. That last line in particular raises the specter that this is just a bargaining move from Apple: announce it plans to sever ties entirely, watch Imagination’s investors freak out, and then offer the company a lifeline of reduced royalty payments.

After carefully considering an acquisition of longtime partner Imagination Technologies last year, the world’s largest publicly traded corporation went on an obviously related hiring spree, and now it’s all practically etched in stone. The “leading multimedia, processor and communications technology company” behind the PowerVR GPU family wants us to know Apple has been working on a “separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products”, aiming to reduce its “future reliance on Imagination’s technology.” Sounds like an unusual admission of imminent revenue loss, especially since the move is still 15 to 24 months away, but the point Imagination is trying to make is this won’t go down without a fight. Apple’s “assertions” that it will “no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information” are currently unsubstantiated by evidence, thus making the GPU veteran skeptical of Apple’s abilities to “design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights.” In a nutshell, Imagination thinks its technology might be unlawfully used by Apple’s in-house graphics processing unit for the iPhone… 9 (?), proposing “alternative commercial arrangements for the current license and royalty agreement.” Before any such deal is reached however, the company’s stock price has plummeted over 60 percent. Meanwhile, Apple continues to prove its ambition knows no bounds, having been in charge of A-series CPU designs for roughly seven years now. This is the logical next step, but it still takes guts and more money than we can wrap our heads around. Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Apple’s working on a new TV service that might be unlike anything we’ve seen Yoni Heisler @edibleapple April 3rd, 2017 at 8:53 AM Share Tweet I’ve been pretty critical of Apple’s efforts in the TV space, having previously called the company’s seemingly non-existent TV strategy aimless and backwards. And with good reason, nothing Apple has done to date suggests that the company truly understands what makes for a compelling TV viewing experience. Bizarrely, Apple still can’t seem to figure out if it wants to jump into the TV space head-first or simply leverage a few TV programs to bolster its Apple Music service. What’s more, Apple’s rumored TV subscription service remains nowhere to be seen. If you recall, Apple a few years ago was reportedly interested in rolling out a skinny bundle of cable TV channels at an affordable price. Ultimately, word surfaced that Apple couldn’t reach mutually agreeable pricing terms with content providers, thus nipping Apple’s streaming plans in the bud. All the while, Apple has already been beaten to the skinny bundle punch, first by DirecTV and soon by Hulu, Google, Comcast and even Verizon. That said, Apple might have a trick up its sleeve after all. Don't Miss: Samsung is spending $9 billion on the iPhone Not every TV streaming service is created equal, and a new report from Recode suggests that Apple may be working on a skinny bundle that could completely change the streaming landscape as we know it. Citing sources within the TV industry, the report relays that Apple is now interested in putting together a TV package that would include premium channels like HBO, Starz and Showtime within the same bundle. Here’s Apple’s latest proposal: It wants to sell consumers a premium TV bundle, which combines HBO, Showtime and Starz. Apple already sells each of those channels individually. But it has approached the three networks about rolling them up into a single package, as conventional pay TV operators sometimes do. If Apple can actually get this done at a reasonable price point, it would immediately set Apple’s mythical TV streaming service apart from the rest of the pack. Even if Apple prices its streaming service a tad higher than its competitors, the ability for users to instantly access premium shows from the likes of HBO and Showtime — while also receiving access to traditional cable channels like AMC, ESPN and Bravo — would be an immediate game changer. As it stands now, Apple already offers customers HBO, Showtime and Starz subscriptions for $15, $11 and $9, respectively. Presumably, a streaming package containing all three would fall somewhere in the $60 range, though it’s worth noting that Recode’s sources were unaware of Apple’s desired pricing plan. Previously, it was widely believed that Apple was aiming to introduce a skinny bundle with 25-30 channels in the $40/month range. All that said, there appears to be more life left in Apple’s TV plans than we would have otherwise imagined. Incidentally, Apple recently hired Shiva Rajaraman, formerly of YouTube, to help bolster the company’s video efforts.

Apple isn't done trying to sell you pay TV. From a report on Recode: Here's Apple's latest proposal: It wants to sell consumers a premium TV bundle, which combines HBO, Showtime and Starz. Apple already sells each of those channels individually. But it has approached the three networks about rolling them up into a single package, as conventional pay TV operators sometimes do. The difference: Traditional pay TV operators, like Charter, usually require consumers to subscribe to a basic level of TV channels before it will sell them a premium bundle. Apple could sell the bundle as standalone product, delivered via its iOS devices and its Apple TV settop box. Apple doesn't have a bundle deal in place with any of the premium networks, industry sources say. Apple currently sells HBO for $15 a month, Showtime for $11 a month, and Starz for $9 a month. apple movies tv ← You may like to read: → Computer Programmers May No Longer Be Eligible For H-1B Visas [Update] Apple Cites 'Courage' As Reason To Remove 3.5mm Headphone Jack China Threatens To Cut Sales of iPhones and US Cars if 'Naive' Trump Pursues Trade War Phil Schiller Says the MacBook Pro Doesn't Need an SD Card Slot Taking the Headphone Jack Off Phones Is User-Hostile and Stupid Thanks To Apple's Influence, You're Not Getting A Rifle Emoji Bidding Website Rentberry May Be the Startup of Your Nightmares Apple Wants To Sell Premium TV Channels in a Bundle More | Reply Login Apple Wants To Sell Premium TV Channels in a Bundle Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

Monday, April 3, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] Apple TV Penetration Hits 5% Ben Lovejoy: New data from comScore shows that 5% of all U.S. households with a WiFi connection now use Apple TV. Apple’s streaming TV box is the fourth most popular platform after Roku, Amazon’s fireTV and Google’s Chromecast. I’m still having regular problems simply playing video via Apple TV 3. It will take 45 minutes before a TV show is ready to play and sometimes stop loading entirely. This is exactly what I don’t want to deal with when relaxing for a few minutes before bed. An iPhone in the same room can play instantly. It can also AirPlay, albeit with an increasingly awkward interface, to the Apple TV. I always expected that it would be lack of content that might draw me away from Apple TV. As it happens, my content needs are pretty basic, I don’t want a streaming subscription, and I’m tempted to switch to something else because it simply doesn’t work reliably. Of course, I’ve now purchased lots of content and am locked in.

Chucky April 4, 2017 12:41 AM "I’m still having regular problems simply playing video via Apple TV 3. It will take 45 minutes before a TV show is ready to play and sometimes stop loading entirely." Huh. I wouldn't take an Apple TV if you gave me one for free for a variety of reasons, but this is one complaint I haven't heard before. Michael: you should buy a cheap Roku or Amazon stream stick. They're almost giving them away. That would be the method to troubleshoot if your issues are Apple TV specific, or related to your MSO.

Today, the leading tech support scam is known as the "Microsoft/Apple Scam," and Better Business Bureau Serving Central & South Alabama continues to receive calls from consumers who either received or fell victim to a scam. According to consumers, a "tech support specialist" calls claiming to be from Microsoft or Apple. The caller informs the consumer a virus has been detected on their computer and offers to remove it. The removal process involves gaining remote access to the computer or purchasing a bogus software license for hundreds of dollars. In an effort to solve the problem, consumers provide not only credit card numbers, but also personal information such as Social Security numbers and passwords. In a new twist, cyber criminals attempt to defraud individuals browsing the Internet who unknowingly click a link that produces a pop-up warning about a virus or data breach. The warning seems legitimate and provides a phone number for tech support. Once the consumer calls the "tech support company," they are asked to give up remote access to their device. Signs of a Tech Support Scammer: • They ask for remote access to your computer that once granted, allows them to make changes to your settings and steal your information. • Try to enroll you in worthless computer maintenance or warranty programs. • Ask for credit card information to bill you for phony services or services that are available for free. • Trick you into installing malware that allows them to steal sensitive information, like usernames and passwords. How to avoid tech support scams: • Hang up on unsolicited, third party calls claiming you have a computer virus. • Do not rely on caller ID to authenticate a caller. Remember, scammers can make any number or name appear on a caller ID, even if they are out of the country. • For tech support, verify a company's contact information at BBB.org or visit a known company's official website. • If you receive a pop-up, shut down your computer and take it to a reliable computer repair company.

Apr 3, 2017 - 8:20 PM Pedro Larena has today resigned from his cargo as CEO of Banco Popular, some six weeks after the arrival of Emilio Saracho as the president. The National Commission for Market Values have accepted his decision, made for ‘strictly personal reasons’. Banco Popular has included in its accounts for the first six months a series of adjustments in financial states with the result, an auditory has discovered insufficiencies in some provisions, and consider such adjustments would not have a significant effect on results – a missing 854 million € in promised adjustments. Apple has announced breaking links with their British provider of graphic processors, Imagination Technologies, between 15 and 24 months. After the announcement shares in Imagination Technologies fell by 71.7% on the LSM. The British tech firm is behind the designs of iPhones, iPads, iPods, TVs and Apple watches. Apple is the fourth shareholder in the British provider, and will now rely on a different graphic design partner. The challenge facing Apple regards patent infringement, of intellectual property and the confidential information supplied by Imagination Technologies. Renfe has put into action a plan to avoid the bankruptcy of Renfe Merchandise, their freight affiliate, a loss of 316 jobs (24% of the workforce) and a program of disinvestment by selling many freight wagons – for sale 66 locomotives (20% of the total) and 1,500 carriages, some 15% of the 10,000 currently, so detailed the general director of Renfe Merchandise, Abelardo Carrillo. The PP has rejected the new Contracts Law for the Public Sector, derived from European directress, includes clauses to penalise companies with offshore interests of who evade tax, as claimed by the opposition. They think the instructions from Europe for them to add their own social clauses to the many amendments which are being read in Congress. CCOO thinks the Government has squared their budgets ‘at the cost of pensioners, the unemployed and civil servants’. A claim that taxes are not going up, as ‘they have already done so in a regressive way’ and take no measures to counter inflation which the poorest suffer the most. The Bank of Spain has increased to 2.8% of GDP for this year – the entity forecasts unemployment will fall to 16.7% this year and to 13.9% at the end of 2019. Deficit objectives insisted by Brussels are still ignored. IBEX 35 closed down 1.32% to 10,325.30 FTSE 100 closed down 0.55% to 7,282.69 Euro / Dollar closed up 0.05% to 1.067 Comment Form is loading comments... advanced search Tweet Follow @typspan - About Us - Contact - Disclaimer - Privacy - Privacidad - Cookies - Rss - rate card   © 1999 - 2017 Howard John Brereton - No part of this site may be reproduced without written permission. -
Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple What happens when a small Apple supplier loses its contract Chris Mills BGR NewsApril 3, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Until Monday morning, Imagination Technologies was a successful processor technology company going through a bit of a rough patch. The company designed some of the underlying architecture of chips that Apple uses in its iPhone range, and as a result, it earns royalty money from every iPhone sold. It’s a solid business model, so despite a downturn in iPhone 6s sales causing a cash shortage, Imagination was doing well. Emphasis on the “was.” Don't Miss: Apple’s working on a new TV service that might be unlike anything we’ve seen Early this morning, Imagination dropped a bombshell on its investors: Apple is planning a fundamental rebuild of the GPU used in the iPhone, to increase control over the design and to remove the need to pay Imagination royalties. As you can imagine, the result has been ruinous for Imagination. In the hours since the press release dropped, Imagination Technologies stock dropped by 65 percent, as investors bail out hard. It’s a hard result for Imagination: though Apple’s revenue does make up about half of Imagination’s revenue in total, the stock has dropped by more than half. The revenue for Apple relates to patents and designs that Imagination already owns, so the marginal costs required to earn that cash from Apple are minimal. Without the promise of future cheap revenue streams from Apple, Imagination’s core business is left looking a lot more tenuous. But before Imagination’s stock fully craters, it’s worth looking at the press release the company put out in greater detail. Imagination points out that it will be difficult to Apple to completely abandon the design and architecture that it pays Imagination for. Redesigning a new GPU may well reduce Apple’s reliance on Imagination’s design, but cutting out the company’s intellectual property altogether will be difficult. In a statement, Imagination described its reaction to Apple’s news: Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it. Further, Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple’s assertions. Apple’s notification has led Imagination to discuss with Apple potential alternative commercial arrangements for the current license and royalty agreement. That last line in particular raises the specter that this is just a bargaining move from Apple: announce it plans to sever ties entirely, watch Imagination’s investors freak out, and then offer the company a lifeline of reduced royalty payments.

This time around, it’s the Apple ID page in 10.3, which finally has a more cohesive settings page with access to everything from two-factor authentication to serial numbers on your other devices. Advertisement Open up the Settings app and you’ll immediately see your Apple ID information at the top of the screen. Tap that and you get access to a number of things related to iCloud, your ID, iTunes, and more. Most of this stuff was included in previous versions of iOS, but it’s all now accessible on one page. The first thing you can tap on is your name, phone numbers, and email. You can also change your DOB and change your settings for different email newsletters if you’re getting those. Next up is Password & Security, which used to be buried under a bunch of different pages. Here, you can turn on two-factor authentication, change your trusted phone numbers, and request verification codes to sign into your iCloud account on other devices. Previously, you’d have to tap Settings > iCloud > Apple ID > Password & Security to get to this page, which was cumbersome and awkwardly located. Now, it’s super easy to get to. If you haven’t turned on two-factor authentication, now is a really good time to do so.

You’ll now get a nice visual breakdown of what’s taking up storage space in iCloud, and you can easily toggle what apps and services have access to iCloud syncing. This used to be hidden away under a separate iCloud Drive page, so it’s nice to have everything all in one place. Advertisement Finally, at the bottom of the page you’ll find every other device signed in to your Apple ID, like Macs, Apple Watches, or iPads. You can quickly get access to serial numbers, check if Find My Device is enabled, or even remove any old devices you no longer own. Of course, if there’s some device listed here that shouldn’t be, you can remove it, sign out of your account, and then pop back to the Password & Security page to change your password. None of this stuff is revolutionary, but it’s nice to finally have a single place to manage everything related to your Apple ID. Over the years, all of this stuff has bounced around to different oddball pages, or was tucked away in non-obvious places.

Here’s how   4 by Julie Cazzin March 28th, 2017 Online only.   4 Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Share LinkedIn Email Jared Ali AGE: 38 PLACE: Calgary TFSA TOTAL: $91,753.63 STRATEGY: Warren Buffet’s classic value style Me and my TFSA Jared Ali, a graphic designer in Calgary, is the first to admit he started investing in his TFSA rather late—2011 to be exact. That’s when his dad let him in on the great tax benefits of investing in a TFSA. “I didn’t understand its value as an investment vehicle for quite a while,” says Ali. “I had been investing in RRSPs for years but once my dad explained the tax benefits of TFSAs—that money invested in them can grow tax-free for life—I realized it was a no-brainer and opened one right away.” Ten TFSA questions answered » Right now, Jared has a self-directed TFSA worth an impressive $91,753.63 and for the last six years he’s had one strategy: copy Warren Buffett. “I wanted to find things that were undervalued and follow Buffett’s classic value style of investing. It’s worked for me as I’ve almost doubled my money in six years.” In fact, Jared invests by one of Buffett’s most popular mottos: “Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy only when others are fearful.” But Jared also likes the fact that Buffett favours investing in what he understands. “I remember this one particular story where Buffett was at a a Dairy Queen with his grandkids. Of course, everyone eats Dairy Queen ice-cream so he invested in the company. He also saw his grandkids and their friends with Apple iPhones so he invested in Apple. I think what I like best is the the way he takes into account the emotions of the consumer. That intrigues me.” Sign up for our Investing newsletter » Following Buffett’s lead, Jared’s himself bought Apple shares—10 to be exact—in April 2012 for $590 each, adjusted for the exchange rate and trading fees. He bought more Apple shares in 2013 and 2014, raising his position to 30 shares. (After a 7-for-1 stock split on June 2014 he held 210 shares). In October of that same year, he sold 105 shares for US$105, netting $12,215 total when converted back to Canadian dollars. “I still have 105 Apple shares in my TFSA today and plan to hold those indefinitely,” he says. Have a TFSA strategy to share? Click here to email us » For the last couple of years, Jared has focused his stock buying on what he believes to be undervalued oil and gas stocks. “I started buying Crescent Point Energy, Talisman Energy (before it was bought out by Repsol SA in early 2015) and Calfrac Well Services when oil was trading at around US$45 a barrel and dollar cost averaged several share purchases. I still hold shares in Calfrac and Crescent Point today,” he says. Why your TFSA needs a successor holder » He also bought 125 shares of Bristol Myers Squibb, a pharmaceutical company, last summer for US$60 a share after Opdivo, a promising cancer drug, failed in a key study as the company attempted to extend it’s usage for lung cancer patients. “It immediately fell US$10 a share after that announcement and I immediately bought 125 shares,” says Jared. “I invested US$7,509 at that time and it’s worth about the same today.” His last major holding is 138 shares in Icahn Enterprises, an American conglomerate. “It’s a multi-limited partnership and has a dividend yield of over 11%,” says Jared. Jared’s dream with his TFSA? “To buy a Ferrari. If I get my TFSA to $1 million, my wife may allow me to that. She’s the responsible one in the family, but I think I have a lot more fun.” JARED’S TFSA HOLDINGS CANADIAN HOLDINGS VALUE Calfrac Well Services $9,575.00 Crescent Point Energy $25,353.60 TD Investment Savings Account $17,449.00 Cash $34.19 Sub-total $52,411.79 U.S. HOLDINGS VALUE Apple $14,677.95 Bristol Myers Squibb 7,147.50 Icahn Enterprise 7,657.62 Cash 546.58 Sub-total $30,029.65 Total Portfolio Value* $91,753.63 * U.S. stock values were converted into Canadian dollars (exchange rate $1.31) Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Share LinkedIn Email Advertisement Advertisement    Show comments Hide comments (4) 4 comments on “When investing, copy what works” love this story, thank you for sharing his exact holdings! and the tfsa room calculator is great, haven’t seen one before! Reply ↓ Amy on March 29, 2017 at 8:38 am Check the return on apple over the last 5 years and it doesn’t even beat the s&p500…basically ties it (without being compensated for having a lot more risk ) Disappointing the article doesn’t mention the main reason why his TFSA is so high is because the CAD dollar dropped badly since 2012. (approx 33% currency boost gain + rising US stock market) For example, HXS, s&p500 in CAD including dividends, is up 144% over the last 5 years. Seems lucky he didn’t get burned with such lack of diversification. Alpha doesn’t come by believing in “Warren Buffett” , but his name does attract people to read. Reply ↓ Jungle on March 29, 2017 at 9:40 pm Hi Jungle, you’re absolutely correct that I did benefit from a devaluation of the CAD dollar, that was also a calculated move under the (correct) inference that the Canadian Dollar would not stay at or above parity forever. With respect to the “lack of diversification” that you mention, while correct for the time being, takes into account only the current holdings in the account… and not several of the others which were not disclosed to the author of the piece but still contributed to the gains, including FEN, LULU, RAD, POT, AMD and ERF. Although you don’t appear to be a fan of quotes from other successful businesspeople/investors, I’ll share one more with you… “Put all your eggs in one basket and then watch that basket”, from Andrew Carnegie. To that end, I’m not sure if you’ve been following the Great TFSA Race that MoneySense ran for the last couple years, but, if you had, you may have noticed that many of the other featured (and, far more successful investors) had achieved their success through the purchase of a SINGLE OTC stock or other extremely speculative investments… See below for links to those articles, for your reference. http://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/tfsa/1st-place-rick-maureen-1m/ http://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/tfsa/2nd-place-shafik-262000/ http://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/tfsa/3rd-place-philippe-100021/ http://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/tfsa/the-great-tfsa-race-penny-stock-investor/ Best of luck with growing your TFSA! Jared Reply ↓ Jared Ali on March 30, 2017 at 2:26 pm Only the Canadian stocks are tax free. You pay tax ( 10% ) on the U.S. stock dividend . Withholding tax.

This time, it comes with an extra detail: Apple reportedly wants to offer a premium bundle containing Showtime, HBO and Starz. Image source: Pixabay Apple may be trying to get together a premium TV bundle According to Recode, the iPhone maker is trying to put in place all of the pieces needed to offer such a streaming TV bundle. The technology website notes that the company already offers access to each of them individually. Now it adds that Apple has approached HBO, Showtime and Starz about combining them into one package similar to how traditional pay-TV providers have done for a long time but with one key difference. Traditional pay-TV providers such as Comcast or Charter typically require subscribers to pay for a base set of channels before they can purchase a bundle of premium TV networks including channels such as Showtime, HBO and Starz. However, according to Recode’s sources, Apple wants to sell the premium TV service bundle as a separate, standalone streaming offering. Subscribers could then view content from the three premium TV channels via their Apple TV set-top box, iPhone or iPad. Will Apple be successful? Apple has said publicly that it has ended its efforts to get together a streaming bundle of traditional channels, despite the success others such as DISH Network, AT&T, Google’s YouTube, Hulu and others have had in this area. Media chief Eddy Cue admitted that traditional TV channels aren’t willing to agree to the terms he wants in order to build a package, although that was after rumors suggested that very thing. The iPhone maker is known for its high margins secured through high prices, and it has squeezed third parties to secure its margins in the past. You may remember that Taylor Swift pulled her album 1989 from the company’s streaming music service two years ago. She was fighting back against the company’s decision to not pay artists during the three-month free trial it was offering subscribers when it launched the service. Apple capitulated to her demands quickly and agreed to pay artists during the free trial. Thus, it makes sense that traditional networks wouldn’t agree to whatever Apple was offering, even though they have struck deals with other streaming TV services. It might be easier to strike a deal with HBO, Showtime and Starz, however, since the company already sells streaming access to them individually. The only problem would be whether Apple wants too much and is willing to pay too little. Apple currently offers HBO’s streaming service for $15 per month, Showtime’s service for $11 per month, and access to Starz’s streaming offering for $9 per month. Recode said it’s unclear how much the iPhone maker might charge subscribers for a bundle containing all three streaming networks.

Such is the battle for S&P 500 leadership this year, where mega-cap technology has recently unseated the reflationary trade as the main driver behind the index’s 5.6 percent advance. But lost in the rotation is the stalwart of 2017, a company that sits up there with gains from Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc., and peddles in e-cigarettes over e-commerce. Philip Morris International Inc., the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company, emerged as the first quarter’s unsung hero. Its 3.3 percent contribution to S&P 500 gains makes it the fourth most important U.S. stock, right after shares that look more familiar to the leader board: Apple Inc., Amazon and Facebook. Philip Morris’s gains alongside Facebook comes as the cigarette maker moves to become more like a tech company itself. The New York-based tobacco giant says it’s shying away from combustible cigarettes in the hopes of creating a smokeless future. Its performance over the past two months show investors are keen on the plan, even though it could disturb a steady business with consistently paid dividends.  Shares of Philip Morris have advanced 23 percent in 2017, and are currently trading about 1 percent under an all-time high of $114.65 set March 21. “Both the business and the stock clearly have momentum behind them,” said Philip Gorham, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. “People are waking up to what a game-changer their heated tobacco product could be.” Questions over President Donald Trump’s ability to enact tax cuts at a time of heightened valuations caused equities to lose steam over the past month. Yet computer and software makers -- industries less susceptible to tax reform and rate changes -- returned as market leaders following their brief hiatus after the U.S. election. Active managers followed suit by taking bullish positions. In many ways, Philip Morris behaves a lot like those beloved tech stocks. Both the Nasdaq 100 and tobacco stocks are trading at record low realized volatility, data from Bloomberg show. At 27 percent, the cigarette-marker’s effective tax rate is within one percentage point of Apple. Its international reach also makes shares less susceptible to gyrations in the domestic economy. Though it may resemble a technology company, mutual-fund managers aren’t treating Philip Morris as such as shares stretch to lofty valuations. Although 31 percent of mutual funds analyzed by Bank of America Corp. hold Philip Morris, it misses the cut for the top five of most loved consumer staples stocks, according to research from the bank. “Managers increased their exposure in tech again this month, bringing its relative weight to the second-highest level in our data history,” Savita Subramanian, chief U.S. equity strategist at Bank of America Corp., wrote in a report last week. “In contrast, staples and utilities are currently at record underweights.” Philip Morris has spent more than $3 billion coming up with a portfolio of products it says are less harmful for consumers than cigarettes. That would mean trading out low-tech Marlboros for new innovation. Its biggest bet so far is a heat-not-burn gadget called IQOS. Though it’s not alone in its quest for a better-for-you tobacco product, Philip Morris is ahead of the game with the Food and Drug Administration. It’s submitted two applications with the federal agency -- one to get a modified-risk designation, and the other to get the product on the shelves with or without a less-risk label. That means that IQOS could be sold in the U.S. within the next year. “It is very early days but the success of their reduced risk products in overseas markets -- particularly Japan -- has been better than expected,” said Jack Russo, an analyst at Edward Jones. “So far the news has been positive.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Junko Yoshida 4/3/2017 01:51 PM EDT 2 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet MADISON, Wis. – Apple has notified Imagination Technologies Group, a key GPU core licenser to Apple for years, that it will no longer use Imagination’s intellectual property in new products. Imagination disclosed the Apple cutoff on Monday (April 3).  For the U.K.-based graphics IP firm, whose GPU core technologies have been intrinsic to Apple’s phones, tablets, iPods, TVs and watches, this is undoubtedly a devastating blow. However, members of the GPU community, who’ve been aware of Apple’s hiring binge on GPU talent, tend to regard this as an inevitable development.  Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research, noted that he does not think Imagination can continue as an independent company without Apple. “I expect it will be for sale, especially at the lower stock price.” Imagination’s struggle has been publicly known for some time. Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research added, “Imagination has been losing design wins to ARM and Vivante, and the acquisition of MIPS has not helped the company. Like MIPS, the competition in GPUs became more competitive and the company became complacent.” Legal battle emerging? When Imagination made the announcement Monday, the graphics core licensor framed the news as “Discussions with Apple regarding license agreement.” Imagination said Apple's notification had triggered talks on alternative commercial arrangements for the current license and royalty agreement.  In its press release, Imagination quoted Apple, saying that [Apple] “has been working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination’s technology.” Imagination, however, also made it clear that it is “extremely challenging for Apple to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics” without violating Imagination's patents, intellectual property and confidential information. In other words, there might be a legal battle ahead. Tirias Research’s Krewell agreed. “I do expect Imagination will look for legal remedies and I agree it's very difficult to build a new GPU without infringing on patents held by Imagination.” He speculated, “This could be the start of negotiation between Apple and Imagination for how much Imagination's IP is worth.” He added, “Most power and memory bandwidth sensitive mobile GPU use tile-based, deferred rendering and Imagination has some patents, but so do AMD, ARM, and NVIDIA.” “This has been a long time coming,” Krewell said. Because GPUs are abstracted by API like DirectX, OpenGL, and Vulkan, “one GPU can be replaced with a functionally equivalent GPU,” Krewell said. “It happens in PCs all the time.” He added, however, the GPU inside an SoC is harder to replace. That doesn’t mean it can’t be done, though. "Vendors like Samsung and MediaTek have used both ARM's Mali with Imagination PowerVR," he noted. Apple's modifying Power VR IP It's been rumored that Apple has been developing internal graphics technology for many years.  Krewell said, “It's believed that the GPU in Apple’s A series of SoC processor have been using Apple designed logic in the GPU building on, but modifying, PowerVR IP.” In his view, “Apple may have reached the point where it can replace even the basic PowerVR IP with its own designs.” David Kanter, president of Real World Technologies, first published last October his own analysis entitled "A Look Inside Apple’s Custom GPU for the iPhone." In that piece, Kantor wrote: After years of recruiting graphics architects, Apple has designed its own custom GPU, which is already shipping in the A8, A9, and A10 processors that power the iPhone 6, 6S, and 7. The GPU in Apple’s processors still retains some fixed-function hardware from PowerVR, but based on publicly available evidence it is clear that the shader core in Apple’s GPU is architecturally very different from Imagination Technologies PowerVR line. This further implies that Apple wrote its own Metal and OpenGL ES compiler for its GPUs and almost certainly wrote the entire driver as well. Next page: Smoking gun?

With Apple’s iOS 10.3 release we saw a lack of support for 32-bit devices, but that’s changed with today’s update. iOS 10.3.1 brings back support for 32-bit devices and is available for the iPhone 5 and 5c. Release notes for this particular update are light, only noting bug fixes and security improvements. Today’s update follows Apple’s release of iOS 10.3.2 beta 1 last week for developers. As some readers had pointed out at the time, it appeared Apple had skipped 10.3.1 and went straight for 10.3.2. Apple’s developer site also lists 32-bit devices, like the iPhone 5 and 5c as available to receive today’s update as well. iOS 10.3.1 includes a Wi-Fi vulnerability fix discovered by Google’s Project Zero: Wi-Fi Available for: iPhone 5 and later, iPad 4th generation and later, iPod touch 6th generation and later Impact: An attacker within range may be able to execute arbitrary code on the Wi-Fi chip Description: A stack buffer overflow was addressed through improved input validation.

Imagination is Apple’s biggest customer, and has had a contractual agreement with the iPhone maker since the firm first launched the iPod in the early 2000s. Company officials stated Apple notified it they would be terminating their partnership within 15 months to two years time, Reuters reports. The news sent shares in Imagination down by as much as 72 percent Monday, causing the firm to be worth nearly $600 million less than it was Friday afternoon. Apple is reportedly in the process of developing its own graphics chips, which, if perfected, would make Imagination’s services superfluous to the company. Unhappy with Apple’s decision, Imagination expects to fight the move in court, raising questions as to whether Apple could develop its own operation without violating one of Imagination’s patents. “Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information,” Imagination said in a statement. The company’s chief executive also raised doubts about Apple’s ability to carry on the production of its devices without Imagination’s proprietary technology. “ “It would be extremely challenging for Apple to design a brand new GPU (graphics processor unit) architecture from basics, that is, without infringing our IP rights and also infringing our confidential information,” Imagination Chief Executive Andrew Heath told reporters. Monday’s incredible blow to its stock value comes after March raised expectations for the company, after it revealed new technologies that could be used in smart cars, virtual realty devices and smartphones.

Name: Subject: Message: 5 things Android Wear can learn from the Apple Watch Featuresby Dane O'Leary13 hours ago 20 210 9 While Android and iOS continue to be embroiled in the battle for smartphone OS supremacy, there’s another war that’s waging in the shadows: the War of the Wearables. Of course, calling it a war might be overkill, since overall wearable sales have been in a decline. Then again, there were 6 million Apple Watches sold during Q4 of 2016, which is a year-over-year increase of 12 percent. To put that into perspective, there were a total of 9 million smartwatches sold during that time, so Apple’s acclaimed wearable accounted for more than 60 percent of all smartwatch sales. In case that’s not clear, Apple Watch has been the top-selling smartwatch since its debut in 2014. Market data reveals that there are many more iPhone users buying the Apple Watch than there are Android users buying Android Wear smartwatches.   As for smartphones, Android has roughly an 82 percent market share while iOS accounts for 18 percent of the smartphone market. This disparity shouldn’t be that surprising since there are more than 24,000 different Android devices on the market while iOS is found only on iPhones. However, Android Wear sales are only a fraction of the sales of Apple Watch. To be clear, this means there are many more iPhone users buying the Apple Watch than there are Android users buying Android Wear smartwatches. (And Android Wear smartwatches are typically cross-compatible, too!) It boils down to this: Even though wearables haven’t gained the popularity many OEMs had hoped, sales show that the Apple Watch’s reception has been considerably more positive than Android Wear devices. So what can Android Wear learn from Apple Watch to be a greater success? The Apple advantage One of Apple’s greatest advantages is that the company controls both its devices’ hardware and software. In fact, this is why Apple devices are usually industry-leading performers despite technically having lesser specs than competing Android smartphones. Even if you’re not a fan of Apple products, it’s hard not to have respect for them. When a company can marry each meticulously-written line of code to very deliberately-chosen hardware, you end up with a device that’s truly remarkable. Until recently, Google software was found only on third-party hardware. Then Google introduced the Pixel smartphones (as well as wireless routers, a speaker equipped with a new voice assistant, and a Chromecast with 4K) last year; however, the company has never released its own Android Wear smartwatch on which Google’s wearable OS could run. To date, the only smartwatches running Android Wear are made by third-party companies like LG, Huawei, and Lenovorola,which has surely contributed to the luke-warm sales of Android Wear smartwatches compared to those made by Apple. See also: Google delays Android Wear 2.0 update rollout for most smartwatches 5 days ago Having so many different companies making Android Wear smartwatches ensures variety, but it can easily be overwhelming, especially for a first-timer. Here’s an example: Billy decides he wants an Android Wear smartwatch after seeing Bob using Android Wear’s mobile payment function to pay for his lunch. Although he’s not super familiar with wearables, Billy figures he’ll head over to Best Buy and pick up one of the latest Android Wear smartwatches. A few days later, Billy is at the pharmacy trying to use his LG Style at the checkout counter and realizes that his brand new Android Wear smartwatch doesn’t actually support mobile payments. How can that be? If Google made its own wearable hardware, not only would Android Wear devices be much stronger performers, it would make the wearable market seem much less “inside baseball”, so to speak. Most consumers would expect Google-made smartwatches to offer just about every possible Android Wear feature; meanwhile, many third-party smartwatches fail to take full advantage of all the features Android Wear has to offer. In other words, it’s the third-party manufacturers that are compromising the Android Wear experience. And just like many consider the Pixel smartphones to offer the best Android experience, many of us would be inclined to prefer Android Wear devices made in-house by Google to those made by virtually any other company. More fluidity in the UI For first-time smartwatch users, neither Android Wear nor watchOS are as intuitive as they could be, with both involving somewhat of a learning curve. Of course, once you’ve learned the interface, it’s a matter of preference as to whether you think Android Wear or watchOS is a better experience. Having said that, there’s a certain je ne sais pais the Apple Watch has that’s distinctly lacking on Android Wear. There’s not a singular word for it, but when you use the two wearable platforms side-by-side, you start to get a feel for what has made the Apple Watch so popular. Much like iOS, Apple’s watchOS is very fluid and elegant. Once you get past the learning curve, navigating the platform feels very intuitive and functional, but without sacrificing form. By comparison, the appearance of Android Wear — while very Material Design-esque and ‘current’ in the Android world — feels like it’ll look dated much sooner than the UI of watchOS. Apple's watchOS is very fluid and elegant. By comparison, the appearance of Android Wear feels like it’ll look dated much sooner than the UI of watchOS. Not-so-elegant notifications Speaking of the Android Wear design language, the card-based setup — which is obviously a call to the notification cards you see in Android — doesn’t really translate to a wearable platform. Although notifications are more fleshed-out in Android Wear than in watchOS, as you’re swiping through notification cards, you can’t help but feel like it’s taking you way too many swipes to find the information you’re looking for. There’s no intuitive way to isolate the notification or function you need without being forced to sift through other notifications or functions to find it. An appropriate analogy is that it feels like you’re panning for gold, waiting for all the dirt to fall away and reveal what it was you’d wanted to find. Consequently, you feel like you’d wasted a lot of time while navigating notifications on Android Wear. Depending on how you look at it, notifications on the Apple Watch may not seem all that different from Android Wear, but when you consider it from a practical perspective, the difference is more noticeable. On Android Wear, notifications are individual cards and each card must be swiped before you can access the next one. The Apple Watch’s notifications are much sleeker and more intuitive, putting your notifications into a single feed that you can navigate by rotating the crown on the side of the watch like a dial. This allows you to click onto only the notifications you want rather than having to sift through them like you’re cutting your watch out of a jungle with a machete. Again, it’s a small difference, but arguably a significant one. Hardware controls Although this seems to be changing with LG’s latest Android Wear devices, the vast majority of previous Android wearables had software-only controls. Of course, this isn’t necessarily a problem, especially if you’re someone who prefers tapping and swiping to physical buttons and knobs; however, the so-called ‘Digital Crown’ on the Apple Watch can be rotated like a dial, allowing users to navigate many areas of watchOS without having to rely on touching and swiping and, consequently, covering up the display. Again, it’s a matter of preference, but Apple Watch at least offers a choice between software and hardware controls. Plus, if you’ve ever used an Apple Watch, you’ll know that the crown has a really great feel to it and adds to both the high-end look and feel of Apple wearables. Hardware controls allow users to navigate the user interface without having to rely on touching and swiping and, consequently, covering up the display. Unapologetically smart Take some of the most recent Android Wear smartwatches — i.e., the LG Watch Style, the LG Watch Sport, the Huawei Watch 2 — and put them next to the Apple Watch 2. What do you notice? If your answer was that the Android Wear watches seem to be trying to masquerade as regular watches while the Apple Watch is unapologetically smart, you hit the nail on the proverbial head. One of the things that makes the Apple Watch great is that it embraces its smartness, which has to have been a contributor to its success; it doesn’t provoke comparisons because it’s not trying to be something it’s not. Meanwhile, you can’t help but to compare Android Wear watches to regular non-smart watches because they’re essentially trying to be conventional watches that offer smartwatch features. On the one hand, the fact that most Android Wear devices look like regular wristwatches helps them to blend in and not stick out like Apple Watches tend to do. On the other hand, it also invites comparison and makes you more aware of the additional weight, the bulk, the fact that you have to keep them charged, and so on. In a way, it’s like Android Wear holds itself back by trying to stay within the confines of convention while the Apple Watch isn’t afraid to be something totally different. Up next: Best smartwatches (March 2017) 3 weeks ago Notice that many of the lessons Android Wear can learn from the Apple Watch are conceptual rather than functional. When it comes down to it, the latest iterations of both watchOS and Android Wear share many of the same key features, including mobile payments, third-party apps, changeable bands and watchfaces, fitness capabilities, ad infinitum. However, the fact that the Apple Watch has been selling exponentially better than all Android Wear devices combined is telling, especially considering that there are far more Android users than iOS users these days. But these moderate course-corrections could make a significant difference to the usability, experience, and sales of Android Wear. What do you think about Android Wear? Are you on board with Google wearables? Do you think that Google smartwatches have a lot to learn from the Apple Watch or are both platforms already equal in your eyes?

A new report from the consumer watchdog pulled figures from lab tests of the battery life of some 67 laptops put through their paces since the beginning of 2016. The report by Which found some pretty big discrepancies between the makers’ claimed battery longevity, and how long the device managed to last for in its own tests, with the biggest differences coming from HP and Dell machines. HP laptops – of which 12 were tested – had an average claimed battery life of 9 hours 48 minutes, but in Which’s real-world testing, these portables averaged 5 hours 2 minutes. That’s not much more than half of the manufacturer’s estimation. With Dell, across 10 laptops, the average claimed life was 9 hours 15 minutes, with Which finding it to be 5 hours 12 minutes. Toshiba’s average claimed life (for 6 machines) was 7 hours 58 minutes, with the test results showing 4 hours 45 minutes. Some other notebook makers were a bit closer to the mark, but still adrift, with Asus having a claimed average of 10 hours 12 minutes, compared to a result of 6 hours 53 minutes (over 8 notebooks). Also across 8 machines, Acer had an average claimed life of 7 hours 53 minutes, compared to a test result of 5 hours 59 minutes. And for Lenovo over 20 laptops, claimed life was an average of 6 hours 41 minutes, compared to 4 hours 34 minutes. So those were closer to the mark, particularly in the case of Acer – but still considerably behind manufacturer estimations. Only Apple came out of this benchmarking with its head held high, because the three MacBooks tested had an average claimed life of 10 hours, yet managed to last longer than this, hitting 10 hours 15 minutes. Which doesn’t mention whether one of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models was included here, which would have been interesting to know given the battery life complaints of recent times. Check out the best laptop deals for April 2017 Testing times You may, quite rightly, be wondering exactly how Which tests battery life. The watchdog explains that it performs two main tests during the evaluation of laptops, and runs them at least three times, draining the entire battery in the course of both tests. One test involves browsing websites over Wi-Fi, and the other watching a movie until the battery gives out. However, Which doesn’t clarify considerations such as what the screen brightness is set at, or indeed in the movie test, whether that’s a streamed film from YouTube, for example, or a USB drive (presumably it’s not a movie played off a disc, as not every notebook has an optical drive).  The watchdog says: “We believe that that these tests are representative of the real world use that a laptop would get.” Clearly, though, whatever the exact details of the above tests, it’s still interesting to see the relative results, and it's quite an eye-opener as to how exaggerated some manufacturer claims appear to be. And indeed, how well Apple does compared to Windows notebooks. There was also an in-depth look at a few highlights of individual results, with the likes of the Lenovo Yoga 510 falling way, way short of its claimed battery life of 5 hours – only managing 2 hours 7 minutes, in fact. Some of the notebook makers were, of course, quick to point out that gauging battery life is a tricky matter depending on the exact usage of the laptop. As Dell told the consumer watchdog: “Every individual uses their PC differently – it’s similar to how different people driving the same car will get different gas mileage depending on how they drive.” Incidentally, if you want to maximize the battery longevity of your laptop, check out our guide here.

The news was revealed in a quite venomous statement from Imagination Technologies, the company whose chips Apple is using right now. From the statement: Apple has used Imagination's technology and intellectual property for many years. It has formed the basis of Graphics Processor Units ("GPUs") in Apple's phones, tablets, iPods, TVs and watches. Apple has asserted that it has been working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination's technology. As a result of the news, Imagination's shares fell 70 percent, because Apple is by far Imagination's largest customer, accounting for about half of its revenue. Imagination's statement then proceeds to almost but not quite (yet) threaten Apple with patent litigation. Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination's patents, intellectual property and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it. Further, Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple's assertions. Of note here is that in the past 18 months or so, various high-level Imagination employees joined Apple.

(Which?) While Lenovo claims its Yoga 510 offers up to five hours of battery life, Which? says it only delivered two hours and seven minutes in tests. The Acer E15, which is claimed to offer six hours, was good for just two hours and 56 minutes in Which?’s tests. However, the MacBook Pro 13 kept running for 12 hours in tests, despite Apple giving it a claimed battery life figure of 10 hours. “As the figures we arrived at are often drastically different to the manufacturer claims, we have to wonder how their own estimates are arrived at,” Which? said. Read more Google Chrome update promises to save your laptop's battery life Manufacturers tend to base battery life estimates on testing undertaken in optimum conditions, rather than real-world use. Dell, which was found to be one of the worst offenders, has defended its claims, telling Which?, “It’s difficult to give a specific battery life expectation that will directly correlate to all customer usage behaviours because every individual uses their PC differently – it’s similar to how different people driving the same car will get different gas mileage depending on how they drive.” HP, which was also found to be greatly exaggerating battery life, said its tests use ”real life scripts” and run on “real applications like Microsoft Office”, adding that specifications, such as screen resolution, impact results.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Inside every iPhone and iPad are dozens of small components made by suppliers whose businesses are tied to Apple Inc. As Imagination Technologies Group Plc has now learned, it’s lucrative to be a favourite Apple supplier — until you’re not. Apple notified Imagination that it will no longer be using the British company’s graphics technology within the next two years. The news Monday sent Imagination’s shares down as much as 72 per cent. Apple is Imagination’s largest customer, providing just over half its revenue. Just as a household product’s success can be determined by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the fate of component suppliers around the world are often based on the product decisions of Apple engineers and executives. With about 211.9 million iPhones sold last year, Apple’s scale gives it considerable leverage over suppliers. Sixteen companies receive at least half their revenue from Apple, including Cirrus Logic Inc and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Related Apple Inc unveils new iPad with lowest price ever, red iPhone 7 and new social app Clips After acquiring several firms and new talent, Apple Inc may be looking to bring augmented reality to the masses Imagination has long been one of Apple’s closest suppliers. Its graphics technology has been inside every iPhone and iPad released, allowing for things such as playing games. In 2008, Apple began building what’s now an 8 per cent stake in Imagination.  The partnership has been a financial boon for the chip supplier, whose revenue has more than tripled since the iPhone was first released in 2007. Imagination even has an office near Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California, so its engineers can work more closely with Apple. The two companies held talks last year about combining, but a deal the didn’t come together. Apple has recently hired several people from Imagination, including former chief operating officer John Metcalfe as a senior director based in London. Now Imagination says Apple plans to make the graphics technology on its own. The U.K. company said it was negotiating with Apple, but Imagination’s stock still collapsed. Neil Campling, head of technology research at Northern Trust Securities, said Imagination is now “uninvestable.” Roger Phillips, an analyst at Investec Ltd., said it was Imagination’s “biggest risk realized.” The news spooked investors of other Apple suppliers. Dialog Semiconductor Plc., a U.K.-based chipmaker that gets about 69 per cent of its sales from Apple, fell as much as 4.4 per cent Monday, the most since December, according to data from Bloomberg. Apple has a history of being touchy with suppliers. In one current spat, Apple has sued chip supplier Qualcomm Inc. over the royalty it pays for cellular technologies used in modems for the iPhone and iPad. Apple and Samsung Electronics Co., which is a supplier for Apple in addition to being its biggest competitor, were entangled in patent lawsuits for years.  Other suppliers such as touch-screen maker TPK Holdings and audio-component maker Audience have also seen their stocks whipsaw based on orders from Apple. GT Advanced Technologies, which Apple hired to make a new kind of screen glass, filed for bankruptcy after Apple abandoned the project. “It is both a boon and a bane to have Apple as a customer,” said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research.

According to Apple's release notes, iOS 10.3.1 includes bug fixes and improves the security of your iPhone or iPad, and a security document suggests it fixes a Wi-Fi-related vulnerability. The release notes do not go into more detail about what bug fixes might be bundled into this release, so we'll update this post if and when we learn more about the content of the iOS 10.3.1 update.

Rating: 19 Votes LosLoco 14 hours ago at 10:21 am Don't count on it. These are minor bug fixes, only 25MB, hardly enough to fix a battery issue if there was one. Its also possible you just had a bad install. I have had zero issues with battery life on 10.3 on my 7Plus or Air 2. Well, a battery issue could potentially be fixed with an update in only a few kilobytes, if the issue is a question of a coding error... Rating: 11 Votes Mlrollin91 14 hours ago at 10:14 am I'm concerned in updating because I saw an article saying that 10.3.2 will remove support for 32 bit apps. Are 32 bit apps working in 10.3.1? I may be forced to upgrade to an iPhone 7 now just so I can remain on 10.3.0. I have some 32 bit apps that are a must because I live in a remote area without internet and my apps allow me to download Apple updates onto the phone first and then transfer them to the computer via iTunes. I mean its only a matter of time until 32bit was no longer going to be supported. It was believed it was going to be iOS 11, but I guess Apple wanted to get it done with sooner. Eventually you will have to upgrade your OS or your device so you will lose access to those apps. I have plenty of 32bit apps as well, but unless the developer decides to update them, we are stuck. I will be updating to 10.3.2 though. Coming from an android device (S7 edge) this is cray cray. So many updates and they are available instantly! Welcome to iOS. Apple cares about security!

ADVERTISE SUBSCRIBE CONTACT ABOUT COMPANIES Imagination Technologies shares freefall by 70pc after Apple cuts ties by Colm Gorey 54 minutes ago Apple logo. Image: r.classen/Shutterstock Following the news that Apple will no longer use GPUs from Imagination Technologies in its iPhones, the UK company is now seen as ‘uninvestable’. When you are particularly reliant on the whims of one customer – perhaps the largest in the world – then that customer’s decision to cut all ties with you can be devastating. This appears to be the situation for UK semiconductor business Imagination, which has revealed that Apple is cutting ties in a move to develop its own graphics processing units (GPU). Believes patent infringement will occur Imagination has said that any new devices Apple brings out will not be covered by existing licensing and royalty agreements, meaning a significant loss in revenue for the company. “Apple has asserted that it has been working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products, and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination’s technology,” Imagination said in a statement. It appears as if the split between the two has not been amicable. The statement goes on to say that “Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology”, alleging that infringements of patents, intellectual property and confidential information are likely. “Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple’s assertions,” it said. Not wanting to cut all ties with its biggest customer, however, Imagination has said it will look to discuss “potential alternative customer arrangements” for its existing loyalty agreement, which expires in two years. Imagination’s share price shows a noticable freefall. Image: Google ‘We view Imagination as now uninvestable’ Regardless, the damage to Imagination has been considerable, with the company’s share price plummeting by as much as 70pc following the news. Speaking with Forbes, Northern Trust Securities analyst Neil Campling revealed the extent of the damage from an investor’s perspective. “We view Imagination as now uninvestable. This is what we would describe as a black swan moment for the company and investors in Imagination.” Until today’s announcement, the company had seen its stock climb by as much as 400pc since 2009, as the iPhone’s power on the market grew exponentially. With around half of its revenue coming from Apple, Imagination has seen its value cut from $1bn to $360m in the space of a week. Apple logo.

The British company, which makes money from selling licenses to patents and designs for graphics cards, counts Apple as its largest customer. Imagination Technologies isn't alone: There are dozens of companies that get 20 percent or more of their revenue from Apple, according to FactSet.

But longer term, the chip industry in particular may have to compete with Apple's piles of cash. Apple now does "much more in-house development of some fundamental technologies than ... a few years ago," especially processors and sensors, the tech giant's chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, said earlier this year at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference in San Francisco. Even a big supplier, Qualcomm, has faced the wrath of Apple's chip crusade. Apple has waged a $1 billion legal battle, alleging the company has unfairly charged high chip royalties. SoftBank — a company with deep Apple ties — also agreed to buy leading chip designer ARM last year. Not to mention Apple's staffing up: It hired Imagination Technologies' chief operating officer last year, according to Business Insider. Apple spent more than $10 billion on research and development in 2016, up from $8.07 billion in 2015 and $6.04 billion in 2014. That means that the company spent 5 percent of its total net sales on research last year, up from 3 percent in the prior two years. "It's very important for us because we can push the envelope on innovation, we can better control timing, cost, quality. We look at that as a great strategic investment," Maestri said at the conference.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS US Edition Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides Samsung Galaxy S8 iPhone 8 LG G6 Nintendo Switch Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus VPN News The best SIM-free phone deals in April 2017 The best SIM-free phone deals in April 2017 By TechRadar deals Mobile phones   The best prices for SIM-free phones available to buy today Shares  If you’re looking to buy a SIM-free phone you’ve come to the right place! Our price comparison engine checks the prices for all these phones several times a day and lists them all cheapest-first so you can be sure we’re always linking you to the best prices! SIM-free phones have become increasingly popular in the last few years. When big phones like the iPhone 7 or Samsung Galaxy S8 go on sale, they’re usually very expensive. So expensive, in fact, that it's usually cheaper to buy the phones SIM-free and pair them with a SIM-only deal from one of the networks. What’s more, mobile phones are a lot better than they used to be and that means people are hanging on to their phones beyond the traditional 24 month contract. Many people pair their existing phones with a SIM-only deal once their contract expires and that gets them out of that two-year cycle of perpetually signing new phone contracts. Once you’re out of the cycle, getting a SIM-free phone and not signing long contracts is, for many people, a more enticing option.  On this page we’re listing the best SIM-free phone deals for all of the world’s best phones. We’ve also got the best prices for some of the budget favourites like the Moto G. 1. Moto G4 Probably the best 'cheap Android phone' out there right now Weight: 155g | Dimensions: 153 x 76.6 x 9.8mm | OS: Android 6 Marshmallow | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: Snapdragon 617 | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 16GB/32GB | Battery: 3000mAh | Rear camera: 13MP | Front camera: 5MP Brilliant phone at a great price Strong screen and camera Looks more expensive Lacks the power of pricier phones For less than £150 you can grab yourself the Motorola Moto G4 which is a brilliant budget Android SIM-free phone. In many ways it makes a mockery of the prices that the other phones go for. It lacks the stunning build quality of a Samsung or an iPhone but it gets most of the way there and for a price that will have many people doing a double-take. One thing to note - the Moto G5 is now out and our review will be here very soon so this phone might soon be replaced on this list! 2. Moto G4 Plus A superb cheap Android phone with a brilliant camera Weight: 155g | Dimensions: 153 x 76.6 x 9.8mm | OS: Android 6 Marshmallow | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: Snapdragon 617 | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 16GB/32GB | Battery: 3000mAh | Rear camera: 16MP | Front camera: 5MP Better camera than G4 Fantastic value for money Decent screen Not the most powerful The Moto G4 Plus is very very similar to the Moto G4. It's the same size, has the same internals and has the same screen. What sets it apart is it's superb camera that beats out any other cheap smartphone. It's a good step up from the Moto G4 and thus if you take a lot of photos with your phone, the G4 Plus is probably worth the extra cost - generally it only costs about £50 more which is worth it if you ask us. 3. iPhone SE The 'cheap iPhone' option is a good bet if you want Apple on a budget Weight: 143g | Dimensions: 123.8 x 58.6 x 7.6mm | OS: iOS 10 | Screen size: 4-inch | Resolution: 640 x 1136 | CPU: Apple A9 | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 16/64GB | Battery: 1624mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 1.2MP Cheap for an iPhone Simple to use Just like the iPhone 5S but better Lacks top features If you want a cheap iPhone then the iPhone SE is the best SIM-free phone to go for at the moment. It is not as powerful compared to the iPhone 6S or iPhone 7 but it is a step up from the iPhone 5S and crucially retains the 5S' size and shape which is ideal for anyone who wants an iPhone but doesn't want a phone with a massive screen. 4. OnePlus 3T A top smartphone for those that want the best on a budget Weight: 158g | Dimensions: 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.4 mm | OS: Android Marshmallow | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: Snapdragon 821 | RAM: 6GB | Storage: 64GB/128GB | Battery: 3400mAh | Rear camera: 16MP | Front camera: 16MP Premium phone design Good battery life No microSD slot Camera not the best If you're after a high-end Android handset but don't quite want to pay high-end prices, the OnePlus 3T is the phone for you. It's got everything - stunning AMOLED 5.5-inch screen, fingerprint scanner, excellent battery life and lots more. And the best bit is that it costs a lot less than the equivalent phones from the bigger brands. 5. Samsung Galaxy S7 Last year's Samsung flagship is still a brilliant phone in every way Weight: 152g | Dimensions: 142.4 x 69.6 x 7.9 mm | OS: Android Marshmallow | Screen size: 5.1-inch | Resolution: 1440 x 2560 | CPU: Exynos 8890 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32GB/64GB | Battery: 3000mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 5MP Brilliant design Lovely screen and lots of power Attracts fingerprints The Samsung Galaxy S7 phones sit at the pinnacle of the smartphone world right now - they're the best selling Android handsets out there. The S7 is very similar to the S7 Edge (below), containing most of the same components. The main difference is a slightly smaller screen that's flat rather than curved. It sat at number 2 in TechRadar's best phones ranking for a year so yeah, it's brilliant. In terms of outright value for money, the S7 is probably the better option. 6. LG G5 A cheap SIM-free phone that matches more expensive options Weight: 159g | Dimensions: 149.4 x 73.9 x 7.7 mm | OS: Android Marshmallow | Screen size: 5.3-inch | Resolution: 2560 x 1440 | CPU: value | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32GB | Battery: 2800mAh | Rear camera: 16MP | Front camera: 8MP Great performance Cheap price Decent wide angle camera Battery could be better LG phones have been very strong for the last couple of years. The LG G5 is only a year old but the SIM-free price has already dropped quite considerably which makes it a great option for a SIM-free phone purchase. It's got a great screen, a dual-camera and many other features that cheap phones don't usually have. A great option. 7. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge A stunning phone with a great screen and superb camera Weight: 157g | Dimensions: 150.9 x 72.6 x 7.7 mm | OS: Android Marshmallow | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1440 x 2560 | CPU: Exynos 8890 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32GB/64GB | Battery: 3600mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 5MP Beautiful screen Super camera Slight plastic feel More expensive than the S7 The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is a brilliant phone and one that should sit near the top of your wishlist if you're after a superb Android phone with all the trimmings. It has sat at the top of TechRadar's best phones ranking from the moment it hit our review benches. With a best-in-class screen, powerful components plus everything that Android offers it also has a layer of Samsung cleverness that puts it above all other Android smartphones. 8. Huawei Honor 8 An extraordinarily shiny Android phone that’s extra ordinary Weight: 153g | Dimensions: 145.5 x 71 x 7.5 mm | OS: Android Nougat | Screen size: 5.2-inch | Resolution: 1920 x 1080 | CPU: Kirin 950 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32/64GB | Battery: 3,000mAh | Rear camera: Dual 12 MP | Front camera: 8MP Alluring reflective glass design Neat fingerprint sensor gestures Illogical software choices No OIS on the camera Huawei is a Chinese brand that has taken the smartphone world by storm in the last few years. And the Honor 8 is an all-metal and glass phone that could easily go for more money. It looks and feels really premium but the asking price is a step below other leading smartphone which makes it a great SIM-free option. 9. iPhone 6S 2015's best iPhone is still a brilliant phone to this day Weight: 143g | Dimensions: 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm | OS: iOS 10 | Screen size: 4.7-inch | Resolution: 750 x 1334 | CPU: Apple A9 | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 16/32/128 | Battery: 1715mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 5MP Almost as good as iPhone 7 It's way cheaper than iPhone 7 Doesn't have the latest features Less bragging rights The iPhone 6S is no longer the best iPhone out there but it could be the best iPhone to buy if you want something decent without paying the Earth. It's well over £100 cheaper than the iPhone 7, after all, and yet it's exactly the same size, has a very similar screen and has most of the same features. 10. Samsung Galaxy S8 The latest and greatest Samsung Galaxy phone is out now Weight: 155g | Dimensions: 148.9 x 68.1 x 8mm | OS: Android 7 Nougat | Screen size: 5.8-inch | Resolution: 1440 x 2960 | CPU: Exynos 8895 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 64GB | Battery: 3000mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 8MP Stunning screen Slick new UI Very powerful Empty List The Samsung Galaxy S8 is a superb phone and it's currently available to pre-order from various places. If you want it SIM-free you're going to have to pay around £689 which is a lot of money. Don't worry though, if that's way too much there are some great cheaper options further down the page. We'll be publishing our full Samsung Galaxy S8 review soon so keep checking in for our full verdict. 11. Apple iPhone 7 Far and away the western world's best selling phone Weight: 138g | Dimensions: 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm | OS: iOS 10 | Screen size: 4.7-inch | Resolution: 750 x 1334 | CPU: Apple A10 Fusion | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 32/128/256GB | Battery: 1960mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 7MP Good low light camera Water resistant Battery life better but unimpressive Lacks clear upgrades The iPhone 7 is the most popular SIM-free phone out there. It's also the most popular contract phone out there. And so it was always going to make our list of the best SIM-free phone deals. Is it the best SIM-free iPhone to buy though? Only you can decide that - you'll probably see that the iPhone 6S offers most of the same features but is available for less. 12. Google Pixel The best phone for pure Android Weight: 143g | Dimensions: 143.8 x 69.5 x 8.5mm | OS: Android 7.1 | Screen size: 5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: Snapdragon 821 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32/128GB | Battery: 2770mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 8MP Supremely smooth performance Bright, colorful full HD display Battery life could be better Assistant yet to realize potential The Google Pixel is a super high-end Android phone and consequently you're unlikely to find cheap prices for it just yet. If you're after a brilliant Android phone though it's a super option. It's got perhaps the best camera of any phone out there right now, and because it's made by Google it's got Android baked into it from the ground up so it's super slick and easy to use. 13. Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus The bigger version of Samsung's amazing new phone Weight: 173g | Dimensions: 159.5 x 73.4 x 8.1mm | OS: Android 7 Nougat | Screen size: 6.2-inch | Resolution: 1440 x 2960 | CPU: Exynos 8895 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 64GB | Battery: 3500mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 8MP Incredible screen Powerful and full of features Very expensive Too big for many If you love the look of Samsung's new S8 phones and want to go supersize then the S8 Plus is the SIM-free phone for you. It's a brilliant handset, visually the most impressive out there right now. And it's got all the best features, for example you can pair with two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. It's expensive though so this one is only for those who want to spend a lot. 14. iPhone 7 Plus The best and most powerful iPhone available right now Weight: 188g | Dimensions: 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3mm | OS: iOS 10 | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: A10 Fusion | RAM: 3GB | Storage: 32/128/256GB | Battery: 2900mAh | Rear camera: 12MP+12MP | Front camera: 7MP Loads of power for performance Fantastic camera It's expensive No headphone port If you want the latest iPhone and you want it to be big, the iPhone 7 Plus is your phone. It's quite expensive though, so you may want to consider the iPhone 7 instead. If you absolutely must have that massive screen then it's a great option, and comes with a better camera than the main iPhone 7 which is an added plus.

Apple told British chipset designer Imagination Technologies - a company Apple has been using for GPU tech since the first iPhone - that it will stop using its tech at some point in the next two years. The statement confirmed Apple is “working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination’s technology.” That may mean we’re about to see a big improvement on the iPhone when it comes to gaming. Apple bringing graphics chip production in-house will give it more control over what the innards of the iPhone or iPad can do. The dates suggest Apple will stop using the technology in the next 15 to 24 months, which would mean it could be ready for the new iPhone we see in September 2018. Another reality This may also suggest Apple is readying itself to jump into the world of virtual or augmented reality tech. Tim Cook has made clear his intention to bring AR technology to the iPhone in the future and this could be the major step forward the firm needs to make it happen. Apple had previously considered taking over Imagination Technologies, about a year ago, but this news seems to confirm the acquisition is no longer underway.  Apple has been designing its own CPU for a number of years, so being able to reconfigure GPU tech within Apple itself will likely be a major benefit to the company and hopefully iPhone users too. Imagination Technologies is uncertain Apple will be able to make the chip technology without breaking patents owned by the former though. The statement from the firm says, "Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination's patents, intellectual property and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it. "Further, Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple’s assertions." Whether Apple will be able to do it without ensuing a major court case is yet to be seen, but this move may make certain that the iPhone is the best mobile gaming device in a few years time. iPhone 8 could steal a cool screen trick from the iPad Pro Topics iPhone iPad Related news HTC U ‘Ocean’ specs and features revealed in huge new leak Apple looking at channel bundles to make its breakthrough into pay TV big leagues Project Scorpio: everything we know about Microsoft's 4K-ready Xbox Project Scorpio's specs could be revealed sooner than you think See more Mobile phones news Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

You may be craving a different finish for your next Apple smartphone in the future, with a new patent revealing the company's plans to use new durable materials in future gadgetry. The patent filing (as spotted by Patently Apple) details Apple's plans to use titanium metal, titanium alloys and 'hybrid plastics' in everything from iPhones to Macbooks to Apple Watches. Benefits of titanium Most Apple gadgets make use of aluminum in its casing and construction, giving that premium silver-grey look, before colored oxidised coatings are applied. But for darker finishes, zirconium and its alloys are often used, which can be expensive and hard to machine. Titanium and its alloys are relatively inexpensive by comparison, remaining lightweight and easy to work with, while retaining durability. A physical vapor deposition (PVD) coating can also easily be applied to give "cosmetic" enhancements to titanium.  For Space Grey and Jet Black iPhones, titanium alloy's additional toughness could be very useful, especially given the chipping issue the darker iPhones have been known to suffer from. Plastic bonding for waterproofing A separate Apple patent also details how a process of bonding plastics to porous metals could improve future Apple gadgets. Rather than wrapping all your premium gear in shoddy plastic, the patent here seems more interested in using thermoplastic materials to help make Apple's products watertight, sealing up areas otherwise exposed to the elements. According to the patent, "the strength of the bonds between the materials may provide some degree of impact resistance to the electronic device. The increased bond strength thus results in a sturdier, more durable product." It's all sounding very promising – should Apple's patent exploration bear fruit, Apple may have some very sturdy, attractive products in the pipeline. iPhone 8 release date, news and rumors Topics iPhone Related news The best Macs to buy in 2017: Apple's top iMacs, MacBooks and more Camera rumors 2017: the biggest and best camera rumors around The best 4K Blu-ray players you can buy right now HTC Vive celebrates its birthday with a Netflix-like service for VR games See more Mobile phones news Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

10.38 AM Tuesday, 4 April 2017 Home News Emirates Government Region World Law & Order Local Region World Entertainment Films and Music Celebrity Gossip Events Lifestyle Health Shopping Food Fashion Offbeat This is life Crazy World Business Economy and Finance Corporate Technology Energy Property Real Estate Rentals Sports Local Cricket FootBall Other Olympics Classifieds Videos Pictures Bollywood Jobs Home Business Advanced Imagination Technologies' shares plunge 70 per cent after Apple ditches firm By Reuters Published Monday, April 03, 2017 Pic: Reuters Imagination Technologies has been told by Apple, its biggest customer, that the maker of iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches is to stop using its graphics technology in its new products, sending shares in the company crashing by more than 70 per cent on Monday. Imagination said Apple, which accounts for about half its revenue, had notified the British firm it was developing its own graphics chips and would no longer use Imagination's processing designs in 15 months to two years time. "The biggest risk to Imagination's business model was realized this morning," analysts at Investec said. "The loss of this revenue stream will have a material impact on the financials of the company." The technology company, which was founded in 1985 and listed in 1994, has licensed its processing designs to Apple from the time of the first iPod and receives a small royalty on every device using its graphics. Imagination said it doubted Apple could go it alone without violating Imagination's patents, and analysts said legal battles could lie ahead. "It would be extremely challenging for Apple to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics, that is, without infringing our IP rights and also infringing our confidential information," Chief Executive Andrew Heath said. "As such we do not accept their assertion that they no longer require our technology." The company said it had asked Apple for evidence that it could dispense with all of Imagination's technology, "but Apple has declined to provide it". Apple declined to comment. Shares in Imagination, in which Apple holds an 8 percent stake, plunged to 76 pence, their lowest level since 2009 and about a 10th of their record of 734 pence hit in 2012. They were down 64 per cent at 97 pence by 1350 GMT, giving the company a market value of 275 million pounds ($372 million), or 479 million pounds less than it was worth on Friday. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said it was not the first time Apple had cut off a supplier - Portal Player, Sigmatel, CSR and Wolfson were all abruptedly dropped. "There is a difference here though", they said. "Imagination holds significant patents around graphics cores, in particular those which allow lower power use, and is considering discussing different commercial arrangements with Apple." Imagination's shares rose sharply between 2009 and 2012 as sales of smartphones boomed and Apple and Intel bought stakes. The company was valued at more than 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) in April 2012. It struggled, however, to reduce its reliance on Apple, and has faced increased competition from the likes of chipmaker Qualcomm and British rival ARM, which developed its own graphics to complement its core processor blueprints. Imagination says it has just over 50 per cent of the high-end smartphone market - nearly all of which stems from Apple, although MediaTek (2454.TW) also selected its graphics for its new chipset last month. But Imagination only has 7 percent of the market for mid-tier devices, where it has been trying to gain share, including in phones made by Chinese manufacturers. Imagination said it would talk with Apple about alternative commercial arrangements. Analysts said there could be room for compromise, and it could even be a bargaining move by Apple to reduce royalties. Apple paid Imagination license fees and royalties totaling 60.7 million pounds for the year to end-April 2016, half of its total revenue, and is expected to pay about 65 million pounds for this year, Imagination said. Most of its costs are incurred in developing technologies years ahead of when they are deployed in products, and it said there were minimal direct costs associated with Apple's revenue. Around half of its non-Apple revenue comes from the MIPS processing platform it bought in 2012 in an attempt to extend its product line-up beyond graphics. Customers for the MIPS technology include Israeli automated vehicle driving systems specialist Mobileye and Chinese chipmaker Spreadtrum Communications, according to analysts.

A deep look at Google’s biggest-ever search quality crisis Under fire for months, can Google reverse the drip-drip-drip of criticism as incorrect, absurd or even dangerous results surface to the top? Danny Sullivan on April 3, 2017 at 9:00 am More The past few months have been bad for Google’s search reputation. Long considered the “gold standard” in search, Google has seen its search results questioned as never before. It’s a body blow to a core service that should be safe as Google tries to grow in new directions. Recovering from that blow isn’t easy. What’s happened to Google search is on par with the Apple Maps fiasco or Samsung’s exploding Galaxy Note7 phones. To this day, people still joke about Apple Maps being bad, even though it’s greatly improved. As for Samsung, the phones might no longer explode, but the jokes continue. Google now faces the same problem. Some of its search results are seen as laughable, embarrassing, or even dangerous. How Google lost its search groove Last November, Google found itself dragged into what had been mostly Facebook’s fake news problem when it listed a page at the top of its “In the news” section that promised the final election counts for the 2016 US presidential election. The page didn’t have the final, official, or even accurate counts. The next month, in December, Google took a huge hit after a Guardian article highlighted how, for some searches, Google was giving extremely disturbing answers. For example, here’s Google Home speaking at the time about how every woman has some degree of prostitute and evil in her: Google Home giving that horrible answer to "are women evil" on Friday. Good article on issues; I'll have more later https://t.co/EUtrx4ZFul pic.twitter.com/Ec8mEqx8Am — Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) December 4, 2016 A week after that, the Guardian was back, highlighting how Google was putting a Holocaust denial site at the top of its search results for “did the holocaust happen.” That hadn’t yet been forgotten when last month, Google could be found confirming that President Barack Obama was plotting a coup: I know @ruskin147 already shared this, but here's my own Google Home informing me Obama plans a coup. pic.twitter.com/gs0s0ivF3L — Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) March 5, 2017 This was just one of several odd “featured snippets” or “one true answers” appearing at the top of Google’s results. Less than two weeks ago, Google took further flak after featuring Breitbart for a science news search: How on earth is @BreitbartNews getting the #1 slot in Google results when it comes to Science/Nature News pic.twitter.com/AIpMYrJ38b — Cody Brown (@CodyBrown) March 22, 2017 That’s not actually what happened, as I’ll come back to. Nevertheless, it doesn’t stop the “WTF, Google?” reaction. Indeed, it’s a reaction that’s happening because I’d argue Google has lost core faith with people and publications that have bought into the idea that you can Google anything and get the right answer. Google’s results might be as good as ever. They might even be better than ever. But if the public perception is that Google has a search quality problem, that wins, because we don’t have any hard figures about relevancy. We don’t have relevancy ratings for search engines We don’t know which search engine has the best search results. There’s no independent third-party diligently and consistently evaluating actual results. We occasionally get consumer satisfaction surveys, but those don’t actually try to verify that the consumers rating search engines actually know themselves how to evaluate the quality of results. Without qualified data, Google has earned its reputation as being the best search engine because early on when it started, it was easily demonstrably better than other search engines. By the time the others caught up, it was over. People stopped talking about using “search engines” and shifted over to “Googling” things, where Google was seen at the best and only serious way to get information. A 2003 New York Times column by Thomas Friedman even asked, “Is Google God?” Google’s only real challenger in recent years, Bing, was largely laughed off as competitor when it started. Bing certainly didn’t help itself by spying on Google searchers in order to copy Google’s results. By and large, Google’s results were unquestioned. Google was the best. Anyone in the search marketing space, or those who watch search closely, knew this wasn’t necessarily the case. Google had weaknesses. But we’re a niche audience that’s largely dismissed. It takes something among the “normals” out there to finally have an impact on Google’s reputation as being great. There have been only a handful of such occasions. Google’s previous search quality challenges In 2003, Google came under criticism after its results were “Googlebombed” so that in a search for “miserable failure,” the official biography for George W. Bush generally ranked first. This wasn’t a major crisis for the company, however. Indeed, Google saw it as so low in priority that took three years before a fix was put into place. A far bigger crisis was in April 2004, when the anti-Jewish “Jew Watch” site was noticed to be ranking at the top of Google for a search on “jew.” There were calls for the site to be dropped from Google’s results. But Google chose to go with a message of wanting to be inclusionary rather than censor. It quickly posted a disclaimer that appeared alongside those results, which themselves changed over time. The issue largely went away. In August 2005, Google took a brief blow when Yahoo managed to claim it had indexed more pages than Google. In a world without a universal quality score to measure search engines, size was often used as a proxy. As relatively meaningless as that number was, Google went into red-alert status to claim within about a month that it had overtaken Yahoo with a bigger index — and oh, that it now considered size so passé that it wasn’t going to cite pages indexed as a metric any longer. Google’s most serious challenge until now, in my opinion, really came on January 1, 2011. In the weeks before, there had been grumblings that “content farms” were somehow walking all over Google’s results, serving up lightweight content to answer common questions. On New Year’s Day 2011, Vivek Wadhwa published a column about why a better Google was “desperately” needed. The column was an over-the-top condemnation of Google’s search quality backed by no actual metrics. Google was clearly serving hundreds of millions of searches successfully per day, or its actual users would have been abandoning it in droves. They were not. But Wadhwa’s column resonated with tech bloggers who for various reasons just felt in their gut that Google had a problem. Google again went to red-alert status. Within two months, it launched what was called the Panda Update, a change especially meant to go after content farms and low-quality content. The normals relaxed, assuming all was fixed. Meanwhile, search marketers watched as Google rolled out nearly 30 subsequent updates over a four-year period to get a handle on the issue. Google’s current search reputation challenge All those past crises are nothing in seriousness, compared to what Google currently faces. Now, the search engine is regularly finding its search quality questioned, often with little perspective and sometimes with flat-out inaccuracies reported as fact. For example, the Guardian has done a fantastic job highlighting serious issues with Google. But that same publication also declared in December that Google was promoting right-wing bias in a systematic fashion. That’s not true. If you care to understand in detail why it was demonstrably false, see my previous explanation at the end of this story. The reality is that Google has problems that can seem to favor extreme sites of any leaning. The Guardian writers just didn’t bother to do any easy, basic checks beyond right-wing sites. Also consider that issue I mentioned earlier, where Google was spotted listing a Breitbart story first among three news items for a search on “great barrier reef.” After that was tweeted, legitimate questions were raised about whether Breitbart should be a science news source. What seemed missing was any solid examination of the problem. Instead, Gizmodo first condemned Google for serving up Brietbart for a “climate science” search, then in a follow-up declared in a headline: “Google Says Its Job Is to Promote Climate Change Conspiracy Theories.” Neither of those things were true. It’s also deeply ironic. Google’s being attacked over whether or not it’s doing a good job presenting factual information in articles that themselves that have factual problems. A fact check on Google’s alleged failure on facts A search for “great barrier reef” is not a “science” nor a “climate science” search. It’s a search for a place. Those conducting it might be interested in science information. They might be interested in tourism information. They might be interested in business information about the region. They might just want a map. Google has no way to know the exact intent of that search. That’s why it presents a variety of results, some related to tourism, some related to climate science. Those results currently include pages from three major and generally respectable news sites — CNN, The New York Times and the Guardian — saying large parts of the Great Barrier Reef are dead, or that it’s under stress but not dead, or that it’s not actually dead at all: (Those conflicting headlines all come from the same research report, which indeed says that the Great Barrier Reef has serious problems. But because some publications reacted to that initial report to say that the reef was dead, the researchers and local tour operators pushed back — which caused a spate of “it’s not dead or completely dead” stories). When people search about things, they might also want to know related news. That’s why Google has the Top Stories box. And with this search, Google faces the same issue. People searching for “great barrier reef” aren’t necessarily wanting just science news, so Google provides a variety of current news headlines. On the day this all exploded, there was fresh news about the stress the Great Barrier Reef is suffering. Breitbart had a commentary on that topic. It happened to get the first spot. It wasn’t “pinned” to that spot permanently, as the Gizmodo article suggested. It was rotated out as the news itself started to change. Nor was that news for a “science” search, as previously explained. And no, Google didn’t say the story was there because Google’s job was to promote climate change conspiracy theories. Google said it was there as a natural consequence of showing a range of news and views — which is generally what you want from a search engine. If you want to go further with me examining the issues in this particular search, see some of my commentary in this Twitter moment. But the facts don’t matter, in terms of Google’s search quality reputation. The Google outrage machine is stoked. After so many failures, I’d say many don’t care about the facts and important questions in search, including how censorship might have unwanted blowback. They just see Google screwing up again, adding to the growing public relations issue. Fix it! Google DOES have problems that need fixing Don’t get me wrong. Google deserves plenty of criticism for some of the results that it has been showing. Even when there are reasons that provide perspective, that doesn’t excuse the need for Google itself to take corrective actions. Here are some specific things it is doing and could do better. Search Suggestions / Autocomplete: Google began testing a way for people to report offensive search suggestions in February and has promised to improve those suggestions overall. But nearly two months after that limited test began, the reporting tool has yet to be rolled out broadly. Meanwhile, it’s fairly easy to find suggestions that some might find objectionable: Those are for the political parties of the Democrats and Republicans, but trust me, you can sadly find similar things about racial groups, ethnicities and sexual orientation. These will continue for as along as Google offers suggestions, which are based on actual searches that real people do in volume. Over time, perhaps they’ll be reduced. But with an infinite amount of things to search for, you can’t fix it all. Nor can Bing, by the way: Google needs to get that reporting tool out broadly as soon as possible. It needs to consider eliminating suggestions on desktop, where they aren’t as necessary as on mobile. It needs to ramp up ways to filter out offensive suggestions. It’s a problem that’s festered for six years or more. Google needs to do more. Featured snippets: Google could and perhaps should eliminate featured snippets for desktop searches, where they aren’t necessary and would encourage people to assess a variety of results rather than fixating on “one true answer” that might not be true at all. It’s much more difficult to drop featured snippets for Google Assistant and Google Home, because when they work — and they do often work — they are a distinguishing feature that puts Google ahead of Apple’s Siri and Amazon Echo’s Alexa. Google hopes a new effort announced last month involving its quality raters will make objectionable and questionable content less likely to appear. But that wouldn’t stop a site like Quora, which isn’t generally objectionable, for showing up with an entirely fake answer about the person who “invented” homework: That person isn’t real and didn’t invent homework, but because the page looks like it’s providing an answer to the question, Google elevated it. Bing did this as well, when I first noticed this last month. Bing’s since changed to using an answer from its Bing Distill community, where volunteers try to answer questions: That’s better, but it’s not a scalable solution to the overall problem. People want one fast answer for all types of topics. The more comprehensive any search engine tries to be in doing this, the more likelihood that it will make mistakes for more obscure or infrequent questions. The solution overall might be that our voice assistants have to do a better job stressing that they’re making a “best guess” and perhaps encouraging us to review other answers. It might also involve us, as searchers, doing a better job understanding that there’s not always one true answer to everything and that we need to be more critical about what we receive and do further research where it might seem needed. Search quality: Aside from presenting one answer in a special featured snippets box, Google has had problems where the top web result can be offensive or where most of the results have issues, as was the case with searches about whether the Holocaust was real. Google launched an algorithm change within a week of that problem coming to light in December. It quickly changed the results for the Holocaust search in question. That change also appears to have helped with some other problematic searches, as I’ve covered earlier. Data from quality raters may help further improve things. Still, Google almost certainly won’t be able to eliminate all objectionable results. Inevitably, someone will stumble across something that feels grossly wrong. The question then is whether that will be seen as Google failing to do enough or that Google can’t fix everything perfectly. Top Stories: The problem of fake news or dubious content appearing in Google’s “Top Stories” section is largely down to Google itself. It deliberately chose to allow publications beyond vetted news sites into this area back in October 2014. That’s why those fake election results appeared there. Changing the name of the section to “Top Stories” last December didn’t change the underlying problem. Shifting back to only allowing vetted sites won’t solve the issue of Breitbart content showing up. Breitbart is a vetted site that was admitted into Google News. The only way to keep that content out would be to ban the site from Google News entirely. Some might agree with that; others might find there’s a strong argument that a publication that’s one of the few to get a one-on-one interview with President Donald Trump deserves to be retained as a news source. Search will never be perfect In the end, it’s good that Google is going through this search quality crisis. This new pressure is forcing it to attend to issues that can no longer be allowed to fester. It’s not clear, however, if Google will be able to solve its biggest issue overall: the drip-drip-drip of criticism for problems that no search engine can ever fully eliminate, given how broad search is. Google handles 5.5 billion searches per day. Per day. Billions of searches, with around 15 percent being entirely new, never asked before. Google tries to answer these questions by producing results from billions of pages from across the web. It’s an impossible task to get perfectly right every time. Pick any search, and you can come up with something that will return objectionable or questionable results. This isn’t a new issue, as some of Google’s past search quality crises demonstrate. But possibly it’s growing, either as more questionable content flows onto the web or as more people are hyperaware of checking to see if such content surfaces in search results. An impossible task, but one where striving for perfection remains so crucial. Dylann Roof, convicted of murdering nine people in the Charleston church shooting, is an example of how important this is. Roof has said he did a Google search to learn more about “black on white crime” and that the first site he came to was a white supremacist site, which in turn may have shaped his motivation to commit the murders, as this NPR story recounts. Google no longer lists that site in the first page of its results. Bing does, at the time of this writing. I suspect that even if Google’s top results had lacked that site, Roof might have gone on searching until he found information confirming the bias he already had. Another part of his “manifesto” espousing hatred toward blacks comes from what he called his own “real life” experience, not from Google searches. But still. Getting the results as right as possible matters, however impossible that might seem. Search is hard. A big challenge for search engineers in the past was dealing with overt spam trying to attain high rankings. Now they have to grapple with “post-truth” content where pages that sound factual or informative to an algorithm can be anything but. We should continue to hold Google and search engines to a high standard and highlight where things clearly go wrong. But we should also understand that perfection isn’t going to be possible. That with imperfect search engines, we need to employ more human critical thinking skills alongside the searches we do — and that we teach those to generations to come. Life itself rarely has “one true answer” to anything. Expecting Google or any search engine to give them is a mistake.

Apple likes to have control over as much of the technology used inside its devices as possible. The desire for control even extends as far as the processor at the heart of the iPad and iPhone, which Apple designs itself. Now it seems, Apple is bringing the design of the GPU in-house, too. If you go back to the first iPhone in 2007, or the first iPad in 2010, you'll find a PowerVR GPU inside. Those chips are designed by British company Imagination Technologies, which has enjoyed a very healthy relationship with Apple until now across phone, tablet, TV, and watch hardware (even the brand new iPad uses a PowerVR GT7600 GPU). But a press release put out today by Imagination reveals its Apple relationship is coming to an end. Apple informed Imagination recently that " it will no longer use the Group's intellectual property in its new products in 15 months to two years time." Apparently Apple is developing its own GPU, which will replace PowerVR and any other Imagination-owned technology or IP in future devices. Imagination is treating this news with quite a bit of suspicion, stating the company believes, "it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple's assertions." Those suspicions are clearly made worse by the fact Apple is refusing to present evidence that it will no longer require or use Imagination's technology or violate any patents it owns. Related New iPad vs. iPad Pro 9.7-Inch: Apple Tablet Showdown New iPad vs. iPad Pro 9.7-Inch: Apple Tablet Showdown Imagination's reaction is understandable. Apple's products have relied on PowerVR for over a decade and Apple knows the licensed technology intimately. To produce their own replacement from scratch and without violating any Imagination IP would be quite impressive, especially considering compatibility needs to be maintained with all existing App Store software. According to The Verge, Apple owns 8 percent of Imagination and did pursue an acquisition of the company last year. Ultimately that didn't happen for unknown reasons, and it now looks as though the relationship could end badly and be followed by legal action. That all depends on the GPU Apple reveals in, based on Imagination's timetable, July 2018 at the earliest.

Now, however, the hardware manufacturer has announced the end of its manufacturing agreement with Apple. In a recently released statement, Imagination Technologies says that Apple has plans to replace the PowerVR GPU that runs its iOS devices, with new graphics silicon designed in-house. “Apple has used Imagination’s technology and intellectual property for many years. It has formed the basis of Graphics Processor Units (GPUs) in Apple’s phones, tablets, iPods, TVs and watches. Apple has asserted that it has been working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination’s technology,” writes Imagination in the press release. While Apple’s iPhone originally used a generic, Samsung-manufactured ARM processor powered by Samsung’s chip, the company has slowly moved towards building its own silicon, leaving the PowerVR one of the few processor related components the Cupertino, California-based company did not maintain full control over. Losing its primary customer is a significant blow to Imagination and the company says in its statement that it already has plans to take the matter to court. Imagination is likely concerned that in order for Apple to build its own GPU hardware from scratch, the company will borrow concepts and groundwork from its PowerVR GPU> Imaginations stock is already in a free fall, dropping between 60 and 70 percent over the last few hours.

It’s Me True, but if it was an organic process, where their sales to Apple just grew to eclipse the rest of their customers, the only way to avoid being reliant on Apple would be to decline Apple business. While diversification of their customer base would have been preferable, they can’t make other customers order more to offset Apple’s growth. Can’t blame Apple for wanting to control their own business, but I think it might have been easier on everyone involved if they’d just bought the company. FlamesFan89 “I think it might have been easier on everyone involved if they’d just bought the company.” I’m actually surprised that they didn’t. It isn’t like Apple doesn’t have the cash reserves to do it, and I would think that it would be a far easier path than trying to create something from scratch without worrying about any IP issues. It’s Me Apparently they had discussions a year ago that broke down. Apple could afford anything they were asking, but I guess it depends on whether what they were asking was justified cost/benefit. FlamesFan89 Yeah, fair enough. No point in overpaying just to make life easier. I wonder if they will make any attempt to poach talent. They’d be silly not to. Vito R. Apparently they already have according to TechCrunch. It’s Me Might be a good time for them to reconsider, given the recent adjustment in value/price. FlamesFan89 I would have to think that the sale would be blocked now by some sort of enforcement agency considering the reason for the tanking stock is Apple’s announcement. It’s Me Probably. But it was IT that put the info out, so that’s on them. It’s Apple’s decision so you could be right about not being able to buy them now. FlamesFan89 Yeah, I don’t have all the details, nor am I qualified to make any sort of judgments in that regard, nor am I accusing any foul play. I could just see the SEC, or FTC, or whoever would be in charge, not looking too kindly on the whole thing if Apple were to turn around and try to buy them again now that their stock has tanked. JD How do you know they hadn’t already started to Imagination before they severe the ties? vn33 I know hindsight is 20/20, but doesn’t any of Imagination executives have foresight that this may happen. At least have a Contingency plan in place, instead of relying on the court system. Wonder how they are scrambling right now to recover. It’s Me I assume they had some sort of plan B in place, but how do you really plan for the day that you suddenly lose the vast majority of your sales. ciderrules I bet Apple already has a GPU finished, maybe even in time for the iPhone 8. There’s no way Apple would just drop Imagination and start on a new GPU without any guarantee it would be ready in under 2 years. Far too risky. Since Apple continues to sell older model iPhones and iPads when new models come out, then the next 2 years could simply be paying Imagination for IP in current devices while they transition over to their GPU. Vito R. The statement does not say they plan to take them to court. It merely suggests they find it unlikely Apple can do it without infringing on their intellectual property and that they are still negotiating. Basically they are just signaling to their investors that they think they will still get some revenue from Apple. The real Chug that Haterade Maybe they should trying getting their WiFi issues figured out first before they start working on their own GPU… just sayin’ Denton But it wil be Gorgeous and magical…. now who can resist that fairy tale Dankey Are you ladies lost? This ain’t no Failburry article, is all… p_lindsay Nice! I’ve been waiting for Apple to invent the GPU. This promises to be magical. Dankey Yarp; it’ll be the best ever. What is a GPU…?

Zeman   @phonescooper Apple is developing a new graphics chip for the iPhone that will see the end of its long-term relationship with Imagination Technologies. Apple has relied on Imagination for years to provide the iPhone's GPU. Apple recently informed Imagination that it "will no longer use [Imagination's] intellectual property in its new products in 15 months to two years time." The iPhone is packed with third-party components, but Apple designs the main application processor. Phone performance relies on the CPU and GPU working together closely, so it stands to reason that Apple would also want to control that piece of the iPhone. Imagination, however, doesn't think Apple can get away so easily. "Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information," said the company in a statement. Imagination requested these details from Apple, but Apple declined to provide them. The two companies have already explored alternative commercial arrangements for the patent licenses and royalties that pertain to Imagination's technology. Imagination said it won't stand for its patents to be violated. Apple hasn't commented on the matter. Imagination is a U.K.-based firm. Investors punished Imagination's stock after the company shared the news. more info at Imagination Technologies » Related Apple Releases iOS 10.3.1 to Fix Bugs T-Mobile Adds Free AppleCare to Its Device Insurance Plan Apple Announces (Product) Red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus more Apple iPhone 7 news Apple iPhone 7 specs & features Apple iPhone 7 user reviews Apple news   Apple phones iOS news AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

Consumer rights group Which? warned the numbers on the box don't reflect what a typical user will manage to achieve. Which? looked at a selection of popular laptops from Acer, Apple, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Toshiba. All except Apple's failed to live up to the battery life claims made on the manufacturer's website and in the product's documentation. The Lenovo Yoga 510 fell short of its advertised five hours battery life by over half, stopping short after two hours, seven minutes. The HP Pavilion 14-al115na fared similarly poorly, running out of power after four hours, 25 minutes despite claiming a nine hour runtime. Acer's E15 with a "six hour" battery lasted two hours and 56 minutes while Dell's "seven hour" Inspiron 15 5000 ran out in three hours and 58 minutes. Apple's MacBook Pro 13 managed to exceed its 10 hour claim, lasting for 12 hours under lab tests. "Overall we found that manufacturers are missing their claims not by minutes, but by hours," said Which? "The most optimistic laptop manufacturers are overstating their battery life by 50 percent or more, leaving you searching for the power cable twice as often as you’d expect." Which? said it uses a range of real-world tests to assess the battery lives of consumer computers. For the most part, it actively browses the web while using a Wi-Fi connection, continuing to use the laptop until it shuts down. In another tests, films are replayed continually until the battery is depleted. Each laptop is tested multiple times, giving the battery time to cover several discharge cycles. It's of note that all the Windows machines in the test gave dismal results whereas Apple's MacBook Pro – a device plagued with battery issues immediately after its launch – performed well. Which? hasn't detailed its exact testing methodology. Details such as screen brightness, the web browser used and the exact sites being visited have significant impacts on overall power consumption. Given Which? claims it tests "like no one else," it's disappointing it doesn't present the specifics for scrutiny. Responding to the report, Dell noted that lab tests cannot be indicative of actual usage by any one user. Everyone installs a different combination of software and uses their PC for their own reasons. "It’s similar to how different people driving the same car will get different gas mileage depending on how they drive," the company explained. Laptop manufacturers generally test their devices with a standard selection of software that reflects the broadest demographic of users. Commonly used tests include performance in office applications, web browsing and video playback, all on a "clean" machine without the bloat that accumulates through months of PC usage. The setup doesn't truly reflect any real system though. Which? suggested companies should be doing more to indicate how good the batteries in their products are. Which? said that manufacturers are overstating their battery life figures "not by minutes, but by hours." It noted that customers should "look past manufacturer claims" and do their own research on what a laptop's battery is like. Reading online reviews by the media and other customers is usually the best way to tell how reliable a battery is.

The company's current supplier, Imagination Technologies, has seen its stock price fall by 70 percent in the wake of the announcement. The chips will be ready in two years. Apple already designs its own A-series processors for use in the iPhone, iPad, iPod and other products. They incorporate graphics processors (GPU) designs licensed from UK-based Imagination Technologies, an arrangement Apple has been using for almost two decades. Apple is now set to disrupt the industry in an unprecedented way. Imagination announced today that Apple will not be using its intellectual property beyond the next 15 months to two years' time. Future products will use a completely custom graphics chip built in-house by Apple. "Apple has used Imagination’s technology and intellectual property for many years. It has formed the basis of Graphics Processor Units ('GPUs') in Apple’s phones, tablets, iPods, TVs and watches," said Imagination. "Apple has asserted that it has been working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination’s technology." While Apple is clearly intending to launch its own silicon, Imagination has doubts over whether this will be possible. It said it would be "extremely challenging" for Apple to create a GPU that does not infringe on its existing intellectual property rights. As such, the two companies are already back in contact discussing new arrangements. Imagination and Apple are almost certain to end up working together in some form, irrespective of whether new iPhones include Imagination GPUs. This hasn't stopped Imagination's shares from plummeting during the day. Apple has been Imagination's biggest customer for years and accounts for around half of its revenue. The sudden announcement that the money could be gone within two years has caused Imagination's market value to fall by around 70%. It's now trading at about £250m, down from £765m when markets opened on Monday morning. The news is a significant blow to Imagination. The company has struggled to reach more customers beyond Apple. Although around 50% of all smartphones include its GPU designs, the majority of these are iPhone handsets. ARM, the company that produces processor designs for firms including Qualcomm, has its own GPU architecture. Imagination recently won a contract with emerging processor manufacturer MediaTek to provide graphics capabilities for its new chipset. While significant, it doesn't offset the impact of the loss of Apple's custom. Apple has refused to detail its new GPU or state whether it will draw on Imagination property. Until more is known about the chip, Imagination's investors could be left assuming the worst: Apple succeeds in innovating from scratch and severs its ties with Imagination completely. Apple is also building its own desktop graphics silicon for Mac processors that will reduce the company's existing reliance on Intel chips. The company seems to be moving to build everything in-house, cutting outsourcing to a minimum. Apple has previously discussed purchasing Imagination but is now working on chips without external input. The company is still Imagination Technologies' fourth-largest shareholder.

It’s no secret that the characters of Big Little Lies have been beyond compelling. From the way Celeste (Nicole Kidman) handles her volatile and abusive relationship with husband Perry (Aleksander Skaarsgard) to Madeline Mackenzie’s (Reese Witherspoon) perfectly imperfect life, it’s been hard to look away from murder mystery dramedy. But one of the most interesting characters of the HBO mini-series isn’t a person: it’s the music. Music has as much of a presence as any of the dynamic women and men of Monterey, CA on the show. It plays as much of a part in the story as the characters do, providing excitement and suspense. Oftentimes, the show feels like one giant Apple Music commercial, because the soundtrack is curated so supremely and Apple products are usually the catalysts for consumption. Madeline’s daughter Chloe Mackenzie serves as one of the main sonic vessels of the show, playing resident DJ and showing refined musical taste rarely seen from a first grader, often setting the scene for their drives around the affluent community. When Jane Chapman (Shailene Woodley) goes running and experiences flashbacks to her rape, the music becomes so raucous, it’s borderline violent, capturing Jane about to break. With Ed, dancing to classic soul as it blares loudly through he and Madeline’s house reveals the contrast between his more carefree spirit and Madeline’s tightly wound persona. Music defines the Big Little Lies characters more than simply providing a soundtrack to the show, and what’s most interesting,is how one song can emotionally fuel separate vignettes simultaneously. (Luckily, fans who have been pining over the release of a soundtrack are in luck: the showrunners just released an official set on Friday.) Since the power of song has been such an integral part of the seven-part series, we compiled a list of the most memorable musical moments from the show to get you through your first week without the show. (We know -- we’ll miss it too.) The Temptations, "Papa Was a Rolling Stone" Music on Big Little Lies is malleable to different situations, and with “Papa Was a Rolling Stone,” we see the music being both celebratory and anxiety-inducing. While Ziggy Chapman (Jane’s son) and Chloe are dancing in the Mackenzie’s living room alongside Madeline and Ed themselves, the scene cuts to Jane speeding after confronting her potential rapist (who is also Ziggy’s father). As the music intensifies, it parallels Jane’s instability, anger and nerves. But with Big Little Lies, songs often guide the narrative throughout an entire episode, and “Papa Was a Rolling Stone” does just that. Instead of Chloe being the music’s vessel, it’s Ziggy who has taken to the song, even choreographing a dance routine at home to it. For this particular episode, this song channels Jane’s frustration and Ziggy’s realtively carefree attitude. The juxtaposition on the show is what makes it really interesting. PJ Harvey, "The Wind" The recurring theme of having a song really become the score for an episode is something that begins with PJ Harvey’s “The Wind.” While Madeline is driving Chloe to her first day of school in the series premiere, she lets her daughter DJ the ride. Instantly, viewers are made aware of Chloe’s enviable music taste. And it’s the first time a song is really used to narrate more than one scene of an episode, as it also plays over the episode’s end credits. Michael Kiwanuka, "Cold Little Heart" Many viewers of the miniseries have been drawn in by the haunting, soulful track in the opening credits by Michael Kiwanuka. At its core, the opening is a rock track supplemented by Kiwanuka’s raspy lilt, but it seems to serve a higher purpose: It’s equal parts suspenseful and soothing, telling a grander story of the women of Monterey, a place where perfection exists only on the surface. “Cold Little Heart” seems to thematically encapsulate the dichotomy between the characters’ facade versus their authentic selves, as Kiwanuka sings, “Bleeding, I'm bleeding/ My cold little heart/ Oh I can't stand myself." Agnes Obel, "September Song" At the end of the premiere, Agnes Obel’s melancholic ballad “September Song” is a metaphor for the false sense of security that exists for the three main protagonists of the show. While the song plays as the trio separately head to bed for the night, it simultaneously narrates a future scenario where police are investigating the Monterey homicide at the school fundraiser. Obel’s piano track is the calm before the storm erupts in Monterey, and later Jean Marc uses the piece when Madeline mourns her daughter Abigail’s choice to live with her father. Leon Bridges, "River" Though “River” doesn’t necessarily highlight the most dramatic parts of Big Little Lies, it solidifies Chloe’s precocious taste in music. When Madeline’s daughter chooses to play the earworm, she confirms that it’s “a beautiful song.” Chloe’s childlike curiosity seems to come out in Madeline, as the song encourages her to daydream. If you first heard Bridges on Big Little Lies, you probably added him to your Spotify queue soon after watching the episode. Martha Wainwright, “Bloody Mother F—king Asshole” Martha Wainwright’s “Bloody Mother F—king Asshole” is the embodiment of all of the rage, fear and pain Jane experiences as a result of the rape that got her pregnant with Ziggy. Viewers mostly see Jane’s rage when she goes running on the beach and is plagued by memories of the night she was assaulted, as the character evolves from being a loving mother trying to hold everything together to a rape victim who can no longer contain her emotions. Irma Thomas, "Straight From the Heart" On the surface, Celese and Perry seem so grossly in love, Monterey parents often can’t stand them. But behind closed doors, their intense intimacy often turns into domestic violence and emotional terror. “Straight from the Heart” speaks to both sides of Celeste and Perry’s relationship. It plays in Episode 4 right before they have passionate sex, and then again in Episode 5 after Celeste contemplates Perry’s abuse cycle. The lyrics of the song really speak to the impossible choices that many end up making in an abusive relationship: “Tell me we could make another start/ You know I'll never go.” Alabama Shakes, "This Feeling" Chloe’s musical skills are pretty magical when it comes to Madeline. After Abigail decides to move out, Chloe tries to console her mother by uploading a sweet and soulful track to her iPhone. Later, as Madeline gazes at the ocean following a car accident she has with her former lover Joe, the song reprises. Sade, "Cherish the Day" One of the most quintessential Madeline moments of the show happens during her dinner with ex-husband Nathan Carlson (James Tupper), his young wife Bonnie Carlson (Zoë Kravitz) and her husband Ed. During dinner, Bonnie sets the mood with some of her tunes. Madeline can’t get enough of a Sade song Bonnie plays, but tellingly confuses the music for Adele. It’s a brief interaction, but it shows just how out of touch Madeline can be with the world around her, especially since her husband Ed (who plays music all the time) says he has the song. Of course he does. Ituana, "You Can't Always Get What You Want" (Rolling Stones Cover) The final few minutes of the Big Little Lies finale proves on the surface, like most things in Monterey, to be a unifying moment for the five female protagonists. While the serene version of the Stones classic plays as Celeste, Jane, Madeline, Renata and Bonnie sit on the beach drinking white wine while their kids run around, Big Little Lies continues to do what it does best: keep up appearances. Viewers don’t know whether the tranquility between the women will remain, or if they really are okay (despite their smiles and laughter), but the series ends the way it started: giving the illusion of the perfect people that live in Monterey.

The company already sells all three channels individually, but has reportedly approached the networks about combining them into a single package. Sources with knowledge of the negotiations said there is no firm deal in place yet and couldn’t cite a target price for the proposed bundle. Buying monthly subscriptions to the individual networks through Apple currently costs $15 for HBO, $11 for Showtime and $9 for Starz. As for the company’s own in-house video ambitions, The Information reports Apple has hired ex-YouTube and Spotify executive Shiva Rajaraman to overhaul its video and music operations. People familiar with the move said Apple has reached an impasse over the future of its ongoing video development efforts, with executives unable to agree on the direction moving forward. The company has considered bundling “its music, news and book offerings with new video and cable services that could be activated via the iPhone and work on Internet-connected TVs,” but that type of product would be a broad offering that is difficult to define and market. Rajaraman spent 8 years at YouTube hammering out licensing deals with high-profile clients like Disney, then moved to Spotify where he secured deals with both Time Warner and NBC.

The PowerVR supplier stated that the Cupertino-based company is working on an independent unit for better control over production. Half of Imagination's revenue comes from Apple, and losing the iPhone maker as a client will be catastrophic for the company. Depending on how production goes within 15 to 24 months the cash flow from Cupertino is expected to stop. So we might see an A-series chipset with Apple-designed CPU and GPU as early as the 2018 iPhones. Imagination is skeptical, though, that the next year's iPhone could be with an Apple in-house GPU without infringing any current patents. According to Imagination, both parties are actively discussing potential alternative commercial arrangements so we might not see a patent battle after all.

The banks had lobbied for the ability to force Apple’s hand in the matter in the hopes of being allowed to make their own mobile pay wallet options available on the iPhone, but ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in the ruling that the commission wasn’t “satisfied, on balance, that the likely benefits from the proposed conduct outweigh the likely detriments. We are concerned that the proposed conduct is likely to reduce or distort competition in a number of markets.” While the banks argued that allowing their mobile payment options on the iPhone would increase consumer choice and greater innovation in the digital payment space, Sims said mandating that Apple give up access to its NFC controller would “affect Apple’s current integrated hardware-software strategy for mobile payments and operating systems more generally, thereby impacting how Apple competes with Google.” While Apple has won the ability to control how the iPhone’s NFC capability is used, it’s still unclear how the judgment will affect negotiations with the banks to make Apple Pay more widely available within the country. Apple Pay has several partners in Australia, but the country’s four major banks have thus far boycotted the mobile payment system.

Imagination said in a statement that it was informed by Apple that it would not use the group's intellectual property in its new products for the next 15-24 months and as such Imagination will not be eligible for royalty payments under the current license and royalty agreement.  Imagination's technology has been in Apple devices for many years, forming the basis of graphics processor units in Apple's phones, tablets, iPods, TVs and watches. Apple told the company that it was working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination's technology.  Imagination said it requested more information from Apple to show it would not be violating Imagination's patents or intellectual property in future products, but had not yet heard back from the company. Imagination said it would be "extremely challenging" to design a brand new GPU architecture without infringing its intellectual property rights. The announcement led to a dramatic fall in Imagination technologies' share price, of over 60 percent.  Free Headlines in your E-mail Every day we send out a free e-mail with the most important headlines of the last 24 hours.

Supplier Brain drain is a significant risk for this Apple supplier. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 3, 2017 at 12:30PM By this point, the tech investment community is probably aware of graphics specialist Imagination Technologies' (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF) announcement that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has decided to abandon the former's graphics technology for entirely internally developed technology. This is very clearly devastating news for Imagination, which relied on Apple for more than half of its revenue during its fiscal year 2016. If that Apple-related revenue completely dries up, it's hard to see how Imagination can survive as a stand-alone entity with its current corporate cost structure. Image source: Imagination Tech. Even if Imagination eventually finds a way to get around the potential financial devastation that losing the Apple revenue stream would cause the company, there's a big risk Imagination now faces as its future hangs in the balance. Would you stay at Imagination? For a moment, try to put yourself in the shoes of a current Imagination engineer. Prior to this announcement, you were probably aware that Imagination was facing some financial difficulties, but at the same time, you knew that -- if you could do your job well -- you'd probably be able to count on having a well-paying job for the foreseeable future since Apple depends heavily on the technologies you are working on.  Following Apple's recent notice to Imagination and the subsequent public dissemination of that notice, Imagination's future is now incredibly uncertain because of Imagination's heavy reliance on Apple. So, if you are such an engineer, and you've got a mortgage to pay and a family to feed, what's the next logical step considering this uncertainty? You're going to start sending out your resumes to companies with more certain futures. For example, Apple has been making a lot of noise about building up a graphics team in the U.K -- no doubt in support of Apple's ambitions to cease using Imagination's technology in favor of internally developed technologies. I'm sure Apple would be happy to bring aboard more of Imagination's engineering staff to help it design its next-generation graphics processors. It's not just Apple that would likely be willing to employ Imagination's engineering staff. Companies like ARM Holdings (Imagination's major competitor in mobile graphics technology licensing) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) (the market share leader in mobile applications processors) are surely on the hunt for great mobile graphics talent, too. I could also see Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) potentially wanting to grab some of this talent, as it seems to be working to improve its internal graphics efforts (which are certainly in need of work to make them more efficient) in service of its personal computer and Internet of Things products. The point is, there are a lot of companies out there that would be interested in hiring engineers known for building some of the world's best low-power mobile graphics technologies, and I wouldn't be surprised to see some, if not all, of these companies step up their efforts in trying to recruit Imagination's (likely much more receptive) engineering talent in the near to medium term. Brain drain is a huge risk Even if Imagination somehow manages to ink a deal with Apple that allows it to live to fight another day, the potential brain drain Imagination could suffer in the meantime could weaken the company's long-term ability to develop and market competitive technologies.  Things don't look good for the company right now.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

A new report says Apple is trying to bring together a deal to offer HBO, Showtime, and Starz without requiring viewers to sign up for a base-level channel package first. Apple working on premium streaming package with HBO, Showtime, and Starz Apple wants to offer the three-channel package through Apple TV as well as iPhone and iPad. Assuming the company can get all three on board, it could offer something unique compared to AT&T’s DirecTV Now and Verizon’s soon to launch streaming TV package. Apple’s previous efforts to put together a streaming TV package failed because networks weren’t interested in meeting the company’s terms. That plan was said to include a more traditional channel bundle for about US$35. There isn’t any word on how much Apple will charge for its premium three-pack in part because none of the networks have signed on. Recode reports Apple is in talks with all three, although they won’t confirm the negotiations are under way. Presumably it’ll be no more than $35 because that’s what their combined cost through Apple is now. Apple’s Streaming TV Push Apple seems wants to offer some kind of package to compete in the streaming TV space, but so far hasn’t been able to pull anything together. Trying a different approach—working with channels where other iOS and Apple TV deals are in place—may be an easier path to success. Since no one is talking, there’s no way of knowing how interested HBO, Showtime, and Starz are in Apple’s bundle proposal. Right now Apple only has the promise of its own original shows which include Carpool Karaoke, Planet of the Apps, and Vital Signs. Adding in a premium channel bundle could be a big boost for Apple’s streaming plans—assuming it comes together at all.

I’m not even saying there’s anything wrong with that, per se, but the narrative around modern media distribution is waaaaay out of whack and full of misnomers. It’s also way overpriced.

Apple currently uses Imagination’s GPU chips in its mobile devices, but that’s changing within two years when they move to in house designs—and that could lead to a patent fight. Apple ditching Imagination for iPhone and iPad GPUs could lead to patent fight According to Imagination, it’s very likely some if its technologies will be necessary for Apple to make its graphics chip design work. So far, Apple hasn’t been interested sharing technical details to prove it won’t infringe on Imagination’s patents, and that could lead to a legal battle. The company said in a statement, Apple has asserted that it has been working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination’s technology. Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it. That sounds a lot like legal speak for Imagination saying Apple’s own GPUs could trigger a patent infringement lawsuit. The company goes on to say, “Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights.” Imagination’s public statement looks a lot like legal posturing, which is a pretty good indication the talks with Apple aren’t going well. If they were, the company would most likely announce its status change with Apple by saying there’s a change in major clients and might not mention Apple by name. Instead, it looks like Apple may not be overly interested in making a licensing deal come together and is willing to go to court should Imagination file a lawsuit. Imagination supplies chips for a long list of smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices, so it isn’t like Apple is its only revenue source. Still, it’s an excellent reminder that being an Apple parts supplier is great, all they way up until it isn’t.

I mean in order for Apple to prove that they were not infringing, Apple would have to give all of their design data and technical specifications to Imagination. April 3, 2017 at 12:56 EDT PM furbies April 3, 2017 Could Apple go “the clean room” route and design it’s own “GPU” using personnel that haven’t been exposed to the Imagination Technologies designs ? Of course, proving the staff involved in Apple’s design(s) didn’t peek at Imagination Technologies’s stuff would be a pain…. April 3, 2017 at 12:57 EDT PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Motley Fool Staff Apr 3, 2017 at 11:05AM The subject of options is one of the most intimidating topics for many investors, new and seasoned alike. But there are really only a few basics to understand, and then a world of new investing opportunity can open up. In this clip, our Motley Fool Options pro explains the ins and outs of some of the most common options investing strategies -- how they work, what they mean, and how investors can use them to their advantage. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on March 24, 2017. Dylan Lewis: What are some of the other really common option moves that you guys use in Motley Fool Options? JP Bennett: The two basics, put writing, we already touched on, and the other one that is normally a great strategy for beginners is covered calls. In a covered call, you already own the underlying stock. So, you own 100 shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), let's say. And you layer on top of that selling calls. So, Apple is trading around $140, you can potentially say, "Sell the $145 call." So, basically, what you're doing is increasing the income that you're going to generate from a given position. You're going to get the dividend from Apple, but in addition to that, you're also going to generate that option income. Now, the potential downfall of that is that you have to sell those shares at $145 if the stock ends above it and you don't do anything. Again, little side note, there are a bunch of different things you could do as you get close to the expiration if you don't want to sell shares. But that's the biggest risk of writing covered calls. So, one of the cornerstones of that is never write covered calls on stocks you don't want to sell, because eventually, you're going to end up in a position where the stock skyrockets, and you just sit there and you're like, "I should not have covered those shares." That extra $2 per share in income really doesn't offset the sting of a stock moving $15-$20 by the time expiration comes. Lewis: Yeah. And one thing that I think is probably worth clarifying for listeners is when options get exercised. I think that might be something that's a little bit confusing. It might be that you write puts and I take the other side of it, and I pay a premium for that. But, if the strike price doesn't wind up being somewhere that's opportune for me to exercise it, it will just wind up expiring, and I'll eat that premium. Bennett: Yeah. In most cases, the person that's taking the other side of the trade is a market maker. Think about Wall Street, he's one of those guys on Wall Street with his computer, he's basically hedging out a bunch of positions and doing stuff like that. In the vast majority of cases, you have to wait until you get really close to expiration for those options to be exercised, because an options premium is composed of two components. There is the intrinsic value, which is the discrepancy between the current stock price and the strike price. If you bought calls of Apple at $140 and it goes up to $145, you now have $5 of intrinsic value because you're essentially buying the stock at $5 below the current market price. The other component is the component that decays away over time, and that's what's referred to as time value. That is a function of some of the things we referred to in the past. That component kind of withers away. So, when you're selling options, that's the component you want to go away over time. If you have bought an option, it doesn't make sense to exercise it unless there really isn't all that much time value left. Now, there are certain instances, like I said. For every general rule of thumb, there are those exceptions. There's something referred to as dividend poaching, and things like that. But for the vast majority of cases, unless there's no time value left on the option, those options won't be exercised. So, one of the great things, here at The Motley Fool, we're long-term investors, we like to think in the long term. Because options are instruments that have a small lifespan, maybe three or four months, especially when you're writing puts, that's a sweet spot for where we're targeting, they can [...] on value pretty significantly over that time. You sell the put option and the stock falls, the value may increased by a smaller percentage in terms of dollars -- so, the stock falls $1, maybe your puts only change by $0.50. But, in terms of percentages, the move is going to be a lot greater. So, you can see those fluctuating values and just think to yourself, "Oh my gosh, what did I get myself into?" But, you just have to sit pat and have that long-term, "Here's why I initially did the strategy, we're going to ride it out and wait and see and let that time out," because that time value component is going to fluctuate significantly. But over time, because, say you buy an option that expires in four months -- that's worth a lot more, because a lot more can happen in four months than if you bought an option that expires five days from now. The odds of the stock moving over the course of three or four months is a lot higher than over the course of five days. So, the time value, all things equal, ceteris paribus, the option that expires in three or four months from now is going to have a lot more time value than the one that expires in five days.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Lifestyle / Mobile / Apple / Apple dropping 32-bit app support could make almost 200,000 apps obsolete Apple dropping 32-bit app support could make almost 200,000 apps obsolete Matthew Wilson 15 hours ago Apple, Featured Tech News Back when iOS 7 was first introduced, Apple brought 64-bit support to its mobile operating system and since then, all iPhones and iPads have come with 64-bit capable SoCs. While Apple has continued to support both 32-bit and 64-bit apps in later versions of iOS, that will be changing this year. With iOS 11, Apple will be dropping support for 32-bit, meaning 200,000 apps will no longer work unless updated. Apple began warning developers of this change back in 2015, when it began notifying developers that all new apps would need to support 64-bit. Then in the iOS 10.3 beta back in January, a new warning was given, with 32-bit only apps getting the following warning on their store pages: “This app will not work with future versions of iOS. The developer of this app needs to update it to improve its compatibility”. Now with iOS 11 set to release in a few months time, researchers at SensorTower have assessed how many apps will be affected by this change. According to their research, Apple’s move away from 32-bit will mean at least 187,000 apps will become unusable. It will mainly be old, forgotten games that will stop working, though some education tools and entertainment apps will also be affected. That could change over the next few months though if app developers decide to push out updates with 64-bit support. KitGuru Says: At this point, it seems likely that this will be the year we see 32-bit support disappear on iOS. However, this will also mean eight percent of the App Store will suddenly no longer work, which is a huge change. Developers have had more than two years to upgrade to 64-bit though, so the change isn’t exactly sudden.  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags 64-bit Apple ios news Previous HyperX Cloud Revolver S Headset Review Next Android is now the most popular OS for web browsing worldwide Check Also DDR5 memory will provide twice the density and bandwidth of DDR4 While DDR4 RAM has only just broken into the mainstream in the last few years, … Adrian Wujtowicz I don’t like Apple but that’s something Microsoft should have done ages ago, time to move forward 🙂 Rocky40 This is one of the reasons I dislike Apple. I guess MS is starting to do some of this type of stuff now as well. Apple has been known to do whatever they want to for many years so this is nothing new. MS on the other hand has always been known to keep things working so if you had older software or hardware you knew it would work on a new version of Windows but I guess those days are over now for us PC users as well.

There is no deal on the bundle yet, but Apple has reportedly approached the networks about the idea already. Apple’s premium bundle would be available via iOS devices and the Apple TV, according to Recode.   Read: Hulu Adds CBS To Its Live TV Channel List, To Be Priced Under $40 Apple’s bundle would be similar to TV operators. However, traditional pay operators like Charter usually require users to pay for a basic channel package before offering a premium bundle. Apple would change that and allow consumers to directly pay for the bundle without having customers pay for other packages. Apple currently sells three networks individually, with HBO priced at $14.99 a month, Showtime $10.99 a month and Starz $8.99 a month. The price for the premium bundle is not know as of yet, but there may be a discount for the package of all three channels. Read: YouTube Streaming TV Service Announced, Channel List Includes ESPN, ABC, FXX, More Apple’s Premium Bundle Vs. Google Vs. Hulu Channel List Apple rivals Hulu and Google have announced their own plans. In February it was revealed Google will launch YouTube TV this spring, a streaming TV service that offers a bundle of cable and network channels for $35 per month. Channels which will make up the bundle include, Fox, NBC, ABC, CBS and FXX, ESPN, SEC Network, the Big Ten Network and other networks. HBO and Starz are not included, but Showtime will be available as an add-on for YouTube TV. Meanwhile Hulu announced a TV streaming bundle which will cost less than $40. Hulu made deals with Disney, CBS and Fox. Hulu’s live TV streaming service will feature live feeds from networks like Fox, ABC, ESPN, FX and more next year. The deals with Disney and Fox include 35 networks.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Imagination Technologies' share price plunged more than 70 percent after Apple, its biggest customer, said that the maker of iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches is to stop using its graphics technology. Imagination said Apple, which accounts for about half its revenue, had notified the British firm it was developing its own graphics chips and would no longer use Imagination's processing designs in 15 months to two years time. "The biggest risk to Imagination's business model was realised this morning," analysts at Investec said. "The loss of this revenue stream will have a material impact on the financials of the company." The technology company, which was founded in 1985 and listed in 1994, has licensed its processing designs to Apple from the time of the first iPod and receives a small royalty on every device using its graphics. Imagination said it doubted Apple could go it alone without violating Imagination's patents, and analysts said legal battles could lie ahead. "It would be extremely challenging for Apple to design a brand new GPU (graphics processor unit) architecture from basics, that is, without infringing our IP rights and also infringing our confidential information," Chief Executive Andrew Heath said. "As such we do not accept their assertion that they no longer require our technology." The company said it had asked Apple for evidence that it could dispense with all of Imagination's technology, "but Apple has declined to provide it". Apple declined to comment. Shares in Imagination, in which Apple holds an 8 percent stake, plunged to 76 pence, their lowest level since 2009 and about a 10th of their record of 734 pence hit in 2012. They were down 64 percent at 97 pence by 1350 GMT, giving the company a market value of 275 million pounds ($372 million), or 479 million pounds less than it was worth on Friday. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said it was not the first time Apple had cut off a supplier - Portal Player, Sigmatel, CSR and Wolfson were all abruptedly dropped. "There is a difference here though", they said. "Imagination holds significant patents around graphics cores, in particular those which allow lower power use, and is considering discussing different commercial arrangements with Apple." Imagination's shares rose sharply between 2009 and 2012 as sales of smartphones boomed and Apple and Intel bought stakes. The company was valued at more than 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) in April 2012. It struggled, however, to reduce its reliance on Apple, and has faced increased competition from the likes of chipmaker Qualcomm and British rival ARM, which developed its own graphics to complement its core processor blueprints. Imagination says it has just over 50 percent of the high-end smartphone market - nearly all of which stems from Apple, although MediaTek also selected its graphics for its new chipset last month. But Imagination only has 7 percent of the market for mid-tier devices, where it has been trying to gain share, including in phones made by Chinese manufacturers. Imagination said it would talk with Apple about alternative commercial arrangements. Analysts said there could be room for compromise, and it could even be a bargaining move by Apple to reduce royalties. Apple paid Imagination licence fees and royalties totalling 60.7 million pounds for the year to end-April 2016, half of its total revenue, and is expected to pay about 65 million pounds for this year, Imagination said. Most of its costs are incurred in developing technologies years ahead of when they are deployed in products, and it said there were minimal direct costs associated with Apple's revenue. Around half of its non-Apple revenue comes from the MIPS processing platform it bought in 2012 in an attempt to extend its product line-up beyond graphics. Customers for the MIPS technology include Israeli automated vehicle driving systems specialist Mobileye and Chinese chipmaker Spreadtrum Communications, according to analysts.  © 2017 Thomson/Reuters.

Shares in Imagination Tech crashed more than 70 percent on Monday after the UK company said its biggest customer, Apple, would stop using its graphics technology in iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. Imagination said Apple, which accounts for about half its revenue, had notified the British firm it was developing its own graphics chips and would no longer use Imagination’s processing designs in 15 months to two years time. Shares in Imagination, in which Apple holds an 8 percent stake, plunged to 76 pence, their lowest level since 2009 and about a 10th of their record of 734 pence hit in 2012. “The biggest risk to Imagination’s business model was realized this morning,” analysts at Investec said. “The loss of this revenue stream will have a material impact on the financials of the company.” Imagination’s shares were trading down 61 percent at 103 pence at 11:35 a.m. in New York, giving the company a market value of $372 million. The technology company has licensed its processing designs to Apple from the time of the iPod and receives a small royalty on every graphics chip used in a device. Imagination, however, said it doubted Apple could go it alone without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information, and analysts said legal battles could lie ahead. “This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it,” said the British company, which was founded in 1985 and listed in 1994. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Imagination’s shares rose sharply between 2009 and 2012 as sales of smartphones boomed and Apple and Intel bought stakes. The company was valued at more than $2.5 billion in April 2012. It struggled, however, to reduce its reliance on Apple, and has faced increased competition from the likes of chip maker Qualcomm and British rival ARM, which developed its own graphics to complement its core processor blueprints. Imagination says it has 50 percent of the high-end smartphone market, but only 7 percent of mid-tier devices, where it has been trying to regain market share, including in phones made by Chinese manufacturers. It said that Apple’s notification had triggered talks on alternative commercial arrangements for the current license and royalty agreement. Analysts said there could be room for a compromise, and it could be a bargaining move by Apple to reduce royalties. Apple paid Imagination license fees and royalties totaling $75 million for the year ended April 30, half of its total revenue, and is expected to pay about $81 million for this year, Imagination said. Most of its costs are incurred designing new technology years ahead of when it appears in devices, and it said there were minimal direct costs associated with the Apple revenue.

Scroll down for video  A place in the sun: Kelly Bensimon, once a Real Housewife Of New York City, was photographed enjoying a warmer climate than the one the Big Apple's dealing with at present Hoop earrings dangled alongside her face, and the ex-wife of 73-year-old French fashion photographer Gilles Bensimon had clasped on a glinting cross. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Kelly Bensimon lives it up on the beach in Florida | Daily Mail Online Kelly Bensimon flaunts bikini body in Florida | Daily Mail Online Share this article Share Kelly and Gilles - the latter of whom was once International Creative Director and Head Photographer at Elle - were married from 1997 until 2007. During that marriage, which was her first and his third, they produced two daughters and she wound up editing the inaugural two issues of Elle Accessories. Bodacious in Boca: The 48-year-old could be seen on Sunday gamboling about the beach, showcasing her bikini body in a white two-piece Garnishing the look: Letting her dark brown hair fly back in the breeze, she'd popped on an orange pair of aviator sunglasses and accessorized with bracelets and a watch By the middle of 2006, though, they'd officially separated and her editorship at the offshoot of the French-originated magazine was kaput, per the New York Times. She began appearing on Bravo as a Real Housewife Of New York during that show's 2009 second season, leaving after the fourth one ended in 2011. As to her figure, she's been open about her wellness regimen, telling Livingly in 2014: 'I don't skip meals, I'd rather eat three healthy meals than one bad one.' Dashes of glitz: Hoop earrings dangled alongside her face, and the ex-wife of 73-year-old French fashion photographer Gilles Bensimon had clasped on a glinting cross What's her secret?: As to her figure, she's been open about her wellness regimen, telling Livingly in 2014: 'I don't skip meals, I'd rather eat three healthy meals than one bad one' Her credo is: 'I believe that your body is a Ferrari - and I treat my body like a Ferrari. I'm 46, and I definitely have always been mindful of what my body needs.' As she recalled, 'I was an athlete as a young girl and I was always trained to eat a certain way and live a certain lifestyle, and that's translated into my adult life.' Workout-wise, 'for every day,' she could 'do the simplest thing, of doing 30 squats and a headstand, to going out on a 20 minute run, to spending 45 minutes in SoulCycle, to riding a horse with my friends for an hour.' Firmly held: Her credo is: 'I believe that your body is a Ferrari - and I treat my body like a Ferrari,' and she's noted that 'I definitely have always been mindful of what my body needs' Said she: 'It really runs the gamut. I love sports. I love tennis, I love golf, I mean, I hit golf balls by myself all the time off Hudson Pier and people think I'm an idiot.' In her self-assessment, 'I'm just a very physically and mentally active person, I don't know how to describe it any other way. I love to be stimulated.' She's also maintained, in the same interview, that 'your perception of your body and the reality of your body are two totally different things.' Old habits: As she recalled, 'I was an athlete as a young girl and I was always trained to eat a certain way and live a certain lifestyle, and that's translated into my adult life' Kelly's feeling is that 'If you just recognize what kind of body you have and are aware of what your inherent body should be and eat according to that, there is absolutely no reason you should not be a well-oiled machine.' She's said: 'There are people who are so obsessed with their bodies, and they're not recognizing that they should be obsessed with their ability to have an amazing life!' To hear her tell it: 'So many women have come up to me and say: "Oh you're a model, you're so skinny," and I say: "I'm not so skinny. I'm 5'10", I eat really well, I take care of myself, I exercise a lot, because that's my job." It's my job to look and feel good and have as much energy as possible so I can provide for my kids.'

The word from Recode is that Apple has approached three networks – HBO, Showtime and Starz – with a view to neatly rolling them into a single premium package to sell to subscribers. The bundle of channels could be available via iOS devices and its Apple TV box. Apple already sells the trio of channels individually to Apple TV subscribers, but a one-size-fits-all package at a reasonable price could make its service a much more accessible and appealing prospect – particularly since most pay TV operators usually demand a basic level of subscription before they will offer bonus bundles. There’s no news of Apple securing a deal with any of the networks it’s said to have approached just yet, but it’s typical of Apple to keep schtum until the eleventh hour. It’s not the first time we’ve suspected Apple of wanting to beat Netflix at its own game. In January, we heard the rumour that it’s tinkering with the idea of making original video content.

The development highlights how, through its sheer size, Apple’s decisions can make or break the fortune of entire companies that work with it. Imagination, a multimedia, processor and communications technology company, said Apple Inc. “will no longer use the group’s intellectual property in its new products” within two years. That would mean the company wouldn’t be eligible for royalty payments under existing agreements. Imagination says Apple has for years used the company’s technology in the graphics processor units of its phones, tablets and watches but has asserted that it is working on a “separate, independent” design to control its products. Imagination said “it would be extremely challenging” for Apple to design a new product without infringing Imagination’s intellectual property rights. “Accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple’s assertions,” the company said. There are longer-term issues than the loss of royalties and license fees, which amounted to 60.7 million pounds last year. Nick Kounoupias, a London-based intellectual property expert, pointed to Imagination’s assertion that Apple has not provided any evidence to back its assertion that it can do without Imagination’s technology without violating its intellectual property rights, patents and confidential information. To defend its rights, Imagination may ultimately have to sue the world’s biggest publicly traded company. Mr. Kounoupias described Apple’s behavior as “sinister.” “The reason it’s sinister is because big companies have a habit of doing what they like and then hiding behind deeper pockets than their opponents,” he said. Shares in Imagination Technologies were down 62 percent at 101 pence in London. That cut its market value from 759 million pounds to just 294 million pounds ($950 million to $368 million). That will hurt its main investors, including London-based asset managers Baillie Gifford, which bought about 34 million shares three years ago and currently owns an 11.6 percent stake. Apple itself owns 8 percent of the company, which would have resulted in a book loss of almost $50 million – a sum easily absorbed by the tech giant, itself worth $750 billion.   Filed under: Apple, U.K. Print Email Gmail Related Skorea Court: Apple Didn’t Violate Samsung Patents Apple Shares Fall on Disappointing Prices Apple Hit With More Patent Lawsuits Apple Reports 5 Percent Dip in iPhone Sales Apple Shares Slip After Report of Weak Production More in Business Asian Markets Gain on Japan Data, Awaiting U.S.-China Meeting Business Briefs – April 2, 2017 FOCUS: 10 Best Ways to Outsmart Your Car Dealer DuPont, Dow Push Back Merger Date Consumer Spending Up a Minuscule 0.1 Percent in February OP-ED How a 40-Year-Old Lawyer Could Help Reset U.S.-Russia Relations Expand, Don’t Cut, Pell Grant Program Rei’ach Nicho’ach Freedom Caucus Not Done Yet Brexit Doesn’t Have to Be a Disaster Hailing Haley The Healthcare Malaise Continues The Kid From Ashkelon Isn’t the Whole Story I Came Here as a Refugee.

Can the UK chip designer hit back? The US computer giant plans to make its own graphics chips rather than relying on Imagination's designs, but the UK outfit says it doesn't think Apple can do that without infringing its patents  James Moore Chief Business Commentator @JimMooreJourno Monday 3 April 2017 16:58 BST Click to follow The Independent Online iPhones currently contain chips based on Imagination Technologies' designs Getty Images Talk about a bad start to the week: Apple has brought the hammer down on chip designer Imagination Technologies, saying it doesn’t plan to use the UK company’s kit for very much longer.  The tech giant had licenced Imagination’s graphics technology in the iPhone and other products, paying royalties for the use of its designs. Apple is also a big shareholder, and even talked about buying the business a while back. Instead it bought some Imagination Tech staff, a number of whom have joined the business during the last couple of years. It’s cheaper that way.  Read more Shares in UK tech company crash after Apple says it no longer needs it Apple wins court ruling against banks to retain Apple Pay control iPhone 5 could lose access to future Apple software updates Naturally Imagination is not best pleased, and has questioned whether Apple can, in practice, manage to produce its own chips without in some way infringing upon its patents.  “Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination's technology, without violating Imagination's patents, intellectual property and confidential information,” it growled, in an announcement to the stock exchange.  And there was an explicit threat at the end: “Imagination has reserved all its rights in respect of Apple's unauthorised use of Imagination's confidential information and Imagination's intellectual property rights.” Cue another one of those patent lawsuits that seem to be endemic to the tech industry? A dream ticket for some ambitious lawyer working for a big London firm?  That’s one possible outcome. Trouble is, while Samsung Vs Apple (they fought a ding dong battle over design patents that reached the US supreme court last year) was like Ali vs Frazier, Imagination Technologies vs Apple looks like throwing flyweight Andrew Selby into the ring with one of the Klitschko brothers. With one hand tied behind his back. Why the latter? Not only is Imagination a mere fraction of Apple’s size with a mere fraction of its resources, Apple’s decision also takes away half its revenues and nearly all of its profits.  The company does have other customers. But there’s a reason it described its contract with the US giant as “essential” to its future.  Business picture of the day 37 show all Business picture of the day 1/37 Stopping climate change could boost the world economy by £15 trillion - Tuesday March 21 Efforts to slow climate change won’t just keep the planet habitable. They will also boost the world economy by $19 trillion (£15.2 trillion). Investments in renewable power and energy efficiency will add about 0.8 per cent to global gross domestic product by 2050, the International Renewable Energy Agency, or Irena, said Monday in a report produced for the German government. Governments are committing resources to green energy in a bid to keep warming within 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), of pre-industrial conditions, in accordance with the landmark Paris Agreement on global warming.

The theme park will be the first of its kind in the UK, and is being created by film company Paramount at a cost of £3.5 billion.

The partnership, which is owned by its employees, reduced the bonus to 6 per cent of salaries making it the lowest since 1954. It is the fourth year in a row that the payment has been cut. Pre-tax profits rose 21.2 per cent to £370.4m as overall sales rose 3.2 per cent but the group said it cut staff bonuses because of an “increasingly uncertain” market.

Reuters 6/37 Global sales of UK food and drink hit the £20bn mark for the first time - Tuesday February 21 Global sales of UK food and drink have hit the £20bn mark for the first time in history, as the Government prepares to ramp up its focus on international trade following the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Getty 7/37 Plastics industry 'pressured UK Government to cut recycling targets' - Friday February 17 Recycling targets in the UK were cut last year after successful lobbying from the plastics industry, a freedom of information request by Greenpeace has revealed. The Government came under fire last year after it announced that targets for plastic recycling would be reduced from 57 per cent to a mere 49 per cent for 2016 and then increased by 2 per cent each year to 2020, to a maximum of 57 per cent by 2020. AFP/Getty 8/37 Inflation hits 1.8% as post-Brexit pound weakness feeds through to high street - Tuesday February 14 UK consumer price inflation jumped to 1.8 per cent in the year to January, from a rise of 1.6 per cent in the year to December, as the slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum continued to trickle through to the high street. According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target. Getty Images 9/37 Lettuce crisis hits those who love it most: hungry British sea turtles - Friday February 10 The UK’s vegetable crisis has not only gripped the country’s supermarkets and healthy eaters, but also a bale of 12 hungry green sea turtles in aquariums across the country.

Tim Cook met Ms May at Downing Street on Thursday morning and reiterated the tech giant's plans to build a new UK headquarters at the Battersea Power Station as proof of the company's support of the UK. Getty 11/37 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) already designs its own CPUs for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. AAPL licenses the iPhone’s PowerVR GPU — graphics processing unit — from British chipmaker Imagination Technologies (OTCMKTS:IGNMF). Source: Apple Despite the long-term relationship (and Apple owning a stake in the company), AAPL has decided to go it alone on the iPhone graphics chip. Imagination Technologies confirmed the bad news this morning, triggering a panic sell-off that saw the company’s shares plummet by over 60%. AAPL’s Long Relationship with Imagination Technologies Apple has been licensing the iPhone GPU from Imagination Technologies since 2008. Its dependence on the company to provide the iPhone graphics chip led Apple to boost its investment in its graphics partner to a 10% stake in 2009. In 2014, it was announced that Apple had signed an extended deal with Imagination Technologies, agreeing to continue using its PowerVR GPUs in iPhones for a multiyear period. As the British chipmaker’s largest client, this was a big deal. However, despite the new licensing deal, the relationship between the two companies began to deteriorate. Last year, MacRumors reported Apple confirmed it had been in talks to acquire Imagination Technologies outright, but decided to pass. From there, AAPL began hiring talent from the chipmaker, and was rumored to be establishing a UK office to develop its own iPhone graphics chip. Apple to Design Its Own iPhone Graphics Chip Those rumors became fact this morning when Imagination Technologies posted a statement on its website confirming Apple’s move: “Imagination Technologies Group … has been notified by Apple Inc. (“Apple”), its largest customer, that Apple is of a view that it will no longer use the Group’s intellectual property in its new products in 15 months to two years time, and as such will not be eligible for royalty payments under the current license and royalty agreement.” The fallout was immediate, with Imagination Technologies stock dropping over 68% within hours. Designing a new iPhone GPU from scratch will be a challenge — especially without running into IP issues and while using a team with members from AAPL’s former long-term partner. Imagination Technologies notes this on its statement, saying: “Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights.” Next Page   1 2 View All View All   Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, http://investorplace.com/2017/04/apple-inc-aapl-stock-iphone-graphics-chip/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC More on InvestorPlace 5 Best Stocks to Buy for April Will Panera Sell Out to SBUX or MCD?

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Technology News | Mon Apr 3, 2017 | 3:57pm BST Imagination Technologies' shares plunge 70 percent after Apple ditches firm By Paul Sandle | LONDON LONDON Imagination Technologies (IMG.L) has been told by Apple (AAPL.O), its biggest customer, that the maker of iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches is to stop using its graphics technology in its new products, sending shares in the company crashing by more than 70 percent on Monday. Imagination said Apple, which accounts for about half its revenue, had notified the British firm it was developing its own graphics chips and would no longer use Imagination's processing designs in 15 months to two years time. "The biggest risk to Imagination's business model was realized this morning," analysts at Investec said. "The loss of this revenue stream will have a material impact on the financials of the company." The technology company, which was founded in 1985 and listed in 1994, has licensed its processing designs to Apple from the time of the first iPod and receives a small royalty on every device using its graphics. Imagination said it doubted Apple could go it alone without violating Imagination's patents, and analysts said legal battles could lie ahead. "It would be extremely challenging for Apple to design a brand new GPU (graphics processor unit) architecture from basics, that is, without infringing our IP rights and also infringing our confidential information," Chief Executive Andrew Heath said. "As such we do not accept their assertion that they no longer require our technology." The company said it had asked Apple for evidence that it could dispense with all of Imagination's technology, "but Apple has declined to provide it". Apple declined to comment. Shares in Imagination, in which Apple holds an 8 percent stake, plunged to 76 pence, their lowest level since 2009 and about a 10th of their record of 734 pence hit in 2012. They were down 64 percent at 97 pence by 1350 GMT, giving the company a market value of 275 million pounds ($372 million), or 479 million pounds less than it was worth on Friday. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said it was not the first time Apple had cut off a supplier - Portal Player, Sigmatel, CSR and Wolfson were all abruptedly dropped. "There is a difference here though", they said. "Imagination holds significant patents around graphics cores, in particular those which allow lower power use, and is considering discussing different commercial arrangements with Apple." Imagination's shares rose sharply between 2009 and 2012 as sales of smartphones boomed and Apple and Intel (INTC.O) bought stakes. The company was valued at more than 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) in April 2012. It struggled, however, to reduce its reliance on Apple, and has faced increased competition from the likes of chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM.O) and British rival ARM, which developed its own graphics to complement its core processor blueprints. Imagination says it has just over 50 percent of the high-end smartphone market - nearly all of which stems from Apple, although MediaTek (2454.TW) also selected its graphics for its new chipset last month. But Imagination only has 7 percent of the market for mid-tier devices, where it has been trying to gain share, including in phones made by Chinese manufacturers. Imagination said it would talk with Apple about alternative commercial arrangements. Analysts said there could be room for compromise, and it could even be a bargaining move by Apple to reduce royalties. Apple paid Imagination license fees and royalties totaling 60.7 million pounds for the year to end-April 2016, half of its total revenue, and is expected to pay about 65 million pounds for this year, Imagination said. Most of its costs are incurred in developing technologies years ahead of when they are deployed in products, and it said there were minimal direct costs associated with Apple's revenue. Around half of its non-Apple revenue comes from the MIPS processing platform it bought in 2012 in an attempt to extend its product line-up beyond graphics. Customers for the MIPS technology include Israeli automated vehicle driving systems specialist Mobileye (MBLY.N) and Chinese chipmaker Spreadtrum Communications, according to analysts.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH  • Business •  Markets Money Real Estate Legal Corporate News One News Page > Business > Apple's Imagination Technologies warning: What the analysts say Apple's Imagination Technologies warning: What the analysts say Monday, 3 April 2017 (23 hours ago) Imagination Technologies has gone from potential takeover target by Apple to being warned by the tech giant that its technology will be dropped from future devices. The UK company, which derives around half of its business from its licensing to Apple, indicated that it believes that Apple does not have the capabilities to create its own phone chips without infringing on Imagination's patents. *Read more*: Imagination Technologies share price drops 70 per cent after Apple warning Here's what analysts are saying... *Black swan moment* Neil Campling, analyst at Northern Trust: "It is undoubtedly a black swan moment for Imagination. There is no way they could have seen that coming. Apple is around 50 per cent of revenues. And with this dispute comes the additional overhang that Apple will seek to sell their shareholding. "To replace lost Apple revenues will need many design wins at other OEMs (original equipment maunfacturers) but that would take time and any near term beat from the Apple supercycle over the next 12 months will be overshadowed by this looming overhang. And, if Apple believes there is essentially a work around made possible, then other smartphone designers will be evaluating the same." *Sell from buy rating* N+1 Singer: Apple is Imagination’s biggest customer, expected to generate around £65m of revenue in full-year 2017, the majority of which drops to profit. Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging for Apple to design a brand new GPU architecture, without infringing on its intellectual property. If the group is unsuccessful in challenging Apple’s position, we would expect the group to need to make significant operational changes to align the cost base to the new revenue profile. Given the uncertainty around its largest revenue stream, and current net debt position, we move to Sell. *Kneejerk reaction?* ETX Capital senior market analyst Neil Wilson suggested the reaction - a 70 per cent crash in its share price -  is a kneejerk one to the bad news. "Apple is only half of revenues I understand, so perhaps the selloff today is overdone," he said. "Sounds like Imagination thinks Apple can’t just walk away like this so will be interesting to see if we get any comeback from Apple on what its plans are. Sounds like Imagination is prepared to launch legal action if Apple does walk away." *It makes sense (for Apple)* Neil Shah, analyst at counterpoint research tweeted that Apple moving to make its own chips makes sense. "Apple developing its own GPUs make perfect sense as many verticals / applications will be more graphic intensive.  "Many verticals such as automobiles, AR, VR are going to be super graphics oriented - hence move from CPU to GPU. See NVIDIA's growth. Apple building its own GPUs though from scratch will be challenging unless they have acquired IP in some form or mastered reverse engineering. Apple doing its own GPUs also points in direction of future Apple categories - AR, VR, Auto dashboards/HUDs, Gaming Hubs, etc. This leaves Imagination Technologies in a vulnerable spot, as it lost CPU/MCU war to ARM, GPU to NVIDIA (now Apple), Modem to Qualcomm." *The biggest risk to Imagination has been realised * Investec: "The biggest risk to Imagination’s business model was realised this morning, with the notification by Apple of its view that it will no longer use Imagination’s IP in its new products in fifteen months to two years’ time. Apple is Imagination’s largest customer and we had forecast it to account for around 60 per cent of Power VR volumes this year and around 50-60 per cent of group sales. This represents a major setback to our investment case and we place our forecasts, target price and recommendation under review. "Going forwards, the loss of this revenue stream will have a material impact on the financials of the company - while we would expect there will be some areas where cost reductions will be possible, Imagination will still need to invest in its IP roadmap to support its other customers. "Imagination has stated that Apple has presented no evidence that it will not be infringing IMG’s intellectual property when it moves to its own in-house offering. We see a risk of future legal battles ahead. Imagination has also stated it is discussing with Apple potential alternative commercial arrangements to its licence and royalty agreement, so there might be scope for a compromise deal at some stage. The material financial impact from a loss of its largest customer could raise the risk of other customers not signing future licences with Imagination until the situation with Apple is resolved." » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit Tech - 19 hours ago< > Embed Is Apple Developing iPhone Graphics Chips In House? 00:48 Cnet has reported that Apple is developing its own graphics processors to be used in future versions of products including the iPhone.

Apple's licensing agreement with Imagination has been in place since at least 2008. It owns more than 8 percent of the UK firm, and came close to acquiring it last year. A deal never materialized, but several Imagination employees were recruited by the iPhone maker. Imagination gets around half its revenue from Apple, thanks to royalties from its PowerVR graphics architecture found in iOS devices. While the firm does have licensing deals with other customers, Imagination called Apple’s contract “essential” in its latest annual report. Apple paid about £60.7 million (around $75.88 million) in royalties to Imagination last year, and it is forecast to pay about £65 million ($81.26 million) for the current financial year, according to the BBC. Ending the agreement may not be a smooth process for Apple. Imagination writes that the firm's plans to develop in-house chips could see it infringe on the UK company’s intellectual property rights. Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination's technology, without violating Imagination's patents, intellectual property and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it. Further, Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple's assertions. Imagination did note that it is looking at "potential alternative commercial arrangements" with Apple, though the news still wiped around £515 million ($643 million) off the value of the company.

Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect the tech giant to sell 82 million iPhone units during this year's holiday quarter, up from 78 million last year. But Wall Street might be lowballing Apple's wide base of existing iPhone users who are itching for an upgrade, Arcuri told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Monday. "This phone's going to be launching into an install base that's 50 percent bigger than the last big phone, the iPhone 6, launched into. So even if the upgrade rate is way lower, they're going to sell way more phones," Arcuri said. "I think the numbers are still way too low." Getty Images Apple CEO Tim Cook gestures on stage during an Apple special event at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on March 9, 2015 in San Francisco, California Last year, Apple reported three straight quarters of lower year-over-year sales, adding up to its first yearly decline since 2001. But a confluence of factors — Apple's return to iPhone sales growth, investments by famed investor Warren Buffett and the company's ambitions to double its services revenue — all came together at the right time, said Brian White, global head of technology hardware and software at Drexel Hamilton. "I think this still remains one of the most underappreciated stocks in the world," White said on "Squawk on the Street." "I think what people are starting to understand is they were negative on Apple for all the wrong reasons." Shares of Apple have already risen nearly 24 percent over the past three months. During the first quarter, the company added more than $140 billion to its market capitalization, more than the gains of the other 29 Dow components combined. Source: FactSet Keeping the Apple ecosystem interesting with additions like original content might help the company sell more phones, the analysts said. "They have at least one more big phone cycle here. There's a ton of innovation yet to come in the phone," Arcuri said. "You're going to have a foldable phone from Apple probably by 2019 ... I think there's a lot more lengths to go with just the phone. " To be sure, while Apple is shelling out big time on research and development, it is notoriously secretive about its new products. "What they are creating here is a vehicle that can capitalize on the world as it becomes a computer," White said. "Whether it's a TV, whether it's a watch, whether it's your home, whether it's a car. ... Today the phone is the biggest piece of it, but I think it's going to give people kind of the walkway into these other areas over time." Disclosure: Apple is an investment banking client of Drexel Hamilton.

Rather, as previously reported, the company is building its own GPU. There were rumors that Apple was in 'advanced talks' to acquire Imagination Technologies but based on a recent press release from Imagination Technologies that no longer appears to be a possibility. Imagination Technologies claims it would be 'extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture' without infringing on its intellectual property. It's requested evidence to substantiate Apple's assertion; however, as expected, Apple isn't sharing any details. Here's the full announcement made by Imagination Technologies. --- Imagination Technologies Group plc (LSE: IMG, “Imagination”, “the Group”) a leading multimedia, processor and communications technology company, has been notified by Apple Inc. (“Apple”), its largest customer, that Apple is of a view that it will no longer use the Group’s intellectual property in its new products in 15 months to two years time, and as such will not be eligible for royalty payments under the current license and royalty agreement. Apple has used Imagination’s technology and intellectual property for many years. It has formed the basis of Graphics Processor Units (“GPUs”) in Apple’s phones, tablets, iPods, TVs and watches. Apple has asserted that it has been working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination’s technology. Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it. Further, Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple’s assertions. Apple’s notification has led Imagination to discuss with Apple potential alternative commercial arrangements for the current license and royalty agreement. Imagination has reserved all its rights in respect of Apple’s unauthorised use of Imagination’s confidential information and Imagination’s intellectual property rights. A further announcement will be made in due course. --- Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Shutterstock Apple to develop game-changing iPhone component Chris Smith @chris_writes April 3rd, 2017 at 6:50 AM Share Tweet Well, Imagination that! Apple just confirmed something that we’ve been suspecting for a while now. The company is indeed working on its own graphics processing unit that could power iPhones, iPads — and Macs? — in the future, and that spells trouble for a long time Apple customer. UK tech company Imagination Technology announced on Monday that Apple will stop using its GPUs in “15 months to two years time.” Imagination Technologies’ revelation wiped £500 million of the company’s market value, as the stock opened 60% lower than its closing price on Friday. Don't Miss: Samsung is spending $9 billion on the iPhone We often talk about the importance of winning Apple’s iPhone supply business, and this is clear proof of what can happen to a company when the products it develops no longer serve Apple’s plans. “Apple is of a view that it will no longer use the Group’s intellectual property in its new products in 15 months to two years time, and as such will not be eligible for royalty payments under the current license and royalty agreement,” Imagination said. Apple, who owns an 8% stake in Imagination, currently accounts for half of the company’s revenue. Apple even considered purchasing Imagination last year, but those plans fell through. Instead, Apple hired a number of former Imagination employees, including former COO John Metcalfe, a 20-year veteran of the company. In its announcement of the news, Imagination also said that it’s prepared to take Apple to court should the iPhone maker violate its intellectual property. “Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information,” the Imaginaition said. “This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it.” “Further, Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple’s assertions.” Apple paid Imagination licensing fees totaling £60.7 million in the year ending in April 2016, half of its total revenue. According to Reuters, Apple should pay about £65 million this year. Apple is yet to announce any GPU chips of its own, and it’s likely it won’t make any announcements until it’s ready to unveil a product that will make use of the new chip.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 April 2017 by Military News Google eclipses Apple as most valuable brand of 2017 Brand Finance has released its list of the 100 most valuable American brands, and there’s a new No. 1. Google has taken the top spot from Apple. It’s now considered not only the country’s most valuable brand, but the world’s, as well. The company held the top spot previously in 2011. Its brand value is pegged at $109 billion. Brands are assed on a variety of factors, including “what proportion of a business’s revenue is contributed by the brand.” Part of Google’s rise to the top is the stagnation of Apple’s technological innovation and branding efforts. Brand Finance explains in a press release: 2017 has already delivered one major shock to the branding world: Apple has seen nearly $40 billion wiped off its brand value. Apple has over-exploited the goodwill of its customers by failing to maintain its technological advantage and delivering tweaks to existing products rather than genuine innovation. Brand value has fallen 27% since early 2016 to $107 billion, meaning that for the first time in over five years, America (and the world) has a new most valuable brand. Other brands have been hit with negative public perception as consumers turn toward healthier eating choices, and reject fast food, soda and sugar. Brand Finance says: Coca-Cola’s brand value was $43.1bn in 2007, making it the most valuable brand in America and the wider world. Today, however, its brand value now stands at just $31.8bn, putting it 16th in the US and 27 th internationally. Increasing concerns over the links between carbonated drinks and obesity have begun to undermine what the Coca-Cola brand has represented for over one hundred years. Pepsi is similarly suffering, falling 4% to $18.3 billion. The same trend is evident in the fast food industry. The brand values of McDonald’s, KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, Subway and Domino’s have all fallen due to heavy competition in an increasingly fragmented market, with healthier challenger brands offering greater choice for consumers.

Here are the top 10: 1. Google 2. Apple 3. Amazon.com 4. AT&T 5. Microsoft 6. Verizon 7. Walmart 8. Facebook 9. Wells Fargo 10.

See related  Government to restart £16bn Bradford & Bingley sale The company derives half its revenues from supplying chips for the iPhone and other Apple products. "[Its] technology has formed the basis of graphics processor units (GPU) in iPhones, iPads, iPods, TVs and watches," says The Guardian. "But Apple has been working on a separate, independent graphics design to control its products and has served notice that it will stop using Imagination's technology in its new products within 15 months to two years." Imagination's shares fell 61 per cent to 104.5p after the announcement, giving it a market valuation of less than £300m compared to more than £2bn in April 2012. The company made its biggest ever loss last year despite earning more than £60m from its Apple contract. However, it posted a £2.9m profit for the six months to October after slashing costs. It was expected to make around £65m from its Apple deal for the full year to the end of April.   Following today's news, the "market has been spooked by the real chance that Imagination could soon swing into substantial losses", said Steve Clayton, fund manager at Hargreaves Lansdown. Imagination has vowed not to go down without a fight and says Apple will not be able to sever all ties without infringing on its intellectual property rights. "Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination's technology, without violating Imagination's patents, intellectual property and confidential information," it said. "Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple's assertions." Talks have begun with Apple and the Guardian hints Imagination is gearing up for a legal battle with the Californian tech giant.

Not anymore. The company is on its third smartphone cycle and has consistently released excellent iPhone-rivalling handsets at wallet-friendly prices. The OnePlus 3T is the company's most recent product . It's a 5.5-inch smartphone with a Snapdragon 821 processor and 6GB of RAM. And, at £339, it's half the price of the iPhone 7 or the Google Pixel. But despite the 3T being unveiled only a few months ago, it was definitely an iterative update rather than a full-blown new product. Read More Eager gadget fans queue for hours to get new phone - and it's NOT made by Apple The new phone is believed to be coming later this year - with many internet rumours already circulating of a OnePlus 4. Here's what we know so far about it. (Photo: OnePlus 3T) Latest news Development of the new OnePlus phone looks to be underway according to a tweet from Evan Blass. Blass has a great track record when it comes to new smartphones and he recently tweeted an image believed to be the homescreen of the next OnePlus phone. Read More Samsung Galaxy S8 vs Google Pixel: Which Android smartphone comes out on top? We've no idea what to make of this - other than OnePlus is obviously continuing with its "Never Settle" mantra. Release date Looking back at the release dates for previous OnePlus phones gives us an idea of when to expect from the OnePlus 4. The OnePlus One was launched back in April 2014, followed by the OnePlus 2 in July 2015 and the OnePlus 3 in June 2016. Read More OnePlus 3T upgrade brings more power but keeps low price to undercut the iPhone 7 It's unlikely OnePlus will be able to squeeze out a phone in the next month, so we can probably expect it to drop in either June or July 2017. Just in time for some luxurious sun-soaked summer selfies. Price Price has made OnePlus the success it is. Being able to offer less affluent customers the same specs as their iPhone-toting friends has won the Chinese brand legions of fans. However, the more recent handsets have seen a bump in price - most notably due to the UK's decision to leave the EU. Read More Hidden feature in Apple iOS 10.3 update will free up extra space on your iPhone (Photo: OnePlus 3T) It's unlikely that the OnePlus 4 will come out with the same £600+ price tag that adorns the Samsung Galaxy S8 or the iPhone 7. Best guess is that the OnePlus 4 will probably arrive with a £400/£450 price point and the current OnePlus 3T will be downgraded to £350. Specs Smartphones have followed predictable upgrade cycles for a few years now, so predicting the innards of the OnePlus 4 isn't too tricky. In fact, a website has been set up solely devoted to the new phone. Those behind OnePlus4.net claim to have been given detailed information on what's under the new phone's bonnet. They claim it will feature 8GB of RAM, a Snapdragon 830 processor with the same 5.5-inch Full HD display and 64GB of on-board storage. Read More There's a worrying issue with the Samsung Galaxy S8's facial recognition software OnePlus 3T Launch (Photo: alphr) Meanwhile, the battery could be a massive 4,000mAh power pack that supports the company's much-publicised "Dash Charge" feature. For those unaware, the Dash Charge concept transplants much of the charging mojo from the phone itself to the adapter. That allows it to regulate temperature and energy flow. The result is, in OnePlus' words, "a day's power in half an hour". The fast charging technology has been a big deal for OnePlus over the last year and we don't expect any different from the OnePlus 4. Other rumours are sure to circulate about the phone as its official unveiling draws closer. We'll keep this article updated with all the recent OnePlus 4 news, so remember to keep checking back.

Paul Sandle Imagination Tech said Apple had notified the British firm it was developing its own graphics chips. London: Shares in Imagination Tech crashed more than 70% on Monday after the British company said its biggest customer, Apple, would stop using its graphics technology in iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. Imagination said Apple, which accounts for about half its revenue, had notified the British firm it was developing its own graphics chips and would no longer use Imagination’s processing designs in 15 months to two years time. Shares in Imagination, in which Apple holds an 8% stake, plunged to 76 pence, their lowest level since 2009 and about a 10th of their record of 734 pence hit in 2012. “The biggest risk to Imagination’s business model was realised this morning,” analysts at Investec said. “The loss of this revenue stream will have a material impact on the financials of the company.” ALSO READ | Apple sparks row with pledge to drop Imagination Tech graphics Imagination’s shares were trading down 61% at 105 pence by 0915 GMT, giving the company a market value of £298 million ($372 million), or £463 million less than it was worth on Friday. The technology company has licensed its processing designs to Apple from the time of the iPod and receives a small royalty on every graphics chip used in a device. Imagination, however, said it doubted Apple could go it alone without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information, and analysts said legal battles could lie ahead. “This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it,” said the British company, which was founded in 1985 and listed in 1994. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Imagination’s shares rose sharply between 2009 and 2012 as sales of smartphones boomed and Apple and Intel bought stakes. The company was valued at more than €2 billion ($2.5 billion) in April 2012. It struggled, however, to reduce its reliance on Apple, and has faced increased competition from the likes of chipmaker Qualcomm and British rival ARM, which developed its own graphics to complement its core processor blueprints. Imagination says it has 50% of the high-end smartphone market, but only 7% of mid-tier devices, where it has been trying to regain market share, including in phones made by Chinese manufacturers. It said that Apple’s notification had triggered talks on alternative commercial arrangements for the current license and royalty agreement. Analysts said there could be room for a compromise, and it could be a bargaining move by Apple to reduce royalties. Apple paid Imagination licence fees and royalties totalling £60.7 million for the year to end-April 2016, half of its total revenue, and is expected to pay about £65 million for this year, Imagination said. Most of its costs are incurred designing new technology years ahead of when it appears in devices, and it said there were minimal direct costs associated with the Apple revenue.

  Processors PC Cases Video Cards Motherboards Storage Mobile Memory Cooling Misc News Home | Forum | Shop | RSS Search Legit Reviews News  Apple Tipped to Abandon PowerVR Graphics Processors Apple Tipped to Abandon PowerVR Graphics Processors Posted by Shane McGlaun | Mon, Apr 03, 2017 - 9:06 AM Imagination Technologies is the company that owns the tech behind the PowerVR graphics processors that are currently used in the iPhone and iPad devices. The company has announced that Apple has stated that it will no longer be licensing the PowerVR tech for the iPhone or iPad in less than two years. Imagination has issued a statement saying that Apple is working on its own independent graphics chip design. Imagination Technologies said Apple is, “working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination’s technology.” Imagination has to be reeling at this announcement because Apple is about half the companies revenu. At the same time Imagination is dubious of Apple being able to design a graphics chip that wouldn’t infringe on patents that Imagination holds. That means that Apple’s new graphics processor would be under serious scrutinization for patent infringement. It also means that if Apple plans to abandon Imagination and move forward with its own graphics processor that the design of said GPU might be vastly different from what Apple is using today. Imagination says that it requested proof from Apple that it would be able to build a graphics chip that wouldn’t infringe on Imagination’s intellectual property, but Apple declined to give that proof reports The Verge. Imagination says that Apple doesn’t accept Imagination’s claim that it would be “extremely challenging” to build a GPU from “basics” without infringing on Imagination’s intellectual property. Imagination says that it and Apple are currently working on alternative commercial arrangements. Apple currently owns 8% of Imagination Technologies and held talks at one point to acquire Imagination Technologies, but declined to make a full merger.

A Bloomberg report from October claimed the iPhone maker had refocused its efforts on developing software for autonomous cars, rather than an actual vehicle of its own. The secretive "Project Titan" team was said to have been reduced dramatically as a result of the decision, with sources claiming the project was "blighted by internal strife." In other words, it was all a bit disappointing following the months of speculation and rumours that an Apple Car was in the works. Related: Apple Car And although there's been a few developments to suggest the car may still arrive, such as Apple's December letter to America's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there's not been a whole lot to suggest the company is still serious about building its own autonomous vehicle. But today, it seems there could be hope for Project Titan, as a new supplier list seems to suggest Apple is still working on such a vehicle. The list of Apple suppliers (via) highlights the firm's environmental responsibility, and includes, for the first time, German company Bosch. It's been known for some time that the firm, listed as Robert Bosch GmbH, supplies parts for iPhones, but the facility featured in this latest supplier list reportedly produces automotive electronics. The Tuebinger Strasse 123 facility in Reutlingen, Germany is said to work on "functional areas" of research and development, alongside the "manufacture of mobility solutions." While it's not known exactly what parts this facility provided to Apple, AppleInsider says it's confirmed with Bosch employees "not authoriseed to speak on behalf of the company" that the products supplied are "automotive and mobility-enhancement related". Of course, there's no way to know for sure just what Apple is doing here. It could be that the parts provided are used for testing the autonomous software the company is said to be working on after downsizing the Project Titan team. But it's a promising development for those that still want to see a fully autonomous car from the firm – a car that was once said to be set for a 2020 release. At this point, it's anyone's guess when or if the car will arrive, but stay tuned for more in the coming months.

There's long been rumors of Apple working on their own GPU designs for future iPhones/iPads, but it's looking more and more likely now that Apple has let Imagination know they will not be relying upon them in the future. Their issued announcement mentions in part, "Apple is of a view that it will no longer use the Group's intellectual property in its new products in 15 months to two years time, and as such will not be eligible for royalty payments under the current license and royalty agreement." More details on BBC.com. With Apple being Imagination's largest customer, the company's stock is getting hammered and as of writing is down around 63% today. 21 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Stephanie BodoniGaspard Sebag The European Commission may be moving ahead with a decision in the McDonald’s case before the EU’s summer break in August. Photo: Getty Images Berlin/Paris: A European Union (EU) probe into McDonald’s Corp. is entering its final stages after officials gathered information on whether the Big Mac maker unfairly benefited from a hefty tax break in Luxembourg, according to people familiar with the case. The European Commission may be moving ahead with a decision in the McDonald’s case before the EU’s summer break in August, according to the people, who asked not to be named because details of state-aid investigations are confidential. That means the ruling could arrive before another pending decision on Amazon.com Inc.’s tax deals with Luxembourg, the people said. EU Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager has been cracking down on tax loopholes, ordering Apple Inc. in August to pay as much as €13 billion ($13.9 billion) plus interest in back taxes over an illegal accord with Ireland. Shortly after, she warned that Amazon and McDonald’s were next “in the pipeline.” At stake are billions that multinational companies have squirreled away in tax havens, out of the reach of authorities in the countries where they make most of their sales. Partly in response to the EU probe, McDonald’s announced in December it will ditch Luxembourg and switch its non-US tax base to the UK, where it would create a new international holding company in charge of most of the royalties received from licensing intellectual property rights outside the US. Billion euros Alongside the EU case, the hamburger giant has been facing criticism from trade unions and consumer groups, alleging the company avoided more than €1 billion in taxes in Europe between 2009 and 2013. An EU official last year called the McDonald’s case very instructive in showing how far some companies push authorities to avoid paying any taxes. The Brussels-based commission opened its probe into McDonald’s more than a year after starting an in-depth investigation of Amazon’s tax affairs. Other cases opened around the same time as Amazon have led to decisions in which Starbucks Corp. and a Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV unit were ordered to each pay as much as €30 million in back taxes to the Netherlands and Luxembourg respectively. Court appeals in all cases are already pending, including ones by Ireland and Apple over their EU state-aid decision. McDonald’s didn’t respond to requests for comment. Amazon and the EU declined to comment. Tense relations The investigations have been creating tensions in EU-US relations, with then US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew writing to Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker last year about the “disturbing international tax precedents” that the EU probes are creating. The EU antitrust chief, Vestager, said in a Bloomberg Television interview last week that she is open to discussions with the new administration. “We’re more than happy to talk about how our approach is different from the approach of the US,” Vestager told Bloomberg TV’s David Gura in the 31 March interview. “We share the concerns that sometimes businesses can harm competition. For us in Europe, it’s also important that governments cannot harm competition by handing out selective benefits to certain companies, or groups of companies.” Last week at an event in Paris, a former senior US Treasury official continued the criticism of the EU for putting antitrust lawyers in charge of delving into “very, very tricky” issues that have troubled tax experts for years, such as profit attribution in the Apple case. “The commission has got itself now in a position where it’s a bunch of plumbers doing electrical work,” Robert Stack, the Treasury’s deputy assistant secretary for international tax affairs under the previous administration, said 27 March. “The commission has probably bitten off more than it can chew.” Gert-Jan Koopman, the commission official in charge of the state-aid probes, took Stack’s remarks in stride. He said the goal of the EU’s state-aid enforcement is to avoid subsidy races, whatever the industry. He then hit back with a Shakespeare reference. “There is something rotten in the land of tax if these matters are considered to be just a matter of technical interpretation,” Koopman said at the Paris event. “It is very hard to understand how it is possible that a company operates in Europe and in effect pays hardly any tax whatsoever.” Bloomberg Stephanie BodoniGaspard Sebag Topics: McDonald's tax probe tax investigation European Union Margrethe Vestager More From Livemint READ MORE Forget compassionate capitalism, just some fairness will do St Petersburg blast: Kyrgyz-born Russian citizen likely suspect Sri Lanka releases 18 Tamil Nadu fishermen First Published: Mon, Apr 03 2017. 07 17 PM IST Editor's Picks Donald Trump begins crackdown on H-1B visa programme GST’s last and critical lap | Arvind Subramanian RBI clears proposal to introduce Rs200 notes Latest News Forget compassionate capitalism, just some fairness will do St Petersburg blast: Kyrgyz-born Russian citizen likely suspect Sri Lanka releases 18 Tamil Nadu fishermen Under pressure, Snapdeal woos employees with promises of profit Govt exceeds 2016-17 tax collection target, collects Rs17.10 trillion Mint On Sunday Forget Matt Damon, The Great Wall is about China’s quest for global dominance The search for god through the eyes of a child How a famine happens: The tale of South Sudan The thin line between greatness and madness Letter from...

Apple May Offer Premium HBO/Showtime/Starz TV Bundle Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple May Offer Premium HBO/Showtime/Starz TV Bundle Image courtesy of Adam Fagen April 3, 2017 9:41 am EDT By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk apple let's get together pay tv pay tv bundles streaming streaming tv One reason some TV fans are tempted to cut the cord? Having to pay for a whole slew of basic channels when all you really want to watch is a few. Those are the people Apple is after with a reported plan to sell HBO, Showtime, and Starz as a bundle. According to Recode, Apple is busy trying to talk those networks into becoming part of one standalone product that customers could access via iOS devices and Apple TV. It’s unclear how much Apple would charge for a bundle, as HBO is currently $15/month, Showtime is $11/month, and Starz is $9/month. While companies like AT&T and Dish sell web TV packages, Re/code notes, Apple has said in the past that it wouldn’t get into pay TV bundles. Apple has either changed its mind, or it just can’t resist the thought of all those eager Game of Thrones fans gearing up for a final season with the Starks, Snows, and Targaryens. This wouldn’t be Apple’s first attempt at a streaming TV service: Back in 2015, the company was talking to programmers about offering a streaming service and on-demand library that would include about 25 channels, as well as some broadcasters. That plan was first just delayed by a year and then eventually fell apart after Apple reportedly had a tough time licensing content. This effort might be easier for Apple to pull off, however, as it only includes three networks and not a long lineup of channels and broadcasters.

As Imagination Technologies Group Plc has now learned, it’s lucrative to be a favorite Apple supplier -- until you’re not. Apple notified Imagination that it will no longer be using the British company’s graphics technology within the next two years. The news Monday sent Imagination’s shares down as much as 72 percent. Apple is Imagination’s largest customer, providing just over half its revenue. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Just as a household product’s success can be determined by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the fate of component suppliers around the world are often based on the product decisions of Apple engineers and executives. With about 211.9 million iPhones sold last year, Apple’s scale gives it considerable leverage over suppliers. Sixteen companies receive at least half their revenue from Apple, including Cirrus Logic Inc and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Imagination has long been one of Apple’s closest suppliers. Its graphics technology has been inside every iPhone and iPad released, allowing for things such as playing games. In 2008, Apple began building what’s now an 8 percent stake in Imagination.  The partnership has been a financial boon for the chip supplier, whose revenue has more than tripled since the iPhone was first released in 2007. Imagination even has an office near Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California, so its engineers can work more closely with Apple. The two companies held talks last year about combining, but a deal the didn’t come together. Apple has recently hired several people from Imagination, including former chief operating officer John Metcalfe as a senior director based in London. Now Imagination says Apple plans to make the graphics technology on its own. The U.K. company said it was negotiating with Apple, but Imagination’s stock still collapsed. Neil Campling, head of technology research at Northern Trust Securities, said Imagination is now "uninvestable." Roger Phillips, an analyst at Investec Ltd., said it was Imagination’s "biggest risk realized." The news spooked investors of other Apple suppliers. Dialog Semiconductor Plc., a U.K.-based chipmaker that gets about 69 percent of its sales from Apple, fell as much as 4.4 percent Monday, the most since December, according to data from Bloomberg. Apple has a history of being touchy with suppliers. In one current spat, Apple has sued chip supplier Qualcomm Inc. over the royalty it pays for cellular technologies used in modems for the iPhone and iPad. Apple and Samsung Electronics Co., which is a supplier for Apple in addition to being its biggest competitor, were entangled in patent lawsuits for years.  Other suppliers such as touch-screen maker TPK Holdings and audio-component maker Audience have also seen their stocks whipsaw based on orders from Apple. GT Advanced Technologies, which Apple hired to make a new kind of screen glass, filed for bankruptcy after Apple abandoned the project. "It is both a boon and a bane to have Apple as a customer," said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The development highlights how, through its sheer size, Apple's decisions can make or break the fortune of entire companies that work with it. Imagination, a multimedia, processor and communications technology company, said Apple Inc. "will no longer use the group's intellectual property in its new products" within two years. That would mean the company wouldn't be eligible for royalty payments under existing agreements. Imagination says Apple has for years used the company's technology in the graphics processor units of its phones, tablets and watches but has asserted that it is working on a "separate, independent" design to control its products. Imagination said "it would be extremely challenging" for Apple to design a new product without infringing Imagination's intellectual property rights. "Accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple's assertions," the company said. There are longer-term issues than the loss of royalties and license fees, which amounted to 60.7 million pounds last year. Nick Kounoupias, a London-based intellectual property expert, pointed to Imagination's assertion that Apple has not provided any evidence to back its assertion that it can do without Imagination's technology without violating its intellectual property rights, patents and confidential information. To defend its rights, Imagination may ultimately have to sue the world's biggest publicly traded company. Kounoupias described Apple's behavior as "sinister." "The reason it's sinister is because big companies have a habit of doing what they like and then hiding behind deeper pockets than their opponents," he said. Shares in Imagination Technologies closed down 62 percent at 103 pence in London. That cut its market value from 759 million pounds to just 290 million pounds ($950 million to $360 million). That will hurt its main investors, including London-based asset managers Baillie Gifford, which bought about 34 million shares three years ago and currently owns an 11.6 percent stake. Apple itself owns 8 percent of the company, which would have resulted in a book loss of almost $50 million - a sum easily absorbed by the tech giant, itself worth $750 billion.

Apple’s streaming TV box is the fourth most popular platform after Roku, Amazon’s fireTV and Google’s Chromecast. NordVPN comScore collected the data in December of last year. The company notes that despite the growing use of video on demand services, live TV still dominates, accounting for 84% of all viewing against 14.9% time-shifted TV and just 1.1% video on demand. However, this is very much driven by demographics: Millennials and Gen X spend more time watching digital media than live TV. In streaming services, Netflix is the unsurprising market leader at just under 40% penetration, followed by YouTube at around 27% and Amazon Video at a surprisingly high 17%. Hulu remains below 10%. It was reported over the weekend that Apple hasn’t entirely abandoned its plans to sell a streaming TV bundle, but is currently focusing on a ‘premium TV bundle‘ comprising HBO, Showtime, and Starz. But TV is itself declining in importance as people use other devices to stream video content. Smartphone usage has doubled since 2013, with tablet usage also up 26%. This has been in part driven by the fact that nearly one in eight U.S. Internet users are now mobile-only, with 18-24yo women the key demographic here, at 22%. On desktops, Safari retained its market share of 10% across the second half of last year, while Internet Explorer and Firefox saw their share fall. Google Chrome is the clear market leader at 51% of the desktop browser market, up from 48% across the six-month period, while Edge is gaining on Safari, up from 6% to 8%.

Kelly Fiveash (UK) - Apr 3, 2017 1:22 pm UTC Imagination Technologies reader comments 177 Share this story A year on from Apple being locked in potential buyout talks with Imagination Technologies, the iPhone maker is set to abandon the British chip design company. Further ReadingApple in “advanced talks” to acquire Imagination Technologies for PowerVR GPU Shares in Imagination were in free-fall on Monday morning after Imagination confirmed it would lose its biggest customer by 2019. "Apple is of a view that it will no longer use the group’s intellectual property in its new products in 15 months to two years time, and as such will not be eligible for royalty payments under the current license and royalty agreement," it said in a statement to the press. The struggling UK-based semiconductor supplier axed 350 jobs last year and said it needed to slash millions of pounds in operating costs, after it warned that a slump in iPhone sales has hurt the business. Roughly half the company's revenue derives from a licensing deal with Apple. Apple told the company that it is "working on a separate, independent graphics design" so as it can ditch Imagination Technologies and take more control of its products, but an IP row appears to be brewing. Imagination said: Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property, and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it. Further, Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple’s assertions. It said that talks about "potential alternative commercial arrangements for the current license and royalty agreement" were taking place with Apple, adding: "Imagination has reserved all its rights in respect of Apple’s unauthorised use of Imagination’s confidential information and Imagination’s intellectual property rights." Shares in Imagination are currently trading at 93.5p on the London Stock Market—down 65 percent following confirmation of Apple's decision to rip up its contract with the firm. In 2016, Apple paid nearly £60.7 million (about $75.8 million) in royalties to the British company, which reported total sales of £120 million (about $150 million) for the 12-month period. "There are no parties with whom the group has contractual or other arrangements which are essential to the business of the group except the contract with Apple," Imagination said in its most recent annual report to the City.

Use a VPN Jailbreak Guide: Can I jailbreak?   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple is developing its own GPU chips By Christian Zibreg, Apr 3, 2017 Tweet 2 Comments In a bombshell press release issued Monday, UK chip designer Imagination Technologies said Apple told it that it would end a fruitful deal to use Imagination’s blueprints for customized graphics cores in its own A-series chips powering iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple Watch and Apple TV devices. Apparently, the Cupertino company is now looking to create independent GPU designs that could be ready in about two year’s time. Shares of Imagination immediately plunged over 70 percent to their lowest level since the financial crisis in 2009, wiping over $625 million off the company’s market value. Apple is Imagination’s biggest customer: more than half of the UK company’s revenues come from Apple, as per The Financial Times. Imagination says Apple’s “asserted that it has been working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination’s technology.” In other words, Imagination will not be eligible for future royalty payments under the current license and royalty agreement. “There are no parties with whom the Group has contractual or other arrangements which are essential to the business of the Group except the contract with Apple Inc,” according to Imagination’s 2016 annual report. Surprisingly, Imagination claims Apple cannot develop bespoke mobile GPUs from scratch without violating its patents, intellectual property and confidential information. The company believe it would be “extremely challenging” to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights. Accordingly, Imagination does not accept Apple’s assertions. The fabless semiconductor designer is discussing with Apple alternative arrangements for the current license and royalty deals. “Imagination has reserved all its rights in respect of Apple’s unauthorized use of Imagination’s confidential information and Imagination’s intellectual property rights,” reads the statement. The wording of Imagination’s statement suggests Apple’s decision to ditch their technology took them by surprise, indicating that the breakup between the two companies is poised to get messy. Since 2008, Apple’s been using customized versions of Imagination’s PowerVR designs under a licensing agreement. Imagination’s solutions power GPU cores in Apple’s A-series chips found inside iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple Watch and Apple TV devices which are sold to hundreds of millions of people around the world, paying the UK company an estimated $75+ million per year in licensing fees. Apple currently owns 8.48 percent of Imagination shares and is its third-largest shareholder. It’s unclear whether or not Apple will seek to sell their shareholding in light of today’s development. To replace lost Apple revenues, Imagination will need many design wins at other vendors. However, that would “take time and any near term beat from the Apple supercycle over the next twelve months will be overshadowed by this looming overhang,” Neil Campling, analyst at Northern Trust, told City A.M. “And, if Apple believes there is essentially a work around made possible, then other smartphone designers will be evaluating the same,” Campaign added. Apple was reportedly interested in acquiring Imagination but ultimately decided against it. Instead, it’s hired key talent away from the Hertfordshire-based company, including former COO John Metcalfe, Imagination’s 20-year veteran. Metcalfe has been working as a senior director at Apple since last July, his LinkedIn profile shows. In October 2015, Apple hired Imagination’s VP of Hardware Engineering to be a director based in the United Kingdom. More than two-dozen engineers and managers have quit Imagination and gone on to work at Apple over the past two years. Imagination posted its biggest loss in 2016, £61.5 million (about $77 million) on revenue of £120 million (approximately $150 million) due to weaker smartphone sales. Apple last renewed its contract with Imagination in February 2014. In addition to developing mobile GPUs that companies like Apple and others license for use in their own system-on-a-chip designs, the UK company is behind Pure digital radios and also creates and licenses processor designs for video processing and communications. Imagination was founded in 1985 and employs about 1,700 people, as per its website.
