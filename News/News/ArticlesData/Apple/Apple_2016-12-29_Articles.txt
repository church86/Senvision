Follow TechnoBuffalo What do you want from the next iPhone? An OLED screen? An improved camera? Maybe the death of the home button? We don’t know what Apple intends to release next year but won’t stop people from dreaming. This iPhone 8 concept, released last week, imagines what Apple’s device would look like if fans were involved in the design process. Everything from a bezel-less display to Touch ID embedded in the display is featured, making us pine for what could be in next year’s release. What’s notable about this concept is the cues it takes from devices like the V10 and V20. Rather than a home button, the concept inserts a secondary display at the bottom—a Touch Bar if you want to stick with Apple’s preferred vernacular. You’ll never get this iPhone The problem with concepts is we’ll never see them come to fruition. As badly as we want this iPhone to exist, it won’t. Not only because it’s technologically unfeasible, but because Apple is slow to adopt new trends in the market. It’s unlikely we’ll see an iPhone with wireless charging for at least a few years. In fact, we’ve been hearing next year’s release will simply be a general follow-up to the iPhone 7, with the possibility of a new color. That’s about as far from this concept as you can get. The New Year is just around the corner, however, which means we’ll soon start seeing iPhone rumors pop up with greater frequency. In the meantime, check out the concept and yearn for what will never be.

Breaking News Day at a glance Weather Horoscopes Ireland Business World Showbiz #Discover Sport Tech Jobs Property Login Terror attacks Trump presidency Review: Apple AirPods and going wireless PreviousNext 30/12/2016 - 17:37:47Back to Business Home Wireless headphones – the unlikely topic at the centre of one of the most fierce debates in the world of technology this year – was sparked by Apple and its new AirPods. By now you’ll have heard the arguments both for and against the earpieces – ranging from the impressive tech housed within them to their high price tag of £159. But what about living day-to-day with them? Is the prospect of losing one or both of the Pods as real as it seems? And crucially, is now the time to go wireless? The set-up (SNAPPA) No matter what your initial thoughts are on the AirPods, the set-up process and user experience is one that you can’t help but be impressed by. It’s driven by and centres on the small white carry case for the AirPods. It’s smart and subtle enough to be tucked into your jacket pocket or bag when you head out for the day, while also serving as a charger for the earphones when you’re not using them. The case should also provide more security against losing the Pods too, although it does remain a nagging fear when using them. Beyond that, the wireless connection to your phone is triggered by opening the lid of the case in close proximity to your device. Tap connect on the on-screen prompt and you’re paired. Not only that, but it’s the only time you’ll need to connect the AirPods; in future, as soon as you open the case lid, the connection will be made. (SNAPPA) The case also has a Lightning port so it can be charged when needed. This, combined with the case’s ability to charge the Pods, means you’re very unlikely to ever be hit by low battery anxiety as you make your way home. There’s nothing awkward or cumbersome about carrying the case or reaching for it to use your AirPods, it’s a set- up that makes sense and quickly becomes comfortable. From this angle, the AirPods appeal. The looks (SNAPPA) Apple is known for bringing a level of uniformity and tidiness to and across their various product lines, and that theme is quite clearly still at play here. If you’ve used EarPods at any point in the past four years you’ll be familiar with the look of the AirPods. The same smooth plastic earpieces that Apple provides wired together in each iPhone box are also used here, with the larger speaker sitting on what almost looks like the side of the earbud, and that shapes into your ear. Ignoring the obvious fact that the wires are gone, the only other noticeable change is the elongated bottom of the AirPods, which stretch down farther than their wired counterparts. This is to accommodate a greater amount of technology than any previous Apple earbud – more on that in a moment – but also to enable the microphone in each earpiece to be lower and ever so slightly closer to your mouth to detect when you talking to Siri. Sound and tech (SNAPPA) To prompt that voice control, wearers can double tap on either of the buds while in-ear, giving a hands-free voice control that removes the need for you to shout “Hey Siri” at your iPhone first. Of course, you’re likely to be listening to music most of the time you have the AirPods in and you won’t be disappointed with what you hear. For a wireless connection the AirPods offer good clarity of sound as well as a solid level bass you can feel and appreciate. Crucially, the AirPods feel like an upgrade on EarPods and a match for other premium wireless earphones. (SNAPPA) The small sensor in each Pod that automatically pauses and restarts music when you remove and replace a Pod in your ear is another premium feature offered by few others, adding to the high-end aura. Frankly, the AirPods need to do this to justify the price of £159 – which still feels too steep no matter how much you appreciate the comfort and smart set-up. Early in our testing we also experienced an unusual connection drop-out, where not only did audio drop from the AirPods, but it also shifted to playing loud on our iPhone, which on a crowded commuter train drew some looks. There were a couple of other moments of slight interference, but this was the most notable. (SNAPPA) However, looks should be expected when wearing AirPods – their appearance and bright white finish do catch the eye. The lack of wires only adds to the effect. In an age where wireless over-ear headphones and noise cancelling technology is readily available, it’s noticeable when a premium product such as the AirPods doesn’t offer it. When travelling on a loud underground or metro train, we struggled to hear our audio at times and that’s nothing short of frustrating. Of course, these aren’t over-ear headphones that can block out all surrounding sound, but there’s still room for improvement in cutting out such noise, perhaps in the earphone fit itself, which while comfortable for us, has been loose for others. Such are the perils of only offering one size for all. Verdict (SNAPPA) Having been unveiled to scepticism from some, the AirPods will and do exceed expectations in many ways. The Apple calling cards of smart set-up and use, comfort and head-turning design are expected, but it’s the introduction to wireless audio it will give many that is exciting. Make no mistake, AirPods are an excellent option for music fans who want a little more freedom of movement while listening to their favourite audio. They’re great to use for all occasions – from commuting to exercising – and that is true of few wireless headphones and so should be commended for that, as well as the smart case set-up. However, it’s extremely difficult to look past the price when weighing up whether to buy the AirPods. Yes, Apple is not known for undercutting rivals on price but £159 for a product some already feel they’re being pushed towards feels a step too far. Those who buy them will love them, but convincing consumers it costs this much to go wireless will be quite a fight.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software iOS 10.3 Update with ‘Theater Mode’ Releasing in Early January By Uzair Ghani Posted Dec 30, 2016 9Shares Share Tweet Submit iOS 10.3 update with a new ‘Theater Mode’ feature is bound for release in early January, according to a reputable source. What is ‘Theater Mode’? Your Guess is as Good as Ours – iOS 10.3 Update is Going to be Interesting, Nonetheless According to Sonny Dickson, a man famous for leaking key Apple announcements ahead of time, has taken to Twitter to reveal that Cupertino is all set to release the iOS 10.3 update (in beta) on January 10th. Interestingly, not a lot of details are at hand, but what we do have right now is something which Apple might end up calling ‘Theater Mode’. That’s not just it though, it’s also rumored that this new feature will have its dedicated button in the Control Center, and will be shaped like a popcorn. Given how the term ‘theater mode’ is treated by many different outlets already, it’s likely that the feature will bring dark mode to iOS (at long last) if nothing else. But of course, there could be a surprise waiting for us which we do not know about currently. Also, given how close we are to January 10th, we will know very soon what Apple has wrapped for us in the gift box. Here are all the tweets Sonny Dickson sent pertaining to the upcoming iOS 10.3 update: iOS 10.3 to feature a new Theatre mode – will include a new popcorn-shaped Control Center icon. — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) December 30, 2016 iOS 10.3 beta 1 is scheduled to seed on January 10th. Advertisement — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) December 30, 2016 We will, as ever, update our readers whenever the first beta of iOS 10.3 becomes available. And it is highly likely that the first release will be aimed towards developers only, with public beta testers getting a taste of the build within the same week. The developer beta, as you can tell already, can be accessed only by those who have an Apple Developer Program membership. Public beta software on the other hand, is absolutely free to download and try. Wrap Up Theater Mode is going to be an interesting addition to iOS 10 as it is a feature many users have been asking for, including me. But given how Apple is planning to add a flagship feature to its current OS ahead of iOS 11, it makes us curious what the next-gen software will pack under the hood. WWDC is just a few months away, and everything will be unveiled by Cupertino in great detail. Exciting times!

Apple also seems to have been caught off guard by the demand for its wireless earbuds, with many in-store locations already selling out of $219 CAD headphones. Prior to the AirPods official release, it was rumoured that Apple had delayed the wireless earphones due to manufacturing issues, though they eventually hit store at the start of the holiday shopping season. If you’ve been waiting to get your hands on AirPods, however, there are a number of Canadian Apple Stores that currently have the headphones in stock as of December 30th. Apple’s AirPods are also available for order from its Canadian website, though the shipping estimate comes in at six weeks. We’ve rounded up every Canadian Apple Store that has AirPods in stock below: Apple Carrefour Laval 3035, boulevard Le Carrefour, local C14B, H7T 1C8 Laval, Quebec Apple Chinook Centre 6455 Macleod Trail SWm T2H 0K8 Calgary, Alberta Apple Conestoga 550 King Street, N2L 5W6 Waterloo, Ontario Apple Coquitlam Centre 2829 Barnet Highway, V3B 5R5 Coquitlam, British Columbia Apple Eaton Centre 220 Yonge Street, M5B 2H1 Toronto, Ontario Apple Fairview 1800 Sheppard Avenue East, M2J 5A7 Toronto, Ontario Apple Fairview Pointe-Claire 6801, autoroute transcanadienne, H9R 5J2 Pointe-Claire, Quebec Apple Guildford Town Centre 10355 152 Street, V3R 7C1 Surrey, CBritish Columbia Apple Halifax Shopping Centre 7001 Mumford Road, B3L 4N9 Halifax, Nouvelle-Écosse Apple Mapleview Centre 900 Maple Avenue, L7S 2J8 Burlington, Ontario Apple Market Mall 3625 Shaganappi Trail NW, T3A 0E2 Calgary, Alberta Apple Markville Shopping Centre 5000 Highway 7 East, L3R 4M9 Markham, Ontario Apple Masonville 1680 Richmond Street North, N6G 3Y9 London, Ontario Apple Metrotown 320 4700 Kingsway, V5H 4J2 Burnaby, British Columbia Apple Pacific Centre 701 West Georgia Street, V7Y 1G5 Vancouver, Colombie-Britannique Apple Place Ste-Foy 2450 Boulevard Laurier, G1V 2L1 Québec, Quebec Apple Polo Park 1485 Portage Avenue, R3G 0W4 Winnipeg, Manitoba Apple Sherway Gardens 25 The West Mall, M9C 1B8 Toronto, Ontario Apple Square One 100 City Centre Drive, L5B 2C9 Mississauga, Ontario Apple Upper Canada Mall 17600 Yonge Street, L3Y 4Z1 Newmarket, Ontario Apple Yorkdale 3401 Dufferin Street, M6A 3A1 Toronto, Ontario Shogun Who wants this çrap really. An overpriced piece of hardware that is nowhere near justifiable in price and certainly not in quality Eric Tang I must say that the double-tapping on the earpod is very difficult and I am lucky if it registers my tapping; exchanged for another one and it has the same issue…additionally the lack of volume control on the pod itself is a big let down for me… Shogun You were a sucker to buy that crap in the first place. Eric Tang Well I like to try it anyway. Shogun For the money? Seriously? To each his own but really there are better choices out there for BT headphones.

Peking Duck First 2 locations are in France and half way down you have a Spanish location….hehe KBoland Nothing like fact checking the article you’re writing before hitting the submit button. This site is becoming a joke… Shogun The bigger question is why this is even a story. I mean who cares what store carries what but its obvious that its much-needed page filler and there is a need to churn out as much fluff to give the impression these guys are earning their pay for the little work they do here. What MS needs is some solid editorial commentary that drills down in the nuts and bolts of technology and its positive and negative impacts on society. A little analysis of the industries wouldn’t hurt either. I think they try in their SyrupCasts but something written would be a nice addition to the site and would give it far more substance than it has. KBoland You hit the nail on the head my friend. J-Ro These are really ideal for the gym. Countless times I seen people tangled in their cords or breaking their screens from having the phones too close. This will always be a top seller because of that one industry. Smanny How can you say these are ideal for the gym. Maybe they fit perfectly snug in your ears. However there are other earbuds that a much better for the gym. They even give you multiple ear tips so literally one size fits all. The other thing is some other earbuds offer built in music, that can last up to 3 hours, so no need to carry your phone to the gym at all. Plus some of them offer fitness tracking, and play back controls. All of which is missing from Apples airpods. Clearly you don’t know what is currently offered on the market. Not to mention if you want some better sounding Bluetooth headsets, then there are a number of them that are half the price or less. Randy I am getting the AirPods because it doesn’t use plasticky ear tips and it is true cordless. I have a jaybird and it is constantly falling because when I am wiping my sweat off my head with a towel, the wire that connect the 2 earbuds get accidentally pulled.

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus did good when they were launched this September, but many Apple fans were not really convinced with the idea of upgrading their handsets this year. It won’t be surprising if consumers will not upgrade their smartphones early next year either.  Given the situation that Apple is in, it appears the Cupertino giant has already planned of adjusting the number of devices it will be making in the first quarter of 2017. Reuters has learned from Nikkei that Apple has decided to trim production of its new iPhones by 10 percent based off of suppliers’ calculations.  An Apple spokesperson has declined to comment on the new information from suppliers. But looking back at this year’s Q1 production, Apple also did some adjustments on the production of its iPhones. From January through March 2016, the company slashed its output by 30 percent as per its inventory. Therefore, it isn’t a major shocker to hear news about the decrease in iPhone production starting next month.  Related Stories Apple AirPods: Supplier Expanding Production After High Demand iPhone 8 Rumors: Samsung To Supply Apple with AMOLED Panels Should You Buy Or Sell Apple Stock? Aside from the reduced output, new information from industry sources claims that Apple is also manufacturing iPhones in India in 2017. The industry sources have said that Apple’s Taiwanese manufacturer Wistron has plans of assembling more iPhones in Bangalore starting in April of next year. This initiative is seen as an advantage to Apple because India is one of the fastest-growing smartphone markets at present, according to Fortune. Meanwhile, Apple is also busy preparing its next flagship smartphones. If the latest rumors are to be believed, the tech giant could be releasing three iPhone 8 models next year: a 4.7-inch, 5.5-inch and 5.8-inch variants. Per our latest coverage of the iPhones, Samsung is going to supply Apple with curved display panels for the OLED version. Contrariwise, the other two models are sporting LCD screens.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Alas, according to Japan's Nikkei, 2017 is set to begin with a whimper, not a bang, as Apple will trim production of its iPhones by at least 10% in the first quarter of 2017. The latest disappointing news comes after the company slashed output in January-March 2016 due to accumulated inventory of the iPhone 6s line at the end of 2015. That experience led Apple to curb production of the iPhone 7, introduced in September, by around 20%. But the phones still have sold more sluggishly than expected. Information on production of the latest models and global sales suggests cuts in both the 7 and 7 Plus lines in the coming quarter. The larger iPhone 7 Plus, which features two cameras on its back face, remains popular. But a shortage of camera sensors has curbed Apple's ability to meet demand for the phones. U.S. research company IDC forecasts global smartphone shipments in 2016 on par with the 2015 level. Even Apple has had difficulty creating appealing new features, stifling demand from customers who otherwise would look to upgrade to the latest device. The Nikkei notes that while Japanese demand for the iPhone 7 line is strong, thanks in part to the phone's compatibility with contactless IC chip readers, commonly used for services such as payment. Japan makes up just 10% or so of the global smartphone market, and cannot compensate for sluggishness overall. Japanese component producers will again feel pain from the coming cuts. But orders from Chinese smartphone makers, as well as growing demand for automobile technology linked to automated driving, will soften the blow. *A source at a major parts producer called Apple's production cut "within expectations," saying the company has reduced the role Apple plays in its overall business*. For those expecting the same pace of growth out of Apple they have been used to for the past few years, that last statement is the last thing they wanted to hear. In response to the news, AAPL stock has dropped to intraday lows. » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: The Street - 3 days ago< > Embed Apple Reportedly Will Cut iPhone7 Production in the First Quarter 00:28 Shares of Apple ( ) were under pressure Friday after a Japanese newspaper reported the tech giant might cut iPhone production by 10% in the first quarter.

Apple to Cut iPhone 7 Production Due to Disappointing Sales GO Report claims production could be trimmed by 10 percent Dec 30, 2016 22:38 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  ​ Apple launched the iPhone 7 with much fanfare in the fall, but the lack of innovation and the similarities between the new model and its predecessor are dramatically affecting sales, with Cupertino now preparing a substantial decrease in production, a new report states. Japanese daily Nikkei reveals that Apple plans to trim production of the iPhone by as much as 10 percent in the first quarter of the next year particularly because both the standard and the Plus models are selling fewer units than expected. Surprisingly, the Plus has become more successful than the smaller iPhone, Nikkei writes, but its sales are below expectations as well because of a different reason. It looks like a shortage of camera sensors is impacting sales of the iPhone 7 Plus because Apple can’t build enough units to cope with demand - the Plus comes with a dual-camera system that uses two lenses instead of one, thus requiring more complex hardware than a traditional model. Apple still claiming the iPhone 7 is a hit Apple is obviously yet to acknowledge the rumored adjustments of iPhone 7 production, but such news wouldn’t come as a big surprise given the fact that Cupertino already reduced production of this model in September because of iPhone 6s inventories. The same source notes that Apple was forced to cut production of the iPhone 7 just before its launch by 20 percent because of the existing iPhone 6s stock. The iPhone 7 is very similar in terms of looks and features to its predecessor, while at the same time causing controversy and criticism due to a number of changes, such as the removal of the headphone jack. These have all contributed to declining demand for the iPhone, with Apple now believed to be putting all of its hopes into the next-generation model celebrating the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. Rumor has it that the 2017 iPhone would come with many more improvements, including an OLED display, as well as new features, such as wireless charging and a bezel-less design. #Apple#iPhone#iPhone 7#iPhone production subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple to Start iPhone Production in India Next Year First iPhone 7 Jailbreak (iOS 10.1.1) Now Available for Download The Jet White iPhone 7 Looks Stunning in This Mockup - Video 5-Inch iPhone to Launch Next Year with Vertical Dual-Camera System New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    iPhone 7 sales not going exactly as Apple hoped new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments How Apple Wanted (But Failed) to Boost Battery Life of Its New MacBook more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

The lawsuit alleges that Apple had patented but unimplemented technology that could lock out FaceTime to prevent distracted driving. That patent, filed in 2008 and approved in 2014, would prevent users from activating or using FaceTime while driving, utilizing a motion and scenery analyzer to lock out certain features under certain conditions. This is similar to the limitations that were placed on Pokémon that restricts the game's use while above a certain speed. The driver involved in the accident admitted to police that he was using Apple's FaceTime app on his iPhone when he collided with the other car. In fact, according to Courthouse News, FaceTime was still running when the police arrived. The Modisettes, the family of the young girl that was killed, say that Apple either failed to shut off the app or failed to give enough of a warning about how dangerous it is to use FaceTime while driving. The lawsuit claims Apple should be held accountable because it didn't implement the patented lock-out feature. Whether the claim has merit will be decided in court, but the logic behind the complaint is troubling. Patent protection is an important incentive for companies to innovate, and precedent that requires safety-related patents to be utilized (instead of giving the company the discretion to make that decision) could stifle creativity. It's unclear at this point why Apple decided not to utilize this technology, but it could certainly have valid reasons.

It was a busy year for Apple, and as an Apple customer I got to see this year’s updates in iOS and macOS. I’d like to share my three favorite apps that I’ve used this year. Cryptomator Cryptomator is a piece of open source software that gives you encryption for files you store in the cloud. It’s different than encrypted cloud storage providers like Mega or SpiderOak because it’s client-side. Cryptomator encrypts your files before it uploads them to the cloud. It works with Google Drive, iCloud Drive, Dropbox and OneDrive. Choosing a cloud provider Although iCloud Drive is already encrypted, I personally feel a bit better using this app. Cryptomator also has desktop apps for Windows, macOS and Linux. Some might consider this iOS app a bit pricey at $4.99, but you’re helping to support a small development team and keeping your data secure at the same time. Download it on the App Store. RNI Flashback I take a lot of photos with my iPhone, and I use a handful of editing apps. An interesting app I found is called RNI Flashback. RNI, or Really Nice Images, calls it a “pretty scientific experiment in photo processing.” The app’s main focus is film emulation—evoking the look of pre-digital photos. Editing Interface The company does this in a unique way, by using real film data to simulate how film layers combine when processing colors. Unlike other editing apps, there are no predefined filters. You tap a button to randomize the virtual “chemicals” to get an infinite variety of looks. RNI Flashback is $3.99 and completely worth it to make your photos stand out on Instagram. Download it on the App Store. Curiosity If you love learning new things, check out Curiosity’s app. Every day it presents you with random facts, deemed “most interesting.” You can also dive into a wide variety of subjects like art, history, math, science, etc. Daily Trivia At first glance, you’ll see each image with a fact on it. You can keep swiping, or choose to read the article given with each fact. It often provides a YouTube video about the subject too. The app is one of the first things I check in the morning, and I love learning random bits of trivia. Best of all, Curiosity is free, so check it out on the App Store.

Apple Still Planning to Bring the Watch Digital Crown on iPhones GO New patent shows Apple explores Digital Crown expansion Dec 30, 2016 22:02 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  ​ The Apple Watch Digital Crown is a neat little feature that makes a lot of sense on a smartwatch, especially because it benefits from the high build quality that Apple has become famous for, but it looks like Cupertino is already looking beyond the wrist to expand this control method. A new patent discovered by PatentlyApple shows that Apple wants to bring the Digital Crown on more devices in its portfolio, including the iPhone and the iPad, in a way that would provide owners with an additional touch input giving more accurate control of certain features. While it’s not yet clear how Apple would integrate the Digital Crown in the iPhone design, the company explains in the patent that this feature could be used to control what it’s being called a cube-based user interface in the operating system. Digital Crown’s purpose on an iPhone Users can thus easily rotate the Digital Crown to switch between multiple screens using a cube-like UI, similar to what some Android devices already offer. Apple thinks that this could lead to better organization of iPhone tasks, with the available screens integrated into this cube to play the role of small profiles that users can switch between by simply rotating the Digital Crown, such as work, home, and others. Additionally, the Digital Crown can be used for a variety of other tasks as well, including controlling the volume easily when listening to music - this makes sense given the fact that Apple is already exploring ways to make the iPhone bezel-less, which means that the company could give up on the side volume buttons. Resizing text in a browser could be another helpful feature of the Digital Crown, and so could be zooming in and out photos and other types of content. Certainly, Apple has more in mind when it comes to bringing this little Apple Watch feature on more of its devices, but for the moment, this is just in patent stage and there’s no evidence that mass production is prepared. It’s the second time we hear about such a plan, though, so don’t be too surprised if at some point in the future the Digital Crown shows up on an iPhone. #Apple#Apple Watch#iPhone#Digital Crown subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news iPhone X Concept Imagines the Anniversary iPhone Launching Next Year Apple to Start iPhone Production in India Next Year Apple Sued After iPhone Driver Using FaceTime Caused Fatal Accident iOS Bug Can Crash Messages App on Any New iPhone New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    Apple thinks the Digital Crown has a future beyond the wrist New ios.

This comes after the company slashed output in January-March 2016 due to accumulated inventory of the iPhone 6s line at the end of 2015. That experience led Apple to curb production of the iPhone 7, introduced in September, by around 20%. But the phones still have sold more sluggishly than expected. Information on production of the latest models and global sales suggests cuts in both the 7 and 7 Plus lines in the coming quarter. Nikkei says the larger iPhone 7 Plus is still popular but a shortage of camera sensors has prevented Apple from meeting demand. Demand in Japan for the iPhone 7 is strong; however, the country accounts for only about 10% of the market. Japanese component producers will again feel pain from the coming cuts. But orders from Chinese smartphone makers, as well as growing demand for automobile technology linked to automated driving, will soften the blow. Despite the negative reports, Apple still dominated the holiday season, activating over double the number of smartphones that Samsung did.

Reply · Like · Mark as Spam Great! - December 31, 2016 at 11:16pm Yes, there's no way that this adjustment is a normal occurrence every year. He couldn't have boosted production for this quarter and then cut next quarter after the surge across the holiday season. Yes there's no way that makes sense to ensure smooth flow of the product. Everyone else is a supply chain expert except Cook.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Liberty Utilities gives back in a big way Friday Dec 30, 2016 at 1:49 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — The town’s largest water provider partnered with several local organizations to provide more than $14,000 in donations to families in need throughout December. During the holiday season, Liberty Utilities, Apple Valley provided 120 Zacky Farm gift certificates to families in Apple Valley and Yermo, donated 100 pairs of shoes and socks to schoolchildren and treated 40 boys at the Cooper Home to Target gift cards. Employees also raised $8,300 throughout the year for the local chapter of the United Way, donated $1,000 to the Sunset Hills Children’s Foundation, contributed another $1,000 to High Desert Homeless Services and delivered clothing to to students at Yermo School. In a statement, Business Administration Manager Kristin Davenport said the company enjoyed making “the holidays a little brighter for children and families in the communities we serve.” In addition to partnering with the Desert Communities Region chapter of the Inland Empire United Way and the Sunset Hills Children’s Foundation, the company teamed with San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department’s Barstow Station, the Apple Valley Schools Foundation and the Happy Trails Children’s Foundation during its month of charity, the statement shows. “We truly appreciate the partnerships with these wonderful organizations that have such a positive impact in the region,” Davenport said. The 100 pairs of new shoes and socks were given via AVSF’s Shoe Bank Project to benefit Apple Valley Unified School District students. Meanwhile, the donation to HDHS will work to help High Desert residents “who have been displaced from long-term housing due to natural disaster or loss of income,” as well as provide short-term emergency shelter for non-residents. Toys donated by Liberty employees also were delivered to the Barstow Sheriff’s Station for distribution to local children. “Giving back to the community is part of our mission,” Davenport said. “It is especially fulfilling to see our company’s commitment and support of the worthy organizations and causes our team cares so deeply about.” Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254.

The S&P 500 technology sector's 0.72 percent drop put the broader index on track for its third straight day of declines, its longest losing streak since Nov. 4. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was set for its first weekly decline since the U.S. election. The rally had pushed the index to within 13 points of 20,000 last week, but after three straight days of losses, the index is now about 200 points shy. "The market is ending 2016 with a whimper. We entered the rally like a lion, but are leaving like a lamb," said Andre Bakhos, managing director of Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. "It is disappointing on many levels as investors believed that we are going to see the Dow at 20,000. The euphoria that was in motion in the Trump rally has fizzled." Until Thursday, the three main Wall Street indexes were set to end the year with double-digit percentage gains. The S&P is now on track to post a gain of 9.7 percent for the year, the Nasdaq 7.8 percent and the Dow 13.7 percent. At 12:35 p.m. ET (1735 GMT) the Dow was down 20.2 points, or 0.1 percent, at 19,799.58, the S&P 500 was down 5.87 points, or 0.26 percent, at 2,243.39 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 38.38 points, or 0.71 percent, at 5,393.71. Seven of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, with technology and consumer discretionary stocks taking the biggest hit. Apple was the biggest drag on all three indexes, falling 0.6 percent to $115.98 after the Nikkei financial daily reported that the company would cut production of the iPhone by about 10 percent. Apple suppliers also dropped on the news. Qualcomm, Skyworks Solutions, Cirrus Logic and Qorvo were down between 1 percent and 2 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,444 to 1,402. On the Nasdaq, 1,795 issues fell and 1,004 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed one new 52-week high and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 35 new highs and 36 new lows.

In subdued holiday trading, the S&P 500 declined for a third consecutive session. But the benchmark index still tallied an annual gain of 9.5 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 13.4 percent for 2016, even as it recorded its first weekly decline since the U.S. election on Nov. 8. Stocks stalled this week after surging in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential election. Investors have bet Trump will cut taxes and regulations and introduce fresh economic stimulus. "It's been such a significant run-up that there's been a pause," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. "We are to the point now where there's uncertainty with regard to what policies are implemented, when are they implemented and how are they going to affect the economy as a whole and industries specifically." The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 57.18 points, or 0.29 percent, to 19,762.6, the S&P 500 lost 10.43 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,238.83 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 48.97 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,383.12. The Dow slipped further from the 20,000 milestone, after coming within 13 points of the mark but not yet breaching it. The Dow is now up about 8 percent since the election. "It's been quite a rally, so not surprised to see some profit taking," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer with Solaris Asset Management in New York. "There might be some reality setting in that a lot of this rally is based on assumptions of stimulus legislation occurring, and it's really the market's hope that those actions occur and that there isn't a heated battle and a water down of some of these indicated proposals by the soon-to-be new administration," Ghriskey said. Apple shares fell 0.8 percent after a report that the company will trim iPhone production. Shares of Apple suppliers such as Cirrus Logic and Qualcomm also declined. Tech was the worst-performing major S&P sector, falling 1 percent. Big tech names such as Microsoft and Alphabet slumped more than 1 percent. Investors are wary that the market could be primed for a spill to start 2017, after the S&P 500 posted a surprisingly strong gain in 2016. In other corporate news, OPKO Health shares fell 18.8 percent after the company said its experimental drug for growth hormone deficiency in adults failed to provide a statistically significant benefit in a late-stage study. About 5.6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 6.8 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.23-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.49-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 1 new 52-week high and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 58 new highs and 48 new lows.

But the organization says it is standing by the results of its battery tests and won’t be running them again. Apple’s latest laptops became the first ever MacBook Pros to miss out on Consumer Reports’ coveted rating, after it found their battery life to be wildly inconsistent. The nonprofit discovered that the runtimes of all three machines varied by more than 10 hours in three consecutive tests. The13-inch model with the Touch Bar ran for 16 hours in the first trial, 12.75 hours in the second, and just 3.75 hours in the third. The 13-inch model without the Touch Bar worked for 19.5 hours in one trial but only 4.5 hours in the next. And the numbers for the 15-inch laptop ranged from 18.5 down to 8 hours. It’s those higher figures, which are almost double what Apple says the laptops are capable of, that have caused 9to5Mac to question the validity of the tests. The publication emailed Consumer Reports’ director of electronic testing, Maria Rerecich, suggesting the experiment should be repeated, but she believes such an action is unnecessary. “In this case, we don’t believe re-running the tests are warranted for several reasons. First, as we point out in our original article, experiencing very high battery life on MacBooks is not unusual for us – in fact we had a model in our comparative tests that got 19 hours,” she replied. “Second, we confirmed our brightness with three different meters, so we feel confident in our findings using this equipment. Finally, we monitor our tests very closely. There is an entry logged every minute, so we know from these entries that the app worked correctly,” Rerecich added. The tests also prompted Apple’s VP of Marketing, Phil Schiller, to make a statement. He said the Cupertino company was working with Consumer Reports to find an explanation for the results, which apparently do not match Apple's own extensive lab and field testing. A large number of MacBook Pro owners say the new machines’ poor battery life is a major problem. A 9to5Mac reader poll found the largest group were reporting the laptops lasting five hours or less before running out of juice. Earlier this month, Apple removed the ‘time remaining’ battery life estimate in the newest version of MacOS Sierra in response to the complaints.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Master Gardeners push for 'Seed' movie screening Friday Dec 30, 2016 at 1:09 PM Dec 30, 2016 at 3:45 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — A group of individuals with a passion to keep a pure seed supply and Americans healthy is attempting to get a local movie theater to screen “Seed: The Untold Story.” The David versus Goliath documentary explores how farmers are engaged in a battle with large biotech corporations who grow genetically modified crops, and sell seeds and pesticides to farmers across the country. The Master Gardeners requested the screening of the award-winning film to be shown at 7:30 p.m. on Jan. 18 at the Apple Valley Digiplex. The group needs 100 confirmed attendees by Friday 6 for the movie to be shown. Meredith “Mo” Hergenrader, a master gardener who owns Valhalla Goat Farm in Pinon Hills, said anyone interested in health and safety should attend the special screening. Hergenrader said she’s one of many who believe the actions of many agriculture giants have led to the manipulation of nature, the reduction of the variety of food being grown and has handcuffed farmers who must buy from their big agro-brother. Producers of the movie claim some 94 percent of seed varieties have disappeared over the last century, with biotech chemical companies controlling the majority of seeds, farmers, scientists and lawyers. “Bayer is buying out Monsanto and pretty soon one company will own up to 40 percent of our seeds, which are GMO and are used in various products,” Hergenrader said. “Food safety is important and we need to be aware that the government is not protecting us from consuming unhealthy product. To them, it’s all about the bottom dollar.” According to Hergenrader, who learned about seeds from her parents who kept “a wall of shelves full of seeds” at their Nebraska home, said she won her first gardening award at age 9 from the Spanish American War Veterans group. Hergenrader claims health risks come from consuming GMO corn, soy, cotton and canola-based products. She added that the incidents of allergies “skyrocketed” in Great Britain after residents began consuming soy products. Figures released by Allergy UK estimate that 45 percent of the country's population is affected by the food allergies, with a 10-fold increase in people with food intolerances in the UK over the last two decades. Hergenrader said consumers who want to avoid GMOs should buy “100 percent organic,” and use olive, coconut, sesame, grapeseed and topical oils. She added the use of pesticides and GMO corn and soy crops have caused the death of thousands of fish in the Great Lakes area. Some 39 species and 18 subspecies have vanished from Great Lakes over the past century. By 2050, the tally could reach as high as 86 species, with an extinction rate that is about 877 times higher than normal and has accelerated in the past 20 years, according to BioScience magazine. "Biotech crops and their food products have been used worldwide for about 14 years, since the first commercial planting in 1996. Since then, more than two trillion meals containing ingredients from biotech crops have been safely consumed," reported Monsanto. In addition to the leading U.S. regulatory agencies, Monsanto said regulatory agencies in 25 different countries have independently assessed these products and concluded they are safe for human consumption and the environment. Beekeeper and teacher Dale Wilcox, owner of The Natural Honey Company, told the Daily Press the use of pesticides is one of the many reasons for bee “colony collapse disorder,” which has severely reduced the agricultural bee population over the last five years. “These GMOs also change the plant’s DNA structure, resulting in weaker bees who can’t survive smaller pest infestation, nutritional deficits or travel to various parts of the state,” Wilcox, 54, said. “It’s like a domino effect, once man puts nature out of balance, the hive is affected.” Hergenrader said she’d like to see a group of like-minded people "gather to begin a conversation" and start a seed bank in the High Desert where they can wash, dry, store and trade non-GMO seeds with each other. As for the flim, Hergenrader said people shouldn’t think the cost of a $11 movie ticket is high, but should “consider it an investment in education and their health.” For more information on the seed bank, call 760-954-7792 or search Valhalla Goat Farm on Facebook.

Violet Blue, @violetblue 12.30.16 in Security Comments 691 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Hulton Archive/Getty Images Just when we thought things couldn't get worse than 2015's security and privacy disasters, the asshole known as 2016 came along to trample and pee on any hope we had left for a hack-free, secure future. This was the year Hollywood hacking scare-fantasies like War Games started to feel uncomfortably real. Yay... This lovely year, our government used Tor exploits, the UK passed its terrible Snooper's Charter, our TSA failed at cyber, the FBI got its hacking powers expanded and the Shadow Brokers tried to sell NSA secrets. But it's the stories below that shaped this year in hacking and cybersecurity. They may have even had a hand in changing the course of history for the free world. All for nothing All it takes to get the FBI's panties in a bunch is for someone to say "no" -- and bunched they became when the agency wanted to get into an encrypted iPhone related to the San Bernardino shootings. The FBI wanted Apple to build a custom version of iOS with a backdoor. Apple said it not only wouldn't, but couldn't break the phone's encryption for the case, because it would essentially break encryption on every other iPhone. This turned into a knock-down-drag-out fight both in congressional testimony and in the press. Everyone had an opinion, and the encryption debate became a vitriolic and emotional squabble. Eventually, the FBI picked itself up, dusted itself off, and ponied up $1.3 million for an exploit that allowed it into the phone. An unhealthy diagnosis When the Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital had its files held hostage in February by malware demanding payment, the digital plague known as ransomware finally got everyone's attention. While not the first emergency service organization to fall victim to these extortion schemes, the hospital's predicament highlighted the direness of the situation. The hospital was at a standstill with its systems responsible for CT scans, documentation, lab work, pharmacy functions and electronic communications all out of commission. Staff relied on pencil and paper; it was reported that radiation and oncology were temporarily shut down. The hospital eventually paid the ransom and got its files unlocked, and no one was harmed as a result of the disruption (that we know of). Still, it demonstrated just how fragile the systems our lives depend on have become. Ocean's 15 is going to be boring The SWIFT bank heists are the stuff blockbuster films are made of. That is, if we wanted to watch George Clooney sit at a computer mashing keys for about 1,000 hours. In April, hackers swiped $81 million from Bangladesh Bank thanks to a flaw in SWIFT international banking software. A bank in Vietnam was also hit with the same technique, to the tune of $1 million. Then May saw another round of SWIFT-related bank robberies, in which hackers snatched $12 million from an Ecuadorian bank. Most of the attacks targeted Australia, Hong Kong, the UK, the Ukraine and the US, and they probably won't stop anytime soon. It's now believed a second group is targeting banks using the same methods, again using malware to cover its tracks via SWIFT. Offshoring accountability There was one big hack and dump that actually felt like it wasn't done with completely evil intentions. That was the Panama Papers leak, in which a boatload of offshore-tax-haven records was released to the public via a handful of global news organizations. The offshore money-laundering firm Mossack Fonesca provided tax-avoidance services mostly to the rich and despotic, who wanted to stay technically within the law but needed to cover their unethical tracks. The resulting scandals prompted the prime minister of Iceland and FIFA ethics-committee member Juan Pedro Damiani to resign. Former UK Prime Minister David Cameron had some fessing up to do; leaders of Sudan and Azerbaijan, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko were also named in the papers. China's government went on damage control and demanded reporting on the Papers be stopped after the family members of eight Communist Party elites were shown to have dealings with offshore companies. Leave Britney alone Throughout the year, one group managed to ruin the day of many CEOs, companies, and celebrities: social media extortionists extraordinaire OurMine. Grabbing usernames and passwords from breach dumps, finding famous names and seeing if the credentials still work isn't exactly the work of hacking masterminds. But OurMine has made headlines time and again with this very simple formula. Big names on the "hacked by OurMine" list include Katy Perry, Marvel, Mark Zuckerberg, Google's Sundar Pichai, Yahoo's Marissa Mayer, AOL's Steve Case and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. They proved that even the people who should know better reuse passwords, and companies aren't doing a good enough job at telling users to change their passwords after a breach. Though, we can note with a small amount of dark amusement that one of its recent victims is Sony ... which you'd think would know all about password and security hygiene by now. What's the opposite of security? If there was a contest for getting embarrassingly hacked and being the worst at user security, Yahoo surely became the reigning queen of 2016. In fact, they won the race to the bottom so hard this year, the company may be hanging onto the crown for years to come. When Yahoo revealed in September it had been hacked in 2014, just after its sale began to Verizon, the truth started coming out. That incident affected a jaw-dropping 500 million Yahoo users. Turns out this was only one of the intrusions Yahoo failed to tell us about, because this month it revealed that it was hacked again, in 2013. This time, it took the crown for the biggest exposure of customer records and credentials, ever -- with over 1 billion accounts coming up pwned in a years-long compromise. Yahoo always had a tough slog when it came to staying afloat, but this year we found out that it really sucked at everything. But most especially security. When your DVR is a honeypot There was only one way this year could get worse when it came to hacking, and of course, it happened. Insecure IoT devices were leveraged via the Mirai Botnet to take out about half the internet when PayPal, The New York Times, Pinterest, Spotify, Twitter and many more sites went offline in October. WikiLeaks said it was all about them, everyone blamed Russia, and IoT hackers pretty much just rolled their eyes. The attackers did all this by exploiting the stupid decisions of "smart" appliance companies who left backdoors and default passwords in things like connected cameras and DVRs. The Mirai Botnet incident was only a partial use of the gigantic implanted malware bot-army, so that's just great. It certainly served as a warning -- albeit too late -- about security neglect in manufacturing, and just how fragile our internet economy and communications really are. Like D-Day, but for drama In July, President-elect Donald Trump invited the Russians to hack us in a very specific way... and they did. So weird, right? They even went the extra mile for him by taking down his Democratic opponent with a series of hacks (and subsequent leaks, via WikiLeaks) that may have swayed the election in the bad hombre's favor. It was the world's most painful lesson in cybersecurity. John Podesta got owned through bad advice encouraging him to click a phishing link, and every US state panicked about the vulnerability and hackability of its voting machines. The result has been an ugly, rolling-downhill cyberwar with Russia, pitting the incoming president against the White House and most governmental organizations who believe Russia fucked us over -- while Trump defends the 400-lb hackers who made him look good. And not just by physical comparison.

The news comes after Flurry Analytics showed that Apple still maintains a lead in holiday activations. This isn’t the first time Apple has cut back on iPhone production as a similar event occurred this year in the January – March quarter. That cut on production was around 30%, which Nikkei Asian Review says was caused by slowing sales of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. Though production of the iPhone is set to slow down in the coming year’s first quarter, that didn’t stop Apple from being another holiday hit this year. Apple devices saw a significant lead over Samsung in terms of device activations this past holiday. Apple came in first at 55% of the total activations, with runner-up Samsung following in at 21%. According to Nikkei, the latest models “sold more sluggishly than expected” and shortages of the camera sensors on the new devices have curbed Apple’s “ability to meet demand for the phones”. Zac Hall and Benjamin Mayo postulated what 2017 will bring for Apple products, and we’ve taken a look back at everything we know about the 10th anniversary iPhone thus far.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple This Text Message Could Disable Your iOS Messages Don Reisinger Tech Media Network (Tom's Guide)December 30, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Apple's Messages app could be permanently killed at the hands of one dangerous message, according to a new report. A security researcher going by the handle vincedes3 created a vCard that contains more than 14,000 lines of code. When the vCard is sent to an unsuspecting Messages user, it causes Messages to freak out and crash repeatedly. Even after you reset your device or turn it off and back on, the trouble continues. The result? A flaw that renders Apple's iOS Messages app completely useless. The flaw, which was earlier reported on by Gizmodo, is actually a problem with iOS. Apple's Messages app doesn't have the ability to interpret exceedingly sophisticated vCards, causing the Messages app to crash. While that's not necessarily a big deal (most vCards have no more than 300 lines of code and they're handled well in iOS) Apple's app automatically tries to open the last text message for users. Therefore, it creates a loop when there's a glitch in Messages that users can't escape. While the flaw has been affecting iOS users since iOS 8, according to vincedes3, it's never been a problem, since few people are trying to send vCards with that many lines of code. However, vincedes3 said that his tool is designed to highlight the flaw and illustrate that while iOS might be a generally secure operating system, it can still fall victim to sophisticated hackers. MORE: iOS 10 Messages: All the New Features and How to Use Them In fact, the vCard flaw is the second iOS Messages exploit this year. The first, which surfaced over the summer, would have allowed hackers to kill a person's iOS device whenever they opened a TIFF image containing malicious code. Although the vCard flaw isn't easy to overcome, it can be circumvented once you find yourself in that endless loop. According to vincedes3, you can simply send a text message via Siri, which will prompt the Messages app to open that text instead of the vCard. From there, simply remove the vCard text and you should be fine. If that doesn't work for some reason, vincedes3 has also launched a "save" webpage you can click on that will stop the flaw from running amok on your device. But if anything is certain, be wary of any vCards your hilarious friends decide to send your way.

Now two more patent applications have been published, suggesting Apple is continuing to take a serious look at bringing the UI feature to future iPhone and iPad models. Related: Apple Watch Series 2 review The initial filing, revealed in July, showed how the crown could be used to control volume, resize text, take a photo or scroll through menus. A second in August demonstrated how it could be used to give iOS a 3D UI that would make it possible to switch between a cube of common apps like Mail, Safari, Phone and Calendar. However, the patents unearthed today by Patently Apple (via 9to5Mac), show how haptic feedback could be added to the Digital Crown if it were deployed on iOS devices. The filing described “an exemplary rotary input that can rotate in a rotational direction as well as be displaced in a direction orthogonal to the rotational direction.” {puyllquote}If deployed it would see to give the user the illusion of a ‘click-click-click” sensation akin to turning a rotary wheel{/pullquote}. Of course, the appearance of these patents doesn’t mean Apple is certain to take future iOS devices in this direction. It does offer an insight into Apple's thinking though and, with iOS feeling a little stale, this might be a away to freshen things up.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Electronics Why iPhone production isn’t coming to the United States Why iPhone production isn’t coming to the United States By Ryan Whitwam on December 30, 2016 at 3:01 pm Comment Apple is not the top seller of smartphones in the world — not even close. It does, however, have the vast majority of smartphone profits in the world with an estimated 90%. The margins on Apple’s hardware are so large that it can out earn OEMs that sell several times as many phones. There’s been a lot of talk about encouraging the manufacturing of electronics in the US with the incoming Trump administration, but is it even feasible to build an iPhone in the US? If Apple built them in the US, would that really create many jobs? It is estimated that the iPhone 7 costs about $400 for Apple to produce. It sells for $649 in the US. A large chunk of the cost of making the phone has to do with getting components to the factories in China’s Zhengzhou region, a historically poor area that has been built up and perfectly tuned to churn out iPhones. This extreme specialization is one reason iPhone production would be very difficult to do cheaply in the US. Analysts have pointed out that when you figure in the increased wages for a US-based assembly operation, the cost of building an iPhone might only rise by 5%. I think that’s an amount that many people would be willing to pay. However, that calculation ignores many of the logistical issues. According to the New York Times, the Foxconn facilities in Zhengzhou can produce 500,000 iPhones per day. Foxconn has gotten to this point with the help of local government grants and subsidies totaling about $1.5 billion. The company has built huge facilities and employee dorms, and the government has added in infrastructure of its own. It laid down new roads and even built an airport just a few miles away from the factory to streamline the exporting process. It’s not unheard of for municipalities in the US to offer incentives to businesses that want to expand, but nothing on this scale. Apple has a sweet deal in China that it simply wouldn’t get in the US. The next problem in moving iPhone production stateside comes in actually getting the components here. Currently, Apple has nearly 800 suppliers for iPhone components, and almost half of them are in China. The vast majority of the others are in Asian countries. The logistics of getting all those parts to the US would add great expense beyond simply paying workers more. These supply chains have been built from the ground up to serve a Chinese manufacturing machine. Let’s just say that Apple decides to build a new factory in the US to assemble iPhones, and it somehow figures out how to do it without adding too much to the cost. It might not result in as many jobs as politicians would like to think. Even in China where labor is cheap, Foxconn is beginning to use robots to replace human workers. In the US, a new factory would undoubtedly be highly automated, limiting potential employment. Building iPhones in the US might sound nice, and it makes for good political rhetoric, but it’s not a silver bullet to create jobs. Smartphones has we know them were devised with Chinese manufacturing and Asian supply chains in mind. The cost of labor is only the first hurdle that would been to be cleared. Different US policies could bring some manufacturing jobs back, but automation is one of the major reasons those jobs don’t exist anymore — and no tariff policy or homegrown manufacturing initiative can easily change that.

Photo / AP Apple wants India to offer tax concessions on iPhones that the company plans to manufacture in the country, a person with knowledge of the matter said. The company wrote to the industry ministry last month seeking lower import and manufacturing duties, the person said, asking not to be identified citing rules on speaking to the media. The concessions should continue even after the government rolls out its goods and services tax which is expected to subsume all existing tariffs, the person said. The Cupertino, California-based manufacturer of iPads and iPhones is keen to kick-start operations in the world's fastest growing phone market as growth slows in countries such as China. Apple trails rivals selling cheaper handsets in the US$2 trillion (NZ$2.8t) Indian economy and producing devices in the country could accelerate the roll out of its iconic retail stores to capture burgeoning demand in the world's second-most populated nation. Apple's path toward a bigger slice of Indian sales hasn't been smooth. Its application to open stores was rejected as it fell foul of local rules that typically require at least 30 per cent of components to be made locally before a foreign company can sell through their own outlets. Apple makes most of its products in China and doesn't currently meet that criteria. Apple's spokesman in India, and Mattu J.P. Singh, a spokeswoman at India's Commerce and Industry Ministry didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants companies to make products in the country as part of his "Make in India" policy, aimed at reaping the benefits that come from manufacturing facilities and jobs. His administration doesn't want technology companies to sell products and take advantage of its vast consumer base without making their own capital investments. The company wants to start discussions with the tax department on future liability on its India earnings, the person said. It has also sought competitive advantages compared to other economies where they are already manufacturing. While Foxconn Technology Group -- Apple's main manufacturing partner -- has expressed plans to assemble phones in the country for brands like China's Xiaomi, most iPhones are put together in China. The Taiwanese company only began making its first smartphones in India in the middle of 2015.

Others share their life stories. A wife got rid of the handgun her abusive husband waved in her face. A young man handed over a brown paper bag with a loaded pistol inside. A mother dropped off a Glock she found in her son's dresser drawer. A pedestrian came in with a firearm found hidden in Washington Park. Pastor Charlie Muller of the Victory Christian Church has been the middle man for Albany County's illegal handgun buybacks for eight years, trading more than 500 anonymously surrendered weapons for $100 each. But it's a system on uncertain legal ground. Muller doesn't have a pistol permit to possess a handgun. And, even if he did, he's holding onto illegal firearms that can't be registered on a permit. "It's a judgment call and it does more good than harm. We have an arrangement," Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple said about his and District Attorney David Soares' decision to partner with a pastor. "We're trying to get these guns off the streets," the sheriff said after picking up 26 guns from Muller Friday. Muller could technically be charged with criminal possession of a weapon, but his plan to collect and transfer the guns to law enforcement shows no "criminal intent," the sheriff said. Muller and Apple attributed the program's success to their "unique" arrangement in Albany. Elsewhere a law enforcement agency participating in a gun buyback accepts the illegal guns directly. "People trust someone in the faith-based community more than they trust law enforcement," Apple said. "I have no idea who handed these guns in." Calls from anonymous civilians who want to surrender illegal handguns come to Muller's cellphone at all hours and he said he arranges to meet with them "immediately and wherever they want." After each hand-off, Muller unloads the weapons and snaps provided gun locks on each one, Apple said. Muller locks the guns in a safe inside a vault built into his church on Quail Street, which used to be a post office. "I got to trust the guy. He's been a great partner for us," Apple said. The sheriff said Muller uses the church's money to pay for each $100 trade. Once the guns are handed over to sheriff's deputies and tested, the county reimburses the pastor using asset forfeiture money collected by the district attorney's and sheriff's offices, Apple said. Deputies check every serial number and test fire each guns for ballistic examination. So far, none of the more than 500 guns handed over in the last eight years have been traced to a crime, Apple said. The guns are then destroyed in a metal-grinding machine. "We'll never know if that gun was going to be used for a violent crime or not," the sheriff said, "but now we know it won't ever be." emasters@timesunion.com • 518-454-5467 • @emilysmasters This is a TU+ story.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Silly as they look, AirPods are facing increased demand from consumers who want to buy Apple’s latest gadget. The headphones went on sale just before Christmas but sold out within an hour. Shipping times are now pushed back into February. As a result, Apple’s suppliers are working around the clock to boost production. DigiTimes cited a report from China’s Economic Daily News on Friday, noting that Apple’s supplier Inventec is “working overtime to deliver orders” placed for Apple’s AirPods. The report said Inventec is also “expanding capacity,” which should allow it to create even more AirPods. AirPods quality control should be a focus, too This doesn’t mean that your order will ship any sooner but it should help Apple have enough stock in the coming months that new orders won’t be delayed as long. Apple should be focused on quality control as well, however, because reports are already starting to surface that suggest the AirPod travel case doesn’t actually provide as much battery life as advertised. Maybe Apple should fix that before it sends production into overtime.

The Surface Studio is selling better than expected, according to Digitimes, but it's still very far from being a mass-market product. However, it could have other benefits for both Microsoft and the PC industry... By Jack Schofield for Jack's Blog | December 30, 2016 -- 08:30 GMT (00:30 PST) | Topic: Microsoft Microsoft's Surface Studio offers a new angle on the desktop PC Image: Microsoft Microsoft's high-priced Surface Studio may be selling better than expected, if we can believe a recent report from Digitimes. The Taiwanese company - which publishes a Chinese daily newspaper on IT and high-tech supply chains - reports that "Microsoft has ordered 30,000 units to be shipped in the first quarter of 2017, according to Taiwan-based supply chain makers." Original estimates suggested that only 15,000 units would be shipped this quarter, because the Surface Studio costs so much more than alternative all-in-one PCs. The three models cost $2,999, $3,499 and $4,199. Assuming the average buyer spends $3,400, the retail value of 30,000 Surface Studios would be $100 million. If Microsoft could sell 100,000 a year, sales would be worth $0.34 billion. But this would still be a drop in the bucket. The news item says: "Apple ships about 3.5-4 million all-in-one PCs a year and is the second-largest all-in-one PC vendor worldwide behind Lenovo, according to Digitimes Research." If so, Apple could be shipping around 40 iMacs for every Surface Studio. We also don't know what sort of people are buying Surface Studios. If Microsoft is lucky, most of them will be the creative types at whom the product is aimed. But Microsoft has around 114,074 staff - that's the official number for June 30, 2016 - and a lot of them could be tempted. Some Surface Studios could even end up on their office desks, at Microsoft's expense. But it doesn't really matter. The Surface Studio is obviously a high-end product, not one designed for the mass market. If Microsoft aimed for the mainstream, it would be competing with its own partners, and I don't expect the major ones - HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus, Acer etc - would like that. The Surface Studio is doing other things, regardless of how many it sells. First, it's competing directly against Apple in the image wars, rather than the sales wars. Microsoft never wants to hear anyone say that the best PC for running Windows is a Mac. I think it would enjoy hearing that the best PC for running Windows is a Microsoft Surface, whether or not people actually buy them. You may remember that the Surface Studio has already scored a major victory in the image wars, because Microsoft's launch generated lots of praise on social media and in the press for its innovation and style. One day later, Apple was widely criticised for its lacklustre MacBook Pro launch, and for failing to even mention its moribund desktop products. The idea that "Microsoft is the new Apple" is a potent one. Second, Microsoft's research is feeding innovation into a PC industry that is struggling in a declining market. The Surface Pro range has already prompted several knock-offs, including Apple's iPad Pro. Even if nobody clones the Surface Studio directly, it will give other PC designers new things to think about. Third, Microsoft's Surface range should help to improve Windows 10. Until recently, Windows software was developed without much first-hand experience of the hardware design problems, whereas Apple benefited from the close integration of hardware and software. We can but hope that the future development of Surface and Windows 10 will produce similar benefits. Microsoft still makes most of its income by selling through partners, so competing with partners is a dangerous game. However, in this case, there are some benefits. And if the OEMs can see that Microsoft is targeting Apple rather than them, they'll probably live with that.

In subdued holiday trading, the S&P 500 was on pace for its third consecutive session of losses. But the benchmark index was still on track for an annual gain of more than 9 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed more than 13 percent for 2016, but was also on pace to post its first weekly decline since the U.S. election on Nov. 8. Stocks have stalled this week after surging in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential election. Investors have bet Trump will cut taxes and regulations and introduce fresh economic stimulus. "It's been such a significant run-up that there's been a pause," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. "We are to the point now where there's uncertainty with regard to what policies are implemented, when are they implemented and how are they going to affect the economy as a whole and industries specifically." The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 55.22 points, or 0.28 percent, to 19,764.56, the S&P 500 lost 10.5 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,238.76 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 51.17 points, or 0.94 percent, to 5,380.92. The Dow slipped further from the 20,000 milestone, after coming within 13 points of the mark but not yet breaching it. Apple shares fell 0.9 percent after a report that the company will trim iPhone production. The stock was one of the biggest drags on major indexes, while shares of Apple suppliers such as Cirrus Logic and Qualcomm also were lower. Tech was the worst-performing major S&P sector, falling 1 percent. Big tech companies such as Microsoft and Alphabet slumped more than 1 percent. Investors are wary that the market could be primed for a spill to start 2017, after the S&P 500 posted a surprisingly strong gain in 2016. In other corporate news, OPKO Health shares fell 19.9 percent after the company said its experimental drug for growth hormone deficiency in adults failed to provide a statistically significant benefit in a late-stage study. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.80-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 1 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 40 new highs and 43 new lows.

NEW DELHI: Apple may well be planning to make iPhones in India through the contract manufacturing route, initially partnering with Wistron, with industry insiders saying the Cupertino-based smartphone maker can begin with accessories and repairs before taking the bigger plunge. Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron is setting up a plant in an industrial area near Bengaluru, two people aware of the developments said, adding that a timeline for undertaking the task has not been decided. "Wistron is setting up a plant exclusively for Apple," one of them said, requesting anonymity. While Apple declined to comment, Taipei-headquartered Wistron said, "We are unable to make any comments on our clients and products currently," when asked specifically about Apple’s plans to make in India. Wistron is one of the global contract manufacturers and was hired by Apple in 2016. The company reportedly assembles iPhones at three plants in China. Industry insiders say that while assembly of phones may begin with Wistron, Apple could look at taking the manufacturing to deeper levels in the coming years, with larger players like Foxconn or Pegatron. Foxconn is Apple’s largest supplier of iPhones. Analysts say that while taking the step of assembling iPhones can be done with present set of duties and incentives being offered by the government, full scale manufacturing is still a few years away. "The question in Apple's case is what level of manufacturing it wants to do in India… some high-end phones are already being made in India, but Apple's level of manufacturing is way above what local vendors are doing here," said Jaipal Singh, senior analyst at IDC India. Manufacturing in India may enable Apple to sell phones in India that cost 10 per cent less than those imported – at upwards of Rs 50,000 a pop, the cost saving is a very attractive proposition. But experts point to the fact that local level manufacturing is still in the nascent stages of assembly, which will continue for the next two to three years. There is also the element of lack of supporting ecosystem, as all parts are imported from China and put together in India. The other issue is of the demand and whether Apple will have enough volumes for assembling locally. "Majority of the Indian market is less than $200, so the most pertinent question is that how much is Apple willing to invest for just 15 per cent of the market?" Singh added. Apple has shipped a record around 2.5 million iPhones from October 2015 to September 2016, up 56 per cent on year, according to Counterpoint Research. The annual volume is far lower than the average monthly sale of a local smartphone maker in India. Despite the low volumes, India has been on Apple's radar in 2016, more so after CEO Tim Cook spent nearly a week here in May.

Nikkei sources say Apple will make one less iPhone for every 10 between January and March, amid reports of slowing demand for the flagship models. Related: iPhone 7 review - not up to Apple's high standards The report says: “Apple will trim production of its iPhone family around 10% on the year in the first quarter of 2017, according to calculations by The Nikkei based on data from suppliers. ...the phones still have sold more sluggishly than expected. Information on production of the latest models and global sales suggests cuts in both the 7 and 7 Plus lines in the coming quarter.” Many of the firm’s loyal customers are believed to be swerving the modest update served up in September. The iPhone 8 (or 7s or whatever Apple ends up calling it) will bring a much larger design overhaul, if reports are to be believed. The iPhone 8 is believed to offer a flexible OLED display with a bezel-free design and an all-glass casing. Today’s report follows purported insight from the analysts at NPD, who claimed the iPhone 7 lacked enough “compelling features” to fully capitalise on Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 disaster.

The iPhone 7 was released without a headphone jack, an unpopular choice that's now been somewhat ameliorated by the launch of the AirPods, and the MacBook Pro has been plagued by battery issues, graphics problems, and complaints about the high price of the device. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. Apple also saw its first decline in iPhone sales in 2016, but 2017 could potentially turn things around for the company. We're expecting the biggest iPhone revision we've seen since the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launched in 2014, plus we're also expecting major iPad changes, refreshed desktop Macs, and software improvements. iPhone 8 - September 2017 Rumors about the 2017 iPhone started ramping up before the iPhone 7 was even released, so there's a lot of information out there, and at this point, quite a bit of it conflicts, so it's difficult to get a clear picture of what Apple is planning for the iPhone's 10th anniversary. If you read all of the rumors and suss out some common themes, there are a few concrete details that hint at what likely to see in the next-generation iPhone. We're assuming it's going to be called the "iPhone 8" due to design changes that are more radical than we'd expect for an "iPhone 7s," but it's entirely possible Apple will go with another name. It looks like there's going to be at least three iPhone models, and one of those will have an OLED display. It's sounding like we're going to get one premium OLED iPhone somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 inches, with either a flexible curved display that wraps around the edges like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge or an edge-to-edge display more in line with the current design of the iPhone 7. These seem to be mutually exclusive concepts, but we've heard rumors suggesting both possibilities. A display that wraps around the sides of the phone seems to suggest we'd continue to have some kind of top and bottom bezels, but information coming from sources like KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo seems to point more towards a less curved 2.5D edge-to-edge display that does away with bezels entirely. Edge-to-edge iPhone concept image via ConceptsiPhone Of course, it's possible some "edge-to-edge" rumors refer to the removal of the side bezels rather than the top and bottom bezels, but it's not entirely clear. Either way, it seems the iPhone 8 will do away with the Home button, incorporating a Touch ID fingerprint scanner directly into the display. Ambient light sensors, microphone, and camera may also be located under the display for a true single piece of glass look. Along with that OLED model, rumors also suggest we're going to get two other iPhone models, perhaps in standard 4.7 and 5.5-inch configurations. These would presumably be less expensive and would use easier to obtain standard LCD display panels. Either the OLED model or all three iPhone models rumored for 2017 will include a glass body, doing away with the aluminum-style body that Apple has used for several years in a row. The glass back and the display may be housed in an aluminum frame for stability, but the glass itself will mean a significantly different visual aesthetic. A glass body will bring a fresh look, but there's another reason behind the materials switch -- wireless charging. Apple is rumored to be developing long-range wireless charging techniques, which could make their debut in 2017. An aluminum body can interfere with wireless charging speeds, while a glass body offers less interference. It's not entirely clear if Apple is developing its own wireless charging solution or working with a company like Energous, nor do we know exactly how wireless charging will be implemented, but it is looking like a feature we can expect to see in all 2017 iPhone models. Other features rumored for the 2017 iPhone include a faster A11 processor, more advanced biometric features like improved facial recognition techniques or perhaps even iris scanning, and an upgraded Taptic Engine able to create "more complex tactile vibrations." Dual cameras are expected to be offered in some iPhone models, but optical image stabilization could be added to both lenses (instead of just the wide-angle lens) in the next-generation iPhone. Apple is rumored to be considering upwards of 10 different prototypes for the 2017 iPhone, which explains why we may be hearing so many different rumors about the device at this point in time. As we get closer to the September launch date of the 2017 iPhone and as Apple's own plans solidify, we'll get a better idea of what to expect. Read full iPhone 8 roundup iPad Pro - Spring 2017? Apple is working on a revamped version of the iPad Pro, and as with the iPhone, the rumors are all over the place. Apple is said to be planning on introducing three models in 2017: a 9.7-inch iPad Pro, a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and a new mid-range model with a display that's somewhere between 10.1 and 10.9 inches. The 10-inch iPad Pro is rumored to feature an edge-to-edge nearly bezel-free display much like the iPhone 8, and its actual body size will be identical to the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. For that reason, rumors suggest the 10-inch iPad Pro will be replacing the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, but Apple plans to keep the 9.7-inch iPad Pro around as a low-cost tablet option. The 10-inch and 12.9-inch models will reportedly be the new flagship models, upgraded with faster A10X processors. The exact size of the 10-inch iPad hasn't been sussed out yet. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who often reliably predicts Apple's plans, says it will measure in at 10.5-inches. Japanese site Mac Otakara has a more mixed track record and has released two reports pointing towards both 10.9 and 10.1 inches. Rumors out of the Taiwanese supply chain have suggested 10.5 inches, and research conducted by Barclays Research says it'll be 10.9 inches. One rumor from Mac Otakara also suggests Apple will introduce a smaller 7.9-inch iPad Pro to succeed the iPad mini, but that information has not yet been confirmed by another source. With Apple planning to introduce new iPads in 2017, there may also be more of a focus on iPad-specific software during the year. Apple is said to be aiming to enhance the iPad Pro with new hardware and software features that cater specifically to professional users, such as a faster display for smoother on-screen zooming, panning, and scrolling, and expanded iOS support for the Apple Pencil that will allow it to work in more areas. Mac Otakara and Barclays Research have both predicted an early 2017 launch for the new iPads, perhaps in March or April, but if a radical edge-to-edge redesign is in the works, it is questionable as to whether Apple will upstage the 2017 iPhone 8 that's expected in September with an edge-to-edge iPad launching earlier in the year. Read full iPad Pro roundup iMac - Spring 2017 New iMacs didn't debut alongside the MacBook Pro at Apple's October 2016 event, but there's rumored to be an update in the works. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, we will see iMacs in "mid-1H17," which translates to sometime around March or April. A refreshed iMac will likely include Intel's Kaby Lake chips and AMD graphics (in models that use discrete graphics options). The iMac is potentially due for a design refresh, but there have been no rumors suggesting anything more than a minor spec update is on the horizon. In fact, information from Bloomberg suggests all we'll see in a 2017 is a shift to USB-C and improved processors. Kaby Lake chips appropriate for the iMac are set to come out in late December to early January, perfect timing for a spring release. We could potentially see a new keyboard that could ship alongside an iMac. Apple is rumored to be considering a standalone keyboard that incorporates a Touch Bar much like the keyboard of the MacBook Pro. Such a product might accompany a future iMac. Read full iMac roundup MacBook - Spring 2017 After introducing the 12-inch Retina MacBook in the spring of 2015, Apple launched a refreshed version in the spring of 2016, so it stands to reason we'll see yet another upgrade in the early months of 2017. Low-power Kaby Lake chips appropriate for the MacBook are already available, so that's a safe bet for what we might see in an upgraded machine. No design changes are expected. Read full MacBook roundup MacBook Pro - Fall 2017 New MacBook Pro models with a Touch Bar came out in 2016, and if Apple sticks to a traditional upgrade cycle, we'll see a refresh with upgraded internal components in the fall of 2017. Upgrades could include Kaby Lake processors and slight price cuts, but no external design changes are expected for the next several years. Read full MacBook Pro roundup Mac Pro The Mac Pro is overdue for an update, having last been updated in 2013, and we don't know when it's going to get a refresh. There are no concrete rumors suggesting an update is in the works, and no hints on what a new machine might include. Processors and graphics cards appropriate for an updated machine have long been available, but Apple could be waiting for the latest technology from companies like Intel and AMD before presenting a new Mac Pro. If a Mac Pro is planned for 2017, it could come in the spring alongside refreshed iMacs or, if Apple is waiting for cutting-edge current-generation chips, it could come in the fall. Read full Mac Pro roundup Mac mini Like the Mac Pro, the Mac mini has not seen an update for multiple years, with the last update coming in October 2014. Unfortunately, we've heard no rumors on whether or not we can expect to see an upgraded Mac mini in 2016, but if it does come, it could include Kaby Lake chips, faster SSD options, better graphics, and other improvements that have been brought to the Mac lineup over the last two years. Read full Mac mini roundup MacBook Air - Never With thinner, lighter MacBook and MacBook Pro machines now available, we don't expect to see another MacBook Air update. Apple will likely keep the MacBook Air around for a while as a low-cost option until it's able to cut the price on more expensive machines, but a new MacBook Air probably isn't going to happen. We could, however, potentially see small spec boosts and minor internal upgrades if Apple wants to keep its low-cost machine relevant for a longer period of time. Read full MacBook Air roundup Apple Watch - Fall 2017? If Apple is working on a third-generation Apple Watch for the fall of 2017, it's being kept tightly under wraps. We haven't heard any rumors suggesting a new Apple Watch is in the works for 2017, but if we are going to get one, it could come in the fall alongside the iPhone 8. Potential features we could see in a new Apple Watch include the first significant design changes, upgraded processors, and perhaps sensors that Apple was not able to build into the first and second-generation versions. Cellular connectivity, a feature Apple has wanted to incorporate into the watch but hasn't been able to add due to battery life concerns, could also come in a 2017 model. We've also heard rumors of a potential switch to micro-LED displays for the Apple Watch, which can be thinner and lighter with improved color gamut and brightness. At this point, it's too early to tell if we're going to get a new Apple Watch in 2017, so we'll need to wait for additional rumors to surface over the first few months of the year to figure out what's going on with Apple's wearable. Read full Apple Watch roundup Apple TV - Unknown While it's possible Apple could introduce an Apple TV update in 2017, we don't think it's likely to happen. There are no recent rumors suggesting an update is in the works, and there's no real reason for the Apple TV to be updated. Prior to the introduction of the fourth-generation Apple TV, Apple went several years without introducing a new version of the device, so historically, it is not on an every-year or every-other-year update schedule like Macs and iOS devices. That said, rumors suggest a future Apple TV could include a better processor and perhaps some features that would allow it to compete with products like the Amazon Echo and the Google Home, but there are other rumors that make it unclear whether these are features that would go into an Apple TV or another standalone product also rumored to be under development in Cupertino -- a home hub. Read full Apple TV roundup Home Hub - Late 2017? Rumors suggest Apple is working on a connected smart home device that's similar to the Amazon Echo. It would be equipped with a speaker and microphone and powered by Apple's Siri voice assistant. The hub, which has been in development for two years and is in the prototype testing phase, is said to be able to control HomeKit-connected accessories like lights, locks, window shades, and more through voice activation. It may feature "more advanced microphone and speaker technology" than the Amazon Echo or the Google Home, products it will compete with. The Amazon Echo Information on the hub is a bit nebulous at this point, and it's not clear if it's going to be a new standalone speaker-only product or something in the AirPort or Apple TV families, both of which are possibilities. Facial recognition capabilities may be built into the device, and Apple is also working on Siri advancements that will allow it to do more. Because the hub is still in the prototyping phase, it's not entirely clear when it will launch. It could come in the later months of 2017, but it may not be ready until 2018. Apple could also scrap the project entirely. iOS 11 - Fall 2017 (June Preview) Apple introduces a new version of its mobile operating system for iPhones and iPads on a yearly basis, and in 2017, we're expecting to see iOS 11. There aren't many details on what will be included in iOS 11, but we've heard some hints suggesting there could be more of a focus on the iPad, with features like improved Apple Pencil support that cater to professional users. Apple is said to be planning on allowing the Apple Pencil to work more widely across the operating system. Apple is also rumored to be developing its own social networking app to compete with Snapchat and Facebook, allowing users to record video, edit video, and add filter and doodles. Such an app, if development continues, could debut alongside iOS 11. Apple has also been exploring augmented and virtual reality with a dedicated AR/VR team, and some kind of augmented reality feature could potentially be introduced in iOS 11. Maps and Photos are two areas where Apple could take advantage of augmented reality with the iPhone's camera, offering features like mapping overlays of real-world views or Snapchat-style photo filters. macOS 10.13 - Fall 2017 (June Preview) The next-generation version of macOS (10.13) will come in the fall of 2017, introducing new features and refining the macOS operating system. There's no word yet on what features we might see in macOS 10.13, but details will likely leak out as it gets later in the year. Apple will preview macOS 10.13 at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, which typically takes place in June. watchOS 4 - Fall 2017 (June Preview) Alongside iOS 10.11, we're likely going to get watchOS 4, an updated version of the operating system that runs on the Apple Watch. There's no word yet on what new features could be included in watchOS 4, but we'll get our first glimpse of the new software in June. tvOS 11 - Fall 2017 (June Preview) The final software update we're expecting in 2017 is tvOS 11, a new version of the tvOS software that runs on the fourth-generation TV. Apple is still working to refine the tvOS experience, so we can likely expect to see some interface improvements and other usability changes as the company gets a better handle on how people are using their set-top boxes. tvOS 11, along with macOS 10.13, watchOS 4, and iOS 10.11, will be previewed at WWDC ahead of a fall launch.

I'll still rock their phones but when it comes to my next laptop, it's getting harder to root for Apple with competition heating up.

They will blow people's mind. You will see the the widest range of colors in the entire tech industry. There will be new watch bands that will make YSL envy. Needless to say, all the products will be thinner and thinner as unnecessary ports are removed from the devices. The new emoji collection will have the most comprehensive ethnicity ever created. The number of online orders for each product category will be the largest in Apple's history and will outpace the competition by many folds. The company will continue to make efforts to improve safety and privacy. On top of that, they will continue to make sure we live in a better planet.

I wouldn't hold my breath these days :( I'll be blue by next November Rating: 23 Votes Altivec88 3 days ago at 08:57 pm When I look at what Apple is doing in its entirety, I see a company who is slowly but surely gravitating towards what they believe will be the next big thing. The things we are criticizing Apple for, I feel they are simply growing pains as Apple prepares to leave older markets behind and enter new ones. And I feel we need to be understanding in this area. . As an enterprise customer that has built their entire business on Apple products the past 30+ years, We do not have the luxury of being understanding in this area. Unfortunately, for us pro's, "the next best thing" doesn't put food on our plate. For the time being we must rely on those old things called computers. The point of paying a premium for Apple products is the problem free (well less problem free lately) ecosystem between all products. From our iPhones and iPads, to our Mac mini servers and airport routers, right down to our work horse MacPro's. Allowing us to concentrate on our work rather than the technology more than makes up for the extra costs we pay Apple. The problem is we've been waiting 6 years to update our aging and dying 12 core 2010 MacPro's. We purchased one 2013 MacPro to try out and there was virtually no improvement in rendering speeds, yet they were double the price of our 2010 models. So month by month we kept waiting for a speed bump. Both Dell and HP have updated their workstations twice since 2013 and currently offer 44 core systems. When Apple announced their Mac Event at the end of 2016, we were sure a Mac Pro update was imminent. Nope, not even a mention... That silence was deafening to us and triggered a stop order on all future purchases of any Apple product. We use iPhones and iPads to automatically sync notes and photos to our pro machines. If we have to switch our Mac Pro's to Dell or HP workstations, we have no reason to buy Macbook Pros, iMacs, iPads or iPhones. We will be switching those to surface's and window phones for easier integration and lower cost. I know, windows sucks and we don't want to leave, but as other pointed out, Apple is pushing us out the door by neglecting us. So I get that consumers who are okay with outdated tech and slow updates get upset at seeing all the negativity. Trust me, I use to be a die hard fan boy too. But when your PC using competition is blowing you out of the water because their tech is far far superior to yours and it starts costing you big dollars, you would show a little displeasure too. 2017 is the year that things better start popping out this long dragged out pipeline or I really won't care any more. More specifically, no Mac Pro by March and you can put a fork in it. Thanks Tim for ruining Apple. Rating: 21 Votes tech4all 3 days ago at 02:26 pm Hope we get less whiners/trolls/trolling posts next year! If Apple delivers satisfactory products, then people will stop stating their dissatisfaction, or "whining" and "trolling" as some call it. Rating: 21 Votes gertruded 3 days ago at 12:24 pm We are Apple users since our first Apple 2 plus through iPhone 6splus, we are finally through. Our 2007 iMac, our 2009 mini, and our 2012 air are all aging and need replacement soon. We purchased a Windows machine for Christmas and it seems to be OK. Apple is clearly abandoning their Mac line. The difficult conversion of files has begun. Apple left us, not the other way around. Rating: 20 Votes BreadofWonder 3 days ago at 11:13 am No reason to update the Apple TV? Really? I can think of two really good ones: 4K and HDR. Every other streamer has it at this point and I'd be shocked if Apple doesn't do it too before the end of the year.

Video provided by TheStreet Newslook There’s a lot more you can do with your new iPhone than simply take photos, listen to music and make calls. (Photo: Apple) Apple will reportedly cut production of the iPhone during the 2017 first quarter as sales of its latest smartphone are slower than expected. According to Nikkei Asian Review, Apple will trim production by 10% based on data from suppliers. The additional cuts arrive despite Apple performing a similar cut last year for the iPhone 6s. The report also says Apple's iPhone 7 Plus remains popular, but the company can't meet demand because of a shortage in camera sensors. Apple declined to comment on the report. Shares of Apple were down nearly 1% in afternoon trading Friday. Apple has hinted throughout the year sales of its iPhone would decline. Fiscal year revenue for 2016 dropped for the first time in fifteen years. Meanwhile, fourth quarter iPhone shipments were down 5% from the same time last year. Next month, Apple is expected to report first quarter results, which will break down sales of Apple devices during the important holiday season.

That’s good news for impatient consumers who are currently waiting upwards of six weeks for theirs to arrive. Inventec ramps up AirPods production to help meet demand News of the production increase comes via DigiTimes from the Chinese-language Economic Daily News. EDN reports Inventec also has staff working overtime to help meet Apple’s demand. Apple introduced the AirPods wireless earbuds in September at its iPhone 7 launch event. AirPods connect through Bluetooth, and once paired with one of your devices they automatically work with others linked to your iCloud account. AirPods were supposed to ship in October, but were delayed until late December. Apple began taking preorders on December 13th, but excitement quickly led to frustration when shipping times were pushed out to four weeks within an hour. That delay stretched out to six weeks in short order, and hasn’t changed. Inventec’s efforts may already be paying off because some AirPods buyers are getting their delivery earlier than expected. If you’re hoping to get AirPods earlier, Apple’s stores are getting very limited stock.

And there's much more chaos and innovation to come. [Photo: Flickr user Steven Depolo] John Paul Titlow 12.30.16 2:00 PM Last year was another eventful one in the history of music. And that was no surprise. In 2016, the music industry saw its first signs of true growth since the internet started ravaging it a decade and a half ago. By mid-year, labels saw revenue grow 8.1% over the same period in 2015, fueled mostly by an explosion in subscribers flocking to services like Spotify (40 million subscribers) and Apple Music (20 million). Indeed, in early 2016, we learned that streaming had officially become the industry’s biggest source of income in 2015. While revenue from downloads and physical album sales both continued their years-long decline (by 14% and 17%, respectively), streaming revenue grew 57% during the first half of 2016, and since then, all signs have pointed to continued growth. This is good news for record execs, but what it means for artists and streaming platforms—which each have their own contractual relationships with labels—remains to be seen. As the pie grows, expect to see intensified battles over how it all gets divvied up. 5 Ways Streaming Music Will Change In 2016 2015 was a transformative year for online music. So what's next? There were also big changes within the streaming landscape itself. Amazon and SoundCloud launched Spotify competitors. Apple polished up its existing service with a new interface. Pandora also unveiled its premium subscription service, expected to launch in the first quarter of 2017. For those keeping count at home, that’s three new subscription services in one year, on top of the three that launched the year before (Tidal, Apple Music, and YouTube Red). Despite all the new competition, Spotify has held onto its dominant role, growing its listenership and flexing its playlisting muscle with more in-house curation and data-powered personalized playlists like Discover Weekly, Release Radar, and Your Daily Mix. Despite all the upward-sloping numbers, the music industry still found reason to gripe. Its chief target this year was YouTube, which, along with Spotify’s free tier, creates what the RIAA calls a "value gap" for the industry. Simply put, ad-supported services just don’t make as much money as music subscriptions. Indeed, vinyl sales—a relatively tiny sliver of the industry’s income—generated more money than ad-supported streaming like YouTube, SoundCloud, and Spotify’s free tier. There was tension elsewhere as well. Frank Ocean pulled a fast one on his label Def Jam by releasing his short visual album Endless on Apple Music to fulfill his contract before self-releasing the blockbuster Blond and denying Def Jam a cut of the profits. The maneuver made record executives rethink the already-controversial practice of releasing albums by major artists exclusively on one platform, which may help drive subscription numbers, but frustrates fans and encourages piracy. Up until that point, big-name exclusives practically defined the year in popular music: Kanye West, Drake, Beyoncé, and Chance the Rapper all put out albums initially available only via either Apple Music or Tidal. (Spotify refuses to play this game.) Meanwhile, the concept of the album itself became ever more fuzzy, thanks to visual albums (i.e., music released as a long-form video or film) from Ocean and Beyoncé, plus Kanye West’s post-release editing of Life of Pablo. With so much change in the last few years, what could 2017 possibly hold? Plenty. Here are our predictions. The Music Subscription Boom Will Continue The number of people willing to pay $10 a month for music skyrocketed in 2016, but it’s still pretty small. All told, about 100 million people are believed to subscribe to music services. (This doesn’t include free streaming from SoundCloud, YouTube, or Spotify’s free tier.) But considering that there are 319 million people in the United States alone, there’s plenty of room for growth. Just look at Apple Music. The service, which is available in 113 countries and comes pre-installed on every iOS device, only took a year and a half to reach half of Spotify’s size in terms of paying subscribers. And they both keep expanding. Now we have Amazon Music Unlimited, which is well positioned to reel in new subscribers at $8 per month for Prime members. When Pandora finally launches its subscription service, it will have 78 million listeners to potentially convert into paying subscribers—not to mention a newfound possibility of expansion beyond the U.S., New Zealand, and Australia (although those plans are still being hammered out). Streaming music is also breaking free from the confines of our smartphones and laptops. Thanks to the rise of smart speakers like Amazon Echo, Sonos, and Google Home, more listening is happening at home, making the prospect of treating music like a monthly utility an even more sensible one. Cheaper family subscription plans don't hurt, either. At Least One Music Service Will Disappear We’ve seen five new music subscription services arrive in the last two years (and one more coming from Pandora early next year), but that doesn’t mean music streaming has become a lucrative successful business. Quite the opposite: None of these services has made an enduring profit, although Spotify is working aggressively toward that goal as it gets ready to go public next year. Big tech companies like Apple, Google, and Amazon can afford to run their music services at a loss indefinitely. This landscape makes it tricky for smaller players like Tidal, SoundCloud, Deezer, and Napster (formerly Rhapsody). Both Tidal and SoundCloud were the subject of acquisition rumors in 2016, and rumors continue to swirl around the prospect of Pandora selling itself off. Bandcamp would make a very attractive acquisition for Pandora or Spotify, but the artist-centric music and merch marketplace is well positioned to stay independent if it prefers: The company has been profitable since 2012 and its cultural influence is only growing. The bottom line: Expect to see fewer music services this time next year. At least one of these companies is bound to get acquired or go under altogether. Streaming eExclusives Won’t Die Frank Ocean may have put a damper on the industry’s enthusiasm about platform-exclusive album releases, but don’t expect to see the trend die off just yet. Universal (owner of Def Jam) may have sworn them off, but the other major labels have remained silent on the issue. Besides, in an age when many artists have an unprecedented capacity to chart their own course, does it really matter what the labels think? Apple and Tidal are apparently willing to shell out a ton of money for these exclusive deals. And as long as they remain an effective tool for driving subscriptions amid intensifying competition, the streaming platforms aren’t likely to stop offering them. Despite some controversy, the exclusivity approach seems to work for most artists: Drake was the most-streamed artist on Spotify this year, despite Views only being available on Apple Music when it debuted. Like Beyoncé’s Lemonade and Ocean’s Blond, Drake’s latest album was a massive success overall. That said, we should expect to see fewer of these deals next year. Streaming platforms, labels, and artists will use the tactic much more selectively to minimize fallout while still extracting whatever competitive value they can. Musicians Will Squirm As AI Gets Better At Making Music Have you ever seen a computer write a song? It’s nuts. Give IBM’s Watson a simple melody and define a mood, and the multi-talented artificial intelligence platform will churn out an original song that sounds like it was made by a person—albeit not an especially talented one. But it’s now possible to teach machines enough about the rules of music theory to let them compose their own music, complete with multiple instrumental layers and changes in key and tempo. The result isn’t something you’ll want to listen to on your daily commute, but it’s still early in the quest to teach computers how to make art. And it’s not just IBM that’s focused on this. Google’s Magenta project, announced in April 2016, is in the beginning stages of stretching the limits of machine learning to help computers understand—and eventually mimic—creative thinking. Like Watson, Magenta has already produced a rudimentary song of its own. Machines aren’t about to put artists out of work, but advances in artificial intelligence could make certain types of music easier and cheaper to create—video-game soundtracks or background music for a retail store, for instance—that would not require licensing or paying royalties. AI could also augment the creative process for flesh-and-blood songwriters. An artist stuck on writing the chorus of a song could tap into tools based on Watson or Magenta to auto-generate a few ideas. Next year, expect the technology to improve slightly and for more artists to catch wind of it. Some will see an exciting new creative opportunity. Others will cringe at the mere idea of it. New Answers (And Dollar Signs) For Artists The brief history of streaming’s rise has been accompanied by an often awkward question: How will artists fare? It’s a natural concern given the minuscule per-stream royalty rates offered under a model that’s still scaling to its full potential. There won’t be a silver bullet in 2017, but artists will see more reasons to be hopeful about the future because catering to artists has increasingly become a priority for streaming services. Apple Music and Tidal have famously made artist-friendliness a key tenet of their offerings—or at least of their marketing. In June 2016, Spotify hired former Lady Gaga manager Troy Carter to oversee its expanding artist relations initiatives. Middle-class artists might not be getting huge checks from Spotify, but many are finding new promotional value in landing on the service’s most popular playlists, whether they be hand-curated in-house or data-powered. Discover Weekly alone drove more than half of all listening for 8,000 artists in less than a year. Spotify is also building out more tools and services for artists and finding ways to tap into the passion—and disposable income—of super-fans. Meanwhile, Pandora is busy reshaping itself into a service that caters more directly to artists’ needs, be it with data, marketing tools for artists, or the ability to sell concert tickets directly to fans from within the app. Spotify's Discover Weekly Has 40 Million Listeners—More Than Apple Music And Tidal Not even a year after launch, the playlist is boasting some big, impressive numbers. For now, record labels still reap the lion’s share of revenue, but that balance of power is poised to shift. Between the platforms' investment in artist relations and the growing slice of revenue being generated by streaming, musicians are bound to see new benefits. And streaming services, labels, and artists will all have to renegotiate their relationships with one another. Artists may soon be in a better position to demand more from their labels or, following Frank Ocean’s lead, sidestep the middlemen altogether—a prospect that could become easier for less-than-household names as the streaming industry’s artist-facing services mature. We’re also seeing promising signs outside of the all-you-can-stream model. In 2015, Bandcamp announced that it had paid out $100 million to artists since being founded in 2008. As 2016 winds down, that number is already up to $190 million, a number that suggests Bandcamp is booming. That’s not just good news for Bandcamp and the artists who use it to sell music and merchandise. It’s also a clear sign that music fans are perfectly happy to pay for music and support artists directly in the digital age. Amazon Will Become A Major Player In Music In 2016, the streaming battle was primarily framed as a competitive struggle between Apple and Spotify. That will continue in 2017, but while latecomers to the subscription game like Pandora and SoundCloud fight to amass bigger numbers, one company will have a relatively easy time: Amazon. Like Apple, Amazon has the advantage of being a giant tech company with a massive customer base to which it can market its music service. Its wildly successful Echo smart speaker is also a natural vehicle for a full-fledged music subscription service, and Alexa offers more voice control functionality to Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers than it does to users of other services like Spotify and Pandora. Hands On With Amazon’s Spotify Competitor: A Bare-Bones Service, But Still A Threat It may lack sophistication, but the new Amazon Unlimited Music has convenience and price going for it. And that should win it some fans. It's also a cheaper option for many people: If you subscribe to Amazon Prime, Amazon’s music service is $8 per month. If you own an Echo or Echo Dot, you can get the service for $4 per month (although it will only work on that device). No other major subscription service has been able to dip below the standard $10 monthly price tag, making Amazon’s lower cost a unique competitive advantage. While it’s no Spotify, Amazon Music Unlimited launched as a perfectly decent, cross-platform music service. And the company is already starting to improve the service with more hand-curated playlists and exclusive content deals like the one it recently signed with Garth Brooks. Like Apple and Google, Amazon can afford to invest in this area without much concern for profitability. Expect Amazon to nab quite a few subscribers pretty quickly. Next Wave Of Innovation: Virtual Reality Music execs might have been caught off guard by file-sharing and other technological innovations, but the resulting wounds have taught the industry a valuable defensive tactic: Sleep—to paraphrase Napster’s one-time archnemesis Metallica—with one eye open, lest it get blindsided by change yet again. If virtual reality is going to be as explosive as the experts predict (ballooning to nearly $30 billion in revenue by 2020), the music industry will be ready. Big names like Paul McCartney, U2, Björk, Coldplay, and Deadmau5 are just a few of the artists who have already embraced VR in the form of immersive music videos or live concerts that invite fans onstage. But since consumers are just starting to get acquainted with VR, the music industry has pumped the breaks as it waits for the market for hardware and software (and thus demand for immersive content) to catch up with its ambitions. It’s pretty unusual for the music industry to be ahead of the next wave of innovation, but that’s what’s happening with VR. There are already signs that VR will yield exciting developments for fans and the music industry. Immersive live streams of concerts, for instance, could evolve into a real source of revenue beyond the standard catalogs of recorded music. Music videos, music documentaries, and music-oriented video games can also take on new life in a world where virtual reality headsets are common. There are also interactive music visualizers, which turn songs—or even your own voice—into responsive animations that unfold in front of you. Then there’s the audio itself. For the best experience, immersive music environments will require engineers to mix songs in more spatially complex manners than standard stereo or even surround sound, which could pave the way for innovations in the way music is composed and produced.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search iPhone 7 cuts MAY be slowing Chris Burns - Dec 30, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Sources report that Apple’s production of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be cut by 10% in the first quarter of 2017. Let me be up front about this report right away – we’re working with parts production numbers, which could indicate several things. That in mind, pay heed to the sign of the times: this could be another indicator that the public already has a smartphone in their pocket, and they’re not quite ready to buy another. According to Nikkei, Apple is set to trim production of its entire iPhone family “around 10% on the year” in the January-March quarter. This information, they say, comes from calculations done by Nikkei based on supplier data. This might be bad news for Apple’s stock – but it might not be all bad, considering the circumstances. This same source’s numbers put Apple’s production cuts for the iPhone 6s – at this same time last year – at 20%. That’s 20% less production than the year before in the first quarter of the year. This could mean that Apple is inching toward a new normal – not quite as good as it was a few years ago, but still not something to panic about. Nikkei also suggests that a source “at a major parts producer” said that Apple’s production cuts are “within expectations.” What they don’t say is what they expect parts production to do next year. This is year which could produce an iPhone that’s quite a bit different from years past. For more information on what’s possible in the next year for the iPhone, have a peek at the timeline below. Apple is reaching a point at which the tick-tock schedule for the iPhone might not make sense for much longer. This year will still likely make for an easy win with the iPhone 7s, but the year after this – big things.

These modular tiles probably won’t replace traditional lamps or ceiling bulbs, but the customizable LED lights provide visually impressive colorful (and pricey) accent lighting. See it in action below: Nanoleaf’s Aurora smart lighting system retails for $199 for a starter kit that includes nine panels, nine linkers, the HomeKit-compatible controller, 28 3M mounting strips, and the power supply. That’s comparable in price to the Philips Hue smart lighting system which includes three color-changing A19 LED bulbs and a HomeKit-compatible bridge, but the novelty of Aurora is unmatched by any other HomeKit lighting solution on the market. Aurora is modular so you can create a variety of designs from the same nine tiles, or add additional tiles to create more complex layouts. Each lighting panel can connect to up to three more lighting panels with one linker connecting two tiles. Aurora intelligently detects what layout you’ve created, then maps it on Nanoleaf’s companion app where you can set color flows, brightness, speed, and more. Additional tiles are sold in sets of three for $59.99 which is about the cost of one additional Philips Hue color bulb. Check out our hands-on video with Nanoleaf Aurora below: Subscribe to 9to5Mac for more videos HomeKit support means you can also set colors and brightness with Siri, Apple’s new Home app, or through automation based on time or commands that control other accessories. For example, you could have a scene called Movie Night that turns off the ceiling light and sets the Aurora lights to deep blue at 10% brightness; just tell Siri to ‘set Movie Night scene’ and your connected accessories automatically jump to the right mode. Apple’s Home app doesn’t support multicolor waves from the built-in color picker — only solid colors — so you’ll want to spend more time in Nanoleaf’s app at first to discover different color effects. HomeKit makes changing the brightness, toggling the lights on and off, and setting solid colors very convenient. You can also turn color effects you discover or create in Nanoleaf’s app into scenes in Apple’s Home app. This is where HomeKit support’s potential is really unlocked. You can use Siri to change between dramatically different color effects, or pick a few favorites to access from Control Center. You can also automate specific color effects using Apple’s Home app. For instance, you can have Aurora display a vibrant sunrise color effect at 7 am each morning or even based on the actual sunrise time where you live. Simply using Siri to turn Aurora on, change the color effect and brightness, and turn Aurora off makes HomeKit support super valuable. Setting up Aurora can be a bit intimidating, but Nanoleaf provides the necessary  supplies including paper templates that let you mock up a design on your wall before sticking tiles. Nanoleaf also has a series of very helpful video tutorials that I found useful before installation. Nanoleaf’s packaging is pretty minimal and easy to break down and recycle (the box even asks you to) which I appreciated. The power supply includes plenty of cable length for wiring the controller to where you need it, and each tile is pretty light and can stand a few accidental drops (trust me). Nanoleaf recommends connecting each panel right out of the box before you starting hanging anything to make sure there are no defects. The first panel connects to the controller, then each additional panel connects with a small tab called a linker that inserts into both panels to pass power and data. 3M mounting strips hold each panel in place on the wall. Nanoleaf recommends exposing the non-adhesive tab on each mounting strip so panels can be easily removed in the future, and you can strategically place them so that the connecting tile covers the exposed tab. The process is super easy once you get the hang of it. Deciding on a design pattern may be the hardest step. Nanoleaf provides several ideas in the setup guide including four patterns that work with the starter kit, four more designs that work when adding the expansion kit, and seven ideas when using 15 and 30 panels. You can make any pattern with your panels, though, and the Nanoleaf app recognizes it and reflects it on your smartphone or tablet. I was tempted to go with the fish layout, but ultimately decided on a more linear layout to cover a few scratches on the wall from guitars. A few things to keep in mind: each panel is lit by three LEDs which are more noticeable at high brightness levels, the controller is wired and may not sit flush like each tile so try to place it out of sight, and consider how the plasticky white panels will appear when not lit before deciding on placement. Aurora is visually impressive and well integrated with Apple devices and Siri thanks to HomeKit, and Nanoleaf makes the lighting system both easy and fun to set up with the modular design. The starter kit is pricey for mood lighting at $200, but overall the product is very well done. I can definitely imagine purchasing additional starter kits to create different designs in other rooms in the future. My office has a ceiling bulb connected to a HomeKit wall switch, a HomeKit bulb in a desk lamp, two studio lights connected to a HomeKit switch, and now Aurora which is overall my favorite for just general background lighting. Nanoleaf Aurora is like a beautiful screensaver for your wall. Pair that with some music you enjoy and you can create a very ambient lounge experience. Nanoleaf Aurora starter kit is available for $199.99, Aurora expansion kit retails for $59.99, and Best Buy is currently bundling Aurora starter kit and expansion kit together for $199.98. Nanoleaf also makes other interesting HomeKit lighting solutions like the Ivy (reviewed) which you can find on Amazon.

 'Within expectations:' Apple will cut iPhone production to start 2017 Kif Leswing and Reuters Dec. 30, 2016, 1:42 PM 9,727 facebook linkedin twitter email print Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Apple will trim production of iPhones by about 10% in the January-March quarter, Nikkei reported, citing calculations based on data from suppliers. The company slashed output by 30% in the January-March quarter in 2016 because of accumulated inventory, Nikkei reported. Apple sold fewer iPhones in its fiscal 2016 than it had in the previous year for the first time since the iPhone was introduced. 'Within expectations' A source at a parts supplier told Nikkei that the cut was "within expectations," suggesting that Apple's suppliers have been preparing to reduce their dependency on the Cupertino, California, company. The production cuts are likely to affect Apple's 4.7-inch iPhone 7 — not the larger, more expensive iPhone 7 Plus. Demand is stronger for that device, and Apple has had trouble filling demand because its two-lens camera is difficult to manufacture. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo in November forecasted a year-over-year production decline over the entire first half of 2017. "We forecast total shipment volume of iPhones will decline YoY in 1H17 due to weak demand in China, slow shipment volume of 4.7-inch iPhones in 1Q17, and the lack of a new iPhone SE in 2Q17," he wrote in a note distributed to clients in November. The gloomy outlook for sales of Apple's iPhone 7 in 2017 is another reason the company is widely expected to launch an impressive iPhone model in September with a higher-quality screen, wireless charging, and new glass design. Apple's shares were down under 1% in midday trading.

On December 24, 2014, the Modisettes were on Interstate 35, with James needing to slow the car down due to road congestion. The family’s car was then rear-ended by another car at 65 miles per hour, which left Moriah, one of the Modisettes’ daughters, with severe injuries that later resulted in her death. When talking to police, the 20-year-old driver who crashed into the Modisettes’ car admitted to using FaceTime on his iPhone 6 Plus while driving. According to the Modisettes’ complaint, authorities found the FaceTime app open and a call in progress when they arrived at the scene. More: A car accident almost took my brother away, but FaceTime brought him closer The crux of the complaint, which was filed in the Santa Clara County Superior Court in California, does not concern itself with the driver that rear-ended the family’s vehicle. Instead, the lawsuit asserts that the driver’s conduct is “inextricably intertwined” with Apple’s failure to implement a FaceTime feature that renders the app inaccessible while someone is driving. The complaint also chastised Apple for not implementing the aforementioned FaceTime lockout feature, even though the company has the patent for it. Finally, because the iPhone 6 Plus does not implement the technologies for the feature, the lawsuit claims Apple acted with intent to cause injury, with a “willful and knowing disregard of the rights and safety of another” in order to make a profit. “Despite both the technology since 2008 and a patent on that technology so it could exploit its patent without competition for 20 years, defendant Apple has consistently and continuously failed to implement a safer, alternative design that would lock-out and prevent use of FaceTime while driving,” reads a relevant portion of the complaint. The Modisettes’ lawsuit seeks damages, including punitive damages, and medical expenses. Digital Trends reached out to Apple for comment and will update accordingly. Also watch: Share

The UltraFine 5K and 4K displays are optimized for the Mac with tight software integration, and the 5K model in particular with single-cable connection over Thunderbolt 3 has been highly anticipated. Apple has just begun shipping the UltraFine 5K display, and while a handful of lucky customers received their deliveries late last week, availability is significantly increasing this week and we've had about 24 hours with ours to develop some initial impressions. Setup Unlike some other displays, LG's UltraFine 5K comes fully assembled in the box, making setup a breeze. Once you pull the protective sleeve off the display itself and some foam wrap off of the display's foot (and easily peel off an Energy Star sticker), it's just a matter of finding a spot for it on your desk, plugging in the power cord, and connecting the Thunderbolt 3 cable to your MacBook Pro. Also unlike some other displays, the power supply is built into the display itself, so there is no large external power brick to have to find a place for. While the display comes fully assembled, the stand can be easily removed for transport or if you wish to use a VESA arm or wall bracket for mounting the display. LG includes a separate rear cover in the box for use with VESA mounts to make it simple to convert from standing to mounted setups. The UltraFine 5K includes smooth spring and friction height adjustment, making it easy to move the display up and down over a range of 110 mm to find just the right height, while the display can be angled up or down over a range of –5 to +25 degrees. Vertical orientation of the display is not supported, although it can be rotated slightly left or right to compensate for minor leveling issues. A Kensington lock slot is included if you need to secure the display to a desk or other fixed object. With the LG UltraFine 5K able to supply up to 85 watts of power over USB-C, this truly is a one-cable solution even for the 15-inch MacBook Pro, at least for basic setups. The display includes a 1920x1080 camera, speakers, and three downstream 5 Gbps USB-C ports that provide up to 1.5 amps to allow for additional peripherals to be connected hub-style. There isn't even a power button on this display, which keeps the look and functionality clean and simple as the display automatically sleeps and wakes depending on the state of the connected computer. While it's a simple design, the fact that there's a single cable for data and power means that if you want to charge your MacBook Pro through the display, the UltraFine 5K has to be on, which may be an issue for a few users. Build Quality Make no mistake, this doesn't look like an Apple display, but it's certainly not terrible. A metal foot provides solid stability, while the rest of the body is a matte black plastic. My desk setup includes a hutch and I tend to keep the lighting in my office fairly dim, so everything about this display except for the screen itself kind of disappears into the background and doesn't bother me. But if you plan to have this display sitting prominently out in the open, you'll probably notice it's not the prettiest thing on the market. Bezels are a bit larger than many other displays, particularly on the top where the camera and microphone are housed. To be honest though, when you set this display up you're not going to be looking at the bezels. It's the gorgeous 27-inch screen that catches your eye. The 218 ppi IPS display is likely an identical or very similar panel to the one used in Apple's 27-inch Retina iMac, supporting 99 percent of the P3 spectrum for improved color display. The screen itself has a glossy finish, although it does generate considerably less glare than the Apple Thunderbolt Display users may be familiar with. Ports A Thunderbolt 3/USB-C port is the sole input available on the UltraFine 5K, which means you won't be able to hook up multiple sources such as over HDMI or DisplayPort and switch between them. The MacBook Pro uses Thunderbolt 3 over the USB-C port to drive the full 5K resolution over a single cable, while older Thunderbolt Macs can use Apple's adapter to drive the display at lower resolutions. On the downstream side, the three 5 Gbps USB-C ports with 1.5 amp power delivery make for a decent connectivity hub, but the lack of USB-A ports also means you'll likely need some adapters if you want to hook up your peripherals. Resolutions The UltraFine 5K can be managed alongside other displays within the Displays section of System Preferences, and it defaults to a Retina 2560x1440 display, taking full advantage of the massive 5120x2880 screen. Unsurprisingly, text and Retina-optimized images are extremely sharp in this mode. I've been testing the UltraFine 5K as part of a three-display setup, alongside an Apple Thunderbolt Display and the MacBook Pro's own screen. The Retina 2560x1440 display offers the same desktop size as my Apple Thunderbolt Display, which makes for a natural layout and easy transitions between displays. With its Retina display, the UltraFine 5K is obviously much sharper than the Apple Thunderbolt Display, a fact that's impossible to miss. My current desk setup: Apple Thunderbolt Display on left, UltraFine 5K in the middle, and new 15-inch MacBook Pro on right If you prefer a different resolution for the UltraFine 5K, you can select from several other resolution options in System Preferences, including 3200x1800, 2880x1620, 2048x1152, and 1600x900. Interestingly, Apple doesn't offer anything higher than 3200x1800 as a recommended scaled option, although the full 5120x2880 (as well as 1440x810 and 1280x720 low-resolution options) is available if you hold down the option key while clicking the Scaled resolution option. Unsurprisingly, everything is really tiny at the full resolution, as this display packs a lot of pixels. LG Screen Manager The UltraFine 5K and its 4K sibling are supported by an LG Screen Manager app for Mac, which is very similar to the OnScreen Manager app users of some other LG displays might be familiar with. LG Screen Manager supports automatic splitting of a desktop, allowing you to divide your screen into up to four sections to allow multiple apps to be automatically displayed maximized to the size of the section and preventing them from overlapping. As you drag an app to a section, other apps are automatically moved to other sections of the display and everything is resized to fit their new locations if necessary. Example of LG Screen Manager's split view – Dragging Safari from bottom right section to left section will automatically arrange and resize the window to fit the desktop section LG Screen Manager's most handy implementation is through a menu bar app that allows quick access to the different screen splitting options, but it also includes a fully windowed app that allows access to the same options, as well as software updates for the display and links to Apple's System Preferences for adjusting resolution and more. LG Screen Manager menu bar app (left) and main app (right) Bottom Line If you're in the market for a 5K display to use with your new MacBook Pro, you don't really have any other options, as the Thunderbolt 3 standard is just hitting the market. Regardless, this is a very solid display. Image quality is terrific, as anyone with a Retina iMac can attest, with accurate color representation and sharp text and graphics. The physical design may not match Apple's aesthetic, but it's serviceable and relatively non-obtrusive, while the build quality is solid. The $1299 list price is certain to give many pause given other Ultra HD and 4K options on the market for half the price or less, but with Apple's 25 percent discount dropping the price to $974 through the end of March, it really makes this display worth considering. The jump to 5K truly does make a difference compared to displays in the 4K range and the quality of this display is fantastic. The included camera, microphone and speakers are also nice additions for keeping a clean setup if you don't have high-end requirements, and many users upgrading from the Apple Thunderbolt Display would miss them if they hadn't been included. On the downside, the single input may be an issue for some, while only having three USB-C ports on the rear of the display for downstream connections isn't ideal given the USB-A world we're mostly still living in. But USB-C is the future, so the situation will only improve as more and more peripherals adopt the standard. Apple is currently the only authorized retailer for the UltraFine 5K, with online orders currently being quoted shipping estimates of 2–4 weeks and in-store pickup dates listed as early February. Apple's discounted pricing extends through March 31, so users considering placing an order should make sure to lock things in before then.

To be clear, LG did not pay for the post or provide the display. I tried to be fair in my assessment, although I'll admit it's a bit superficial given the limited time I've had with it, so it's more of an impressions post than a full review. The screen is excellent, while the aesthetics of the design are up for debate. They don't really bother me, but I know some people hate the design. It's subjective.

Rating: 11 Votes HadrianMQ 3 days ago at 10:24 am I used Apple products because they are beautiful, sturdy, and cooperate together. I love the harmony of the ecosystem and aesthetics. If I wanted function over form, I would buy PCs - oh wait - I did this year because Apple hasn't updated some products in years. This 3rd party device is part of a problem at Apple and their brand. I've replaced my Airport, monitors, PC, and AppleTV since the ridiculous Apple announcement of the MacBook in October - I am eyeing Google Pixel for phone and tablet in the coming months too. I even abandoned iCloud for Google services. And Siri is a joke next to Google Assistant, so Google Home will happen soon. Apple will need a big bang release of a lot of stuff at one time to really knock my socks off - but I just don't think they can pull it off.

Bigger, better, and curved displays, an all-glass design, wireless charging, and a new embedded home button are just some of the features Apple is reportedly considering for the iPhone 8. Head below for our full roundup of everything we currently know about Apple’s next flagship.  4.7 to 5.8-inch Displays | OLED | Curved  There have been a lot of varying reports about screen sizes for the upcoming iPhones. Updated 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models like the current flagship iPhone 7/7 Plus lineup appear to be in the works, but there are also many reliable reports of a new 5.8-inch flagship model incoming… That 5.8-inch model, according to one report, will actually have a 5.2-inch panel of usable touchscreen space with the remainder of the display curving around the edges of the device. And it’s not just that report that points to evidence Apple is working on a new curved display for some upcoming iPhone models. The Wall Street Journal recently confirmed Apple is prototyping a hi-res curved-screen model as a possible top-tier iPhone 8, and a separate report citing supply chain sources claimed Apple was partnering with LG Display on a foldable OLED for upcoming iPhones. While the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 is said to be the first to switch to an OLED display, one report said the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch updates would remain with LCDs. Though there are a couple additional reports that a 5-inch iPhone model is also being planned for next year, it’s unclear where that would fit in the lineup if accurate, especially if a 4.7-inch model does indeed stick around. Lastly, the company is said to not be planning an update to its current iPhone SE model introduced last March, the last of the 4-inch iPhone models on the market. Apple reportedly sourcing 5.8-inch AMOLED panels for next iPhone exclusively from Samsung Report: Apple planning new 5-inch iPhone model with vertical dual-camera design for 2017 LG Display reportedly partnering with Apple on foldable OLED for upcoming iPhones Report: Apple iPhone 8 to feature plastic, curved, OLED display New profile sheds light on Apple’s push to switch to OLED displays with iPhone 8 Apple prototyping hi-res curved-screen model as possible top-tier iPhone 8 – WSJ Apple planning one 5.2-inch OLED iPhone 8 with major redesign + 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch LCD models iPhone 8: No OLED display expected on 4.7-inch and some 5.5-inch models, dual camera staying Plus exclusive iPhone 8 Plus model likely to use OLED display says Sharp CEO, company could make future iPhone OLEDs in US Nikkei: iPhone 8 will introduce 5-inch version iPhone sales expected to drop in 1st half of 2017 without new SE model, Apple to put margin pressure on suppliers All-Glass Design | New Colors | Apple is planning a new design for the 2017 iPhone lineup that will ditch the aluminium body of the current models in exchange for an all-glass design with metal only around the edge of the device. This comes from several supply chain reports in recent months from typically reliable sources. Think iPhone 4/4S, Apple’s last iPhone model to sport glass on both the front and back, although likely with a much sleeker design overall thanks to the curved display reportedly being planned. The iPhone 4 was offered in black and white, but Apple could have other options as well… A separate report said Apple is planning a red chassis as a new color option for an upcoming iPhone, and there are still rumors floating around that the company is working on a white color option for iPhone 7 that could presumably make its way to the “iPhone 8” next year too. Apple reportedly introducing a red chassis color option with new ‘iPhone 7s’ in 2017 Nikkei: iPhone 8 will introduce all-glass backs across lineup KGI: Apple to drop aluminum iPhone casing in 2017 in favor of new ‘all glass’ enclosure with AMOLED screen KGI: Apple to revamp iPhone lineup in 2017 w/ iPhone 4-like design Wireless charging | If all the supply chain chatter is accurate, wireless charging functionality could be one of the highlight new features for the iPhone 8. A recent report from KGI said Apple was planning to offer wireless charging on three new iPhone models (4.7-inch, 5.5-inch and the new 5.8-inch), though the supply chain analysts also suggested the wireless charger would not be bundled with the device and instead sold as a separate accessory. Backing up the report, separate supply chain intel back in October claimed Apple manufacturing partner Foxconn was producing and testing wireless charging modules for iPhone 8. Inductive wireless charging has been available via accessories and on other smartphones for quite a while, but Apple has made it known publicly that it doesn’t like the tech. The company’s head of marketing Phil Schiller noted back in 2012 that “wireless charging systems still have to be plugged into the wall, so it’s not clear how much convenience they add.” That’s what makes Apple’s reported connection with Energous, a company that has developed a truly wireless charging solution called WattUp, all that more interesting. The technology can charge devices from up to 15ft away using a single transmitter and a receiver embedded into your device. That means no charging mats or additional accessories to plug-in like current solutions. A recent report noted that Apple supplier Dialog has partnered with Energous. Before that discovery, a separate story detailed what appeared to be evidence between Apple and Energous, although the company later responded, it didn’t deny a partnership with Apple. Ahead of iPhone 8, Apple supplier Dialog partners with long-range wireless charging company Energous iPhone 8 to eclipse sales record set by iPhone 6, wireless charging on high-end and low-end models Apple to incorporate wireless charging into ‘all-glass’ iPhone 8 in 2017, but wireless charger may not be bundled in the box Report: Foxconn currently producing & testing wireless charging modules for iPhone 8 KGI: Apple to revamp iPhone lineup in 2017 w/ iPhone 4-like design, wireless charging More evidence Apple is working on wireless charging tech with Energous Embedded Home Button | It has been rumored for several years now that Apple is experimenting with a Home button embedded right into the iPhone’s display and Apple even has patents for such a concept. That would allow it to reduce or perhaps remove the bezel on the front and increase screen real-estate without increasing the size of the device. One patent showed Apple is even exploring methods of allowing fingerprint recognition almost anywhere on the screen. Add in the curved display that Apple is reportedly considering for at least some of the new iPhones and you can imagine what could be quite a stunning update for the front side of the iPhone 8 with near edge-to-edge glass.

In January, 2016 a report said Apple was building a secret research team to develop virtual and augmented reality tech including reportedly prototyping VR headsets. A  separate report back in November claimed Apple is working on AR features that will debut first in a future iPhone’s camera app and tap into technology the company picked up through its acquisition of Metaio and others. That includes object and facial recognition camera features, according to the report, with plans for an SDK for app developers down the road. A separate report from Bloomberg said Apple is exploring digital glasses that could be released as early as 2018.

Moriah Modisette was sitting in the back seat of her parents' car when another vehicle slammed into them - killing the five-year-old. Driver Garrett Wilhelm, 22, is accused of using FaceTime at the moment he hit Moriah's parents James and Bethany's car at 65mph. According to investigators Wilhem, who has been charged with manslaughter, still had FaceTime active when police officers arrived at the fatal crash scene. Garrett Wilhelm was arrested following the crash (Photo: Police Handout) Moriah was killed in the accident on Christmas Eve 2014, but her parents have now reportedly launched a suit against Apple claiming FaceTime was a 'substantial factor in causing the plaintiff's injuries and decedent's death.' In court papers the family, from Texas, allege Apple is responsible for the death because of its "failure to install and implement the safer, alternative design for which it sought a patent in December 2008 to ‘lock out’ the ability of drivers to utilize the ‘FaceTime’ application on the Apple iPhone when driving a motor vehicle, which resulted in the injuries sustained by plaintiffs". Read More Woman hands sippy cup 'filled with wine to child to avoid being caught drink driving by police' The family further says in its complaint: "Defendant Apple Inc. has had the technology to prevent these events, and the Modisettes’ injuries, specifically since at least Dec. 12, 2008, when it filed an application with the US Patent Office for a ‘driver handheld computing device lock-out." The FaceTime app appears on Apple phones (stock image) (Photo: Getty) The Modisettes also claim that by failing to implement the alleged technology, Apple has "breached a duty of care to plaintiffs." Wilhelm was on his way to visit his parents when he allegedly smashed into the rear of the Modisettes' Toyota.

As consumers hurried to buy Apple’s new product this holiday season, Inventec is now rumored to have started expanding its capacity in some of its plants in Shanghai “in order to satisfy increasing demand for the earphones and the plants are currently working overtime to deliver orders,” the report says. When the AirPods were released on Dec. 13, Apple noted the earphones would begin shipping in “limited quantities” at launch, which was rumored before. However, the shipping date was extended to more than four weeks, and six weeks a day after the AirPods were released. But customers said they were notified that they were getting their wireless earphones sooner than they expected.

Apple CEO Tim Cook called the AirPods a “runaway success” in an interview with CNBC this week at the New York Stock Exchange. "We're making them just as fast as we can," he said. Cook added that Apple has had a “great” holiday season overall. The AirPods, which come with a charging case, are priced at $159. The product was announced during Apple’s September event alongside the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The AirPods were supposed to launch in October but the release date was delayed.

Skip to content Search for: Search Kopitiam Bot News · Lifestyle · Tech · Singapore Home Current Affairs Technology Startups Money Matters Lifestyle Contact Us About Technology Can we go back in time and wipe Assassin’s Creed film from our DNA? Date: 2016-12-31Author: kopitiambot (Source: arstechnica.com) The most telling line in the Assassin’s Creed film, based on the video games of the same name, comes about midway through the film. Our hero, Callum Lynch (Michael Fassbender), is bombarded by nonsensical comments while trying to eat his lunch. After he’s left alone for a moment, he chuckles to himself—the first and only time he does so in an organic fashion through the whole movie—before exclaiming, “What the fuck is going on?” I’m shocked that the filmmakers left this moment in the film, seeing as how Assassin’s Creed’s every element—the plot beats, the characters’ decisions, the logical leaps—begs such a question. Assassin’s Creed has the dubious honor of combining ho-hum action sequences, half-baked characters, and a script no larger than a doctor’s free pamphlet. The results leave both series fans and curious passersby with nothing to sink their hidden blades into. Apple of no one’s eye Lynch’s origin story will sound familiar to anybody who has ever played the games. Most of them star a modern Everyman-with-a-checkered-past… who just so happens to have a bunch of badass assassin ancestors. Rather than try to recreate the games’ longtime protagonist, Desmond Miles, Director Justin Kurzel (Snowtown) starts from scratch with Fassbender’s Lynch—who, much like Miles, almost immediately gets tangled up with a shady research institute. Lynch is kidnapped, and his body is plugged into a giant, hydraulic claw. This device, called the Animus, reads Lynch’s DNA before overloading his mind and senses with the feeling that he’s back in the year 1492. Convinced he’s in the Renaissance, Lynch relives the adventurous memories of a Spanish ancestor named Aguilar who was a member of a longtime order of assassins. They were charged with protecting the world’s citizens from an equally longtime order of devious “Templars.” (By the way: Spain, 1492. Yes, you are free to start groaning at the duhhh-I-saw-it-coming possibilities.) At the outset, I had faint hopes that Kurzel’s film might pull off a high-octane version of Quantum Leap or Doctor Who. The game series, after all, updates its location, time, and historical potential with every entry. The problem with the game sequels is that they rarely match their new settings with new gameplay. With TV or a film, on the other hand, that kind of new-every-episode refresh can be a fun way to mix familiar, beloved characters with new villains and bizarre circumstances. The film’s first problem comes from how painfully thin the script is. Does Lynch have a personality? Hard to tell. All he gets to do is groan about his captivity, groan about his pain, and groan about his confusion. His history and personality are hinted at with a three-second glimpse at a wall of news clippings about his life—the kind of stuff, I should note, that gamers would get to pore over during a lengthy quest. Movie viewers aren’t given this luxury. The only other speaking character with a sliver of personality is Sofia, played by Oscar-winner Marion Cotillard. She’s the primary researcher assigned to Lynch’s DNA depths. She wants Lynch to help her discover Eden’s Apple—a holy relic that she’s been led to believe will let her “cure” all of mankind’s violent tendencies. Spoiler alert: Eden’s Apple does this by depriving all humans of their capacity for free will. When Sofia eventually learns this from Rikkin (her father, played by Jeremy Irons), she acts plum-shocked that such a thing could happen. Um, no. Cotillard’s biggest screw-up in her portrayal of Sofia is that she’s clearly a good actress, and she therefore resembles a reasoned, emotionally capable person who should have such insight. “Maybe taking away the ability to be violent, which has decided the fates of various species throughout the entirety of evolution, might be a misguided goal,” you’d expect her to mutter at some point. That doesn’t happen. We only hear insipid one-liners, as if we’re too stupid to question how ridiculous they sound. When Rikkin stands before a UN-like committee in an early scene, he declares, “The economic impact of antisocial behavior was $9 trillion last year.” What? What’s the metric here? Reality TV ratings? Number of houses TP’ed in the nice part of town? Ninja, ninja, rrrrrap Assassin’s Creed’s modern-day characters receive no development, and gosh, the fact that the movie squanders Michael “Omar from The Wire” Williams as a result is unforgivable. Worse, once Lynch enters the Animus and slashes dozens of fools in 15th-century Andalusia, dialogue pretty much drops to zero. Even the worst Assassin’s Creed games pump their worlds full of dialogue, stories, and history odes—and those are often my favorite parts of the games because they show just how much the series’ developers love their source material. Kurzel seems content to conjure up an imaginary version of Renaissance Spain. If the action were up to snuff, that might be tolerable. Bad news: Assassin’s Creed is replete with some of the most cookie-cutter martial arts to pad a blockbuster in years. You wanna know Fassbender’s cleverest attack? While cocking an arrow back, he uses his elbow to smack a guy’s jaw before releasing the arrow and shooting someone else. (“Elbow-and-arrow,” I wrote in my notepad.) Further Reading How Ubisoft kept the lid on Assassin’s Creed III‘s biggest spoilerThe main reason I clearly remember that elbow-to-jaw moment is because nothing else came close, unless you count the film’s final, hilariously awkward fight. This cheeseball, one-at-a-time karate-and-swords fight—complete with armies of armed guards who shout maniacally for no logical reason—better resembles something out of a ’90s Ninja Turtles film than an Assassin’s Creed game. Did you come hoping for at least a few authentic, series-worthy run-and-climb moments? Fassbender and his ancient-Spain cohorts occasionally jump from rooftop to rooftop, sure, but the whole thing honestly looks more like the Prince of Persia game remasters than it does an Assassin’s Creed title. This film’s namesake games astounded when they first debuted because of their amazing wall-scaling and parkour movement systems. You’re not gonna find much of that here. (Series note: thank goodness at least one dude fell from a great height into a bale of hay, but not the same way that you do in the games.) I appreciate that the film relies largely on practical effects, as opposed to a boatload of CGI. What’s more, the Animus sequences—in which modern-day Fassbender jumps around in a lab and battles transparent, particle-loaded versions of his time-travel foes—look cool on occasion. That’s in spite of the Animus contraption, which straps to Fassbender’s back and resembles this South Park episode. Someone, please go back in time and unmake this movie By the end, the whole production goes off the rails. Its Brave New World Eden’s Apple schtick concludes with Sofia blaming Lynch for committing a crime that she encouraged him to do, at which point she gives up on her save-the-world perspective and turns into a furrow-browed villain (just before the credits roll, of course). This crime, by the way, happens inside the most sensationally protected sanctuary of rich nobles, and it happens so quickly and uncontested that you get the feeling the film’s editor had a train to catch. The only thing that got me through the movie was my belief that Ubisoft could honestly try again. Fassbender is clearly a great actor (although I’ve never seen such talent chained to such a rusty furnace of source material). Someone half as good as Fassbender could carry a serial TV show about a time-traveling assassin who lands in a new time period, complete with tons of series-worthy historical-icon cameos, every 44 minutes. If we could pretend this movie never existed, that’d help. My advice to Ubisoft: please hook one of your executives to the Animus and have him or her assassinate this filmmaking disaster from the nucleotides within all of our DNA.

Apple may manufacture iPhones in India from April 2017 International Business Times 3 days ago Sarmistha Acharya © Reuters/Arnd Wiegmann Apple to manufacture iPhones in India Apple is reportedly planning to manufacture iPhones for Indian consumers in the Silicon Valley of the country, Bengaluru. Wistron, a Taiwanese original equipment manufacturer for Apple is setting up a facility in Peenya, the industrial hub of the city. The facility will begin production from April next year, industry sources told daily news outlet The Times of India. There has been no official word so far about the project. The sources told TOI that Apple is quite serious about starting the assembly operations. The full manufacturing line is expected to begin sometime at the end of next year. The sources said, "Bangalore is being looked at seriously." Apple has even posted job opening on its portal at its OEM's factory in Bengaluru for positions such as operations programme manager and product quality manager. Taiwan-based OEM, Foxconn, was earlier expected to set up a manufacturing plant in the western state of Maharashtra. While there were reports suggesting the plant would make only Apple products, but sources say that Foxconn seems to have tied up with firms such as Xiaomi and OnePlus. Setting up facility is not the first biggest announcement Apple made for India. In May this year the company said it would establish a Design and Development Accelerator in Bengaluru, which the company is calling as first-of-its-kind center to support developers creating mobile apps in India. The iOS App Design and Development Accelerator is expected in early 2017. According to data shared by Counterpoint Technology Market Research, Apple sold 2.5 million iPhones in India from October 2015 to September 2016, marking a rise of more than 50% over the year-ago period. It made INR 9,997 crore (£1.19bn) in 2016 financial year, a 56% growth from INR 6,472 crore earlier.

The drive is actually still working but it's PATA. I always enter these things but never win and forget to ever check who wins or if they ever announce it. The chance you win here is probably less than getting hit by lightning.;) Sorry, couldn't resist.:p Rating: 5 Votes classicalbear 3 days ago at 01:40 pm Can't wait for those to be affordable, SSD is still very expensive. And too bad I'm in Canada :-( Rating: 2 Votes Johnny907 3 days ago at 11:28 pm So why are you an Apple consumer? ... because I can't build a MacBook? Or an iPhone? Or an Apple Watch? Or an iPad? I can, however, easily assemble an external SSD drive for a fraction of the cost of third party solutions like this, thus saving money that can otherwise be used to purchase all of the above mentioned Apple products Rating: 2 Votes rGiskard 10 hours ago at 09:13 am I used to use HDDs striped too, but nah, it's still slow for non-sequential I/O. Your system or a database should run much better on an SSD. Oh definitely, I only use HDD's for backup or audio/video libraries. I'm rockin' a Samsung SM951 boot drive in my Mac Pro. :p Unfortunately the G-Drive SSD is a bit of a dog. ('http://www.anandtech.com/show/10840/gtechnology-gdrive-slim-ssd-usbc-500gb-external-ssd-capsule-review') I'd probably just go for the HDD and use it for backup. Rating: 1 Votes bladerunner2000 3 days ago at 11:24 pm I'll take a free one but I'd never pay 230 bucks for something I could make myself with a $109 512GB SSD and $20 USB-C enclosure that supported UASP and get the exact same performance and form factor for a hundred bucks less.

Video provided by TheStreet Newslook LOS ANGELES — Apple continued its winning ways in 2016, with one product that sold more units than any other competitor, the top-selling iPhone. But the year was controversial, as the company angered longtime customers by removing popular features from products and falling further behind Amazon, Google and Facebook in innovation. There’s a lot more you can do with your new iPhone than simply take photos, listen to music and make calls.  (Photo: Apple) KTLA-TV tech reporter Rich DeMuro joined USA TODAY for a Facebook Live video chat, as we compared notes on Apple's year. Click the link below to view our nearly 30-minute conversation. "Apple didn't blow us away with anything brand new, but they delivered on what they do best," said DeMuro. Or in other words, the new iPhone and iPads were the same old product with a new skin and a few new features. That said, I find the latest iPhone, the 7 Plus, to be Apple's best ever, with water resistance and a terrific camera with two lenses. Two big issues didn't get fixed, though: a longer-lasting battery and screens that won't crack. Grade: After a string of new products that were more updates than anything new, I give Apple a B- in innovation in 2016, with an A for running the company efficiently. DeMuro offers a C+ for innovation and A+ for operations. That leaves my grade at B and his at B+. The company generated over $200 billion in revenue from the fourth quarter of 2015 through the first three quarters of 2016. KTLA-TV reporter Rich DeMuro joined USA TODAY for a Facebook Live video chat about Apple's 2016  (Photo: Jefferson Graham) But it wasn't an easy year for the company. First Apple gave us a new iPhone without a headphone jack, saying it took courage to ditch the standard port we’ve grown accustomed to all these years. Then it brought us new Macintosh laptops a few months later with a headphone jack, but minus all the accessory slots we pros live on such as an SD memory card slot to import photos, and videos and USB slots to plug in external hard drives and charge the iPhone. USA TODAY I'm really missing the SD slot on the new MacBook Pro Apple introduced smaller versions of the iPhone and iPad, put a smartphone like TouchBar on new MacBook Pros and gave us some odd-looking wireless headphones, called AirPods, that were recently released after a long production delay. USA TODAY Review: After shaky start, Apple's wireless Bluetooth AirPods work great The company tried to convince us that after five years, the personal digital assistant Siri was finally ready for prime time because now developers could add Siri to their apps. DeMuro and I agree that Siri still isn’t cutting it for us, even if you can use it on Uber.

That said, kudos to Apple for not giving up on it and still trying. Echo.  (Photo: Amazon.com) With the Mac Pro laptop update, Apple turned its backs on pros and raised prices to the point where many started looking seriously to Windows for the first time in years. Then again, the computer division is tiny compared to the cash cow of the iPhone. Despite Apple losing the cool mantle to competitors, it still outsells everyone. Amazon had a killer year with the Echo-connected speaker that sold out for the holidays. Analysts project Amazon to have sold around 10 million Echos. Apple will sell way more than 200 million iPhones this year, an amazing feat. But watching the company isn't as much fun as it used to be, with all the product stumbles of 2016.

Co. Ltd.’s Best Moves in 2016 In 2016, TSMC enjoyed an improved positioning at Apple, made progress on next-generation technologies, and defended its position in older, lucrative technologies. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Dec 30, 2016 at 9:41AM Contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), commonly abbreviated as TSMC, has had a good year in 2016. Its stock price is up 28% year to date, and it's expected to enjoy more than 13% revenue growth this year, as well as nearly 10% earnings-per-share growth for the year. The company made a lot of good moves this year. Here are three of its best. Winning all the A10 orders In 2014, TSMC won all of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) A8 chip orders, which meant that every single iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus that was shipped included a TSMC-built applications processor. Considering that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were enormous successes for Apple, this translated into a nice win for TSMC. In 2015, however, TSMC didn't win the entirety of Apple's A9 chip orders. In fact, numerous reports from the press and the analyst community pointed to TSMC only winning a minority allocation of those chips. However, TSMC is believed to be the sole manufacturer of the A10 processors that power Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones. It's also believed to have won both the chip manufacturing orders, as well as the packaging orders for the A10. (This means more revenue share for TSMC.) Image source: TSMC.  Broadening the business with 7-nanometer tech TSMC is planning to begin generating revenue from its 10-nanometer chip-manufacturing technology in the first half of 2017, but that technology is expected to be short-lived and utilized by only a handful of customers. The next "major" technology from TSMC is expected to be its 7-nanometer technology, which promises performance, power, and area improvements over its 10-nanometer technology. TSMC has said that this technology "has been adopted not only by high-end mobile customers, but also by high-performance computing customers for [graphics processing units], gaming, [personal computers] and tablet[s], virtual reality, server, FPGA, automotive, and networking applications." Although it'll be a while before revenue from these design wins start rolling in -- expect the first revenue during the first half of 2018 -- TSMC's commentary points to strong execution in both the technology, as well as in securing a broad range of customers. It will be interesting to see just how much revenue growth it can drive, especially in applications beyond mobile, in the years ahead. Staying strong in older technologies Although much of the fanfare is around the latest manufacturing technologies from companies like TSMC, the reality is that a lot of the revenue and gross profit dollars that contract-chip manufacturers generate comes from older technologies. While there have been worries that less advanced chipmakers might begin to take share from TSMC in older technologies, like the 28-nanometer technology, TSMC has consistently managed to keep demand very high for such technologies. "Our 28-nanometer capacity remained fully utilized and represented 24% of our wafer revenue in the third quarter," said TSMC CFO Lora Ho. TSMC co-CEO C.C. Wei also said that demand for its 28-nanometer technology "has continued to be strong throughout this year and is expected to last through many years." When management was asked about potential competitive threats from tier-2 chip manufacturers for 28-nanometer business, co-CEO Mark Liu expressed confidence that the company could maintain market share in this technology generation.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Dec 30, 2016 at 10:10AM While the fourth quarter has not quite ended, and it will take a while to sort out all the winners and losers of the 2016 holiday shopping season, two clear victors have emerged. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) said in a press release that "this 2016 holiday was the best-ever season," noting that it shipped more than 1 billion items worldwide with Prime and Fulfillment by Amazon. The online retailer also reported strong sales for its Alexa-powered devices Echo and Dot, with sales for the artificial intelligence (AI) home assistants seeing sales rise by over nine times compared to last year's holiday season. The other big winner of the season, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), claimed 44% of all phones and tablets activated during the season, according to data from Flurry's Analytics Blog. That's actually down from 49% last year, but it's still double the nearest competitor. Amazon's Echo and Dot devices were big sellers this year. Image source: Amazon. Amazon totally crushed it While the online retailer rarely shares specific sales numbers for its devices or membership counts for Prime, it did offer some information in its post-Christmas press release. The company called the number of devices purchased from its Echo family of products "record setting," while also calling its Fire TV Stick and Fire tablets best-sellers. "Echo and Echo Dot were the best-selling products across Amazon this year, and we're thrilled that millions of new customers will be introduced to Alexa as a result," said Amazon's Worldwide Consumer CEO Jeff Wilke. "Despite our best efforts and ramped-up production, we still had trouble keeping them in stock." Amazon also celebrated (without offering any numbers) its $99-a-year Prime service, which offers free two-day delivery along with other perks. The company said that "more people around the world tried Prime this holiday season than any previous year." It also said that Dec. 23 was the biggest day ever for Prime Now (its two-hour delivery service available in limited markets) with the number of items ordered increasing by three times over last year. A good year for Apple, too Apple does very little discounting during the holiday season (though it did offer some limited deals on Black Friday). That did not stop it from seeing iPhones and iPads fly off the shelves, with the company leading in activations, with 44% of all devices. That's more than twice the 21% Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) was able to score to come in second, according to Flurry. Still, while "Apple devices continue to be the gift to give," according to Flurry, Samsung has to be pleased that it not only held the No. 2 spot, it inched up 1% over last year. That's a victory given the massive recall of Galaxy Note 7s the company had to conduct in 2016. These results show that while Apple remains popular, Samsung had enough goodwill to move past its difficult year. That may be good news for the Galaxy maker in 2017 when Apple will likely release a 7s, not a full update to its phone. The gifts that keep on giving By selling phones and home-based voice assistants in large numbers, both Amazon and Apple set themselves up for a strong year. Anyone who owns an iPhone or iPad will likely buy apps, Apple Music, or other services, putting more money in Apple's coffers. The same is true for Echo, which allows customers to subscribe to Amazon's music service and buy items from the online retailer. In addition, while some people do mix and match, if a person buys an iPad or iPhone, he or she may purchase other devices in the Apple family. The same is true for Amazon, as Echo sales could lead to people buying Fire tablets or Fire TV because they have become comfortable with the retailer's Alexa voice assistant. It's possible for both companies that going forward these sales could lead to consumers using their devices to automate their homes -- allowing for even more sales opportunities.

Its compact design easily fits in a pocket or on a keychain. GoPower Watch Earlier this year Kanex released the GoPower Watch, a cordless portable charger for Apple Watch with 4,000 mAh of power.

Garrett Wilhelm, 22, had been using FaceTime when he smashed into the back of James and Bethany Modisette's car going 65mph in 2014, killing their daughter Moriah who was sitting in the back seat. Wilhelm - whose FaceTime app was still active when officers arrived on the scene - faces a manslaughter charge for the crash. But the Modisettes claim that Apple's product was also a 'substantial factor in causing the plaintiffs' injuries and decedent's death.' Moriah Modisette (pictured) was killed in a deadly car crash in 2014 after a driver, who was using Facetime, smashed into her family's car James and Bethany Modisette are suing Apple claiming its FaceTime app was responsible The couple is now suing Apple for undisclosed damages in a wrongful death lawsuit. Filed in California last week, the lawsuit stated that Apple was liable for the fatal crash because its 'failure to install and implement' a patented design to be able to 'lock out' the app while users were driving. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Did YOU get an iPhone for Christmas? Apple dominated the... Share this article Share The patent would have used GPS tracking to determine the speed a user was travelling to prevent the app from working. However, it is not clear how that technology would work for passengers, or people travelling on buses or other public transport. 'Despite both the technology since 2008 and a patent on that technology so it could exploit its patent without competition for 20 years,' declares the court filing, 'defendant Apple has consistently and continuously failed to implement a safer, alternative design that would lock-out and prevent use of FaceTime while driving.'   Little Moriah died from her injuries shortly after the crash on Christmas Eve in 2014 The suit claims that the conduct of the driver was 'inextricably intertwined' with Apple's failure to implement the lock-out feature.  The Modisettes claim in their filing that by failing to implement the technology, Apple has 'breached a duty of care to plaintiffs.' They also claim that the cost of implementing the design would be 'minimal' for Apple and holds 'no conceivable disadvantage' for the tech giant, although provides no evidence in the lawsuit. Garret Wilhelm, (pictured)  of Gainesville, who was on his way to visit his parents in Keller, had slammed into the back of the family's Toyota Camry at speed DailyMail.com has reached out to Apple for comment. The grieving parents filed the lawsuit after the tragic loss of their daughter in the Christmas Eve crash in 2014. James Modisette had been driving with his family on the Interstate 35W when he slowed down as he approached traffic.  Wilhelm, of Gainesville, who was on his way to visit his parents in Keller, had slammed into the back of the family's Toyota Camry at speed. Wilhelm's Toyota 4Runner rolled 'up and over the driver's side of the Modisette car,' the lawsuit states, critically injuring James and five -year-old Moriah, seated behind him. James, his wife Bethany, and their eight-year-old daughter Isabella were taken by ambulance to Denton Regional Medical Center, along with Wilhelm, for treatment. Meanwhile Moriah was airlifted to Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth. She later died of her injuries, reports the Denton Record-Chronicle. Texas is one of the last states which still allows motorists to use their cellphones while driving. However, local ordinances are in effect in both San Antonio and Austin which prevent it.

Happy New Year firework wallpapers The top stories of the week on iDB How to use AirPods like a pro   skip to main content skip to main menu     Samsung developing own AirPods-like earphones for Galaxy S8 launch By Christian Zibreg, Dec 30, 2016 Tweet 169 Comments Samsung is probably going to rip off AirPods next: the company should debut all-new wireless earphones alongside Galaxy S8 launch, according to confidential information received by SamMobile. “Samsung is surely looking to put out a product that competes with Apple’s AirPods,” reads the report. Samsung, of course, was found guilty of lifting Apple’s hardware and software designs in the past. It currently owes the Cupertino firm hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. Back in 2015, Samsung copied the look and feel of Apple’s wired EarPods for Galaxy S6. This won’t be Samsung’s first-ever wireless audio gizmo: the company recently launched a pair of Bluetooth fitness earbuds, called Gear Icon X, depicted top of post. They’re Samsung’s first completely wireless headphones. It’s unclear whether the upcoming earphones would be bundled along with Galaxy S8 or sold separately and if they might use Harman Kardon technology as Samsung is in the process of buying Harman International Industries for a reported $8 billion. SamMobile reported earlier that Galaxy S8 would lose the 3.5mm headphone jack. Bloomberg reported that the upcoming Galaxy will beat iPhone 8 to the virtual Home button and bezel-free appearance because it would use an in-screen Home button. Other outlets have said that a new six-inch Galaxy S8 Plus model would be joining the mix as a viable option for those who may prefer the Note phablet. Last but not least, Galaxy S8 is expected to use Viv personal assistant technology from the creators of Siri, provide dual cameras out the back just like iPhone 7 Plus and possibly boost display resolution to a sharp 4K.

And how is some unknown, unheard of, RUMORED device considering copying? I can’t wait for Apple to release their iPhone edge and see what kind of comments I’ll find here. Docservlet Bluetooth headphones have been around for a long time. Your trying to say that AirPods are the same as any old dumb bluetooth headset. How could you make such a stupid comparison? John Because he doesnt have a clue what hes talking about but thinks he does. jOn Garrett I’m talking about an article about a Samsung product that doesn’t even exist yet somehow Samsung is already accused of copying Apple’s wireless buds when Samsung actually had wireless buds in stores BEFORE Apple even ANNOUNCED their ear tampons. Docservlet Samsung has been consistent in their copying. Rowan09 What did Apple do to you because you’re the biggest fan on this site? Please don’t tell me Samsung hearing aids look better than Apples wireless headsets? jOn Garrett What pissed me off and turned me away from Apple was when I had the iPhone 4. At that time I was an apple fan and had zero interest in Android. So one day, I see a Samsung phone, the one that was in the chimerical where the guy thinks he’s killing a spider but breaks the phone. The display was stunning. I wanted a phone with a display like that. I grew tired of the jailbreaks. Apple trying to control what people do with their own property. I got tired of the cat and mouse iOS updates and waiting for a jailbreak. I was moding my phone more and more to have all those cool things I saw on Android phones so one day I switched. Funny thing is that my first Android phone was shitty, the S2 and I hated everything about the hardware but really liked what I could do with Android. When Steve Jobs made 2 comments I knew at that moment that I would never support apple. 1. When he said 2011 was the year of the copycats when Android OEM’s released their first tablets. The message he sent was clear–the message was that I don’t have the right to buy anything unless I buy it from him. 2. When he called Android a stolen product!!! I was like what? WTF is this guy saying? He’s a sick fuk. So then he goes on to say that he would spend all of Apple’s billions on his (failed) war against Android. So again, this man tells the world that nobody has the right to offer competing products and I have to buy only his. Those 2 things turned me off immensely, if Samsung or Google ever does that I’d never buy their sh’!t again either. I would not buy another iPhone until the 6 plus which died of touch disease and or a bad battery. I only bought the i7 because the 6 plus died. Rowan09 Oh now I see. Android was stolen software hence they pay Microsoft and others royalty. Did you see how an android phone was suppose to look before the iPhone was released? Androids were going to look like a blackberry bold and changed after the iPhone was released. jOn Garrett There’s nothing wrong with them reworking it. They’d be stupid not to, that’s how competition works. The Android OS was not stolen, they changed it from hardware interface to touch. Touch interface existed a decade before the iPhone and capacitive touch wasn’t developed by apple. Companies have every right to licence their tech to other OEM’s LG chose to do so. Take what’s coming up next, wireless charging from a distance–Apple had ZERO to do with its development, they’re going to license it as will Samsung and others but guess how it will be spun on this site and others? Rowan09 Hold on Apple is licensing true wireless? Where did you read that story? Who told you Apple doesn’t invest into some tech development? jOn Garrett Far field wireless charging is almost a decade old and several companies have been developing this tech since then. There’s a company called Energous, I think that’s how it’s spelled–I read somewhere a while back that both Samsung and Apple have invested in this company. There are 2 other companies that Apple will partner with, I can’t remember the names but I’ll try to find them for you. Rowan09 Right Apple doesn’t need to make everything that would just be stupid. As I stated investing into the tech means paying cash for it. I and everyone cares less who makes it in future phones, if Apple is first and it works they get the credit and vice versa. Wireless charging on the S devices are really not needed at all and if you don’t buy a wireless pad you are not missing out on any experience. jOn Garrett Tech doesn’t leap over tech. Without black and white TVs they’re would be no color. Prop planes before jets, and muskets before M-16’s That doesn’t mean that those things of the past were not good or were not useful. You can’t say that wireless charging on S devices aren’t needed–everybody that has wireless charging now likes it and benefits from it. And I hope you don’t think the next iPhone won’t have the exact same thing because it will. Rowan09 Here’s why it’s a gimmick now but if they do get rid of the headphone jack it’s now becomes needed just like on the iPhone 7. Apple needs wireless charging in its current state on the iPhone 7 because there is only 1 port just like on the rumored S8. On the S7 Edge however it serve no real purpose and doesn’t solve a problem. Something is a gimmick when it doesn’t solve any problem like eye scroll. jOn Garrett Two questions for you and answer them honestly. 1. Why is everything an iPhone doesn’t have its a gimmick? No matter the feature, if iPhones don’t have it it’s a gimmick until the iPhone gets it. What problem was solved by apple removing the jack? So by your own definition Apple removing it was a gimmick. The edge on an iPhone solves no problems. When Apple first used a 64bit processor (with just 1GB of RAM it solved no problems. The S8 being all glass removing it is necessary same with all glass body, that was a necessity to accommodate wireless charging which is why Apple is going back to it. Mike You don’t own a Samsung S7 Edge… You always bash on it like it’s a 10 year old phone. It lags? you probably don’t know how to use it… The screen is a big deal actually you look at it all day long and you don’t watch movies on your phone most of the time. You will be waiting for that file manager for a long long time. Rowan09 Oh yes here we go. If you search the web you hear from fanboy and girls how Touch wiz is horrible and it’s nothing like pure Android, blah, blah, blah. I never comment on something being bad unless I own it. The S7 Edge is slower than the iPhone 6-7. I probably don’t know how to unlock a phone and wait for an application to open up? Come on man I hack and modify everything I own and I am also a repair technician. Do I really have to take a picture now? I owned 2 S7 Edges remember the buy 1 get one free deal with 2 VR headsets. I did that deal. My wife has the S6 Edge and when I got her the S7 Edge she didn’t like it, so I sold it. Even though the gold 32Gb was “sold out” I couldn’t get anything but base price for it. I also sold one the VR headsets once it finally arrived and kept 1 VR and 1 S7 Edge. I have 4 lines with t-mobile (get 3 for $150 get forth line free) My wife has the S6 Edge (1 line), my daughter has an iPhone 6S (second line), I have an iPhone 7 Plus (3rd line) and the other S7 Edge (4th line). I also own a S4 and Note 2 which I kept since I can’t make any money from selling them. jOn Garrett I’m taking about the Gear icon X you fool. And this article is about a Samsung product that doesn’t even exist!!!! Docservlet Gear Icon x are junk you moron. jOn Garrett Dude your brain in junk. Docservlet Dude your brain is a worthless dysfunctional piece of crap John Smith Stop being naive. I myself can make a crappy wireless earbuds just to be called first. Icon was crap jOn Garrett How do you know Icon are crap and the Apple buds are not considering you’re just another iDiot who hasn’t used either. Docservlet Because I’ve owned both idiot jOn Garrett You own a shi’ty boost mobile phone with Android gingerbread and $3 earphones you purchased on the street. Docservlet I owned your little mind. I’ve had android and iPhone since 2009. jOn Garrett So lemme get this straight. Android is so shi’!ty and Apple is so great yet you have been buying Android phones–flagship Android according to your comments for 7 FKing years? Do you realize how stupid you sound? If you’re going to lie, at least try to sound believable. Docservlet So let me get this straight….you don’t think that people can buy and use android phones as part of their jobs for 7 years? And you’re idiotic enough to profess that you think I’m the liar while your troll Apple sites like an insecure dbag? LOL jOn Garrett Your posts are childish and immature. There’s no way you’ve been working anywhere for 7 years. I doubt very much that you’re older than 15. People who have to use certain phones for work done have to buy them, they’re given to them by their employers. Docservlet LOL. You fail at logic as usual. Do you think that those who administer, test and deploy mobile solutions inside of Fortune 500 companies have to buy their own gear. Do you think that perhaps they are responsible for purchasing decisions and deployment? Of course an 8 year old fandroid like you wouldn’t be able to think himself out of a box but I believe we’ve all come to expect that from you. Your posts have reflected your deep sense of insecurity and general state of idiocy. John Smith I have none but seen both reviews on Youtube. AirPods battery = 5 hours. Icon battery = 1 hour, that’s enough to shut your mouth jOn Garrett So watching a YouTube review is the same as using something and judging for yourself????!!!! That’s like watching your friends have sex and saying you did it too! lmfao MvP77 I don’t see how this is saying they are developing air pod like headphones when I been rocking Gear Icon X in the picture since august. Maybe they are developing the icon x 2. Neither Samsung or Apple where the first with completely wireless headphones. Natalie I’m waiting on my Phazon earbuds to get to me. I think they might be the best pair of earbuds on the market to date. John Ure kidding right? MMA Rules Your famous IconX have such bad reviews that people have been returning them, check Amazon! They are a half baked product! MvP77 Oh golly, guess I should return a product I like and use almost daily because some people I don’t know gave it bad reviews. You know, I read a couple bad reviews about my iPhone and MacBook to. Guess I’ll return those also! John Smith “Rocking”? Lol half hour battery life askep3 The iPhone 8 better be good, otherwise anybody who’s not stuck in apple land like me had a much better device to buy (specs at least) Rowan09 Samsung was always about inflated specs, so this is no different. 4K on a phone like Sony did a while back is overkill. Snailpo Why would you settle for less? Docservlet Graphics performance and the fact that you can’t see the difference jOn Garrett Of course you can see the difference and Samsung has VR headsets so why would you say something so stupid? Docservlet Of course you can’t see the difference. The pupils cannot distinguish pixels you moron. jOn Garrett Your grand ma is a moron. And of you’re using a VR headset (which you can’t anyway as an iPhone user) you can clearly see pixels on a 2k display. And I did VR several times, I said nothing about normal use. Docservlet You’re a moron and so is your mom. LOL! Under normal viewing there is no pixelation. I’ll leave the VR gimmicks to you children. My Galaxy Prime What iOS users considered gimmicks before Apple did it… Large screens Widgets Curved screens Water resistance Wireless charging (they own patents) Dual speakers Dual cameras I know for sure I’m missing a lot. Help me out people. What else was a gimmick until Apple did it? Docservlet What iOS users still consider gimmicks: Widgets Curved screens Water resistance Wireless charging (they own patents) Dual speakers I don’t remember anyone considering large screens or dual cameras a gimmick. Those were obviously great features and what is your point? The fact that Samsung released high res screens with crap graphics performance is somehow great? How bout the LG dual camera phone that took horrible photos? Or my crappy S7 Edge with curved screen that’s ridiculous to type on because it has stupid curved screens. Use some logic. My Galaxy Prime You all thought they were gimmicks and we’re so outspoken but now that the iPhone has it, you guys are quiet. I remember when you got 3rd party keyboards. Lol that was the greatest thing to happen to the iPhone but who the hell wants to customize their device right? Customization. Beyond changing your wallpaper is a gimmick. No one considered large screens gimmicks when every iPhone user laughed at Samsung? But then you get it and the iPhone 6 is the best selling iPhone. You can’t type on an S7? What’s wrong with your tiny hands? Do your palms really touch the edges when you type? Buy a case, problem solved. Use 1 handed mode, problem solved. Use 2 hands to type, problem solved. Sell the S7 edge and buy the S7 to suit your Trump like infant fingers, problem solved. Docservlet The iPhone has waterproofing. Still a gimmick. I still don’t use widgets. The curved screen on my S7 is PURE GARBAGE. Wireless charging is something I don’t miss at all from my Palm Pre. The S7 Edge has curved screens. That makes touch accuracy nearly impossible and random edge inputs a reality. What’s wrong with your tiny little brain? Is it broken? Or has it turned to mush from all the abuse? One handed mode doesn’t solve the right edge or left edge problem. Sell your brain and trade it in for something newer. Maybe that will solve the issues you’re having with your infantile mind. 3rd party keyboards are a hilarious example of where fandroids fail. While 3rd party keyboards from China were lapping up your usernames and passwords, iPhone was secure. While Android has the security of an open door, security companies are trying to figure out how to break iPhone encryption. Something Android hasn’t even figure out yet. Your comments are so myopic and imbecilic. My Galaxy Prime Lol so because you don’t use them, no one else does? I see, only technology is made for YOU and if you don’t like something, it means no one else does either. Who cares if companies are pouring millions into VR, you can’t use it so it’s dumb technology right? You don’t miss wireless charging so no one else , including Apple, should care about it? Lol and Swype, that China grown 3rd party keyboard is stealing all of our info. We should alert…Oh, none of this is true? I guess creating a fake reality makes you sound dumb…In reality. Lol iPhone is secure right? I have a text I want to send you. Lol or maybe we can contact the FBI and ask them who cracked through the iPhone’s impenetrable encryption. Docservlet LOL!!! You’re such an idiot. So because you consider these gimmicks as feats of technology because you’re a moron then everyone else should??? LOLOLOL!!! Who cares that companies are releasing junk after junk after junk into the market hoping that these gimmicks stick as opposed to useful products. Who cares that wireless charging was on my Palm Pre and didn’t save Palm? Logic is obviously not your friend. Who cares that for the better part of a decade, everyone was using smartphones and tablets that were absolute junk. Who cares that Android is the most insecure mobile OS on the planet with the highest number of vulnerabilities and user damages. Oh but you have wireless charging and VR? LOLOLOLOLOL! How idiotic are fandroids these days? Incredibly idiotic. Android has not Continuity, Hand Off, iWork, FaceTime, 3D Touch etc etc etc etc etc etc. Android is pure junk. Android is laggy, fragmented software. The Android ecosystem is non existent and fandroids will never understand because of their idiocy and bias. My Galaxy Prime I dont consider them feats of technology, your iPhone buddies do. When they were finally able to do these things, they stopped calling them gimmicks and embraced them. And are you assuming that wireless charging is supposed to save technology? You think wireless charging was a means to save…I can’t argue with you. You think like a wall and I feel dumber for having to explain common knowledge to you. You think you k ow tech but you I my know what an iPhone can do. You don’t even know what Apple is working on so what really do you know? I’m having a back and forth with someone who finds it too difficult to do a google search. Do this, when you think of a comeback, Google it first to see if there’s evidence to back up what you’re saying. Don’t see the evidence, don’t say it. This gives your argument credibility rather than saying something like WhatsApp is only minor even though it has over a billion monthly active users. Android is laggy? Really? Still? Android is an open ecosystem dummy. Android works with many services and…Can I have a discussion with someone who actually knows what’s happening in tech? I feel like I’m spending the majority of my time explaining to this idiot what they can read for themselves in years worth of articles. Please, anyone, can I have an actual conversation with someone who knows the subject? Docservlet Only fandroids consider these gimmicks useful. Just like they thought that hand waving and face unlock were useful. Why? Because fandroids can’t see 2 feet in front of them. When a fandroid is so steeped in their own ignorance that reality is just an inconvenience, it’s convenient just to let them run on their own hamster wheel. While technologies like A10 fusion and NVMe storage blow performance metrics for mobile devices out of the water, you and your buddies hang on to wireless charging and waterproofing! LMFAO!!!! That is just about the most pathetic thing I’ve ever seen. So when I say FaceTime, iMessage, Continuity, Hand Off, iWork etc…I would expect morons like you to actually know what they are. Spend a little time educating yourself rather than saying things like WhatsApp and FaceTime. LOL!!!! Pathetic. That just makes your responses appear even more idiotic. If you’re looking for conversation, maybe you should head over to android police and you whackos can keep telling yourselves that wireless charging and waterproofing are amazing “features”. LMFAO!! Idiots. My Galaxy Prime I can’t believe I need to say this again, Apple is working on wireless charging and they made their iPhone water resistant. APPARENTLY, APPLE CARES ABOUT THESE FEATURES. And without water resistance, I couldn’t respond to you while in the shower, like I am now. This lets me respond to your dumb ass comments without having to wait. “Spend a little time educating yourself rather than saying things like WhatsApp and FaceTime. LOL!!!! Pathetic.” What does this even mean? And I own a Mac. I know what continuity, FaceTime, iMessage, Hand Off and iWork all are. This is also how I know that you can get a similar or better experience on Android. You, however, do not know this. You, unfortunately, don’t know alot. Lol A10 fusion. A chip that runs on an underpowered device is a better selling point over a larger screen, smaller bezels, better low light photography, lol the ability to charge your device while listening to music, and so on? Docservlet So what if Apple made their phones wireless. You mean they added some gaskets to the phone? WHO CARES? You do. You think on the scale of technological advances that Apple has provided that waterproof is high on the list? It wasn’t even a factor for the Google Pixel. That is such an ignorant statement considering the massive gains in chip and storage technology that NO ONE has even come close to. Forget the fact that Apple was first with 64bit while the rest of the industry didn’t even have a road map or comprehensive payment solutions like Apple Pay that Google lifted for Android Pay. Or how bout the telephoto lens that none of the android handsets have and are forced to take grainy software zoom. I’ve owned android since 2009. At least a dozen android handset in that time. They are old, tired pieces of junk. While you talk about idiotic things like bezels and waterproofing, the Apple ecosystem has literally crushed Android/MS to a mockery. The ubiquity of access to telephony and messaging across devices isn’t even a possibility with Android. While you morons drone on about face unlock and hand waving, Apple has managed to provide A10 fusion chips, the Apple Pencil, and the fastest production storage speeds on any smartphone or laptop. Your understanding of technology is so basic and limited that it’s amazing you can put sentences together. You’re simply sounding off fandroid talking points like the rest of your insecure herd. Rowan09 It nice to have opinions not by losing battery life. Why does anyone need a 4K screen on a phone? Remember eye scroll we could do without what happened to it? Having too many choices by default is just as bad as not as much choices. Rowan09 How can a large screen be a gimmick? The main reason Android went to bigger screens is why? Let’s see if you even know the reason. Water resistance is a gimmick how? The S7 Edge while a better looking phone than the S7 doesn’t make it any more useful with the curved screen. Widgets are helpful and I’ve never called them a gimmick because it’s a shortcut. Why would anyone say dual speakers is a gimmick when it amplifies sound? Dual cameras is still a gimmick even on the iPhone 7 Plus which I also own. Snailpo Grab a Samsung and compare it to an iPhone. You can’t tell me you don’t see a difference in screen quality. Graphics performance? If we are talking GPU processing to processing you won’t notice a difference between the 2. Docservlet I own an S7 Edge. Worst purchase I ever made. I do see a difference in the screen. There is a noted yellowish tint in the S7’s display. Colors are more vibrant in the AMOLED displays. iPhone display shows the correct color of white. CAN I SEE PIXELS IN EITHER PHONE? NO! That’s what you don’t get. You can have a 10k display but at what point does it make a difference when your eyes stopped seeing the difference 1080p ago. Snailpo I guess your eyes are not very good because it you look you can easily see the Pixel difference. I have an s7 edge, and an iPhone 7 plus. Just looking at the two you can tell the Samsung has a much clearer screen. Docservlet “clearer screen”. You eyes and your brain are obviously not that good. The human eye cannot distinguish the pixels. The human eye can however distinguish between colors and white and black levels and gradation. I have both phones and see the yellowing features of the AMOLED on the S7 Edge. Snailpo Maybe your eyes can’t, but everyone I have ever known can easily see the difference. Docservlet It’s obvious that you’re attempting to defy human biological limits. LOL….ok supergirl! Snailpo Did you just assume my gender ? Docservlet Yes Snailpo Wow what a bigot ! Docservlet Do you know what a bigot is? Obviously not! LOLOLOL!!! Snailpo Like 95% of democrats in this world… #LiberalsUnite Docservlet Your delusional. There’s no place for your silly politics wether it’s liberal or conservative. I don’t care about delusional ponderings. Ideas are vacuous and meaningless. jOn Garrett He says that knowing damn well he doesn’t own a Galaxy. Docservlet LOL!!! You clueless trolls think people can’t own both devices. Snailpo What point does it make having a super fast SSD on your phone? It’s just a phone. But you still got one don’t ya? What’s the point in having a car ? You could just walk, but you got one huh? jOn Garrett They know, they just hate to admit when the iPhone comes up short. Docservlet LOL….it’s useless. While the iPhone offers useful features like A10 Fusion, NVMe storage, iWork, iCloud, Continuity, Hand Off etc etc you fandroids are busy wearing your phones on your heads. LOLOLOL!!! Stupid. My Galaxy Prime Lol when your chip and the storage type are your best features, you have run out of ideas. Docservlet LOL…when a fandroid thinks that hardware and software performance are not important, you know they’ve failed…at life. My Galaxy Prime Of course I think it’s important. But you get great hardware and software on the majority of Android devices out. Even on low budget devices. How’s that low light photography compared to what’s on the market? That’s a selling point. Can you do manual mode on an iPhone? No? Well I guess that camera software sucks too. Apparently, Apple doesn’t think these 2 are important but at least you have that A10 chip. That thing no one is going to stores asking for it specifically. Wait, didn’t Apple just call for a cut in production? Didn’t they sell fewer devices this holiday season vs the past? I guess the A10 chip isn’t a feature many people care about after all Docservlet On high end android devices you get sub par performance and cheap components. No NVMe storage and chipsets that are considerably weaker than the A series Apple chips. There are many APIs that Apple allows into the camera and many apps that utilize it. How’s that oversaturated photo you just took? Oversaturated? Well I guess the cameras suck on Android devices as well. How’s that software update you’ll never get? Nougat is out and most Android devices won’t see it for years if at all. Wait, didn’t Apple just break a record for the December quarter and muster more activations than anyone else? Didn’t their marketshare increase globally? Wasn’t it Apple who managed to capture %104 of mobile profits? keep digging….lol My Galaxy Prime How’s my over saturated picture look? Better than anything you can do on the iPhone especially because I can manually adjust what I want. As a matter of fact, most devices produce better photos than the iPhone. Nougat is coming in January, Samsung just finished their beta testing, Apple got more activations but fewer than last year while everyone’s rose. Damn, even with the Note 7 recall, Samsung was still able to increase activations while the iPhone saw a decrease. And Apple saw their own profits. Just because a company doesn’t make a profit it doesn’t mean another company takes it. Also, isn’t Apple’s profits falling from last year? Hell, from last quarter? Everyone else is selling more devices while Apple sells fewer. Didn’t Android gain more market share this year’s while Apple continued to lose? Docservlet iPhone manual controls were introduced in iOS 8. With the introduction of RAW photos, Apple has opened APIs to even more controls. That’s literally how far behind you are. As a matter of fact, the iPhone still achieves some of the highest rated photos of any device. Nougat is coming in January??? LOLOLOL! Golf clap. While you fandroids have fragmentation up the wazoo, iPhone has achieved an incredible 63% adoption of iOS 10. How does that compare to the 1% of android nougat adoption. Hasn’t Samsung’s profit been on a steady decline since 2013? As others android OEMs are pushing out cheaper and junkier phones, Samsung is unable to compete because there’s no differentiation in android. It’s a race to the bottom and the ASPs keep getting lower. All android OEMs are struggling and companies like Le Eco are packing it up and going bankrupt. Meanwhile, Apple keeps earning more and more from record launches like the iPhone 7 and laptops and services and blockbuster product releases like AirPods. All the while Samsung is playing catch up. LOL My Galaxy Prime The iPhone camera has manual control? Yup, you’re dumber than a wall. Good-bye Docservlet LOL!!!! The fact that you don’t know this speaks volumes for your ignorance. Get lost before you embarrass yourself even more. My Galaxy Prime lol manual exposure, self timer, and time lapse are the manual modes you’re referring to? Speak to me when you can manually adjust focus, white balance, the ISO, and shutter speed. lol the iphone camera doesn’t have manual mode. it’s auto mode with the ability to change the exposure. Might I add, Android devices, including my S7, all come with manual exposure, a self timer, and time lapse. The fact that you don’t know what manual mode continues to reinforce how little you actually know not only about Android devices but the device you carry around with you as well. You can’t do this with your iPhone’s camera app www digitaltrends com/mobile/how-to-use-pro-mode-samsung-galaxy-s7/2/ Docservlet LOL! Are you seriously that clueless? Speak to me when you find your brain. the Focus app takes full advantage of manual features such as shutter speed, white balance and ISO and where it really shines is in its manual focus control. Manual app is super simple to use and lets you adjust shutter, ISO, white balance, focus, and exposure compensation. In a single tap you can also view aperture settings, making Manual a straight-forward and user friendly photography tool. ProCam 2 combines great tools with a great layout. Controls include manual focus, exposure compensation, shutter speed, ISO, and white balance. The fact that you’re a complete clueless idiot reinforces my perception of your stupidity. The fact that you are so clueless that you stand on something that has been available for some time speaks to your considerable mental challenges. My Galaxy Prime So you need to download multiple apps to do what the S7 can do out of the box? Your iPhone is so cool. Docservlet Oh no!!! You mean I need to download multiple apps to get something like iMessage and FaceTime? How bout the fact that you were completely wrong about manual controls? LOLOLOLOL. You clueless trolls. My Galaxy Prime I can text message and video chat out of the box too. Lol they’re baked in features. ROTF really? Just because they’re called iMessage and FaceTime doesn’t make them revolutionary. It’s texting and video chatting. Lol no need to download anything. I can already do it. Docservlet Text message? Is that the same as iMessage? LOLOLOLOL!!! LMFAO! Are you that delusional as to what iMessage is? FaceTime is the same as video chat? Holy smokes. You fandroids sure know how to stretch. Not to mention Continuity, Hand Off, iWork etc etc is baked in. There is no Continuity or Hand Off equivalent in Android. You have to download the junk Google Docs from the Play Store. LOL! Your monkey-like tap dancing is becoming hilarious. My Galaxy Prime So to use iMessage, you don’t communicate with others through their phone number? Isn’t that exactly how text messaging works? And Facetime is video chatting. What do you do on facetime? Chat over video. really? I can download airdroid and get my messages on my Mac, I can be on a website on my device and continue where I left off with Chrome, and Google Docs actually comes pre-installed. I never said any of these were baked in. I said we have alternatives that offer the same or better experiences. The manual controls I said were baked in. You keep mentioning these services…like ALOT. Almost like these are the only things the iPhone can do. Is there anything else special beyond Continuity, Hand off, and iWork? lol who even mentions iWork when speaking about Docs and Office? lol iWork is so great that Apple bundled it into MacOS Sierra. Nope, they didn’t. How great is iWork when Apple doesn’t even bother to bundle it into their newest OS? Docservlet So to get messages on your Mac you have to download airdroid? And then you have to download Chrome? Interestingly Google Docs was not preinstalled on my S7. What is it you do with iMessage? Send full resolution photos, videos, documents, and practically every other attachment that fails to send with regular text messages. Not to mention iMessage apps that further enhance those capabilities. What do you do on video chat? You mean like downloading a separate app and hoping they have a social media account.If they value their privacy, that’s a non starter. Not to mention the complete seamless transition on iPhones between voice and video calls. Airdroid is a joke. How do I get my text messages on my tablet? How do I get my text messages on my other iPhones or Macs? I don’t. How do I answer a call from my Mac, iPad or Apple Watch? I don’t. You simply don’t even have the basic knowledge of what continuity and hand off really are. iWork was included on my iPhone, iPad, and new TouchBar MacBook Pro. Yes they did. Have you seen all the bad reviews for Google Docs? It’s miserable outdated and ugly interface. It consistently rates bottom in capabilities in professional reviews. Google users don’t like the software and professionals pan it as garbage. You keep exposing your ignorance with every post. My Galaxy Prime As an Android user, to get messages on a device that doesn’t support anything outside of the Apple ecosystem, do I need to download an app? Of course. What type of dumb question is that? Its one thing when your device needs developers to create an experience others get out of the box. it’s another when you need developers to create a connection with another device because a company refuses it. Video chat is built in. See that green thing that looks like a camera? If you actually had an S7, you would know. How do I answer a phone call on my Mac using a device Apple refuses to connect with? I don’t. I use my phone. How do I answer a call on my Gear S3? Well, I can either use the 3G service that’s built in or connect it through bluetooth. Dude, I’ve told you that I know what hand off and continuity are. Are these the only things you know that the iPhone can do? iWork is split into 3 apps, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote. I just looked at the reviews for Docs, Slides and Sheets and they all have more positive reviews than negative. Where did you get your info from? You get your news from the same source as Trump. I found this little article when comparing iWork to Docs. The title of the article says it all. www digitaltrends com/computing/apple-iwork-collaboration/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4c996e05b3c5b12d8c771f8d84c8a8de7f8918382adfa483ab2e59b9ec1d3b9a.jpg Docservlet LOL! So I need to download software that Apple provides out of the box to experience iMessage and Continuity and Hand Off etc etc etc. And Google Docs isn’t included on my device so I have to download that too???? And I have to download AirDroid??? LOLOL! It wasn’t an actual question imbecile. I was mocking you. See that green light that indicates video. It’s a carrier enabled feature and it’s device dependent. FaceTime was introduced in 2010 and has been ubiquitous on all iPhones since then. How bout the fact that you can’t answer calls on your tablet or Laptop? LOLOLOL!!! Keep dancing. Dude, it’s obvious you don’t understand what hand off and continuity are. You’re so vacuous in your rambling and tap dancing that your actually forgetting what you’re writing. LOL!!! Not to mention the fact that ratings and reviews for iWork have consistently outranked Google Docs. It’s amazing the level of ignorance you display. My Galaxy Prime 88 1 star ratings for pages? ouch! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/450315ff2f89447afa45386679e1a7bcd31bfba510b382cc37bab1e341ff87d9.png Docservlet 32,000 one star ratings for Google Docs. Ouch. My Galaxy Prime You can 100% see the difference Docservlet LOL…only in your dreams. My Galaxy Prime You are aware that it is very possible to take an iPhone and a Galaxy device, put on the same YouTube video and compare the content right? My brother has an iPhone 6s. I have, in front of him, compared the screens. Now, since his device has a max resolution of 750p, the resolution on YouTube could only go up to 720p. However, for the S7, the resolution can get bumped to 2K. So do I see a clear difference between 720 and 2K? Yes. And is that really your educated and well thought-out argument for there not being a difference in screen quality between the 2 devices? Docservlet You know I own a Samsung S7 right? Now, since the human eye CANNOT distinguish pixels on my iPhone 7 Plus and S7 Edge mobile displays at those resolution it’s another predictable case of fandroidism. On my S7, there are no more or fewer pixels on the screen. There is a distinct yellow tint to the S7. There are more vibrant colors on the S7. The iPhone has brighter whites. As far as educated response, I already know the kind of insecure fandroid I’m dealing with. My Galaxy Prime I’m not insecure. I’m telling you that you’re wrong. Even at 1080p, there is a difference. You don’t need to see individual pixels to notice it. How, oh how, is this common knowledge online and you still can wrap you’re head around it. It is well known that Galaxy devices have better screens and pictures than their iPhone counterparts. Seriously, when was the last time you ever head someone, besides you, say that the iPhone has a better screen than a Galaxy device. Hell, if the iPhone’s screens were so great, they wouldn’t be buying panels from Samsung. Lol they wouldn’t be switching from LCD to OLED. If Apple’s screens are so great, why then switch to “inferior” hardware? And that’s cool to own an S7. I own a Mac. That doesn’t make you any less wrong. Docservlet LOL!!! It’s common knowledge that YOU CANNOT SEE PIXELS. You can see differences in display type and quality. How are you attempting to defy the laws of human biology. It is not well know that Galaxy users have better screens. The head of DisplayMate himself said there are benefits to both AMOLED and LCD and ranked them as nearly equal. AMOLED is newer but also has many many drawbacks. So you mean, if iPhone switches to newer display technology that buying them from Samsung is somehow a massive change? Ridiculous and childish statement. iPhone 7 achieved the highest color accuracy, peak brightness, and contrast rating in bright light of any smartphone display, the highest contrast ratio of any IPS LCD display, and the lowest screen reflectance of any smartphone display. So given that it achieves such exceptional displays performance your point is moot. NO ONE SAID that AMOLED is inferior. Apple doesn’t make screens. It buys them from Sharp and LG. Now it’s SPECULATED that it may be buying AMOLED. If they’ve sorted out burn in, graphics performance issues, yellowish tinting, and dead pixels, then hopefully the transition will not be so painful. As it stands, OLED is not that great a technology. Rowan09 Why not 8K? A small screen won’t benefit from such high resolution and Sony found that out the hard way. It’s just not worth the battery life for marginal differences. jOn Garrett VR Docservlet Gimmick jOn Garrett First off, Samsung has no 4k phone. Second Samsung has VR headsets–try using one on your sh’!ty 720p LED display then try again on 2k or 4k AMOLED then come back here and tell us again about overkill. Docservlet VR is nonsense. Who wants to put a ridiculous piece of junk over their eyes? For what????? If I want VR, I’ll get it on my Playtstion and not on my phone. Snailpo I do.. my and my family absolutely love the VR experience. It is a cheap way to have a great time! Just because your iPhone doesn’t have it doesn’t mean it’s useless or pointless… apple doesn’t even give you the option. You don’t HAVE to use it on Samsung, but you can if you want to. Docservlet I don’t. I’m not going to sit there with some ridiculous headset bandaged to my head and pretend to be doing something. No one cares about it because no one uses it. It’s a gimmick just like all the hand waving and face unlocking nonsense. My Galaxy Prime I use my vr headset to play games, watch movies, visit interactive places around and outside of the globe. Had you actually used one, you would see a benefit. Hell, play EVE GunJack, Temple run, smash hit, or End Space and it’ll make you rethink the way you play games. VR is not a gimmick. This is why companies are investing billions in the platform. You’re arguing without a platform to stand on. How can you honestly say something isn’t good when you haven’t even given it a chance? Because other people said so? You can’t think for yourself and come up with your own conclusion? Docservlet This is the same ridiculous and idiotic argument you fandroids make for features like wireless charging. No one is breaking down the door to get wireless charging. No one is going to buy the ridiculous VR garbage and stick their phone on their face. Or maybe some fandroids will. Features like Continuity, Hand Off, iMessage, FaceTime, iWork, etc etc all make android features like VR look lame and pathetic. My Galaxy Prime Doesn’t Apple’s new earpods and watch both charge wirelessly? Apple just had a patent approved for wireless charging. This was like, a month ago. Lol Apple is breaking down doors to get wireless charging. Have you seen the number of patients they have on wireless charging alone? They have patents dating back years. How do you not even know what Apple is working on but still feel like you know everything? The Gear VR was just ranked 3 on Amazon’s best selling wearables so people are actually buying these ridiculous garbage headsets. But yes, only Android users can buy VR headsets because Apple doesn’t offer anything in this space. And every iOS feature you mentioned are available in some fashion for Android. iWork, iMessage, and FaceTime…Google Docs/ MS office, WhatsApp/ Facebook Messenger, Skype. So we get everything that Apple has plus VR? That seems like a better option. Docservlet Of course they both charge wirelessly and who cares? I had wireless charging in 2009 on my palm Pre. It didn’t make the phone any faster or make HP suck any less. Apple is not breaking anything down. If you had a couple of brain cells, you’d know that induction charging is THE least technical technology. It’s literally 50 cents worth of induction magnets. The Gear VR….you mean literally a set of goggles you strap to your head like some kid? What happens when I get a phone call or text? LOLOLOL! But yes…only android users are childish enough to use VR headsets. Android has no equivalent to iMessage, iWork, FaceTime nor Continuity or Hand Off. You actually don’t get it which isn’t surprising. My Galaxy Prime Did your Palm come with fast wireless charging? No? OK. My S7 does so it actually does make my device faster…Well, charge faster. Wireless charging on my S7 is still faster than wired charging on an iPhone even though the iPhone has a smaller battery. And spending millions on R&D so Apple can most likely create a wireless charging alternative that only works with the iPhone (because Apple) seems like breaking down doors. I mean, when have you personally spent millions on something you didn’t care about? When have you hired experts and professionals for no reason? Wireless charging is important to many but you’ll agree once Apple has a charging pad for you to buy. And yes, a VR headset is something you strap to your head. Sort of like glasses but I can only imagine how stupid you think glasses are. And when you get a text or a call, a notification appears on the screen. Lol your experience doesn’t just shut down. Dude, you seriously haven’t used it but feel the need to comment like an expert? Had you even used the headset, you would have the answer to that question. Don’t waste my time with this nonsense. Why am I sitting here having a discussion with someone who literally has no idea what they’re saying. You don’t know that Apple is investing in Wireless technology. You don’t know that more companies are investing in VR and that the Gear VR sold very well this holiday season. You don’t know that Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Allo, Skype, Duo, Office, Google Docs, AirDroid, and Chrome are all alternatives to the apps you just mentioned. Lol you think no one on Android is texting because we don’t have iMessage? Really? iMessage borrowed so many of their new features from Allo, WhatsApp, and WeChat. Lol what, you didn’t know that either? Docservlet Did my Palm come with wireless charging? Yes. Does my S7 come with wireless charging? Yes. Oh cool….now it charges faster???? BFD!!!! Wireless charging with a 2 amp charger on the S7 is roughly 20 minutes faster than the iPhone with a 2 amp charger. Apple can spend 50 cents on a couple of contacts for the back of the iPhone 7 and a two dollars for a base and call it a day. This is not revolutionary technology. Wireless charging is GARBAGE tech. Wireless charging is important only to fandroids because it’s the only leg they have to stand on. Apple has thousands of engineers. LOL….you still don’t get it. None of those is like Continuity, Hand Off, iMessage, FaceTime, iWork etc. Allo isn’t used by anyone. WhatsApp is a minor alternative but what about regular texting? Which 99% of the world seems to do? You actually have no idea what you’re talking about do you. You’re so behind on the actual technology that you’re just offering Apps. My Galaxy Prime Did your Palm come with FAST wireless charging. You missed the word fast which makes your 1st 4 sentences stupid. Why do you keep saying wireless charging is only important to us when Apple is also spending millions on wireless charging? That’s stupid. You’re ignoring fact to support your dumbass claim. And sure, Apple CAN spend the money but they haven’t. Instead, they’re taking that 50 cents and churning out new patents for wireless charging lol. WhatsApp is a minor alternative? Most of the world uses WhatsApp. And WhatsApp is a TEXT APP. If you have a phone number, you can use it. Do you not know how WhatApp works? I’m done. Rowan09 What’s features did iMessage borrow from Allo? iMessage is way better than anything Google has or tried they were and are all failures. They tried but to force me to use boy I forgot the name to respond on YouTube because they purposely make YouTube messaging system horrible. Continuity is an Apple thing. I could go down a list of things Apple does better and things Google does better, but overall Apple is better in my opinion. Everyone brags about Android being open source when ever since they first made Android they have more closed source apps than Apple. The OS is still open but if you are going to use Google services your stuck to strict Google rules which is no different than Apple really. Both OSes are great but can you tell me why can’t S7 Edge see a tracking number as a tracking number? On my iPhone I click on a tracking and it brings me to the respective page, on Android nothing I have to copy and paste. Simple things like this in my opinion makes IOS better than Android. I love Android as well though because I make a killing off Fire Sticks/Fire TVs. My Galaxy Prime Google that question. Rowan09 Nope I’ll use Bing. Rowan09 They make VR headers for every platform man. Wireless charging on the S7 Edge which I also own is a gimmick. Why do I need to put my phone on a pad and when it rings I have to pick it up? Apple is suppose to be working on true wireless meaning no pad and that would be great. The Apple Watch and Airpods needs wireless charging because they are small devices. My wife has a Gear watch and she has to try her best to just plug in the charger. Watches and small devices benefit from wireless pads not cellphones. Plus every phone has cases for wireless charging as well. jOn Garrett Gunjack is amazing. Imagine what VR games will look like in a few short years from now. My Galaxy Prime I can’t wait to play Call of Duty in VR Rowan09 Come on man VR is obsolutely a gimmick on the Samsung VR because the quality is garbage. I use the a PlayStation VR and that’s a great experience. I didn’t try the Vive or Oculus which is the best. I own the VR headset and it sucks I don’t even use it anymore. I’m watching Netflix in 480P on that thing. Snailpo Ridiculous gimmick? I’m sorry that you have no benefit or enjoyment for it. You don’t have to use it. That is the joy in Samsung, it’s there if you want to and a lot of people want to! Docservlet LOL…you have no benefit for faster processors, faster storage, better ecosystem, continuity, hand off etc etc etc. Samsung is a joke. Rowan09 Umm you can use VR headset for any device including the iPhone, they come a dime a dozen. Right now VR is just a hype it’s not ready and the Samsung VR is the worst. I would know since I’ve had it with a S7 Edge since day 1. Snailpo I have had the Samsung since day one as well. As well as an iPhone 7 since day one. The Vr experience combined with oculus is the best experience I’ve had. I can stream my PC games to it and use a controller and it works flawlessly. Rowan09 What VR experience on the Samsung VR or the Oculus Rift? Snailpo On the Samsung VR you can stream any PC video game to it, it’s a blast! Not quite as good as an actual oculus rift, but it’s damn close for only 100 bucks lol Rowan09 Come on man it’s not close. The viewing quality is what kills the experience for me and the headset is not comfortable. Did you use the Oculus Rift (I didn’t)? I used the Playstation VR and it was great and comfortable and had a chance to try the Vive but didn’t try it. VR is not the future AR is the future. I would like the try the new Google VR to see if it’s any better viewing wise than the Samsung VR. There are many other VR headsets that does the same as Samsung VR for a fraction of the price. george Until Apple makes one and then you call it revolutionary. Pathetic. Docservlet Idiotic. Until your phone gets features like continuity, Hand off, iWork, iCloud, etc etc etc, your phone is garbage. Fandroids are Pathetic insecure idiots. Snailpo You say that all these points that Samsung has other better things than apple are “pointless” it may be pointless to you and you may not need it, but at least I still have it and I can still do it. Whether my screen resolution is triple iPhone or not, I still have a display that is drop dead stunning, or if I have a VR experience, whether I use it or not I still at least have the option of being able to use it. That is the difference between Apple an android Docservlet I have Continuity, Hand Off, dual Camera, Touch ID, 3D Touch, the FASTEST Smartphone Storage on the planet, the A10 fusion chip which obliterates other mobile processors and allows for faster video editing and load times, optical zoom etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc. I’m sure you clueless fandroids will consider it useless but Apple offers them. Whether Samsung’s phone offers a display that is pretty much on par with Apple’s is fine. The fact that you have pointless VR experiences is pointless. Whether or not you use those gimmicks while losing everything else is a hilarious comparison. Snailpo Funny you say all the things that android has as well. Also it’s funny that you say half of the stuff that android has is useless, but half the stuff you just named off is in that same category… but at least you can say you have it. Can’t call me an android fan boy if I use both play forms religiously. I just think Apple holds back way more than they really should. I want stuff in my phone that I don’t necessarily need, because even if I use it once and think it was cool I still had the choice to use it Docservlet Funny, I say all the things Android DOESN’T have. Rowan09 Let me guess when Apple made Touch ID wasn’t it revolutionary? When Apple finally releases something it’s usually a big deal and works different usually better than anything else on the market. Apple is rarely ever first, besides the gimmick of 64Bit processor according to android fans. george I’m talking about VR which he said is stupid. Rowan09 The Samsung VR is garbage. Sony VR is great, Vive I heard was better and Oculus the best. george He’s not talking about quality he’s talking about putting something on your face and looking stupid. So when Apple releases the same thing I hope he says the same. Rowan09 I have the VR and S7 Edge and it is garbage. If Samsung is making a 4K phone just for VR boy oh boy that’s a bad idea. Samsung VR is by far the worst out of all the others. I know Samsung never made a 4K phone Sony did. But according to your point since VR is so important to Samsung why not make a 8K phone that would be better than 4K and sharper. John I swear VR is only good for one thing. Porn. And the only type of person that needs VR porn are losers that sit infrint if their PC all day jerking off. Waste of time. Clearly Samsung are aiming at their target audience. Lol Rowan09 I own the 7 Plus which is 1080P and I used my S7 Edge with the VR and it’s horrible. It never focuses perfectly (I have 20/20) and watching videos is far from HD. Stuart Lombard They couldn’t possibly copy the airpods because Samsung came to market with wireless earbuds before Apple. If you’re going to accuse anyone of stealing ideas, then it would have to be Apple! Rowan09 I’m assuming they are speaking of the style not just simply making wireless earphones. It’s hard to tell from the article so even if it’s like the airpods I don’t blame Samsung because it seems to be a popular device. jOn Garrett Assumptions, rumored, not even built gadget = BS you post to get page views. Docservlet Samsung is going to follow their business model of copying Apple. BS = your idiotic denial. Natalie More like Shitsung are updating there V1 wireless earbuds to match the market now. Apple released theirs a lot later so they can’t be copying. george How are they copying Apple when they already have a product line? Stupid AF article. John After they mocked apple for removing the head phone jack and making room for wireless earpods. They then do the same. Late to the party as usual. jOn Garrett How so why they had their wireless pods in stores before Apple’s was even announced? Apple is late to the missing headphone jack too since than was done starting in 2014 with the Oppo R5 followed by 4 or 5 other Android phones. Docservlet LOL… those weren’t wireless pods. Those were just stupid BT headsets. Apple is ahead of everyone. The level of technology packed into the AirPods pushed bluetooth headsets forward 5 years. Android phones are horrible and they remove headphone jacks and don’t do anything else….like function properly. MvP77 What’s the different tech in airpods? Curious icon x owner wants to know. Seriously, want to know if it’s worth grabbing them. The only thing I miss about using my icons on the my iPhone is the heart rate and workout monitor during workouts. And the ambiant noise switch. Docservlet -Charging case give me about 3 or 4 days of use before needing to recharge. -Automatic stop/start music when inserted or removed in ear -True HD voice quality during HD voice calls -WIreless range of about 100 feet in clear site -Automatic set up across all devices. Can easily switch between iPhone, Mac, Apple TV, Apple Watch. I think that covers a few. MvP77 Thanks, my icon x charging case is about the same, tho I only use them about 45mins a day for workouts. The auto start / stop seems interesting. I don’t really care about call quality. Can you turn up the volume and change tracks with them? Docservlet Only way to change volume is with phone or through Siri. I’ve not found that to be a problem since I never used it on my old bt headsets. The small controls more often resulted in hanging up calls than changing volume. MvP77 Cool, not a deal breaker. Icon X uses gestures to change volume and tracks but it takes some getting use to. I might check out the airpods or bragi dash. Docservlet Cool…ultimately fit is key. Good luck AMB_07 I do have to admit that Apple generally gets it right but they rarely get it first and to start accusing Samsung of copying them is nothing more than pure blind fanboyism. Did Samsung copy in the past? Sure, so did Apple! jOn Garrett The problem is that people enjoy accusing Samsung while Apple mostly gets a free pass. Samsung gets accused of copying Apple when Apple doesn’t even have a product on the market or when said item is already years old on other devices. Imagine what these Apple site posts would look like if Apple had made an iPhone edge in 2015 and Samsung was the one coming out with a Galaxy edge (with glass body, AMOLED display, wireless charging, dust and water resistance) AMB_07 I find some of the writers (particularly Christian here) a bit hypocritical sometimes. I remember back in the days when Samsung popularized phablets and how he and others here were bashing them for creating big phones and they kept bringing back Steve Jobs’ quote about ”if you see a stylus, they blew it”. Yet when Apple made not only a bigger iPhone (which nobody thought was a bad idea) but also a phablet version suddenly it all made sense and this is Apple reacting in a smart way to how the market is shifting. Which isn’t false but still hypocritical. Also, Apple pen. The fact is that both Samsung and Apple will take ideas from each others in order to be one step ahead of the other and Apple has copied tons from Android and vice-versa (although I feel Android copied a little less). John You miss the point. Samsung mock and then copy. They are ultimatly a parasitic company that piggy backs on everyone elses success whilst claiming they innovate. jOn Garrett Mock and copy? Didn’t Jobs say no one wants a hummer sized phone? Didn’t he also say that 7″ tablets were too small to be useful? Didn’t Jobs and Cook mock the S pen? Yet here we are with Apple selling an iPhone that’s bigger than the Note, 7″ tablets and an apple pencil. Apple stole Sony’s design for the iPhone 4 Apple stole slide to unlock Apple even stole the iPhone name. So tell me again about a mocking parasite. My Galaxy Prime Samsung 100% released wireless earpods before Apple, yet they’re copying? If they release new earpods it’s because it’s an update to what is alreadt out. People need to stop getting tech news from those who can’t see beyond a bitten fruit. Crim Nino Correct me if I’m wrong but didn’t the mainstream market bash apple for this? I’m shocked how nobody made any comments about samsung confirming getting rid of the 3.5 headphone jack in favor of all wireless head phones something that was bashed during iPhone 7 launch. So when apple does it then it’s bad but when others copy apple doing it then it’s ok??? Apple got bashed for a non removable battery then others followed. Apple is a trend setter. Rowan09 Absolutely. Apple is number 1 in popularity and sales so other companies look and see what they are doing and follow. Crim Nino I remember how the CEO of Samsung bashed Apple for going 64 bit (first mobile phone) then Samsung went 64 bit Rowan09 Oh yes and all the fandroids said it’s useless and now every phone is 64 bit.

In the spring, we'll likely see devices such as the LG G6, HTC 11, and Samsung Galaxy S8, and then autumn will offer a new iPhone, a Galaxy Note8 (!), and more. Indeed, there will be plenty of product refreshes in the coming year, but we'll also see plenty of new devices. Might we see a Surface Phone or a new, more consumer-friendly version of Microsoft's HoloLens? Andy and I got together to discuss what products we're most excited about in 2017. Rich: Before we get going, let’s just make clear that we’re not going through these products in any particular order. Andy: Yes, that’s very important, or we’ll end up getting death threats from some of the readers. Rich: …again. Andy: Again. Rich: So, with that in mind, the first product that I want to mention is the 10th Anniversary iPhone. It's the phone that we've been waiting for for, well, 10 years. Personally, the rumor mill has hyped this thing so much that I just really want to see if Apple can live up to it. Andy: It won’t. Rich: Yeah, it probably won’t, but it’ll be interesting to see what they come up with. This was kind of a lame year for Apple. The iPhone 7 Plus was a great device, but there were minimal design changes from the 6/6s. The new MacBook Pros were underwhelming, and the only new iPad was the 9.7-inch Pro in the spring. Andy: I have to agree that Apple’s not had a great year. The products have been disappointing in many ways: the MacBook Pro with its silly Touch Bar that doesn’t really solve any problems; the lack of any new Mac desktops; Apple’s dubious quality control with all sorts of issues popping up on its new devices; the delay to the AirPods and some of the battery issues with those… oh, and the battery life complaints on the new MacBook Pros too. Almost forgot about that. Rich: How could you forget? *slap* Andy: I’m getting old. But for me, one of the big disappointments was the iPhone 7. Yes, it has a superb camera, and yes, it ticks all the boxes we’ve come to expect of iPhones – but that’s just it; it felt like Apple was just ticking the boxes. So I’m with you on this; next year, I really want to see what Apple can do, not just with the new iPhone, but also with the iPad, which is crying out for some fresh thinking and a ‘proper’ overhaul. And I’m really hoping Apple will do something exciting and new with its Mac desktops. If the new Macs are just the same, but slightly faster, with a keyboard that has a Touch Bar on it… well, I might just lose it. Rich: …again. Andy: Again. Rich: I know what you mean though. 2015 saw a bunch of new products from the company, like the Apple Watch and 12-inch MacBook. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro was launched (and hasn't been refreshed since) and the fourth-generation Apple TV finally opened up a new App Store. I think you're going to be disappointed if you're hoping for anything exciting on the Mac front though. The MacBook Air is all but dead, and the Pro won't be redesigned for quite some time. All I imagine happening is a new Magic Keyboard with a Touch Bar. Andy: Eugh.﻿ Rich: Since Apple is pretty much becoming "the iPhone company", I'm really hoping that it pulls off something cool in the iPhone 7s, or iPhone 8, or whatever it ends up calling it. Andy: They’ve got some high expectations to live up to, that’s for sure. And that goes for Samsung too, after the Galaxy Note7 fiasco. Will we see a Galaxy Note8? I’m doubtful if we’ll see a device with that name, but Samsung has invested so heavily in stylus support that it can’t really abandon that space now. I imagine what we’ll see is a stylus-enabled variant of the Galaxy S8 family, rather than a standalone Note brand. But I’m really excited to see what they come up with. People can make as many jokes as they like about exploding phones, but the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge are both excellent handsets - well, mostly - and I think the S8 family could be awesome. As long as they don’t explode. Rich: I'm sure they won't explode. After all, Samsung pretty much worked out the problem with the replacement devices. Andy: The replacement devices exploded too. Rich: Oh, right. A Galaxy S8 with an S Pen makes a lot of sense though, as the Galaxy S and Note handsets have been nearly identical with the exception of the Pen for a couple of iterations now. Sticking with smartphones, I'm just going to come out and say it; I think that the HTC 10 was one of the best phones released in 2016. Every time I boot it up, I'm reminded about the stunning display quality and the beautiful metal build, and I really love the latest iterations of Sense. Andy: It is a lovely device. HTC has always known how to make good-looking phones. Rich: Definitely. It wasn't completely flawless, though. The camera was pretty good, although images were overexposed when you'd use automatic mode, forcing the user to take some level of control over the camera. Other than some camera improvements, I'm curious as to what HTC will do for design. Its flagship handsets are really overdue for a design overhaul, and it always has some great design chops. The HTC 10 wasn't exactly a hot seller, but I'll be keeping my eye on the company in 2017. Andy: I know of your fondness for HTC; they have a special place in my heart too. I still miss my HTC Blue Angel. Damn, I loved that thing. But HTC is a hot mess right now. They come out fighting with the impressive 10 flagship, but then they announce the Desire 10 Lifestyle in September with a Snapdragon 400 chip – that’s THREE YEARS OLD. Then comes the HTC 10 evo / Bolt, which doesn’t have a Snapdragon 820 or 821; it’s got the 810 from last year. Oh, and let’s not forget the new One A9s, which had weaker specs than its predecessor. Or HTC breaking its promise to upgrade the original One A9 to Nougat within 15 days of its release. Or the never-ending delays to their smartwatch. The only thing they’re doing to impress me at the moment is the Vive virtual reality headset. Everything else just seems to be chaos. Rich: The 810 was a strange choice, considering that HTC was one of the first companies to take the heat for that chip's original issues. Andy: *slap* Wait, I mentioned the Vive VR headset a minute ago... and that reminds me of something else I’m really looking forward to in 2017: the rise of Windows Holographic. Rich: Or the fall. Andy: Well… yes, one can never be sure how these things will turn out. But I think Microsoft is taking a very interesting approach to mixed reality. What was it Alex Kipman said? Something about Microsoft being on a mission to bring mixed reality to everyone and every company on the planet? Rich: Pretty much – and that’s quite a mission; it's right up there with putting Windows 10 on a billion devices within two or three years. Andy: The less said about that the better... But I think they’re starting out in the right way. If you want VR these days, you need a high-end phone and a headset ‘dock’; or you need a high-end headset, and a kick-ass computer. None of this stuff is cheap. But Microsoft is expanding the Windows Holographic platform by bringing the shell, the core VR environment, to existing Windows 10 PCs as a free update, and working with partners to launch much cheaper VR headsets that buyers can use with their PCs... subject to various minimum spec requirements, of course. Rich: I'm a bit skeptical of all of this. Virtual reality still hasn't proven that it has mass appeal, and I wonder what the performance will be like on the cheaper headsets. Andy: Yes, there’s still a lot we don’t know, a lot of unanswered questions, but if they can bring decent VR experiences to a much wider audience at more affordable, more accessible prices, that’s a good thing. And who knows how the VR platform will develop in the future, and what new ideas and business models will emerge from it? Very exciting stuff. Rich: It sort of bothers me that the third-party Windows Holographic focus in 2016 was on VR. We first learned about the OS as the one that powers the HoloLens, and that's what I really want to see more of. The current iteration of the HoloLens shows a lot of potential, although the field of view isn't that great. Assuming that it doesn't change much in a possible consumer model, I'm a lot more excited about the prospect of third-party HoloLens-type devices, and what OEMs might do to differentiate themselves in this market. Andy: I get where you're coming from. When I wrote about using HoloLens at Build in April, I made the point that it's really just a 'first step' in Microsoft's mixed reality vision, and that its current limitations – including the field of view, and its high price tag – don't represent the future that Microsoft is gradually piecing together with developers, manufacturers and other major partners. But it would be nice to get a taste of that future soon, some further hints of what's to come, and to see what other OEMs can do with Windows Holographic as an augmented reality tool... especially as that will eventually lead to lower prices and wider availability. That future can't come soon enough, frankly; I can't wait to see that potential realized. Rich: Lower prices sound nice. $3,000 for a HoloLens Development Edition is just crazy for any average consumer, so hopefully we'll see a consumer edition and some third-party stuff to keep it competitive. Andy: While we're on the topic of mixed reality, Microsoft is going to be making another big VR push on a different front next year. Back in June at E3, it announced Project Scorpio, referring to it as the "most powerful console ever", with support for native 4K gaming, and VR. Microsoft has been making all sorts of improvements to gaming on consoles and Windows 10 PCs – it even seems to be planning a special 'Game Mode' for the OS. If it can continue to develop its Windows 10 and Xbox gaming platform in the way that it has, and if it can bring that together with some truly monstrous console hardware, I think that Scorpio could be spectacular. Rich: I can see that. Stop drooling. Microsoft's renewed focus on gaming is refreshing. There's so much that we don't know about Project Scorpio, and that's part of what makes it so exciting. We don't even know what it will be called. 2016 saw a lot of cool Xbox news, such as the One S, UWP apps, a lot more backward compatible Xbox 360 games, and more. I'm really looking forward to seeing what they have in store for the Creators Update and Redstone 3 in 2017. Andy: There’s lots of other stuff from Microsoft that I want to see more of, like further improvements to Cortana, more development tools, expansion of the Bot Framework, the company's huge artificial intelligence investments, and... well, I know it's not very 'sexy', but I definitely want to see how Microsoft continues to improve enterprise and cloud security too. But there's another part of Windows that I’m very eager to learn more about: the announcement a few weeks ago about Windows 10 on ARM. Of course, the last Windows on ARM project, which didn’t go much further than the Surface RT, was– Rich: A disaster. Andy: Yeah, it did NOT go well. The biggest problem was obviously apps – the Windows Store didn’t have enough of them, and ARM chips could only run apps from the Store. But this time, Microsoft is bringing the full-fat version of Windows 10 to ARM, with support for 32-bit x86 desktop apps through emulation. There’s been a lot of discussion about power-efficient laptops and tablets with ARM chips running Windows 10 and desktop apps, but it also leaves the door wide open for speculation about– Rich: The Surface Phone. Andy: Yes. But stop interrupting me, or I’ll have to gag you again and put you back in your cage. Rich: … Image via Phone Designer Andy: We both know Windows Phone was a commercial failure, and Windows 10 Mobile sales are terrible – what’s the market share now? 0.4%? But Microsoft is already talking up the idea of redefining the smartphone, carving out new device categories, and building "the most ultimate mobile device". A Surface Phone with a mobile interface for on-the-go, and the full PC OS with desktop app support when docked and connected to a monitor… that could be something special. Rich: It sure could. I was one of those people that was against the idea of running x86 apps on phones, suggesting instead that Microsoft should focus on UWP and making Edge as good as Chrome, or better. After reviewing HP's Elite x3, I definitely see the potential of such a device. HP used cloud virtualization through Workspace, which is clunky and seriously expensive. You're basically streaming apps, so there's no way to get around some level of lag, even with a fast connection. A device that could run x86 apps natively is definitely something I'd be excited about. Andy: And that’s just the beginning. Last year, I wrote an editorial about the potential that Continuum offers for a truly mobile future of computing – with more powerful hardware, Microsoft could eventually deliver Surface Phone-type devices that not only act as your phone and your PC, but even a portable console that you can connect to your TV and wireless controllers. Rich: Yeah, but that’s a much more long-term vision than the next twelve months. As you also wrote this year, the thing with Windows phones is that the best bits are always ‘coming soon’. There’s a long wait ahead, and we may not even see the Surface Phone next year. But what we will see next year are the new Surface Book 2 and Pro 5. I'm really curious about what Microsoft is going to do with these devices. Obviously, they're both going to have Intel's new Kaby Lake chips, but I don't think that's all the company can do. Andy: Agreed. The Pro 4 was a nice update to the Pro 3, but it would be good to see some more substantial changes. Rich: Definitely. We're going into 2017 with a fairly dated selection of Surface devices. Not a single one has a current-generation chip or even USB Type-C. There has to be some level of a redesign on both devices, and I hope it's not just adding a port. Surface Book 2 is what I'm really curious about. There are rumors of a new hinge without a gap, which sounds cool, but what I really want is a quad-core 15-inch model. I'm dreaming now, so I'll stop talking. Andy: Speaking of which, I’ve not been really listening to you for the last couple of minutes, as I’m thirsty. Beer? Rich: Beer. What are your thoughts on what's to come in 2017? Are you looking forward to the same stuff as us, or are you eagerly awaiting something else? Let us know in the comments below!

Related Articles Wolverton: New gadgets only part of the story for CES’s success Trump’s impact and other tech predictions for 2017 Gadgets, apps rank high among Bay Area resolutions for 2017 MacBook Pro users: You’re not crazy, Consumer Reports finds battery life inconsistent Why 2016 was such a momentous year for tech Unable to call up the speaker’s resume — network coverage and WiFi had failed during the conference about Silicon Valley network reliability — Witkowski winged an introduction. “I’m being hoisted by my own petard,” he told the crowd of business leaders. “I wasn’t able to get a data connection.” It’s a cry heard around the Bay Area. Silicon Valley, capital of high-tech and hub of innovation, is stalled in a wireless traffic jam of its own making. Increasing demand for data — driven by the products made by Bay Area tech companies – and lagging infrastructure coupled with intense local politics have helped create the dropped calls, frozen videos and blank web pages on our screens. Industry analytics company RootMetrics ranks San Jose at 49 and San Francisco at 58 out of 125 metropolitan areas in quality of mobile network service. That puts the Bay Area ahead of Santa Rosa (122) but lagging far behind Modesto and Sacramento (7 and 8). Without a better network, the ripple effects could swamp next-generation products — autonomous vehicles, energy-efficient smart cities and the vast universe of the Internet of Things. “We worry about how good is the coverage and how fast is the coverage,” said Jon Walton, co-chair of a Joint Venture Silicon Valley task force on wireless network coverage, organized by Witkowski. “You can’t let your infrastructure degrade.” But getting better cell coverage in Silicon Valley is complicated. It’s a messy, block-by-block battle in city after city with shifting alliances. The fights pit community activists, wireless companies, government planners and consumers against each other. Reading this on your iPhone or iPad? Check out our new Apple News app channel here and click the + at the top of the page to save to your Apple News favorites. It doesn’t help that the Bay Area has a challenging geography for sending crisp signals. For starters, the Bay can muddle signals. The hills and redwoods collude to block transmissions that require line-of-site to properly connect. But even more challenging are local politics. A complex mix of aesthetics and environmental fears often hamstrings new antenna projects. Communities are willing to wage guerrilla warfare against cell phone towers, worrying they will ruin their health or their view. Regulators and network engineers insist the radiation levels emitted from towers are safe, and at lower levels than simply using a smartphone. Since local governments can’t reject a structure because of the power it emits, local battles rise up where cities and municipal agencies have control — site location and aesthetics. Consider the recent rancor in local courts and public meetings across Silicon Valley. Cupertino residents last year protested a proposed 80-foot tower at the civic center — thinly disguised as a cluster of eucalyptus trees — about a mile from the Apple Campus at One Infinite Loop. Dan Allen, a local resident opposed to the tower, said he is concerned the tower is being built too close to homes and government offices. He also feels the city could cut a better deal with the wireless company for using public property. Allen knows there are occasional dead spots in cell coverage. But, he said, “Do you really want a cell tower at the entrance to city hall?” The City Council did. A slightly shorter tower was approved and built. Sometimes, the battles go on for years. In 2010, Verizon proposed extending a light post 5 feet to host an antenna on the Palo Alto Little League field. A group of neighbors rallied to stop the antenna. But more than 250 other residents testified and sent texts and emails to the city to complain about the area’s miserable service. Some said they stood outside in the rain — umbrella in one hand, phone in the other — to get better reception. Another failed to connect to 911 during emergencies. A Stanford nurse e-mailed the city to support the new tower in her neighborhood. “I have cared for patients whose lives were saved by the use of cell phones,” she wrote. “Palo Alto, in the heart of Silicon Valley, should be embarrassed that we have such poor service at this end of town. We live in the shadow of Stanford; shouldn’t we have state-of-the-art communications capability?” Peter Sullivan, a former tech executive-turned environmental crusader, opposed the tower. Sullivan’s organization, Clear Light Ventures, sued to stop the project. Sullivan, who lives in an eco-friendly home in Los Altos, believes exposure to certain radiation and poorly engineered electrical systems can cause health problems ranging from insomnia to autism. Sullivan said his own family has suffered from its effects. “I love technology,” he said. “I want it to be safe.” In the end, the proponents for better service won out. The tower was built in July, six years after Verizon’s initial proposal. Commuters and longtime residents know about the hassles of inconsistent mobile service. Jim Wissick, a 45-year-old driving instructor from San Jose, said he switched carriers after encountering so many dead spots. A lifelong Silicon Valley resident, Wissick said the “not-in-my-backyard” attitude plays a big role. “There’s a lot of that, ” he said, ” especially in Palo Alto.” Network coverage isn’t just a convenience — it’s vital infrastructure. About half of all Americans have abandoned landlines for cell-only connections. A White House study found that unemployed workers are more likely to get back into the workforce, and faster, when they have internet access. The amount of mobile data consumed worldwide is expected to increase eight-fold by 2020, according to a forecast by Cisco. “The curve is exponential,” Witkowski said, “and we’re not slowing down at any point.” Consider the traffic on T-Mobile’s Bay Area network for November: 96 million megabytes of tweets, 1.2 billion megabytes of Facebook posts, 3.8 billion megabytes of YouTube video, and 1.35 billion minutes of phone calls. Planners and entrepreneurs say the stakes are high for the region’s own dominance. Smart buildings and cities – using networks to increase energy efficiency and move traffic faster – will be competing for bandwidth with connected vehicles, appliances and other new products. Engineers say the technological challenges can be met across the region with a combination of towers, small-cell transmitters and new innovations. It could mean more low-powered antennas scattered throughout neighborhoods. Planners say cities need to take a regional approach to building networks — and also urge carriers to improve service in rich and poor communities. Walton suggests local and regional governments develop master infrastructure plans with community input. Does Silicon Valley want lightning-fast connections like Seoul, South Korea, with visible antennas as common as street lamps? Or are residents content with fewer towers and spotty service? “The expectations,” Walton said, “have grown.” Cities with the best and worst mobile network performance Best 1. Lansing, Mich. 2.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Dec 30, 2016 at 10:10AM While the fourth quarter has not quite ended, and it will take a while to sort out all the winners and losers of the 2016 holiday shopping season, two clear victors have emerged. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) said in a press release that "this 2016 holiday was the best-ever season," noting that it shipped more than 1 billion items worldwide with Prime and Fulfillment by Amazon. The online retailer also reported strong sales for its Alexa-powered devices Echo and Dot, with sales for the artificial intelligence (AI) home assistants seeing sales rise by over nine times compared to last year's holiday season. The other big winner of the season, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), claimed 44% of all phones and tablets activated during the season, according to data from Flurry's Analytics Blog. That's actually down from 49% last year, but it's still double the nearest competitor. Amazon's Echo and Dot devices were big sellers this year. Image source: Amazon. Amazon totally crushed it While the online retailer rarely shares specific sales numbers for its devices or membership counts for Prime, it did offer some information in its post-Christmas press release. The company called the number of devices purchased from its Echo family of products "record setting," while also calling its Fire TV Stick and Fire tablets best-sellers. "Echo and Echo Dot were the best-selling products across Amazon this year, and we're thrilled that millions of new customers will be introduced to Alexa as a result," said Amazon's Worldwide Consumer CEO Jeff Wilke. "Despite our best efforts and ramped-up production, we still had trouble keeping them in stock." Amazon also celebrated (without offering any numbers) its $99-a-year Prime service, which offers free two-day delivery along with other perks. The company said that "more people around the world tried Prime this holiday season than any previous year." It also said that Dec. 23 was the biggest day ever for Prime Now (its two-hour delivery service available in limited markets) with the number of items ordered increasing by three times over last year. A good year for Apple, too Apple does very little discounting during the holiday season (though it did offer some limited deals on Black Friday). That did not stop it from seeing iPhones and iPads fly off the shelves, with the company leading in activations, with 44% of all devices. That's more than twice the 21% Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) was able to score to come in second, according to Flurry. Still, while "Apple devices continue to be the gift to give," according to Flurry, Samsung has to be pleased that it not only held the No. 2 spot, it inched up 1% over last year. That's a victory given the massive recall of Galaxy Note 7s the company had to conduct in 2016. These results show that while Apple remains popular, Samsung had enough goodwill to move past its difficult year. That may be good news for the Galaxy maker in 2017 when Apple will likely release a 7s, not a full update to its phone. The gifts that keep on giving By selling phones and home-based voice assistants in large numbers, both Amazon and Apple set themselves up for a strong year. Anyone who owns an iPhone or iPad will likely buy apps, Apple Music, or other services, putting more money in Apple's coffers. The same is true for Echo, which allows customers to subscribe to Amazon's music service and buy items from the online retailer. In addition, while some people do mix and match, if a person buys an iPad or iPhone, he or she may purchase other devices in the Apple family. The same is true for Amazon, as Echo sales could lead to people buying Fire tablets or Fire TV because they have become comfortable with the retailer's Alexa voice assistant. It's possible for both companies that going forward these sales could lead to consumers using their devices to automate their homes -- allowing for even more sales opportunities.

Co. Ltd.’s Best Moves in 2016 In 2016, TSMC enjoyed an improved positioning at Apple, made progress on next-generation technologies, and defended its position in older, lucrative technologies. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Dec 30, 2016 at 9:41AM Contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), commonly abbreviated as TSMC, has had a good year in 2016. Its stock price is up 28% year to date, and it's expected to enjoy more than 13% revenue growth this year, as well as nearly 10% earnings-per-share growth for the year. The company made a lot of good moves this year. Here are three of its best. Winning all the A10 orders In 2014, TSMC won all of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) A8 chip orders, which meant that every single iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus that was shipped included a TSMC-built applications processor. Considering that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were enormous successes for Apple, this translated into a nice win for TSMC. In 2015, however, TSMC didn't win the entirety of Apple's A9 chip orders. In fact, numerous reports from the press and the analyst community pointed to TSMC only winning a minority allocation of those chips. However, TSMC is believed to be the sole manufacturer of the A10 processors that power Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones. It's also believed to have won both the chip manufacturing orders, as well as the packaging orders for the A10. (This means more revenue share for TSMC.) Image source: TSMC.  Broadening the business with 7-nanometer tech TSMC is planning to begin generating revenue from its 10-nanometer chip-manufacturing technology in the first half of 2017, but that technology is expected to be short-lived and utilized by only a handful of customers. The next "major" technology from TSMC is expected to be its 7-nanometer technology, which promises performance, power, and area improvements over its 10-nanometer technology. TSMC has said that this technology "has been adopted not only by high-end mobile customers, but also by high-performance computing customers for [graphics processing units], gaming, [personal computers] and tablet[s], virtual reality, server, FPGA, automotive, and networking applications." Although it'll be a while before revenue from these design wins start rolling in -- expect the first revenue during the first half of 2018 -- TSMC's commentary points to strong execution in both the technology, as well as in securing a broad range of customers. It will be interesting to see just how much revenue growth it can drive, especially in applications beyond mobile, in the years ahead. Staying strong in older technologies Although much of the fanfare is around the latest manufacturing technologies from companies like TSMC, the reality is that a lot of the revenue and gross profit dollars that contract-chip manufacturers generate comes from older technologies. While there have been worries that less advanced chipmakers might begin to take share from TSMC in older technologies, like the 28-nanometer technology, TSMC has consistently managed to keep demand very high for such technologies. "Our 28-nanometer capacity remained fully utilized and represented 24% of our wafer revenue in the third quarter," said TSMC CFO Lora Ho. TSMC co-CEO C.C. Wei also said that demand for its 28-nanometer technology "has continued to be strong throughout this year and is expected to last through many years." When management was asked about potential competitive threats from tier-2 chip manufacturers for 28-nanometer business, co-CEO Mark Liu expressed confidence that the company could maintain market share in this technology generation.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About January 2, 2017 2016: As The Hardware World Turns 22 Comments by: Brian Benchoff December 30, 2016 Soon, the ball will drop in Times Square, someone will realize you can turn ‘2018’ into a pair of novelty sunglasses, and the forgotten mumbled lyrics of Auld Lang Syne will echo through New Year’s Eve parties. It’s time once again to recount the last 366 days, and what a year it’s been. Arduino got into an argument with Arduino and Arduino won. We got new Raspberry Pis. Video cards are finally getting to the point where VR is practical. The FCC inadvertently killed security in home routers before fixing the problem. All of this is small potatoes and really doesn’t capture the essence of 2016. It’s been a weird year. Want proof 2016 was different? This year, Microsoft announced they would provide a Linux ‘shim’ with every version of Windows. By definition, 2016 was the year of the Linux desktop. That’s how weird things have been in 2016. Man, 2016 Sucked, Didn’t It? By all accounts, 2016 wasn’t a good year. David Bowie, Alan Rickman, Carrie Fisher, Antonin Scalia, Morley Safer, George Martin, Marvin Minsky, Keith Emerson, Doctor Heimlich, George Michael, Prince, Muhammad Ali, Gordie Howe, Janet Reno, Elie Weisel, Gene Wilder, Kimbo Slice, Erik Bauersfeld (voiced It’s a Trap), Anton Yelchin, Kenny Baker, Arnold Palmer, Leonard Cohen, Harambe, Fidel Castro, John Glenn, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and Alan Thicke all passed away this year. Former Toronto mayor Rob Ford died at the predictably young age of 46. Lemmy lived harder and faster than anyone and beat this terrible year by three days. In the political sphere, 2016 will go down as the start of something. It’s far too early to tell what the end result will be, but between Brexit, the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, the release of the Panama Papers, a failed Turkish coup, and the presidential election in Gambia, 2016 was a year without parallel. Historians and sociologists are beginning to opine on this year, with the first drafts of the history books citing 2016 as the beginning of a populist revolution. Right now, only one thing is clear: Twitter somehow played a part. I would like to point out we had absolutely no political coverage at all. You’re welcome. The absence of anything political was an editorial prerogative, and by our judgment was the best thing to do. Like our conscious decision not to embed tweets into posts, it’s one of the many editorial decisions we make that goes without thanks or recognition. It would have been so easy and very profitable to pump out a few half-baked opinion pieces on the US presidential election this year. The word ‘trump’ is a verb, and could be easily dropped into a few very clever headlines. This level of restraint deserves, I think, a few pats on the back. Oh yeah, the Cubs won the World Series, Dylan won the Nobel Prize in Literature, we’re going to get a great NOFX album real soon, and the trend of over-hopped beer is finally coming to an end. It doesn’t balance the rest of the year, but it’s something, right? 2016 In 3D Printers 2016 was the year 3D printing started to recover from Makerbot, with advances seen in both very low-end printers and the slow but steady rise of dual (and quad) extrusion. Last year, a good $200 3D printer would have been inconceivable. At CES last January, Monoprice announced a $200 3D printer. The Monoprice MP Select Mini was really just a rebadge of the Malyan M200, but holy crap this thing is awesome. This printer is cheap at just $200, but it’s more than capable of handling anything you could throw at it. It has a 32-bit controller board, and save for a few upgrades (PEI sheet for the bed, maybe throw a larger stepper in the extruder), this printer would be worthwhile at twice the price. 2016 was the year we started to see usable dual extrusion on desktop 3D printers. Dual extrusion isn’t a new thing — it was available on the plywood Makerbots back in the day. Dual extrusion that worked well is another thing entirely. At this year’s MRRF, E3D released Scaffold, a water-soluble filament that is best described as, ‘the stuff gel-cap pharmaceuticals are made out of’. Unlike HIPS or PVA, Scaffold is easy to print with, non-toxic and can be dissolved in water. Dissolvable filament is one of the best use cases for dual extrusion, and with E3D’s Scaffold, dual extrusion makes sense now. Of course, dual extrusion traditionally means two extruders and two hotends. If you want quad extrusion, that’s four extruders. This design is ultimately impractical; it’s either too much mass to move around, or there aren’t enough pins on a controller board. Prusa turned these ideas on their head this year with the release of the quad material upgrade for the i3 Mk2. Instead of four different hotends, the Prusa multi-material upgrade only uses one hotend to print in four different colors. The results are spectacular, and it does it using only three extra stepper motors and a simple, cheap breakout board. In 2017, you’re going to see a lot of companies bring a Prusa-style multi-material machine to market. Last year’s review of the state of 3D printing lamented the lack of a mainstream CoreXY printer. This year brought us the D-Bot by [spauda], the first CoreXY printer to be picked up by the community. MakerBot sold the Smart Extruder – a part that should not fail – in packs of three. Makerbot is dead. We knew this last year, but we had to wait for the yearly financials to be released. Makerbot stopped manufacturing their printers in Brooklyn, and now the easy break ovens are manufactured in China. Every other manufacturer of 3D printers is now selling more units than Makerbot. Still, Makerbot released their sixth generation of printers this year, and Makerbot seems to be transitioning to a software company. I have said time and time again that the public perception of 3D printing is tied directly to Makerbot, and no writings on the state of consumer 3D printing mention this basic fact. The graph of the hype cycle matches shares of SYSS. The general public is a few years behind the enthusiast market, so 2018 or 2019 should see a resurgence of 3D printing in the public’s mind. Will Makerbot be around then? Yes, and they might even be making printers a few years from now. 2016 In Embedded ESP32 [Sprite_tm])’s keychain Game BoyIn 2014, a weird chip showed up on Seeed Studio. It was the ESP8266, and while initially this chip was simply a WiFi chip with a UART, hackers got their hands on this tiny little module and turned it into one of the most interesting electronic building blocks in recent memory. 2016 saw the release of the ESP32, the successor to the ESP8266. The first info for the new ESP32 dribbled out around this time last year, and the specs were amazing. The ESP32 is a dual-core WiFi and Bluetooth powerhouse that’s available for peanuts and shows awesome promise. Right now, the ESP32 is fairly rare, but it is available in quantity one. If you want to, you can build the tiniest Game Boy in the World with it. We welcome 2017 and all the ESP32 hacks it will bring. The Raspberry Pi Zero Does Not Exist Cattywampus. The chip layout on the Orange Pi is cattywampus. In November of last year, the Raspberry Pi Zero was released. Idiots on the Internet suggested the Pi Zero didn’t exist operating under the theory that since you can’t buy a Ferrari right now, Ferraris don’t exist either. Disregarding that derailed train of thought, there was a very good reason for the limited production of the Pi Zero. The Pi Foundation was busy manufacturing the Raspberry Pi 3. The Pi 3 was released in February of this year, and is proving to be one of the best single board computers available. It’s fast, has amazing support, and yes, you can just go out and buy one, just like a Raspberry Pi Zero. In other single board computer news, Orange Pi figured out how to rotate parts on a PCB. Intel did something, but not documentation. The DEF CON badge was an x86 chip, and there’s a really, really small x86 system. This year, Microchip acquired Atmel for $3.56 Billion. The PIC vs AVR microcontroller holy war is over. What will become of our ATMegas? At the very least, AVRs will still be around. There’s a new version of “the Arduino”, the ATMega328. It’s the ATMega328PB. There are new ATtinys.  There is, however, a lot of speculation over what will happen to Atmel and the chips we love so dearly. Microchip released a statement. This statement said, basically nothing. That’s good news. “Microchip will continue their philosophy of customer-driven obsolescence,” and Microchip is very good at keeping parts in the catalog long after they have been rendered obsolete. Don’t count on the DIP ‘Tiny85 disappearing anytime soon. Microchip did screw up the Atmel social media today, but at least the chips will be alright. 2016 saw the release of the first Big-O Open microcontrollers. Finally, there’s a glimmer of hope that our silicon will be unencumbered by patents and licenses. Open-V is the first Open Microcontroller, and the HiFive 1 brings the RISC-V core to the Arduino form factor. The RISC-V ISA isn’t a big deal now, but take a look around and see how many ARM microcontrollers are around you. All of those chip manufacturers pay a licensing fee to ARM. RISC-V doesn’t have that. Kids, this is one to put on your resume. 2016 In Hardware Computing Since the dawn of computing, we have all wanted one port. We needed something to attach microphones, hard drives, keyboards, printers, and phones to our computers. It would be nice if this port could supply power. The ability to connect an external device directly to the PCI bus would be neat, and connecting a display through the same cable would be really cool.In 2016, we sort of have it. The USB Type-C port, with Thunderbolt 3, is the closest we’ve ever gotten to this dream. Apple is the standard bearer of new ports. Just look at the original iMac. In an age filled with serial, parallel, and joystick ports, Apple took their ADB cables and turned them into USB ports. The industry quickly adopted USB, and 20 years later, Apple decided to do it again. Apple’s new MacBook Pros are rightly called out for being too expensive, but there is one huge advancement here: the only ports on these machines are Thunderbolt 3 with USB-C. Donglepocolapse is now a word, but it’s not going to last long. My cache of Griffin iMates tell me that. Look forward to fewer ports on your machines in the coming years, thanks to Apple and their support of Thunderbolt 3. Just don’t cheap out on the cables. The Galaxy Note 7 sold like hotcakes in 2016. Wait, I have another one. Samsung was on fire this year with the Galaxy Note 7. This year, Samsung’s flagship phone, the Galaxy Note 7 blew up. The problem was with the battery, and a few devices turned into bombs while charging. Samsung recalled the Note 7, and it’s illegal to take this phone on a commercial airline in the US. With this many lithium-powered devices, something like this was bound to happen sooner or later. Despite being outlawed by the FAA and kicked off cellular networks, the Note 7 is still selling for about $200 on eBay. I kind of want one. Microsoft and Apple If 2016 wasn’t weird enough, Apple and Microsoft swapped places. Now the Evil Empire is based out of Cupertino and innovation is coming out of Redmond. Microsoft started this whole mess in March (two days before April Fools) by saying Cygwin Can Suck It. Ubuntu will run with native Windows libraries. In reality, everything is still Windows, but Microsoft is providing a ‘shim’ that will allow Linux binaries to run. Apple Sucks Now, Here’s A Thinkpad Buyer’s Guide. For the past few years, Apple hasn’t been paying attention to the Macintosh. Really: go look at the MacRumors Buyer’s Guide and note the release schedule. Desktops are forgotten, the flagship Mac desktop hasn’t been updated in three years, and the recent update of the MacBook Pro was poorly received. In contrast, Microsoft recently released the Surface Studio PC, a neat piece of hardware that’s even better than an iMac and a Wacom Cintiq. Microsoft will soon require manufacturers to use ‘precision touchpads’ in laptops, giving Windows users an experience similar to the excellent Apple touchpads. The world has turned upside down, and soon we may see bog-standard Windows laptops with the same high-quality hardware found in Apple machines. 2016 wasn’t all bad for Apple. Pressured by the FBI to build a new version of iOS with a backdoor, Apple CEO Tim Cook did something amazing. He said no. The eleventh largest company in the world stood up for civil liberties and user privacy. Around here we swing anti-corporate and anti-establishment, but we have to give Tim Cook the respect he deserves for this action. Of course, a backdoor in iOS wouldn’t have done anything, and the FBI eventually cracked the phone in question, but still, Apple deserves a lot of respect. There’s a lot of real courage over there. Actual Hardware We’ve had desktop CNC mills forever, and the RepRap project is still a noble pursuit. 2016 brought some very cool new machines to market, allowing weekend warriors access to the same tools the big boys have. Wazer is a real waterjet machine that fits on your workbench. For a few thousand dollars, you can cut glass into any shape you want. You can cut metal without heating it. You can cut carbon fiber without wearing out a blade. A waterjet has a lot of requirements — you need high-pressure pumps, nozzles that can withstand abrasion, and a consumable medium. It took several years, but Wazer finally released their machine with a successful Kickstarter. Although the Shaper isn’t fundamentally different from a ShopBot, this hand-held CNC router is technically the largest CNC router on the planet. Instead of an XY gantry, Shaper uses computer vision and an attentive human operator to keep a bit where it should be. It’s amazing technology that’s been years in the making, but in 2016, this neat piece of kit was finally released. What does 2017 have in store? It’s a bit too early to tell, but desktop injection molding might be a thing next year. Everything will be bigger, better, and cheaper. Looking Forward How does 2017 look like for Hackaday? This year was great for the entire Hackaday family. Editorially, we could have sold out so hard. So hard like you wouldn’t believe. We didn’t. You’re welcome. We’re producing more and better content than we ever have before. Tindie, our ever-faithful robotic dog, is going gangbusters. Every day, more people are selling their electronic and ‘maker’ paraphernalia on Tindie. Hackaday.io is likewise going crazy. Growth is huge, and we continue to have the best hardware community on the Internet. This year was the third Hackaday Prize The entries were amazing, the work was fantastic, and someone even found a use for ferrofluid that wasn’t just artsy-fartsy stuff. We gave away a lot of prizes, and learned a lot from the hundreds of submissions. The SuperConference was a blast, and we already have a theme for next year: “SuperCon IV – Because ‘Zoso’ was already taken”. What does 2017 have in store for Hackaday? More. More of everything. The third edition of the Hackaday Omnibus is in the works, and thanks to our fantastic community managers, we’re doing more events than ever before. 2017 is going to be a great year, and it’s all thanks to you, our readers.

Hot button topics are easy because no one knows how to handle them…including the audience. But boy do they make the servers burn. As for the waterjet and glass, does that introduce any stress in the cut edges that needs to be treated out? And the Note 7 maybe a third supplier can fix the “too big for the space” battery assuming that was the problem. Report comment Reply SOI Sentinel says: December 30, 2016 at 7:56 am The waterjet will not add any additional stresses. This doesn’t mean that already existing stresses won’t make trouble, though. I have a friend who had a Note 7. I think he would have gone for a slightly smaller battery as long as the pen related software stayed the same (which as far as I know means you’re still using the stock ROM image). He wouldn’t have liked that, but if an external battery-case would have offset it, I think he would have lived with it. I’ve not messed with my Android phones, so I don’t know how easy it would have been to disable the auto updates that are disabling Note 7’s currently. It STILL would have not been allowed on a plane (or other public transportation?), however, which would continue to reduce its audience. Report comment Reply Internet says: December 31, 2016 at 12:19 pm “Wazer finally released their machine with a successful Kickstarter.” Umm, might want to reword that to read: Wazer finished a Kickstarter campaign. That doesn’t mean they have or are going to actually release a machine or that the machine is actually going to be any good. It’s a niche machine in a niche market with major drawbacks and it still is very much a manual machine in terms of the amount of work you have to do to operate it, clean it, etc. Plus, waste disposal and just buying the raw abrasive materials are not easy at all either. It’s basically a “no frills” machine that can produce about as much (still undisclosed) pressure as a pressure washer that happens to be able to erode materials but does so at a much slower pace than anything commercially available, while using significantly more abrasive per minute. There remain a significant amount of unanswered questions about the machine and until those are answered, I am still reserving judgement on exactly what this machine can actually do. It’s a neat toy for sure and it has a very small user base that would appreciate what it can do but I am reserving overall judgement until they actually, you know, release something (machines, actual specifications) to customers.

Mostly the newer graphics technologies are not only relevant to the game development field but more specifically the game engine development. It reveals the complex workings that used to be driver domain and leaves it up the programmer to do all the code leading to a lot of bloat where unless your making a engine you probably aren’t going to use it. Hackaday seems to focused on hardware and hardware hacks. Vulkan and DirectX seem a bit out of scope.

Report comment Reply Internet says: December 31, 2016 at 12:34 pm As much as I would like it to be, I remain a bit reserved that desktop injection molding is going to be a huge game changer in 2017 unless I am missing something about the mold production process being made cheaper and easier? I could see it happen by combining a few automated 3d design tools with JIT aluminum milling, bringing the costs of the mold down to maybe a few grand, tops without requiring huge amounts of mold design work, combining that with a $10,000ish machine with a high degree of automation that can use off the shelf nurdles. Who handles mold post finishing and polishing work? You are not going to get a high polish finish without somebody or something rubbing the heck out of the mold first. But they are quoting a mold cost of $250. “Mold cost by using CNC machine your own $250 (Tormach).” That feels a bit… optimistic. And a Tormach, while a decent machine, is not cheap nor automated. The $250 quoted “mold cost” would be for mostly the cost of the material and maybe wear on the tooling but nothing else. Report comment Reply The Snob says: January 2, 2017 at 10:04 am Protomold can pretty much do what you’re referring to–upload a CAD file and quote you a cost to produce X units in Y material. As you say, you see right away that much of the cost of a tool is how nice a finish you want. As-machined tools are pretty cheap. As for the cost of making a tool on a Tormach, a couple nice chunks of 6061 bar is maybe $30, so unless you’re snapping endmills regularly, most of the cost is going to be labor. If you’re making your own prototypes, then I suppose it depends on how you value your time and whether you’re amortizing the ~15k cost of the mill and tooling. I’m also a little curious about the volume:clamp pressure ratio. I have a Morgan G55T which has a 2oz shot size which is a little bigger than this, but the max clamp pressure is 20 tons versus about 6.5 on this one, and it has more than twice the injection pressure. So I wonder about the limitations there. That said, the controls and automation on this machine look very nice. I’m a bit skeptical of the price given that a new Morgan is ~20k for a much simpler machine whose R&D costs were paid off decades ago, but I guess Chinese controls and mechanicals are pretty cheap nowadays… Report comment Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Local manufacturing is expected to help Apple price its phones more competitively in India as it currently attracts 12.5 per cent additional duty on imports.

The official added that Foxconn, which also manufactures iPhones for Apple, had come with similar plans to the city some time back. This would be Apple's second big project for Bengaluru. In May, Apple had announced setting up a design and development accelerator in the City to grow the iOS developer community. The announcement was made as part of the visit of Apple CEO Tim Cook to India.

A group of senior officials from ministries, including commerce and finance, will early next month deliberate on the incentives sought by Apple to set up a manufacturing unit in the country.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Even in its weakened state, Samsung’s strong foothold in the mobile market enabled the company to stave off competition during the busy holiday period. That’s according to NPD hardware analyst Stephen Baker, who said Samsung’s loyal fanbase helped the Korean company remain competitive, even as companies such as Apple were releasing new devices. “Most of those who bought or wanted to buy a Note 7 opted for a different high-end Galaxy phone,” Baker told The Wall Street Journal. He added, “Samsung was able to fend off other Android competition, and Apple, too, thanks to Apple’s own lack of a wowing product this year.” We echoed a similar sentiment earlier this year, even before the iPhone 7 was introduced. Although the device sports an improved home button, new colors and faster guts, Apple’s latest smartphones don’t feel as technologically advanced as the competition. At least the Cupertino company ditched the option for 16GB of storage. Baker’s comments come on the heels of a report from Flurry Analytics, which said Apple products accounted for 44 percent of activated smartphones and tablets over the holiday period. In contrast, Flurry says Samsung’s smartphones accounted for less than half that at 21 percent. Samsung is too strong The Galaxy Note 7 would have been our smartphone of the year had it not been for the device recall. It features a killer design, excellent camera, and all the functionality you’d ever need. Unfortunately, it had a propensity to catch fire, which is why it was recalled. We’re expecting Apple to step it up next year by upgrading to an OLED display and all-new design. The year 2017 will mark the iPhone’s tenth anniversary, so we’re expecting big things. Whether Apple’s next smartphone will be good enough to compete against devices like the Galaxy S8 or Note 8 remains to be seen.

TheStreet Staff Dec 30, 2016 9:36 AM EST The Trump administration may want Apple (AAPL) to move iPhone production to the U.S. but it's not likely to happen anytime soon. While the cost of production in China may be lower, there are several other reasons production of Apple products will likely continue in China for the foreseeable future. Among other things, it looked at the speed at which Chinese plants are able to "scale up and down" in response to order changes, the presence of various plants needed to assist with iPhone assembly and the number of industrial engineers and other technical workers available to Chinese plants.

Erik Eckel lists three predictions, including one particularly bold prognostication. By Erik Eckel | December 30, 2016, 5:00 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Jessica Dolcourt/CNET Predictions are a tricky business. Suggesting that Apple's port elimination trend would continue was a safe bet in January of this year. The forecast proved correct when new MacBook Pros were introduced that emphasize USB-C ports and iPhone 7s hit the scene packing a single lightning port and no audio jack. My prediction that Apple would introduce its own streaming service in 2016? Well, we're all still waiting for that one. What innovations or changes does Apple have in store for 2017? Here are three predictions I'm making; post your own by joining the discussion below. SEE: Apple rumored to launch three iPad Pro models in spring 2017 (ZDNet) 1: New desktop models With high certainty, look for Apple to introduce faster desktop computers. I believe Apple will introduce both boosted Mac Pro models possessing faster IO speeds, more potent processors, and even more capable video cards. What's Hot at TechRepublic Photos: 2016 holiday gift guide for techies Trump's opposition to H-1B visas has experts concerned about filling high-skilled jobs Open-source pioneer Munich debates report that suggests abandoning Linux for Windows 10 Subscribe to TechRepublic's Cover Stories newsletter Don't be surprised if iMacs and Mac minis receive video processor, CPU, and IO improvements, too. I suspect these desktop models will begin using SSDs exclusively, too, beginning in 2017. Less likely is the introduction of an improved Mac keyboard for desktops that includes Apple's new Touch Bar. But if the Touch Bar were to arrive in desktop keyboards, the move would signal the innovation is more than just a gimmick for high-end MacBook Pro laptops. SEE: Tim Cook says 'great desktops' are on the way for Apple (TechRepublic) 2: A Siri-powered Bluetooth speaker Amazon's Dot and Echo, which features Alexis, and Google's Home, which boasts its own voice-activated assistant, are proving popular. Yet, Apple has no official Siri-compatible Bluetooth speaker capable of receiving and responding to voice commands, playing streaming music, and performing other hands-free conveniences. I wouldn't be surprised if Apple introduces its own voice-activated, Siri-compatible speaker in 2017. What could prove surprising is if Apple introduces a couple higher-end models possessing more impressive fidelity than is normal for such speakers. Considering Apple owns Beats, which manufactures speakers recognized by many for their sound quality, I'm surprised they haven't already introduced such models. 3: Touch-screen MacBooks Microsoft's generating headlines (if not equally robust sales) with its Surface Pro 4 touch-screen tablets, and that could be all the reason Apple needs to add touch-screen displays to its laptop lineup. While users can add a Smart Keyboard to an iPad Pro, there are still plenty of business users wanting or requiring the storage and performance traditionally associated with notebook computers. If Apple provides a touch-screen option, I would expect Apple to also re-engineer the display's lid to enable swiveling the screen and folding the tablet back upon itself, which is the configuration often found in medical environments. That's a much taller order and, should the prediction fail to materialize, the first likely reason this bold prediction proves wrong. Apple may not be willing to sink such investment into reconfiguring a laptop lineup that's already widely considered by many to provide the best performing notebooks, pound-for-pound.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Production of Apple's AirPods goes into High Gear in Multiple Shanghai Plants to Meet Consumer Demand | Main | Apple's Normal Order Management after Christmas seems to have Falsely Alarmed Seasoned News Sites » December 30, 2016 Foxconn Reaching Full Robotic Production Automation for All-in-One PC's and Advancing to other Products every Year   In 2014 Patently Apple posted a report titled "CEO of Foxconn: Robots will play a Crucial Role in the World's Third Industrial Revolution." In May 2016 we did a follow-up report titled "Apple Supplier Foxconn Reduces Workforce from 110,00 to 50,000 due to In-Plant Robotic Program." Since that time Foxconn has been pushing ahead at full speed to get their robotic plants up to speed through their three-phase plan with the third phase introducing full robotic automation for production.   It's being reported today that "Foxconn's factories in Chengdu, western China, Shenzhen, southern China, and Zhengzhou, northern China, have been brought into the second or third phase, Dai said.   There are 10 fully automated production lines at some factories, including table one in Chengdu, AIO (all-in-one) PC and LCD monitor lines at a factory in Chongqing, western China, and a CNC line in Zhengzhou, Dai indicated.   Foxconn has deployed more than 40,000 Foxbots, industrial robots developed and produced in house, at factories in China, Dai said. Foxconn can produce about 10,000 Foxbots a year.   Whether phase-three robotic automation will ever be applied to iPhone production is unknown. But all-in-one computers in some plants are fully automated and you have to wonder if that includes Apple's iMac. Once full robotic automation is a reliable reality, nothing will stop Apple products from being made in the U.S. at close to the same profit margins than in China. We may be a little ahead of ourselves at this point in time but Foxconn is determined to move more and more production into the third-phase and Terry Gou is one determined individual. He'll make it happen in the not-too-distant future.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

We grade Apple, Samsung, Facebook, Google and others on their achievements and failures in 2016. By Alistair Charlton December 30, 2016 14:06 GMT 2016 was a strong year for virtual reality and the Gear VR, but Samsung suffered badly when its flagship phone began explodingReuters As 2016 draws to a close the IBTimes UK technology desk will attempt to skillfully sidestep the year's political minefield and instead serve up an end-of-term report on the biggest technology companies. But, even though Silicon Valley kept itself out of 2016's biggest headlines, it was not entirely immune; the year saw Apple thumbing its nose at the FBI, Tesla's autonomous cars allegedly crash themselves, the iPhone lose its headphone jack, Amazon start drone deliveries, Facebook Live broadcast its first live murder and Samsung's flagship smartphone literally explode in its face. Apple: C+ Apple started 2016 strongly by standing up to the FBI, but 'courageous' decisions to drop ports has hurt itReuters Apple came out fighting at the start of 2016 with an open letter from CEO Tim Cook to the FBI in which he called the government demanding access to a terrorist's iPhone "a dangerous precedent". Cook said: "We feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the US government." The good news continued with the iPhone SE, which crammed the performance of an iPhone 6S into the smaller, prettier dress of the 5S. It was met with bemusement but became the UK's best-selling smartphone thanks to its lower price. Apple's previously unassailable design credentials took a knock with the Apple Pencil and new Magic Mouse, but it was the headphone jack-less iPhone 7, ultra-expensive MacBook Pro, complete with nothing but USB-C ports, and delayed AirPod earphones which gave the loyalty of Apple fans its strongest test in years. A stumbling finish to 2016, following the firm's first (and second) quarter of negative growth in over a decade means all eyes will be on 2017, the iPhone's 10th anniversary and a range of "great" new Macs for faith to be restored. On a related note, the Mac Pro has not been updated for over 1,000 days. One. Thousand. Days. Samsung: B- Samsung gave us the brilliant Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge in 2016, but also the explosive Note 7...Reuters Samsung also started the year strongly. The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge arrived in the spring and earned huge praise from everyone who held them. Here Samsung had taken the already gorgeous S6 and S6 Edge duo, and added everything they hadn't included, to offer waterproofing and expandable storage – both things the iPhone 6S of the time sorely missed. Elsewhere, Samsung's televisions continued to rule the roost with their superior design, picture quality, software and HDR adoption; Samsung was also one of the first to start selling an Ultra HD Blu-ray player, and just recently made a play to bring Dolby Atmos into our living rooms with the HW-K950 sound bar. An updated Gear VR headset (free with many S7 purchases) and new Gear 360 camera, helped Samsung make good progress in the nascent virtual reality market, while the Gear S2 smartwatch was comfortably 'best of the rest' for those who didn't want an Apple Watch. But then along came the Galaxy Note 7. The beautiful handset and its innovative eye scanner had all the hallmarks of a great phone, but exploding batteries, a botched recall and yet more explosions resulted in Samsung killing the phone before it even went on sale in the UK and Europe. This was an unmitigated disaster as expensive as it was embarrassing for a company which should have pounced on Apple's unimaginative iPhone. But instead Samsung floundered in its own acrid cloud of burning lithium. Microsoft: A- Microsoft was arguably more innovative and interesting than Apple and others in 2016.Stephen Lam/Getty Images Put simply, Microsoft was more innovative than Apple in 2016. Where the iPhone maker went about uprooting and tearing away the technology most of us still hold precious, Microsoft under Satya Nadella's lead felt like it was walking us into the future by the hand. Although expensive, the Surface Book impressed us with its design, screen and the feeling that Microsoft fans have a real alternative to the MacBook. Microsoft also brought real-time translation to Skype and showed more innovation with the Surface Studio, a beautiful and powerful iMac rival. Less successful was Tay, an artificial intelligence project let loose on Twitter with the programmed personality of a teenage girl. It took less than a day for the internet to teach Tay to become a racist, sexist, Mexican-hating, Holocaust-denying Nazi sympathiser who blamed 9/11 on President Bush and described President Obama as something we simply can't write here. Rest in peace, Tay. Windows Phone had another awful year and now stands closer to extinction that science previously thought possible. It was a bold yet worthy dream, but now one which needs to be killed and forgotten about. Less tangibly, Microsoft strode through 2016 with a greater sense of presence and self-worth than in recent memory, and long may that continue. Buying LinkedIn for $26.2bn (£21bn) was... bold, but let's wait for 2017 to see what Microsoft has planned for it. Alphabet: A Google, now known as Alphabet, had a strong 2016 thanks to the Pixel phone, Daydream VR and Waymo car division.Reuters Alphabet, parent company of Google, did a lot right in 2016. It partnered with Fiat Chrysler to build a fleet of 100 autonomous minivans and spun off its car division into a new business, called Waymo (points deducted for that name, however). Alphabet also launched its first Google-branded smartphone, the Pixel, and a virtual reality platform called Daydream along with its first VR headset, the View. The much-hyped Andromeda, claimed to be an amalgamation of Google's Android and Chrome platforms, failed to arrive in 2016 and so too did Android Wear 2.0. The former is interesting enough to keep our attention for now, but delaying the second installment of Google's smartwatch software has had the knock-on effect of forcing watchmakers to hold fire on upcoming hardware. As with others, Google was plagued in 2016 with the fake news epidemic which not only saw factually incorrect stories appear high on search results, but also caused hate speech to appear in suggested searches. Facebook: C+ Facebook faced some tough questions over its relationship with fake news in 2016.Reuters Facebook faces some tough questions going into 2017. As much as it and boss Mark Zuckerberg say the platform is a social network and not a publishing company, its alleged role in delivering 'fake news' to voters during the US presidential election puts it in an uncomfortable position. Facebook wants to keep its hands clean, but like Google is needs to start admitting some responsibility. It has the power to deliver news to over 1.5 billion people worldwide, and the growing popularity of websites deliberately set up to spread fake news, which is then promoted on Facebook, is something the company needs to take seriously. More positively, Facebook's autonomous drone programme, built in Somerset and designed to bring internet access to developing countries and remote places, took its first flight. But a crash in December highlights how far Facebook still has to go to make airborne internet a success. Amazon: A Amazon began drone deliveries in late 2016 and wowed us with the Echo and its Alexa personal assistant.Reuters/Mike Segar Now much, much more than just an online retailer, Amazon used 2016 to launch its blockbuster motoring show The Grand Tour, featuring Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May. Reviews have been mixed so far and we will likely never know how many viewers the show is attracting, but it is evidence that Amazon Prime Video is gunning directly for Netflix and has very deep pockets. Amazon also began delivering orders by drone in a small part of the English countryside. The Prime Air trial has just two customers for now, but Amazon is hoping to scale this up through 2017. The company has rightly not revisited its failed smartphone efforts (does anyone actually remember the Fire Phone?) and instead focused on the Echo speaker and Alexa personal assistant, improving them and launching in the UK. HTC: B- The HTC Vive headset, complete with controllers and lighthouses, is the best VR experience yet.HTC Back from the brink, HTC impressed us in 2016 with the Vive VR headset and 10 smartphone. The former a technological tour de force with a price to match, the latter a truly excellent smartphone with market-leading audio. HTC played it well on both fronts, giving us a top-end virtual reality headset and a great alternative to Samsung, Sony and LG. The company's finances are still in a bad way, but with a updated Vive expected as soon as January, momentum could soon be in HTC's favour. Tesla: A Despite Autopilot controversy, Tesla had a successful 2016 led by the reveal of the affordable Model 3. IBTimes UK This final section could honestly be an essay all of its own. Tesla kicked off 2016 by launching the Model 3, an electric car going on sale in 2017 for around £35,000. Fans camped outside to pre-order and soon the order book was 400,000 names long. At this stage Tesla was, at a push, making 50,000 cars a year, but who are we to doubt Tesla magus Elon Musk? But on 7 May the nightmare scenario became perilously close to reality. A Model S with its self-driving Autopilot feature switched on, crashed into a truck, instantly killing its driver and casting a long, dark shadow over the car industry's autonomous future. It emerged that, although enabled, Autopilot had not caused the accident and neither it nor the driver saw the truck in time. Musk and Tesla quickly moved forward, updated Autopilot and highlighted how this kind of accident would soon be eradicated thanks to autonomy. A video was published of a Tesla driving itself through town. But the rest of the industry, with century-long reputations in the balance, were spooked into taking a more conservative approach. Tesla also acted quickly to nip early Model X quality control issues in the bud. Quite how stories of £100,000 cars arriving with wonky panel gaps and rust disappeared so quickly is perhaps evidence of Musk inheriting Steve Jobs' renowned 'Reality Distortion Field'. Tesla and Musk go into 2017 with a lot to prove and a lot on their plates.

Traditional watches have a similar crown that allows them to adjust the date and time, but in the Apple Watch’s case, the digital crown allows users to navigate the watch, act as a home button, a selection button, and more. This is a feature unique to the Apple Watch, although a recently discovered patent by Patently Apple (via 9to5Mac) has revealed that Apple has toyed with the idea of bringing the digital crown to its iOS devices, such as the iPhone and iPad. It is an interesting idea we’ll have to admit and it’s actually not the first time that Apple has come up with such an idea. Interestingly enough this patent has surfaced at a time where according to the rumors, Apple could be looking to ditch the physical home button on the iPhone once and for all. The home button has been pretty much a staple feature in every iPhone launched, despite the fact that it is also one of the features that breaks down the most. With the removal of the home button, we’re pretty sure that Apple is looking to virtual solutions, not an alternate physical one. In any case since it’s a patent there’s no telling if Apple will ever implement it, but what do you guys think of the idea? Yay or nay? Filed in Apple >Cellphones >Gadgets >Tablets.

Some AirPods users cite issues with AirPods charging case, exact cause currently unknown Posted by Chris Barylick Apple’s AirPods have roared out the door and are getting good reviews, but there may be some battery issues to contend with for some users. A number of users have reported that the charging case that comes with the headphones isn’t holding Apple’s advertised 24 hours of charge. In theory, the charging case should only lose noticeable amounts of charge when the AirPods are low on battery and recharging within the case, and when users flip the pack open to check battery levels or otherwise activate Bluetooth with a connected Apple device. Users who’ve reported issues have stated that the AirPods case drains more than 40 percent of available capacity in only a few hours, with the AirPods at 100 percent inside and minimal Bluetooth activation. In the case of Reddit user “severinskulls”, the issue was resolved via a replacement AirPods case. In most cases, the AirPods themselves are not facing any shortened battery life issues. The user offered the following comments: The old AirPods Charging Case: I was having the exact same issue you had. Airpods in case, go to bed with full charge and waking up with 15%-20% of the case charge gone. Thats a full charge cycle for the airpods themselves! I spoke to apple support online. They had no answer how long the charge of the case should last when the airpods are not in use. They made an appointment for me instore as all diagnostics at the moment are being handled instore they said. Cut to this morning, go in for my appointment. The genius was very friendly. I was his first airpods case. Turns out he also has no info on whether this rate of the battery draining is normal. He said that definitely they are designed to lose charge over time as cycling the charge improves the health of the airpod batteries. However as I pointed out, going from a full charge to empty in two days while they are sitting there unused seems way too fast. To be safe, he placed my airpods. So i got a brand new pair. The new AirPods Charging Case: Sooooo I just checked. Airpods and case were 100% at 9pm last night. Checked just now at 9am the next morning and they are STILL at 100%, both the pods and the case. I had bluetooth on my phone on all night too. With the other pair in the same situation, I would have lost 14-20% charge by now. So there we go, case closed (pun?), there is a battery life problem suffered by the airpods. I’m going to write back feedback to apple now. You should get your airpods replaced because they shouldnt lose as much charge as what youre experiencing. In a teardown last week by iFixit, it was theorized that the Charging Case was the cause of the AirPods’ delay from October to December. The root of the problem was a few empty spaces discovered within the solder joints of the case’s chip. This is referred to as “voiding,” which iFixit said “could be evidence of low quality standards, or a rushed product release.” The exact cause and scope of the AirPods case issue remains unclear and some users have speculated that the issue could be an initial charge cycle hiccup that sorts itself out over time. Even so, some users have reported that the issue has remained since day one. Apple has yet to officially comment on these reports. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

James and Bethany Modisette’s daughter Moriah was killed when Garrett Wilhelm, 22, smashed into the back of their car on Christmas Eve 2014. facebook 5 James and Bethany Modisette, who lost a daughter in a horrifying car crash gofundme 5 Moriah Modisette, a 5-year-old girl who died in the incident He was using the app Facetime whilst speeding along the road at 65 miles per hour and is now facing manslaughter charges. But the Modisette family are also suing Apple for an undisclosed sum over allegations that it should have installed a system on all iPhones to stop people from using the devices whilst at the wheel of a car. In legal documents filed in California, the couple alleged that Apple was liable for the crash because it patented a system to prevent “distracted driving” but failed to install it on iPhones. Apple’s patented technology effectively stops motorists from texting or using Facetime whilst they are driving by using GPS tracking to work out if they are travelling above a certain speed. “Defendant Apple has consistently and continuously failed to implement a safer, alternative design that would lock-out and prevent use of FaceTime while driving,” the court documents said. Wilhelm was driving a large Toyota 4Runner when he slammed into the back of the Modisette’s Toyota Camry. facebook 5 Garrett Wilhelm, who is now set to face manslaughter charges gofundme 5 Moriah Modisette was killed on Christmas Eve 2014 The impact spun the family’s car around, before Wilhelm’s large vehicle “continued its trajectory by rolling up and over the driver side of the Modisette’s car”. “This caused severe damage to the entire vehicle and such extreme damage to the driver’s side of the car that rescue workers laboured extensively to extract James and Moriah Modisette from their car.” Mum Bethany and her other daughter Isabella, who survived the crash, then “visibly and audibly witnessed rescue workers’ gruelling efforts” to remove James and Moriah from the wreckage. Moriah was airlifted to Cook Children’s Medical Center in Fort Worth, where she died from her injuries. James, Bethany and eight-year-old Isabella were treated in Denton Regional Medical Centre. In the court documents, it is alleged that Wilhelm told police at the scene that he was using Facetime before the crash. “Police located his iPhone at the crash scene with the Facetime application still active,” the Modisette family’s legal team wrote.

However, this functionality has still not been installed in iPhones. “The Apple iPhone 6 Plus that was a substantial factor in causing or contributing to cause this accident was defective because, at the time of the collision in question, no universal solution or ‘built in’ method of disabling the sending or receiving of text messages, emails, video calling services or any other notifications had been implemented by Apple Inc. for the iPhone,” the legal documents continued. “Despite both the technology since 2008 and a patent on that technology… defendant Apple Inc. has consistently and continuously failed to implement a safer, alternative design that would lock out and prevent use of Facetime whilst driving.” Driver caught on phone and watching tablet while driving in London rush hour We pay for your stories!

(Dmitri Lovetsky / AP) Rex HuppkeContact Reporter Greetings and welcome to Rex Huppke's third annual Surefire Guaranteed-Or-Your-Money-Back New Year's Predictions. As most of you know, I was born with the gift of precognition. (I knew that was going to make you roll your eyes.) Granted, my past prognostications have been described as "pitiful" and "laughably inaccurate," but critics tend to get hung up on silly details like facts and truth and the unnecessary trappings of reality. Was I wrong when I predicted that marijuana would be legalized nationwide in 2015, prompting Apple to release its first iBong? Not if you've been smoking a lot of marijuana. Surefire predictions for 2016: Trump Island, Kanye baby, sentient guns Rex Huppke SPOILER ALERT: I know everything that's going to happen in 2016.

Precognition is a talent I rarely draw attention to (it's listed way down on my LinkedIn page, under "Hobbies"), but given the importance of the coming year, I owe you all the benefit of my foresight. Here, then, are some of the things... (Rex Huppke) Was I incorrect when I foretold that in 2016, Donald Trump would deport himself and his followers to a small land mass in the South Pacific known as Trump Island? Given the rising popularity of fake news, I would say that prediction was spot-on. Regardless of how skeptics view my past prophecies, I assure you that this year's look ahead to 2017 will not let anyone down. So here we go: •President Trump will be impeached by March. The reason for his impeachment is foggy right now, but it will likely stem either from his decision to give Alaska to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a birthday present or the fact that the wall project along the U.S.-Mexican border will be running $50 billion over budget due to Trump's insistence that it be built with solid-gold bricks. Trump will respond to the impeachment by denying that he was impeached. He will then deny the existence of the word "impeach." The accuracy of that denial will be confirmed by the website Breitbart. After he is forcibly removed from the White House, Trump will deny that he was ever president. Breitbart will then post a story that Trump himself never actually existed, and the disgraced former president will vanish in an orange poof of logic. •Online retailer Amazon will begin using drones for a majority of its deliveries, blocking out the sun with the joyful high-pitched buzz of commerce.

Jackson) •Apple will release the highly anticipated iPhone 8, which the company will claim is both larger and smaller than previous models. Because that's a physical impossibility, consumers who buy the phone will receive empty boxes and, in order to remain on the cutting edge of hip Apple technology, will have to walk around staring at an empty hand or holding nothing to their ear while talking into the air. Passers-by, not wanting to seem out of touch, will comment on the nonexistent phones and say things like, "Oh, man, he's got the iPhone 8. It's so large and small simultaneously!" Users of the iPhone 8 will become wholly disconnected from the internet and remember how to use their minds, causing them to evolve into superior humans. They will use their newfound intellectual abilities to develop rudimentary flip phones, and the cycle will begin again. •Fake news will become the new real news, while real news becomes the new fake news. Those who embraced fake news and denounced real news during the 2016 presidential election will respond to this paradigm shift at first by sticking with fake news — which will be what used to be real news — and continuing to denounce real news — which will be what used to be fake news. Upon realizing they've been tricked, the fake news enthusiasts will switch to real news — which at that point will be fake — and begin denouncing fake news — which at that point will be real. In the ensuing confusion, Christmas will be celebrated in June and Batboy will be elected president of the universe.

(Nina Agrawal) •I will be locked up in a journalism gulag for predicting President Trump's impeachment. Breitbart will report that I never existed. The fact-checking website Politifact will rate that report "half-true," and CNN will spend half the year trying to find me. •The smartest investment of the year will end up being stock in the language software company Rosetta Stone, thanks in large part to relentless demand for its "Learn Russian" series. •Foodies will continue to find new and annoying ways to make food look weird and taste awful, leading to the inevitable legalization of state-licensed "foodie hunting." A cookbook titled "10 Mouth-Watering Ways to Boil a Foodie" will be the surprise publishing hit of 2017, with the biggest surprise being its popularity among foodies. 2016: A fantastic, marvelous, glorious year Tribune Opinion staff We asked readers what made 2016 a good year for them — and here’s what they said:  A surprising twist Early in 2016, I discovered that I had Stage 3 breast cancer.

It might be time to upgrade. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Q: My cable modem is a few years old. Do the manufacturers ever update these gadgets? A: Good question, because many people forget their modem even exists, unless there’s a power outage and they have to reboot. The short answer is yes; companies often upgrade their hardware every few years. As download speeds increase, companies have to provide more sophisticated modems. What you want to know is whether your modem is keeping up with the demands of your service. You can contact your cable company, of course, but you may be able to skip the phone call if you know what you’re looking for. Click here to learn about the DOCSIS 3.0 and whether your modem is up to speed. Using Apple for the first time Q: I just switched from Windows to Mac after using Windows for 20 years. Do you have any pointers for this new Apple user? A: Switching to Apple does take some adjustment. You’ll find a lot of things are similar, including many of the programs, but the layout and appearance can be dizzyingly different. You’re so accustomed to the “Start” icon and the “Insert” key that you wonder what you’ll do without them. Don’t worry: Apple is famous for its intuitive design, and you’ll figure everything out in no time. But there are certain tricks to help you through those first few days. Click here for three troubleshooting tips I give every newbie Mac user. USA TODAY Virtual standoff: Amazon Echo vs. Google Home Fixing a smart TV’s resolution Q: My smart TV’s picture isn’t as good as it used to be. What can I do to fix it?

Just like your digital photo software, you can change the brightness, contrast, and color of your screen. Click here to find out exactly how to improve your smart TV’s image quality. Help for a New Year’s resolution Q: I’ve never made a budget that I kept. But now that I am getting older, I really need to start managing my money. Help me so my parents stop lecturing me! A: The good news is that there are apps and programs to get you on the right path. But these don’t do all the heavy lifting. It's a lot of effort to keep track of every purchase that you make. I like to recommend different methods for tracking your finances, but all of them do one important thing: Let you visualize how much you're spending and saving every month. Click here for apps and programs to help you make a budget and stick to it. Quitting Facebook for good Q: I am done with Facebook. How can I delete my account? A: You’re not the first. Many people find Facebook overwhelming, especially in a breakneck and controversial year like 2016. Most Facebook users prefer to take a break for awhile, deactivating their account for days or even months. The advantage of deactivating is that you preserve all of your information, including photos and statuses, and you can switch it back on whenever you want. Fully deleting you account takes a little more time, but the process will erase every byte of data from your social media account. Click here for the steps to delete your Facebook account.

Subtly Pushing Back on U.S. Manufacturing? Read between the lines. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Dec 30, 2016 at 7:00AM Image source: Apple. Arguably more than any time in the past decade, the political pressure is on for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to bring back at least some of its manufacturing jobs from overseas. Beyond overtures from President-elect Donald Trump himself, his victory in November shows a resurgence of a nationalist mentality across large swaths of the U.S. population. The company is now tasked with navigating an increasingly complex political landscape while balancing its financial and operational needs, including the massive globalized supply chain infrastructure that it has built over the years. Apple can't just come out and say "no," even if it wants to. Yesterday, The New York Times published a thorough investigative report on Zhengzhou, China, known as "iPhone City." It's a great read for Apple investors, but if you read between the lines, you may notice the possibility that Apple could be subtly pushing back on the current political pressures. Pressure pushing down on me One of the ways that Apple has changed under CEO Tim Cook is that it is much more engaged with the media. Trading access for positive coverage is one of the oldest tricks in the media playbook, and Apple long played this game in spades under Jobs. But Cook implemented a major shift in communications strategy, hoping to make Apple more approachable. While Jobs used to hog the spotlight, Apple now regularly grants executive interviews with media outlets. Even if outright positive coverage isn't part of the deal, companies also often grant access in order to have at least some influence on the direction or tone of a story. That's why it jumped out to me that COO Jeff Williams was quoted directly in the report. "I was impressed," Williams said when discussing the early evolution of Apple's partnership with Foxconn. "They were very focused." It's a tiny snippet -- just seven words -- but that's not the point. The point is that Apple made Williams available, and in exchange was potentially able to have a say in how its China operations were portrayed. For the most part, the report is mostly descriptive, detailing the wide range of incentives that Foxconn scored to set up shop on Apple's behalf, as well as just how complex and developed the whole operation is. You get a sense that this is a massive machine that hums along, churning out one of the world's most popular products at mind-boggling volumes -- because it is. The tone is almost reverential. Compare that to the harshly accusatory tone that the Times took in 2012 in its iEconomy series, for which the publication won a Pulitzer Price for in 2013. For instance, even the headlines alone for some of the parts were fiercely critical: In China, Human Costs Are Built Into an iPad How Apple Sidesteps Billions in Global Taxes Apple's Retail Army, Long on Loyalty but Short on Pay If the headlines were that damning, you can only imagine how negatively the articles themselves portrayed Apple. (You should read the whole series if you haven't already.) Note that the reporter for yesterday's story, David Barboza, contributed to the iEconomy series. That brings a building down This is conjecture on my part, but it seems quite possible to me that Apple was able to favorably sway the tone of the report by contributing to it and granting executive access. There was no discussion about human rights concerns, which used to be an easy weakness to call out (even though Apple has made progress on that front since 2012). There's some discussion of tax avoidance near the end, but that part is mostly more of the same. Apple is extremely thoughtful, deliberate, and intelligent when it comes to influencing the media, so it's hard to chalk it up to coincidence. That's especially relevant if the takeaway is that Apple's manufacturing infrastructure is simply too massive and entrenched to move anywhere else. That fact may be obvious to most investors, but promoting the public perception (via a high-profile report at a reputable media outlet) that this is true could relieve a tiny bit of that political pressure.

Happy New Year firework wallpapers The top stories of the week on iDB How to use AirPods like a pro   skip to main content skip to main menu     Why Apple shouldn’t pass on the rumored Jet White iPhone 7 By Steffen Reich, Dec 30, 2016 Tweet 18 Comments On Tuesday, Apple afficionados were treated to a new wave of white shell iPhone 7 mock-ups and purported leaks hitting the internet, advancing the notion that the Cupertino-based company could plan to release a white counterpart to their Jet Black coating some time around March 2017. From an aesthetic standpoint, everyone is going to have their two cents on the necessity of it in the grand scheme of things. Simply by moving the discussion from the fashion sphere to the finance department though, the ambivalence in regard to whether or not this iPhone release is genuinely necessary quickly crumbles and clearly comes down on one side of the fence. As we will learn in late January, Apple’s first quarter of the fiscal year 2017 is going to look after itself nicely, but in view of the Q2 figures and a long summer following, Jet White definitely needs to happen. Two key reasons must be paid attention to in order to understand the imperative of a Jet White iPhone for a healthier bottom line in the fiscal year of 2017. Let’s kick this off by saying that by and large Apple is of course still flying incredibly high and unlike some, I am not going to exhibit the overbearing arrogance to tell you otherwise. With that out of the way, the Apple of late has seen quite a few hiccups and could be on the precipice of another negative record year. Yes the Q1 earnings report in January is going to look glorious for a variety of reasons (and good on Apple for that) with analysts predicting revenues of up to $76.96 billion – which would marginally best last year’s Q1 results – but that is hardly telling the whole story. The whole story namely comprises the fact Apple desperately needs that break, hopefully ending a negative streak of three quarters of year-over-year declines in revenue. The answer to whether or not this negative record can be broken we will learn soon enough, and does not hinge on the possible introduction of a Jet White iPhone 7 some time around March. Yet it is important to remember that in spite of the assumedly strong figures that will be published by the end of January, it is not all smooth sailing at Apple. The truth of the matter is that the drop from the beginning of the fiscal year 2017 to Q2 and Q3 could be steeper than ever, which is why the new coating would play a crucial role. Here are the two central points to substantiate my claim: Could this be the Jet White iPhone 7? pic.twitter.com/pHoDiZ63ON — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) December 27, 2016 The iPhone SE vacuum It somewhat befuddles me to think the iPhone SE happened this year, but it did see the light of day just this March. Accordingly, Apple had an absolute crowd pleaser in the pipeline for that critical Q2 spell following the holiday quarter. The SE succeeded at bolstering the sales revenue from March onwards, appealing to both Apple nostalgics and segments with less buying power. But where there is light, there is also plenty of shadow, because despite the additional revenue stream (let’s ignore product cannibalisation for simplicity), the drop in revenues from Q1’16 to Q2’16 has been appreciably steeper than the corresponding curve back in 2015. The graph following below visualises that by pitting quarterly revenues of the two years against each other. The green wedge is visible enough already, so just imagine the drop of the curve without the SE pulling its weight in 2016. What does that tell us about 2017? The gist is that not even the iPhone SE in 2016 could save Apple from continuing their quarterly year-over-year decline. Now imagine the additional revenue of a new introduction to the iPhone family in March breaking away altogether in 2017, and the impact this would have on the revenue curve. It is by no means a long shot to say that the dropout would be considerably worse than what we saw in April this year, when Apple reported a drop of $8 billion in revenue in year-over-year comparison for Q2 ($58bn in Q2’15 to $50bn in Q2’16). A white and shiny iPhone 7 fresh on the shelves to grab in March could counteract the trend of a back to back plummet in Q2. If Apple were to forfeit the chance of a white iPhone boost, I believe the Q2’17 numbers could dwindle down to a dismal $40 billion. Aside from the iPhone SE vacuum occurring in 2017, other variables need to be factored in to understand the seriousness of the descent we might face after peaking in late January: Apple Watch sales are still rocky (although we might get a glimpse of the potential of the Series 1 and 2 in January’s earnings report) and have gathered zero to negative momentum in 2016 (more on that later) and analysts are expecting the iPhone 7 euphoria to wane quicker than in previous years, eventuating in much lower shipment numbers in early 2017. With the shine coming off the iPhone 7 earlier than it did for its predecessors, the Jet White iPhone could be the lifeline Apple needs. Perhaps not to fully tide them over spring 2017, but at least to soften the blow. Botched product launches for Christmas No matter how hard Apple is going to try to put a spin on this, PR language can not gloss over the monumental fail the launch of the AirPods has been. At $159, the product must harvest margins that will make any Apple executive salivate. Add to it the fact that hundreds of millions of iPhone users are potential buyers and Apple really forewent a massive chunk of revenue for what they label ‘Other Products’. This category also contains Watch sales, which as touched on before evidently stagnated through 2016. I don’t mention the wearable at this point because I like to go off on a tangent, but rather because the slow rollout of Series 1 and 2 could be indicative of what the AirPods might suffer from as well: we do not know at what point AirPods are actually going to attain a fair market saturation, we are not privy to how bad the bottleneck situation is right now and how distant a future lies in which we can promenade into an Apple Store and grab a pair on a whim. The backlog could easily carry into Q2 and hamper the value of ‘Other Products’, which is going to be covered up by tremendous iPhone unit sales in Q1, but laid bare in Q2. Beats X are suffering an even grimmer fate, one where we know next to nothing about a possible release in 2017. Just like with the AirPods, this is going to be an accessory badly needed to counterbalance (as much as ‘Other Products’ worth $2-5 billion can offset dwindling iPhone sales) the sales revenue hit to be recorded in Q2’17. Besides, never mind the opportunity costs for Apple with those two big cash cows not providing the milk they could and should have if handled more professionally. As you can see in the data, ‘Other Products’ are a far cry from the worth of any other product category, even though they were designated to enjoy a huge growth spurt right about now. The botched launches are going to thwart that development for months into the fiscal year of 2017, again calling for an alternative product to iron out such shortcomings. This is again where the Jet White iPhone enters the scene, ideally coming to the rescue. In conclusion, those should be the two major motivations for Apple to launch Jet White in March. Another rather tongue in cheek point to consider is that the success story of iPhone 7 is in parts surely down to the simple fact that they were finally offered in new, black colors. Mind you, that is not to say the iPhone 7 boasted underwhelming specs, but at the end of the day visual stimuli often make or break purchase decisions. It has proven to work beautifully for iPhone 7 in 2016 and it would be smart business to make use of that strategy one more time next March.

Such a long essay for something so small Jay Fun fact. The iPhone 7 is merely a SE. 5, 5S, SE – same form factor, screen size with plenty of internal upgrades 6, 6S, 7 – copy & paste from above Nothing bad could come from releasing a new color, the more the merrier, and they would still sell plenty along with next years upgrade. MMA Rules Jay there’s a big difference from the 6 to the 7 in terms of internals, the 6 only had 1gb of ram and couldn’t even hold an app in the background plus camera, speed 3D Touch, etc. Same form factor though Jay The same difference from the 5 to the SE. The 7 is the iphone 6s’ “SE”. Im saying just how the se was completely reworked on the inside the 7 was reworked just as much from the 6, the fact the outside is still the same is my point of it being an SE. burge The SE was out before the 7 so the SE has nothing from the 7 in it. The SE has 5s, 6 and 6s parts Jay You missed the point. The 7 has iphone 6 screen resolution, form factor and external look on the front minus the headphone jack. burge And home button. You pointed out that the 7 is an SE of sorts. It’s not, Yes the 7 is not the device it should or could of been and apple have made a poor device but it’s not comparable to the SE at all. In spec wise you could class it with the 6s and that’s it. Jay I have a7, I upgraded from a 6. I also had a 5 and have personally used the SE. The upgrades internal feel the same. The home button isn’t really an upgrade from anything either. burge It feels the same because the devices operate exactly the same as each other. Be it on a bigger or smaller interface. The older devices are just a fraction slower on the newer OS. Yes the 7 is a poor device you’ll get no argument there from me, and I’m so glad that I didn’t purchase mine and it was a gift. The device itself looks fantastic but that’s about all I have to say about it. Mark S Well they need to do something for their slumping sales. zoLa siWisa Why are you worried though? burge It’s because thay get paid to do it. It’s called a job. Anonymous This is how dude gets paid. Just like what ever you do for a living. Shadowelite123 Technology is a beautiful thing. Business is also the same. No one is worshipping a phone except for the annoying fanboys you see for any kind of product. Like others have said, its a job they’re doing and whose to say that they dont love what they do? If they love what they do and they get paid for it too, isn’t that just as good as walking outside and smiling at the first three people you see? Do you not have any ambitions or dreams in your life? Natalie Whenever I see the word “Analyst” in any kind of tech related article I just wave it off as being f#cking obvious. These guys get paid to say “Apple will release a phone next year” Which is dumb in my opinion. Half the shit they say never comes to fruition anyway lol, Ignoring that stupid part of the article. It’s very possible that a Jet White iPhone is coming, Kinda makes sense ya know… Black, White, two colors that have been part of the iPhone line since the 2nd gen… You don’t need to be an Analyst to know that lol Shadowelite123 Thats not exactly true. Most things analysts say actually come to life. Rumors are separated into two categories: Analyst predictions and possibilities due to uncovered information such as patents and such. Not everything predicted will be guaranteed. This is because no one actually knows what will happen. Look at the sapphire glass screens we were supposed to see. Production was low and we weren’t able to see them come to life. Now GTAT is bankrupt i think. Things come up, thats life. We pretty much predicted nearly everything that the iPhone 7 models would have. Less than a handful of things didn’t show up.

Some of them could disappear if trade tensions rise under President Trump. Eric Jhonsa Dec 30, 2016 9:51 AM EST This article originally appeared on Real Money on Dec. 29, 2016. There already were good reasons to doubt the likelihood of Apple (AAPL) moving a significant percentage of its iPhone production to the U.S., even in the face of fresh political pressure to do so. A Thursday New York Times report provides fresh arguments. But the report also highlights just how much Apple, and perhaps some other U.S. tech giants dependent on Chinese manufacturing, have to lose if the status quo with China in terms of trade is disrupted in a significant way. In a lengthy expose that partly relies on confidential government records, the New York Times reviewed the many subsidies, tax breaks and infrastructure investments that support a massive iPhone plant run by top Apple contract manufacturer Foxconn in the city of Zhengzhou in east central China. The factory is capable of producing 500,000 iPhones per day, and accounts for about half of global iPhone production. Zhengzhou's government is said to have paid more than $1.5 billion to Foxconn to "build large sections of the factory and nearby employee housing," as well as develop needed roads and power plants. It helps cover energy and transportation costs, recruits workers and pays bonuses to Foxconn for hitting export targets. In addition, the local government provided Foxconn with breaks on corporate and value-added taxes, and cut social insurance and other worker payments required by Foxconn by up to $100 million per year. And the customs centers overseeing Foxconn's operation are in a special "bonded zone" subject to different import and export rules than most of China, which makes it easier for iPhones to be sold to Chinese consumers. It all makes for quite the public-private partnership, one whose scope makes the incentives provided to Carrier to keep an air conditioner plant in Indiana look quaint by comparison.

When will Apple wow the world again? By Shobhit Varma | Dec 30, 2016, 04.56 PM IST FacebookLinkedinTwitterGoogle+Reddit Continue reading 2016 hasn't been very kind to the once bulletproof company. The Apple Watch failed to set the market on fire, iPhone sales and revenues have been dropping every quarter, and the iPad range is flagging. The problem is that over the last few years, the excitement has been constantly waning, with Apple releasing iterative updates to the iPhone which are constantly behind the competition. 2016 saw many users becoming disillusioned with the company because of the lackluster iPhone 7/7Plus and the extremely mediocre iPhone SE, which was nothing but a repackaged iPhone 5. Let's take a look at what all Apple introduced in 2016: iPhone SE/iPad Pro The year started with the introduction of the iPhone SE and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Both products represented a company that had lost focus and was confused. By putting the Pro moniker on what was essentially nothing but the iPad Air 3, Apple made its iPad lineup extremely confusing and cluttered. Apple, which was known for simplicity and a streamlined product portfolio under Steve Jobs now had 5 different iPads being sold at the same time. The iPhone SE was another underwhelming and disappointing product from Apple. Many expected a new design in line with the iPhone 6 design ethos but Apple simply repackaged the internals of the iPhone 6S into the almost 2.5 year old iPhone 5 design. This again marked a move which was very unlike the Apple of old. WWDC: iOS 10, MacOS Sierra Apple's WWDC this year saw a lot of incremental updates to OS X(now macOS), watchOS, tvOS. Messages, Apple Maps, iOS 10, as well as complete overhaul of Apple Music. MacOS Sierra was an extremely underwhelming update. It’s only major feature was the introduction of Siri to the Mac, something which should have happened years ago. iOS 10 saw Apple playing catchup with Android without any new innovative stand out feature. Apple Music’s redesign was nice but stemmed out of the inherent usability problems with the original Apple Music layout. The overhaul of the Maps application finally made Apple Maps usable, but that should again have been the case from the get go. Apple CEO Tim Cook iPhone 7: The iPhone 6S in a new color! The iPhone 7 was the first time Apple didn't overhaul the design with the launch of a new numbered model. Most analysts suggest Apple did the same so as to introduce a new design with their tenth anniversary model next year. Even to the most ardent Apple fanboys, the iPhone 7/7 Plus were huge disappointments. With same three year old iPhone design, no major standout features and the huge bezels, the iPhone 7 came across more as a ’S’ version upgrade. Yes the updates to the camera, the dual telephoto lens in the 7 Plus and the waterproofing were fine, but they were all features we had already seen before from Android competitors. Apple’s decision to drop the headphone jack was the the final nail in the coffin for many. While the iPhone 7/7Plus are not bad smartphones, they failed to stand out from the crowd, especially in a year which saw great smartphones such as the the OnePlus 3/3T, Samsung Galaxy S7/S7 Edge and great products from Chinese companies like Xiaomi, Huawei and LeEco. Apple Watch: Lukewarm response 2016 has been a dismal year for smartwatches in general and even Apple’s mighty Apple Watch couldn’t change the tide. The sales of the Apple Watch were lukewarm at best and it wasn't the market success everyone thought it would be. The Series 2, with an updated processor, GPS and waterproofing abilities failed to bring anything exciting to the table and was what the Apple Watch should have been in the first place. Read : TechRadar India Special: BEST TECH OF 2016 MacBook Pro: The final nail in the coffin Apple finally updated it’s MacBook Pro range of laptops in November 2016. With the last comprehensive redesign of the MacBook Pro having been introduced in 2012, the new products were much anticipated by ardent Mac fans. However, the new MacBook Pro’s saw a lot of criticism from both critics as well as MacBook purists as they went against the very definition of a ‘Pro’ laptop. The removal of almost all legacy I/O ports, lack of an SD card reader, the underpowered internals and the shockingly bloated sticker price all contributed to the disappointment. The distinguishing feature of the new MacBook Pro lineup - the much leaked and anticipated TouchBar also received mixed reactions. Mac: The neglected member of the Apple family While 2016 finally saw an update to the MacBook Pro, the rest of the lineup has not seen an update in ages. Something which is very unlike the Apple of old which despite flagging sales, upheld Mac's status as a flagship product. The Mac Pro has not been updated in over three years. The Mac Mini has not seen a revision since 2014 and even the iMac is in dire need of new internals. Even the MacBook Air hasn’t seen an update in ages and it doesn't even seem likely that Apple will shower the Air some love anytime soon. Apple also discontinued the late 2012 MacBook Pro, which was a very popular as it was the last MacBook that allowed for user upgradable Ram and HDD without voiding the warranty. Apple is planning to set up retail stores in India Analysing Apple's financial performance The once bulletproof Cupertino company suffered a second straight quarter in earnings and revenue decline in Q2 2016. Apple's sales for the June quarter were $42.4 billion, with a net income of $7.8 billion. While those figures sound very impressive, that was a 27% drop over last year's figures, when Apple's sales for the same quarter were $49.6 billion. A drop of that proportion is extremely worrying, especially for a company like Apple. Focus on India and China With Apple witnessing a drop in iPhone sales for the second time in Q2 2016, the company started looking towards emerging markets like India and China for growth. Apple CEO Tim Cook visited India and opened up a development centre in Hyderabad and announced a iOS design centre in Bengaluru. Apple also wants to open retail stores in India in the future. And now the way is clear for Apple to do so due to the Indian governments new FDI rules which were announced back in June 2016. Final words As someone who himself is invested in the Apple ecosystem and uses his MacBook Pro and iPad Mini extensively, the situation is extremely worrying. 2016 saw me finally switching over to the Android camp after extremely lackluster iPhone updates. The company needs to pull itself together, realign its focus and streamline its product portfolio. By ignoring the Mac and it’s actual user base, Apple is at a risk of alienating its core customers. The iPad range is also flagging and needs a major strategic realignment. Long gone are the days when the iPhone set the market trends and showed everyone else how it's done. The iPhone has been playing catchup for too long and Apple needs to stop playing it safe and introduce something that wows the world again. What do you think? Can Apple pull out of the slump and prove doubters wrong in 2016? Sound off in the comments!

Print Email James Kratch | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By James Kratch | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 30, 2016 at 7:05 AM, updated December 30, 2016 at 7:33 AM comments EAST RUTHERFORD -- Eli Apple was not a Philadelphia Eagles fan growing up in South Jersey. He pulled for LaDainian Tomlinson and the San Diego Chargers. But the Giants rookie still had a good view of the damage DeSean Jackson has dished out to his team with the Eagles and Washington Redskins.  SLO-MO: Odell Beckham Jr. during pregame - Giants vs. Eagles "Yeah, of course," Apple said. "The Miracle at the Meadowlands No. 2, that's what they like to call it? I'm familiar with that. I watched it live. It was a crazy moment." What would be even more crazy: Jackson, whom Apple and the Giants will encounter again in Sunday's regular season finale against Washington, finding his way back to Philly in the offseason as a free agent, as is rumored. "I think they would welcome him," Apple told NJ Advance Media. "Because he's a good player, of course, and their receiving corps has been struggling a little bit this year." That's for down the road, though. Jackson, one of the all-time Giant killers, is focused on the task at hand. The Redskins must win Sunday's game to make the playoffs. With a playoff spot locked up, Apple and the Giants don't need to win, but they don't want Jackson to go off on them, either. "He's probably the best deep threat in the league," said Apple, although teammate Janoris Jenkins may think otherwise. "He's good at kind of slowing his tempo down, and then picking it up, changing it up. He's really smart. He can set defenders up one way, and go the opposite direction." How Cousins has transformed Or, as safety Landon Collins put it: "He kind of lulls guys to sleep. He doesn't use his actual speed when he is running his routes and stuff like that. "And then when he knows he is about to go deep, he hits it, and hits you while you are asleep basically, and he gets behind you. Kirk (Cousins) just has to throw it up, and he will go get it." Jackson has 61 catches for 1,017 yards and six touchdowns in 15 games against the Giants, with four of the scores on plays 44 yards or longer. Jackson also has run back two punts for touchdowns against the Giants, the last his infamous walk-off in 2010 in the Eagles' stunning 38-31 comeback win. "That's someone you've always got to have eyes on, or make sure where he's at on the field," Apple said.  Jackson enters Sunday's game with a head of steam, too. He's had 100-plus receiving yards in four of his last five games. If Jenkins is limited or does not play Sunday, Apple may see a lot of Jackson. The rookie was injured after just nine snaps against the Redskins in the Giants' 29-27 loss in Week 3. So he didn't get to compete much against a player he has long admired. "I still have fun watching him. He's somebody that was one of my favorite players growing up, even back to his days at Cal (in college)," Apple said. "So I've got a lot of respect for him as a player. It's going to be fun going against him. I'm looking forward to it." TALK IS CHEAP, E78: Should Giants rest starters in Week 17?

Subtly Pushing Back on U.S. Manufacturing? Read between the lines. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Dec 30, 2016 at 7:00AM Image source: Apple. Arguably more than any time in the past decade, the political pressure is on for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to bring back at least some of its manufacturing jobs from overseas. Beyond overtures from President-elect Donald Trump himself, his victory in November shows a resurgence of a nationalist mentality across large swaths of the U.S. population. The company is now tasked with navigating an increasingly complex political landscape while balancing its financial and operational needs, including the massive globalized supply chain infrastructure that it has built over the years. Apple can't just come out and say "no," even if it wants to. Yesterday, The New York Times published a thorough investigative report on Zhengzhou, China, known as "iPhone City." It's a great read for Apple investors, but if you read between the lines, you may notice the possibility that Apple could be subtly pushing back on the current political pressures. Pressure pushing down on me One of the ways that Apple has changed under CEO Tim Cook is that it is much more engaged with the media. Trading access for positive coverage is one of the oldest tricks in the media playbook, and Apple long played this game in spades under Jobs. But Cook implemented a major shift in communications strategy, hoping to make Apple more approachable. While Jobs used to hog the spotlight, Apple now regularly grants executive interviews with media outlets. Even if outright positive coverage isn't part of the deal, companies also often grant access in order to have at least some influence on the direction or tone of a story. That's why it jumped out to me that COO Jeff Williams was quoted directly in the report. "I was impressed," Williams said when discussing the early evolution of Apple's partnership with Foxconn. "They were very focused." It's a tiny snippet -- just seven words -- but that's not the point. The point is that Apple made Williams available, and in exchange was potentially able to have a say in how its China operations were portrayed. For the most part, the report is mostly descriptive, detailing the wide range of incentives that Foxconn scored to set up shop on Apple's behalf, as well as just how complex and developed the whole operation is. You get a sense that this is a massive machine that hums along, churning out one of the world's most popular products at mind-boggling volumes -- because it is. The tone is almost reverential. Compare that to the harshly accusatory tone that the Times took in 2012 in its iEconomy series, for which the publication won a Pulitzer Price for in 2013. For instance, even the headlines alone for some of the parts were fiercely critical: In China, Human Costs Are Built Into an iPad How Apple Sidesteps Billions in Global Taxes Apple's Retail Army, Long on Loyalty but Short on Pay If the headlines were that damning, you can only imagine how negatively the articles themselves portrayed Apple. (You should read the whole series if you haven't already.) Note that the reporter for yesterday's story, David Barboza, contributed to the iEconomy series. That brings a building down This is conjecture on my part, but it seems quite possible to me that Apple was able to favorably sway the tone of the report by contributing to it and granting executive access. There was no discussion about human rights concerns, which used to be an easy weakness to call out (even though Apple has made progress on that front since 2012). There's some discussion of tax avoidance near the end, but that part is mostly more of the same. Apple is extremely thoughtful, deliberate, and intelligent when it comes to influencing the media, so it's hard to chalk it up to coincidence. That's especially relevant if the takeaway is that Apple's manufacturing infrastructure is simply too massive and entrenched to move anywhere else. That fact may be obvious to most investors, but promoting the public perception (via a high-profile report at a reputable media outlet) that this is true could relieve a tiny bit of that political pressure.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) is synonymous with novelty, innovation and appeal. The company was named the most innovative company by the Boston Consulting Group in 2015, topping the list every time since 2005 Among the many compelling and innovative products that have rolled out of Apple's stable, the iPhone stands tall. iPhone, as with any Apple product, had a long incubation period and was shrouded in secrecy until it was launched in 2007. The product has had so many iterations over the years, with the latest version to be launched being the iPhone 7, which was released in September. Work on the original iPhone began in 2004, when Apple hired about 1,000 employees to work on the project which was then code-named as Project Purple. The executives roped in to develop iPhone included Jonathan Ive, currently Apple's Chief Design Officer, and Scott Forstall, who oversaw the software development. On Apple founder Steve Jobs' direction, the product design was moved to a phone and away from a tablet. Spending about $150 million, the company created the iPhone in collaboration with Cingular Wireless, which has now become part of AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T). The First iPhone Event in 2007 The first iPhone event was held on January 9, 2007, and Jobs announced the iPhone to the world in an hour-long speech. Terming it as a revolutionary product, Jobs introduced it as a combination of three devices, namely a widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary phone and a breakthrough Internet communicator. Magic of Multi-touch Introducing the multi-touch technology, Jobs said, "We have invented a new technology called multi-touch. It works like magic, you don't need a stylus, far more accurate than any interface ever shipped, it ignores touches, mutli-finger gestures, and BOY have we patented it!" Stunning Design & Features Jobs said that the iPhone would run on OS X, which does multi-tasking, networking, power management, graphics, security, video, graphics, audio core animation etc. The design of the original iPhone such that it had only one button, the home button, a 3.5 inch screen, with very high resolution. Other features revealed in the event were a two megapixel built-in camera, a headset jack, SIM tray, sleep-wake switch, speaker, mic input and iPod connector. Jobs also spoke of some stuff, which are not visible, including three advanced sensors. Killer Apps Jobs demoed making calls and explained features such as favorites, visual voicemail, multiple SMS conversations and photos. Coming to Internet communications device, Jobs pointed to the rich HTML emails, which work with any IMAP or POP3 e-mail service. Safari browser was used on the first iPhone. Additionally, it had Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Maps as well. Jobs also showed off the widgets, which communicate with the Internet over WiFi and EDGE. Pricing & Availability Initial models, included a 4GB model priced at $499 and a 8GB model at $599. Jobs said then the product was to be shipped, beginning in June 2007. IPhone was to be launched in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2007 and in Asia in 2008. Despite its innovative appeal, Apple trails Samsung in terms of its share in the smartphone market. IDC's data pitches Samsung's market share at 21 percent in the third quarter of 2016 compared to Apple's 12.5 percent. Apple has come a long way since its first iPhone, and the world now waits with bated breath for the iPhone 8.

Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations TechEye Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations Menu Consumer Reports will not bow to Apple pressure Posted on December 30, 2016 by Nick Farrell - News The nonprofit outfit Consumer Reports is standing by its damning verdict on the MacBook Pro and is refusing to print testing results from the Apple marketing department instead. Apple, and its legends of fans in the Tame Apple Press, was insisting that Consumer Reports re-run its tests until they are similar to those Apple uses in its advertising. Apparently, that is how IT product testing is done in the US these days. However CR has said it doesn’t think re-running the tests will change anything and it is standing by them. It said that experiencing very high battery life on MacBooks is not unusual for us – in fact we had a model in our comparative tests that got 19 hours. We confirmed our brightness with three different meters, so we feel confident in our findings using this equipment. Finally, we monitor our tests very closely. There is an entry logged every minute, so we know from these entries that the app worked correctly, it added. Apple’s VP of Marketing, Phil Schiller said the company was working with the magazine to understand the review. Schiller insisted that Consumer Reports’ findings didn’t resonate with their “extensive lab tests or field data.” Apple must have been stunned. This was the first time that Consumer Reports hasn’t recommended a MacBook Pro model. The review said that battery life on the new MacBook Pro was all over the place, hitting 19 hours in a test, but less than four hours in another. Apple could not believe that it was at fault and it must have been those pesky people in the press getting their reviews all wrong. It also confirms complaints that some users have had with the notebook. A report on Bloomberg earlier this month claimed that Apple had faced challenges with an improved battery module on the new MacBook Pro and it settled with older battery technology to meet the holiday shipping target.

Most Galaxy Note 7 owners reportedly didn't switch to iOS because Apple lacks a "wowing product."  ( Spencer Platt | Getty Images ) Advertisement Samsung had a tough year with two Galaxy Note 7 recalls, but fans stuck by its side because Apple didn't offer anything truly exciting, a new report indicates. Apple has long been criticized over a lack of innovation with its recent products and a new report suggests that Galaxy Note 7 owners stuck with Samsung particularly for this reason — the lack of a better alternative. While Apple ruled holiday shopping with the most device activations and app downloads and installs, beating Samsung to the punch, it's expected to experience some phone fatigue after the holiday rush dies down. Hardware analyst Stephen Baker has now commented on the holiday sales stats for the two dominant smartphone makers, offering an interesting take on the matter. Apple Lacks A "Wowing Product" In a recent report on The Wall Street Journal, Baker notes that Galaxy Note 7 owners remained loyal to the Samsung brand despite the whole fiasco surrounding two recalls over exploding batteries because Apple failed to offer notable innovation with its 2016 smartphone lineup. Consequently, although Apple was expected to reap hefty benefits from the Galaxy Note 7 recall, most Galaxy Note 7 owners stuck with Samsung and preferred to get another Samsung smartphone rather than the iPhone 7. "Most of those who bought or wanted to buy a Note 7 opted for a different high-end Galaxy phone," says Baker. "Samsung was able to fend off other Android competition, and Apple, too, thanks to Apple's own lack of a wowing product this year." As a reminder, Samsung officially stopped selling the Galaxy Note 7 back in early October, gearing up to recall the product for the first time over exploding battery issues. Even back then, analysts predicted that Samsung fans would remain loyal despite the recall, as they had confidence in the brand as a whole. Last month, a Reuters/ Ipsos survey bolstered such claims, revealing that the Samsung brand remained strong even after a second Galaxy Note 7 recall. In the meantime, Samsung went one step further and deployed a kill switch to permanently disable any remaining Galaxy Note 7 units, but it seems this hasn't shattered consumers' faith in the brand either. In this gloomy Galaxy context, many expected Samsung users to shift their brand loyalty and switch boats to Apple's side, Samsung's main rival on the smartphone market. Analysts believe that consumers' loyalty to Samsung's brand is not only due to Samsung, but also to the fact that Apple's latest iPhones lack a compelling enough feature set to warrant the switch. Apple has been criticized for failing to innovate in recent years, especially since Tim Cook took over as CEO after the iconic Steve Jobs passed away. On this note, it seems that not even exploding Galaxy Note 7 handsets managed to convince Samsung fans to change ecosystems and buy an iPhone instead of a Galaxy smartphone. Decade-Long Malaise As MacRumors points out, earlier this month financial company Oppenheimer highlighted Apple's current state and noted that the company's first revenue decline since 2003, combined with disappointing consumer reception ranging from mixed to negative, could lead to a "decade-long malaise" if it doesn't come up with something to turn things around. It remains to be seen how things will pan out but at the current rate, Samsung fans apparently don't find the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus appealing enough to switch to iOS.

Instead of the usual tick-tock cycle where each ’S’ release is followed by a brand-new design, the new iPhone models look pretty similar to their counterparts from the previous two years, and sport nearly identical dimensions. There are more changes than there are in a typical ‘S’ cycle, but if you have a Rose Gold iPhone 6s or a Silver iPhone 6 Plus, for example, the differences may not be apparent at first glance. In a world in which a device’s reception is driven by its looks, it was no surprise that the initial reaction to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus was lukewarm. Apple didn’t help matters with the "courageous" move of dropping the headphone port, with everyone and their friend Jack outraged even before anyone had a chance to test the impact of the move in the real world. So how do the new iPhone models stack up against their predecessors and competing flagships from the Android world? Like last year, we’ve spent more time than we do with most phones before sharing our thoughts with you, and here’s our review of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus design As we mentioned earlier, the new iPhone models can easily be mistaken for their predecessors at first glance. The most visible change is that two of the antenna lines that marred the otherwise beautiful design of the previous iPhone models have been removed. The ones that remain are flush with the top and bottom edges, making them a lot less prominent than before; in fact, on the Black and Jet Black variants they are all but invisible. Which brings us to another break from tradition - the launch of not one, but two new colours. Gone is our previous favourite Space Grey, replaced with two great new options – Black, and the rather imaginatively named Jet Black. While the former has the same classy, understated matte finish as before, the latter features a glossy finish that makes it a bit of fingerprint magnet. Jet Black iPhone 7 This year, we received a Black iPhone 7 Plus and a Jet Black iPhone 7 as our review units. We spent our initial days alternating between using the two as our primary phones, before we ultimately settled on the iPhone 7. This was down to two reasons. First, the Jet Black finish itself. As we stated in our Sony Xperia XZ review, the Jet Black finish gives the best in-hand feel we’ve experienced with a mobile device. The finish has just the right balance between grip and smoothness. In comparison, the Black finish on our iPhone 7 Plus felt a bit too boring. Of course as someone who’s looking to buy a new phone, you can get the Jet Black finish in both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, so this won’t be a factor for you. Second, as we will discuss through the course of the review, the differences in performance and features between the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus isn’t the same as between iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, so apart from the slightly cramped typing experience (we were using the iPhone 6s Plus as our primary device before), we didn’t feel like we were ‘settling’ for the smaller iPhone. Now we admit part of the appeal of the iPhone 7 could be our nostalgia for smaller phones in a world where every other new release seems to be pushing the envelope on how big a phone can get. Back to the Jet Black finish, and fingerprints are not the only thing it attracts - as Apple itself points out on its website, the new finish is more scratch-prone than others. Since we love the finish so much, and have never been fans of cases, we used the iPhone 7 without any protection for the duration of our testing, and for most of this time we couldn’t see what the fuss was about. Despite using it as our primary device for over two months, we didn’t notice any scratches on our Jet Black iPhone 7 - until we saw our unit under a particular light and then dozens of tiny scratches at the back suddenly became visible! Thankfully, this wasn’t a case of not being able to un-see something after having seen it. We went back to business without really being bothered, but if you are someone who worries about the resale value of your phone, this is something you might need to keep in mind. Typing on the iPhone 7 felt just a little bit cramped iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus display Have you ever ordered something online only to find that the colours don’t quite match what you saw on your screen when it arrives? Don’t blame the store, blame the limitations of technology. Not many realise this, but the colours that you see on screen - whether it’s your mobile, laptop, or any other device - are only a visual approximation of real colours. In fact, no electronic device is capable of accurately representing the entire range of colours that occur naturally. Every display and even devices like cameras, which are used to capture colour information, have an associated colour profile that defines the range of colours (aka colour space) that they can display or capture. To ensure interoperability across devices, colour profiles have been standardised, and the most popular one is called sRGB. This is used by most displays (computer and mobile), cameras, printers, and other devices. Let’s take the example of an image where you have multiple shades of red - for example a gradient that goes from an extremely dark shade of red to the lightest possible red. While in the real world you will see this as a continuous stream of colour with virtually infinite strains of red in between, while capturing this information, your sRGB camera is limited by the number of red shades available in its colour space. This means that every pixel that doesn’t have a corresponding exact match in the sRGB colour gamut is replaced by its closest match. This is the main reason why gradients never look as smooth on our screens as they do in the real world. Like we mentioned earlier, we haven’t been able to make devices that accurately capture 100 percent of the colour information available in the real world, but there are devices that can capture more colour information than the sRGB colour space, minimising the inaccuracies introduced by digitisation. One such colour space is the DCI-P3 colour space that has a 25 percent larger colour gamut than sRGB, which means the approximation of colours that it offers is closer to the real world than what you get with standard sRGB devices. Now it’s important to understand that just having a display that supports the wide-colour gamut doesn’t mean you will see images and colours that are closer to the real world - the picture that you are seeing should’ve been captured using the wide colour profile to begin with. If your camera or scanner approximated the colours down to the sRGB colour space while capturing the image, there’s nothing your fancy wide display can do to offer a better viewing experience. This long-winded explanation is a precursor to tell you that while the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have wide colour gamut displays (as Apple calls them), it doesn’t really make much of a difference in most day-to-day situations since most visual information is still being captured in the sRGB colour space. This means that most of the time the P3-capable displays are rendering a sRGB image, and it’s no surprise then that they look pretty similar to other displays. Even when you are viewing content that’s captured using the DCP-P3 colour space, you may not really notice the differences on the relatively small smartphone screen. This is further compounded by the fact that every smartphone out there uses colour matching techniques to display DCI-P3 content on its sRGB display, and every panel manufacturer may use a different algorithm to approximate the colours. Thrown in the differences in luminance, saturation, and other factors across screens, and there’s no saying which display will look the most ‘appealing’ to the naked eye. But Apple’s switch to the P3 colour space is about accurate colour reproduction and not how good the images look, and on that count the display on the iPhone 7 is said to be "virtually indistinguishable from perfect". As you would expect, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus’s cameras are capable of capturing information in the P3 space. While the new iPhone models as well as the latest MacBook Pro and iMac models will show these colours off in all their glory, you may not see them the same way while using any other phone or computer, unless of course your device is also listed to support the P3 colour space, like the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7. To be fair, these inaccuracies are unlikely to bother the Average Joe using any other smartphone, but purists can rejoice in the knowledge that the iPhone 7 can now accurately display 4K content that’s captured in the DCI-P3 colour space, just like many expensive new television sets. The displays on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus continue to way behind the competition when it comes to resolution and pixels per inch, but this hasn’t bothered us in the past, and using the new models was no different. Text still appears sharp, and pixelation was never a problem. The new displays are rated to be 625 nits bright, compared to 500 nits each in the earlier models; a difference that’s clearly visible when you, say, put the iPhone 7 Plus next to an iPhone 6s Plus. Suffice to say the displays on the new iPhone models are bright enough for any situation. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus performance and battery life The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus famously do away with a physical home button. Instead of a button that moves when pressed, you have a static, solid-state one that uses Apple’s so-called Taptic Engine to simulate the feeling of a button press, which makes the experience more natural for users. The change means there are fewer moving parts in the phone that can break, and Apple says this, in part, also made it possible for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus to be water resistant. While setting up your new iPhone, you are asked to choose an intensity level - 1, 2, or 3 - that determines the amount of ‘feedback’ you get from the fake button. We left it and 2 - the default - and it’s safe to say that the first few hours with the new home button were a little awkward. We weren’t quite sure how much pressure to put on the button to register a press, how to trigger the Reachability shortcut, how to double tap, etc. After missing a few actions the first day, we got used to the new home button and now we don’t feel there’s anything amiss - that is when the device isn’t powered off. When your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus is switched off, the ‘button’ has absolutely no feel to it, which is a bit unnerving to this day. The natural instinct is to try and press the home button, but if the device is off, nothing happens at all, and though it isn’t a big deal in the grand scheme of things, we felt it’s worth highlighting. Another thing to remember with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is that the new way to force restart them is to hold the power and volume down buttons, not the power and home buttons as with all previous iOS devices. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have the same Touch ID fingerprint scanner as the last generation models did, which we described as too fast for their own good. We’d stated in our review of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus that it might make sense for Apple to switch to AMOLED displays to partially mitigate this problem, so certain elements like time can be visible on screen without waking up the entire display. While that hasn’t happened (yet), Apple has done something in an attempt to tackle this very problem. The new iPhone models will wake when lifted, which eliminates the need to touch any buttons if you just want to wake up the phone’s display and see the time and notifications on the lock screen. This means you no longer have to touch the home button to see notifications. Still, picking up your phone can be more awkward than just tapping the home button in many situations, so we aren’t entirely convinced if we have a satisfactory solution yet. It’s worth pointing out that with iOS 10, Raise to Wake also rolled out to older iPhone models featuring the M9 motion coprocessor - the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone SE. An inconsistency seemingly related to the feature’s implementation across all models is that that the display doesn’t automatically wake up for all incoming notifications. We tried various combinations of apps and notifications to figure out situations in which the display wakes up automatically to show an incoming notification, and when it doesn’t, but we couldn’t identify a pattern. This was especially confusing when we were, for example, specifically waiting to hear from someone or waiting for an OTP to complete a transaction, and we had to raise the phone or press the home button to see that the message had indeed arrived without the display waking up at all. When it comes to raw performance, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are the fastest phones on the planet, period. Day-to-day performance is a breeze, and while we did experience minor stutters on the iPhone 7 Plus in the pre-iOS 10.1 days, we have had very little to complain about since we installed the update. The iPhone 7 never suffered from any of these niggles, and despite the fact that it lacks the marquee camera features – though it packs in all the important ones, as we will see in a bit - and has weaker battery life compared to its bigger sibling, it became our preferred phone out of the duo, as we stated earlier. This is largely down to the improved battery life on the iPhone 7 compared to the iPhone 6s, as it can last an extra couple of hours on 3G/ 4G networks. While the battery life on the latter was just about enough to last a day, we always had a certain amount of range anxiety when it came to the battery life of our iPhone 6s, and preferred the extra bit of insurance that the 6s Plus offered in that department. This hasn’t been the case with the iPhone 7, and while we would’ve obviously liked the battery life to be even better, those extra couple of hours seem to make a big difference. Though the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus should each last you a day on a single charge, if you are a heavy user, the bigger iPhone still has clear benefits. In our battery loop test, the iPhone 7 lasted just under 10 hours, while the iPhone 7 Plus with its bigger battery but higher-resolution display lasted just over 10 hours. But in real-world usage, the iPhone 7 lasted us a day of moderate to heavy usage, while the iPhone 7 Plus had some juice left in the tank even at the end of busy days. The two phones performed identically in all our benchmarks, and blew the competition out of the water in most of them. In AnTuTu, the two phones scored over 176,000, way ahead of the likes of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and the Google Pixel XL. Only the much newer OnePlus 3T comes close, but it still scored nearly 2000 points less than the iPhone 7 Plus in our tests. We saw similar numbers with Geekbench’s single-core test, in which Apple’s offerings were an order of magnitude ahead of all other phones (including the OnePlus 3T). It was only in the Geekbench multi-core tests that they finished second-best to Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. If the browser-based tests like JetStream, Octane, and Basemark Web 3.0 had been boxing matches, they would have been stopped in round one, with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus declared clear winners. Apple fixed our biggest complaint with the previous generation iPhone models by finally bumping the internal storage on the base model to 32GB. Interestingly, the iPhone 7 Plus has 3GB of RAM while the iPhone 7 makes do with 2GB (though you won’t find any mention of this on Apple’s website, in typical Apple fashion). This does not seem to make any meaningful difference to the day-to-day performance of the two iPhone models - in fact our experience with the bigger iPhone 7 Plus was marginally worse, as described earlier. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus now have stereo speakers, at the top and bottom of the display. The left/ right channels swap around as you rotate the phone, and the top speaker takes the role of the right channel when you are looking at your phone in the portrait mode. Apple claims that the speakers deliver output that’s twice as loud as the ones in previous-generation iPhone models, and our experience was in line with this claim. Both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus support VoLTE out of the box and worked just fine with the Reliance Jio network for calling and data during our tests. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are "splash, water, and dust resistant", rated to survive for up to 30 minutes when submerged up to 1m deep, but the warranty doesn’t cover water damage. We’d advise you not to take them swimming with you, but feel free to use them around the pool. The other big change with the new iPhone 7 models is of course the missing 3.5mm jack. Millions of lines have already been written on the subject - many of those on this site itself - so we won’t go into the pros and cons of the move, but instead focus on what our experience was like during the review period. As far as audio quality is concerned, the Lightning EarPods are no different to the EarPods that shipped with the previous generation iPhone models. We’ve been asked whether users need to muck around with any settings to get them to work, and the answer is no - audio starts playing through the EarPods as soon as you plug them into the iPhone 7’s Lightning port, just like regular headphones. The obvious downside of this is the fact that you can’t charge your phone and listen to music - or perhaps more significantly for some, take a hands-free call privately - if your phone is being charged. We missed this ability exactly once during our two-month old review period, and that didn’t really feel like enough of a reason to invest in third-party accessories that solve this problem. Your mileage may certainly vary, and it’s possible that you’ll end up being frustrated more frequently. If so, you will need to buy accessories, which is of course expensive, and might create new problems such as having one more thing to carry around - or you can choose to go wireless, again at a cost. If you are an audiophile, you likely already have a collection of third-party headphones, which may now need the bundled dongle to be useful. Interestingly, our lengthy review period made us realise that the problem works in reverse as well. Once we got used to travelling with only our Lightning EarPods, we ran into a couple of situations. On a flight, for example, we found ourselves staring at a 3.5mm jack, unable to do anything. We faced the same problem whenever we sat in front of our MacBook as well. Apple ships a dongle with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which lets you use your 3.5mm headphones with the new iPhone 7 models, but there’s no adaptor that will let you use your Lightning EarPods with a ‘legacy’ device. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus cameras Each year’s iPhone has traditionally been that year’s best camera phone, but that wasn’t necessarily true for the iPhone 6s Plus, the flag-bearer of the previous generation when it comes to camera performance. As we noted in our review, while it captured great photos in most situations, its low-light performance didn’t quite match what we got from Samsung’s competing offerings. Perhaps for the first time, Apple needed to play catch-up when it comes to camera performance, and as a result, this year’s models both have major changes to the optics. Though the rear camera is still rated at 12 megapixels, the iPhone 7 has a brand new sensor with an f/1.8 aperture, six-element lens, and optical image stabilisation - a feature that was only present in the bigger iPhone model last year. While the f/1.8 aperture is an improvement over last year’s f/2.2 aperture, it’s still not as good as what you get with the likes of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge which can go down to f/1.7, meaning its sensor can let in more light than the iPhone’s. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve undoubtedly heard that the iPhone 7 Plus has a dual camera setup. While most manufacturers have used the additional rear camera sensor to capture depth information, and some others have used it to capture black and white information to improve contrast and definition, Apple has gone with a slightly different approach. The iPhone 7 Plus has the same wide-angle f/1.8 lens seen on its smaller sibling, but also packs a second f/2.8 telephoto lens that allows for 2x optical zoom. iPhone 7 Plus at 1x iPhone 7 Plus at 2x zoom The camera app on the iPhone 7 Plus acknowledges this change with a new on-screen button towards the bottom. By default this reads 1x, which means you are using the regular lens. Tap on it and it changes to say 2x, which means you are now using the 2x telephoto lens. If you tap the button and hold it briefly, you are presented with a circular slider-like interface where you can choose the zoom level between 1x and 10x at 0.1x intervals (anything beyond 2x is digital zoom, obviously). Between, 1x and 2x zoom, the software supposedly combines images captured by both lenses to create a fused image, though the exact lens that is used at any zoom level depends on a variety of factors including the amount of available light. The telephoto lens gives you the convenient option of getting a closer look at subjects you are a little distance away from, without having to resort to cropping later. We found it particularly handy when attending events where someone was presenting on a stage as we sat in the audience, and were extremely happy with the results. As far as image quality is concerned, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus certainly benefit from Apple’s new image sensors, and the pictures we took in daylight looked natural, with best-in-class colour reproduction and plenty of detail. Low-light performance was also much better compared to the previous-generation iPhone models, but still marginally behind that of the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, which always manages to surprise us with the amount of light its sensors are able to capture even when it seems dark to the naked eye. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus did manage to capture more colour information compared to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and Google Pixel XL, though overall we found low-light images taken with the Samsung phone the best. Tap to see full-sized iPhone 7 Plus camera samples The iPhone 7 packs in optical image stabilisation, a first for the smaller model, which means that performance on the two iPhone models is identical, apart from features that the secondary sensor enables. This means that unlike previous years, you don’t have to settle for worse camera performance when you pick the smaller iPhone. Having said that, the dual-camera mode on the iPhone 7 Plus enables another cool party trick - Portrait Mode. Available since the iOS 10.1 update, this feature lets you blur the background of a photo to get a cool bokeh effect, traditionally associated with DSLR cameras. It’s available as one of the modes (like Photo, Video, Panorama) in the Camera app on the iPhone 7 Plus, and you can see an approximation of how an image will come out. The app also tells you if you are too close to the subject for the mode to be effective. In practise, Portrait Mode has limitations that, while understandable, may not be evident to everyone who uses the app. For example, if the person whose picture you are trying to take is standing with multiple objects at different distances behind them, the results are not very effective. This is also the case if the subject and background are of roughly the same colour. When Portrait Mode works though, the results are quite good, and you would love to share them on social media. The app saves two versions of each Portrait Mode image - the standard image, and another with the depth effects applied. iPhone 7 Plus regular image - tap to see full size iPhone 7 Plus Portriat Mode effect in action - tap to see full size The Camera app is pretty much what you’ve seen on earlier iPhone models. The one new option (introduced in iOS 10.2) that some may find useful allows the Camera app to remember the last Mode (e.g. Video/ Square etc.) and Filter (e.g. Chrome) that was applied, instead of automatically resetting the options to Photo and None respectively. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus both have quad-LED True Tone flashes, compared to the previous models’ dual-LED ones, and this is one of the most effective, least overbearing camera phone flash implementations we’ve come across. The screen flash on the front camera is another one of our favourite features, lighting up faces in a natural way even in completely dark settings. Talking about the front camera, there are improvements like a bump to 7-megapixel sensor (compared to 5-megapixel), and full-HD video recording, compared to 720p seen on the iPhone 6s generation. As you would expect, the front camera also adds wide-gamut support, as well as auto image stabilisation. The front and rear camera now also support body and face detection (compared to only face detection in previous generation iPhone models), and you can use the optical zoom on the bigger 7 Plus during videos too. Other than that, the experience is pretty much identical to that with the previous generation iPhone models. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus software The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus come with iOS 10 out of the box, and while we’ve explored the new features elsewhere, let’s briefly touch upon some of them here. Perhaps the first thing you will notice is that the iconic Slide to Unlock is now gone; replaced by the initially confusing Press home to unlock. While this took some getting used on our previous-generation iOS devices, it feels a lot more natural on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus thanks to the redesigned home button. The other big change on the lock screen is the introduction of widgets. Swipe right and you will be greeted by a list of widgets, which were earlier restricted to the Notification Centre. The notifications that you see on the lock screen are also richer, letting you do a lot more than before. Whether you just want to check some information via the widgets or quickly respond to a message or an email, there are fewer reasons to unlock your iPhone. Of course this means you are potentially exposing a lot more information than before to anyone who might have physical access to your device, even without unlocking it. Thankfully, iOS has always had the ability to control the kind of notifications that are displayed on the lock screen, and you can obviously choose the widgets you want to see as well. You can also disable lock screen widgets completely if you want. Another big change that you might or might not notice is the ability to ‘uninstall’ some of the stock apps that iOS devices ship with. If you’ve ever looked at, say, the Stocks app or the Podcasts app, and thought you don’t have any use for them, there wasn’t really a way of getting rid of them from your device. What most people ended up doing is creating a folder (hello Apple Junk) that became the dumping ground for all such apps. Now, you don’t need the folder anymore; you can simply remove these apps like you’d remove any others. There are still a few things you need to remember though. First, when you uninstall an app, you are not really removing it from the device - the only thing that gets removed is its icon. This means you won’t free up any space on your device, which is a bit of a shame. On the flipside, if you ever want those apps back, just search for them on the App Store and they will ‘install’ in seconds. Lock screen widgets (left) and what happens when you tap a 'mailto' link with the Mail app uninstalled (right). Second, while you can uninstall most of Apple’s apps including the likes of Mail, some apps deemed critical to the operating system’s functioning cannot be removed. These include Phone, Messages, Settings, Camera, Photos, and Clock. While the ability to remove apps like Mail is nice, iOS still doesn’t let you set up a third-party email client like Gmail as your ‘default’ (aka handler of the ‘mailto:’ protocol), which is rather unfortunate. If you have uninstalled Mail and happen to click on a ‘mailto’ link, you will be greeted with a dialog that prompts you to again download the Mail app from the App Store. While Apple has taken steps towards opening up its mobile operating system since to the early days of iOS, it would be nice to finally have the ability to choose a default browser, email client, mapping application, and, dare we say, voice-based assistant - the latter, we realise, might be a bridge too far. Apple has opened up iOS 10 a little bit more with Siri integration, Maps extensions, and CallKit extensions, with the latter enabling deep integrations like TrueCaller. Third-party developers can now extend the functionality of Apple’s virtual assistant in certain predefined ways, so for example, you can now use Siri to hail an Uber, or to send someone a WhatsApp message. Needless to say, developers need to update their apps to take advantage of this functionality, and a lot of popular apps have done so since iOS 10 was released. Maps extension let Apple Maps leverage data from third-party apps and even extend their functionality. Zomato, for example, offers an extension that lets you see results from Zomato’s database while you are using Apple Maps. Both Uber and Ola offer extensions that let you book a cab from within Apple Maps. These extensions are silently installed but disabled by default, and you need to manually enable them under Settings before you can start using them. Of course none of this will really matter to users in India, since there are no signs within iOS of Apple Maps data in the country becoming anywhere near as good as that of Google Maps, or even basic features like navigation being supported. iOS 10 brings a bunch of other features, some of which we’ve covered earlier like iMessage apps, enhanced use of 3D Touch (including the ‘X’ at the top of your notifications screen to clear all notifications), Universal Clipboard (which is a bit hit-or-miss in the real world), a revamped Music app, and enhanced QuickType predictive reactions. The Photos app has a new face recognition feature that tries to identify people and group your photos accordingly, similar to what you might have seen in other apps. Apple takes great pains to reassure customers that all analysis of your photos and private data happens locally on your own device, but looking at the results, we have to wonder whether that’s a good trade-off. For starters, the level of recognition that the Photos app achieves leaves a lot to be desired. We were left with multiple groups of photos for the same person, which means it failed to recognise the same person in different situations. We tried to merge groups, but since these results are not synced up to the cloud, we had to repeat this process all our other devices (Photos on Mac uses a similar approach). This is in contrast to, say, Google Photos, which does a much better job of identifying individuals across different photographs and also offers much more flexible search capabilities. In the Photos iOS app, you can only search for broad categories (e.g. Beach, Ball, Sculpture, etc.), apart from Places (each photo you click on the iPhone has location data), and the aforementioned People. Though Google Photos is a relatively new app, it builds on the cloud and machine learning expertise that Google has developed over the years, and feels a lot more mature than Apple’s. While we are on the subject, let’s thrown in another Photos-related complaint - we hate the fact there’s no way to share entire libraries between family members. Every time we come back from a trip, we find ourselves trying to remember whose iPhone we took that picture with; or at the end of the event, having to use AirDrop to quickly send photos to each other. Yes, Shared Photo Streams exist and they are great for sharing stuff selectively in certain situations, but we wish that iCloud Family Sharing had an opt-in common photo library and shared cloud storage quotas as well. While the cloud may not be Apple’s area of expertise, iOS remains the only platform that realistically offers security and the timely release of new features via software updates. The software update situation in the Android world shows no sign of improving; a stark contrast to the Apple side of things where a four-year-old iPhone 5 today receives updates the same day as Apple’s newest flagship phones. Verdict It might sound strange to say this when talking about the most valuable company in the world, but Apple doesn’t always get the credit it deserves for its engineering efforts. The A10 Fusion chip inside the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is a prime example of a company at the top of its game, and the way everything just comes together, especially on the iPhone 7, is nothing short of spectacular. We’ve been using the device for over two months now, and it still manages to delight us every single day. Yet, if you believe everything you read, you’ll come away with the impression that Apple is a marketing company that happens to be in the technology business, and its success is down to its ability to convince people to pay for its products, instead of any real technical acumen. Nothing could be further from the truth. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus cost a premium, but they deliver on almost every possible parameter, and they are certainly no stopgap before the rumoured tenth anniversary iPhone next year. Apple might of course wow us all next year by releasing something completely new and different, just like it did with the original iPhone, but that doesn’t take away from what you get from this year’s iPhone models right now - amazing performance, great cameras, good battery life, timely software updates, future-proof displays (in terms of colour, if not PPI), and a design that’s up there with Apple’s best efforts. If you are confused between the iPhone 7 and the 7 Plus or wondering which colour to get, we would like to put our weight behind the Jet Black iPhone 7. Yes, it gets scratched, but it’s a joy to hold - and use – every single day. The smaller iPhone’s camera now packs in the all-important optical image stabilisation feature, and the secondary lens isn’t reason enough for most people to pay a premium for the big iPhone. However, the extra RAM on the iPhone 7 Plus could theoretically make it more future-proof, especially if Apple’s rumoured move into the world of AR materialises, so you have a bit of a decision to make there. While there’s obviously a lot to love about Apple’s newest flagship phones, they aren’t perfect. The more time we spent with the iPhone 7, the more its bigger sibling seemed ungainly and just a tad bit slower in comparison. As we’ve mentioned before, Apple needs a reboot of the iPhone design to improve the screen-to-body ratio of its phones compared to other manufacturers – thankfully, rumours suggest we’ll get just that next season. We also wish the iPhone 7 had all of its bigger sibling’s features and specifications, so customers could choose between the two on size alone, and not worry about missing out on something - now, or in the future. The missing headphone jack didn’t bother us as much as we imagined it would, and it’s clear that Apple is pushing us towards a wireless future, even though its other big push for wireless audio hit a few bumps along the way. All in all, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus set the foundation for some fundamental technology like wide-gamut displays and wireless audio that will form a key part of Apple’s ecosystem going forward, and they do that while being compelling offerings in the present.

By Emily Bary Updated Dec. 29, 2016 11:44 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large ENLARGE Photo: Pixabay In a year when I lost my Apple Watch in a pool-table pocket and spent double what I needed to on Apple chargers, my biggest tech regret ended up being the $135 I dropped on a hunk of metal that was supposed to serve as a mobile hotspot. I like buying new tech products and searching for winning ideas, but that means I also wind up with a pile of duds from time to time. To save you from making the same mistakes I did, here are some of my biggest tech busts from 2016. More From Barron's NEXT How To Make a Budget — The Shortcut Version Can Bill Ackman Save Chipotle? Tesla and SolarCity Get Shareholder Approval…Here’s What it Means AT&T Velocity mobile hotspot I was pretty excited about the prospect of having a portable hotspot so I could work on my laptop while commuting -- and occasionally stream a football game on the train without blowing through my family’s shared data plan. The salesperson at Best Buy told me that AT&T’s Velocity hotspot was ultimately a better deal than Verizon’s version, the Jetpack. So I ponied up $60 for the device and $75 for a gift card that would buy me 8GB of data. A colleague later informed me that maxing out my existing cellular data plan would be a cheaper way to get extra GBs, especially since the hotspot also required buying the device itself. In the end, I couldn’t figure out how to use the gift card to pay for the data, so now I have a brick-like device that doesn’t even give me the Internet. Misusing the Apple Watch I made two mistakes the day my Apple Watch fell off into the pocket of a pool table, never to be seen again. The first was wearing an admittedly not so secure third-party watch band. I’ve tried out plenty of third-party bands, and I still haven’t stopped, but this was the only time the watch has ever fallen off. I didn’t know that the pool pocket was the culprit until remembering a day later that I had reached into the corner pocket for my scratched ball. I went back to the pool hall but by then the watch had disappeared. So, my second blunder was not making use of Apple’s Find My Apple Watch feature, which is actually pretty handy if used in time. If your Apple Watch still has a charge and is within range of your iPhone, you can arrange for the phone to ping the watch. Then you follow the sound. Amazon Fire TV Stick Desperate to watch Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Drunk History episode on a hotel TV with a friend, I had Prime Now deliver an $40 Amazon Fire TV stick within two hours (adding $8 for the delivery tip). I just wanted to hook up my laptop to the TV, but a $4 HDMI cable would’ve done the job for a lot less. And, it turns out, the remote for my Fire TV stick wouldn’t pair with the device itself, so I ended up having to get an HDMI cable anyway, while I waited for Amazon to mail me a replacement product. It was an expensive 20-minute episode of TV. Genuine Apple Chargers I outfitted my new apartment with $300 in new Apple chargers and cables. I could’ve gotten high-quality knock-offs for just $125 on Amazon.com. In particular, Anker’s 5-port USB charger makes for a nice, and cheaper, alternative to Apple’s own charger. The Anker one costs just $4 more, but you get four additional ports, so you can charge your iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch in the same place, at the same time. Biēm ButterSprayer I’m not sure what I was thinking when I forked over $144 on Kickstarter in April for a butter-liquefier that “goes from butter stick to butter spray in seconds.” Presumably, it would make baking, frying, and toast-buttering easier. But probably not $144 easier. The Biēm appears to be close to shipping, but I still haven’t gotten it.

China’s largest telecommunications equipment maker expects a 32 per cent rise in revenue to 520 billion yuan (US$75 billion, RM335.7 billion) in 2016, rotating Chief Executive Officer Eric Xu said. That’s down from the 37 per cent growth it posted in 2015. The company now needs to re-tool its management approach to zero in on customers’ needs, while staunching costs and avoiding “blind optimism and rhetoric.” Huawei, which debuted its first Android device in 2009 and is now the largest smartphone maker after Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co., has made significant inroads into markets from the US to Europe. But Chinese rivals from Oppo to Vivo have taken the lead back home and its business of selling networking gear to wireless carriers is vulnerable to political swings. Huawei’s consumer business, which includes mainly smartphones, probably grew sales 42 per cent to 178 billion yuan in 2016, divisional CEO Richard Yu said in a separate memo. “The year 2016 has seen a flock of black swans ― both political and economic ― sweep across the globe,” Xu said in a memo to staff that was posted on the company website. “In 2017, we will face even greater global political and economic uncertainties.” Those include a rise in costs that outpaced revenue and gross margin growth in 2016. Xu outlined a laundry list of time- and money-wasting activities to root out, including “empty talks in offices that are far removed from actual business” and “fancy” internal promotional videos and slides. He wants more independent thinking and visits to key operations from base stations to stores. More fundamentally, Xu ― one of several executives that rotate in and out of the top position ― urged a shift in attitude and mindset from merely responding to customers to actively evolving into a technology leader. He wants to build research and innovation centres around the world. And he warned of internal disruption as employees are trained and re-assigned to the field. “Our human resource policy should help reduce entropy in our workforce,” he said. Founded in 1987 by former army engineer Ren Zhengfei, Huawei is one of several Chinese companies trying to compete in the global technology market. It remains a global leader in carrier equipment, and its latest smartphones ― the P9 and P9 Plus ― have proven popular in higher-end markets. It posted a 37 per cent jump in overall 2015 revenue to 395 billion yuan, and shipped roughly 100 million smartphones globally. Smartphone sales are expected to grow a single-digit percentage in 2016 for the first time, according to IT researcher Gartner. Huawei’s consumer mobile division, riding the strong reception for its marquee phones, far outpaced that: it probably expanded shipments by 29 per cent to 139 million units this year, Yu said. The goal is to become one of two to three few surviving players after a global industry shake-out over the coming three to five years, the consumer division chief added. To get there, Huawei must continue to evolve into a true premium brand and adapt to a rapidly shifting market, rotating CEO Xu said. “To cure an illness, you have to treat the root cause,” Xu said. “Past success is not a reliable indicator of the future, and a long list of accomplishments might end up nothing more than an epitaph.” ― Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Singapore Q4 GDP beats forecasts as manufacturing rebounds ANZ to sell stake in Shanghai Rural Commercial Bank for A$1.8b Twitter China head Kathy Chen leaves company Oil prices rise as markets eye production cuts Brazil logs record trade surplus despite troubles Bank Negara takes action against firm over ringgit trade World’s highest-paid expats toil in land of fondue and watches Ringgit to stay under pressure on US interest rate rise Chinese firms ordered to pay Disney, Pixar US$194,000 for copying ‘Cars’ Bursa Malaysia ends higher Most Watched Now Week MMOTV: SKYACTIV Technologies — reason for renewed Mazda popularity Reuters Video: Israel's Netanyahu dismisses media reports of gifts investigation Reuters Video: Around 60 killed in Brazil prison riot HD video of earth from space will make your heart ache Reuters Video: Carrie Fisher, Debbie Reynolds remembered in LA Reuters Video: Nunes stuns challenger Rousey with first-round title win Related Articles Bitcoin jumps above US$1,000 for first time in three years Beijing’s brief respite from choking smog to be shortlived Foxconn invests US$8b in China LCD plant Taiwan won’t cave to Beijing threats, says president Taiwan announces US itinerary for president, upsetting China Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The plaintiffs claim Apple failed to introduce technology it had a patent for that could potentially have prevented the driver from using the app. The accident happened  on Christmas Eve, 2014. Bethany and James Modisette, and their two children — Isabella and Moriah were in the car at the time. The family sustained serious injuries, and five year old Moriah died of her injuries in hospital. Modisette’s lawyers claim Apple sat on the tech  that could have prevented it but failed to implement it. The court filings point to a patent that Apple applied for in 2008 (and was granted in 2014) that would “lock out the ability of drivers to use the ‘FaceTime’ application on the Apple iPhone while using a motor vehicle.” The case alleges that by failing to incorporate this patent, Apple contributed to the death of Moriah and the injuries of the rest of the family. The company’s “failure to design, manufacture, and sell the iPhone 6 Plus with the patented, safer, alternative design technology already available to it … and failure to warn users that the product was likely to be dangerous when used or misused in a reasonably foreseeable manner … rendered the Apple iPhone 6 defective when it left defendant APPLE INC.’s possession, and were therefore a substantial factor in causing plaintiffs’ injuries and the decedent’s death,” the Modisettes’ lawyers allege.

 Apple sued over fatal car crash for not including a 'lockout' feature on FaceTime Rob Price Dec. 30, 2016, 5:15 AM 24,641 facebook linkedin twitter email print Karlis Dambrans/Flick (CC) Apple is being sued over a fatal car crash in which a driver was distracted by FaceTime. The plaintiffs allege it failed to introduce technology it had a patent for that could potentially have prevented the driver from using the app. The case, filed in a Californian court in early December, relates to a road accident in Texas that happened on Christmas Eve, 2014. The driver, "distracted while using the 'FaceTime' application on an iPhone 6 Plus during the operation of his motor vehicle," crashed at 65 mph into the back of a vehicle that was stationary due to traffic, the court documents say. (We first saw the case over on Apple Insider, and you can read the full filing below.) Inside the car were Bethany and James Modisette, and their two children — Isabella and Moriah. The family sustained serious injuries, and Moriah died of her injuries in hospital. She was five years old at the time. It's a tragic case — but why is Apple involved? The company is being sued because, the Modisette's lawyers claim, it has technology that could have prevented it but failed to implement it. The court filings point to a patent that Apple applied for in 2008 (and was granted in 2014) that would "lock out the ability of drivers to use the 'FaceTime' application on the Apple iPhone while using a motor vehicle." The case alleges that by failing to incorporate this patent, Apple contributed to the death of Moriah and the injuries of the rest of the family. The company's "failure to design, manufacture, and sell the iPhone 6 Plus with the patented, safer, alternative design technology already available to it ... and failure to warn users that the product was likely to be dangerous when used or misused in a reasonably foreseeable manner ... rendered the Apple iPhone 6 defective when it left defendant APPLE INC.'s possession, and were therefore a substantial factor in causing plaintiffs' injuries and the decedent's death," the Modisettes' lawyers allege. An Apple spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Here's the full court filing: EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

(Image: News18.com) The battle for supremacy in the flagship segment of smartphones was really intense in 2016 with Samsung Galaxy S7 edge taking an early lead. Soon, rival Apple took on Samsung with its iPhone 7 Plus featuring a dual-lens rear camera. Meanwhile, Chinese startup OnePlus stormed the market with the OnePlus 3 at a jaw-dropping price. Later, the company had launched an improved OnePlus 3T version in December. Lenovo-owned Moto launched the very first practical modular smartphone in the form Moto Z and Moto Z Play. This makes Moto one of the most innovative smartphone brands in 2016. After dumping the Nexus lineup, Google introduced its first smartphones- Pixel and Pixel XL. The smartphone soon earned the best camera handset badge in 2016. Not to forget, the cool new Google Assistant, which helped the Pixel and Pixel XL to stand apart in the otherwise crowded Android market. Here are the top five flagship smartphones of 2016. 1) Apple iPhone 7 Plus Many years ago, Apple had an advertising campaign that said, ‘If you don’t have an iPhone, you DON’T have an iPhone’. This, in 2016, holds true for the iPhone 7 Plus. They have offered some features that are new and have also improved things that worked seamlessly in the first place. The iPhone 7 Plus is a worthy upgrade to the iPhone 6S Plus and probably the only phone that will give you a hassle-free user experience. Read full review. Watch video: Apple iPhone 7 Plus 2) Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Samsung went all out marketing its flagship Galaxy S7 edge and one could easily see huge buildings covered with ‘the edge’. Other than this, if you compare the specs, the flagship beats any of its competition easily. After the recent Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, competitors like Google Pixel XL, iPhone 7 Plus, LG V20 and BlackBerry DTEK 60 rushed in to tap the opportunity. With little option left, Samsung had to fall back to its Galaxy S7 edge to fight a desperate flagship battle. Read the full review. 3) Google Pixel XL The Apple iPhone 7 Plus finally had a competitor in the form of Google Pixel XL. So, who should care? Precisely, two types. One, if you are bored of your iPhone 6 Plus or 6s Plus and not interested in upgrading to the 7 Plus. Two, if you are only interested in expensive phones. With so many good Android phones at half the price, the major differentiator in Pixel phones is Google Assistant. Other important mentions include unlimited Google Photos storage and online customer support. Read the full review. Watch video: Google Pixel XL Review 4) Moto Z The Moto Z is definitely the Android smartphone you would want to flaunt. Not just for its modular capability but also for the premium design. The Moto Z with Moto Mods is futuristic and takes the game to the next level. We finally have true innovation in a flagship to boast. Read the full review. Watch video: Moto Z Review 5) OnePlus 3 If you are looking to buy a flagship device and are not keen on spending in excess of Rs 30,000 on a phone then the OnePlus 3 is a no-brainer and it's still a flagship killer. OnePlus 3 is all the phone you’ll ever need in 2016. And if the OnePlus 3 wasn’t enough for you, there is the OnePlus 3T that you simply can’t miss. Read the full review.

Apple to Start iPhone Production in India Next Year GO Report claims Cupertino is ready to build iPhones in India Dec 30, 2016 10:11 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  ​ Apple is very close to starting production of its iPhone in India, as the company is now working with its local partners on setting up production facilities in the country. Cupertino has been trying for months to expand its operations in the Indian market to benefit from the local smartphone boom, but the local laws require domestic manufacturing before opening stores. Furthermore, although it was willing to make some concessions, the Indian government refused to allow Apple to circumvent the requirements of setting up manufacturing facilities in the country, so now the firm is ready to take this step as well. TOI reveals that Apple’s Indian production plans involve Wistron, a Taiwanese OEM maker that’s already a partner of the company, and the two will set up a manufacturing facility in Penya, Bengaluru. And while there’s no confirmation from Apple regarding its Indian expansion plans, it’s believed that production would begin in April next year with the iPhone 7. New job listings for Indian operations At the same time, Apple has also posted ads for several jobs in India, some of which hint that production of iPhones could indeed start locally. As 9to5mac notes, one of the job openings states that Apple is looking for an “iPhone Operations Manager” in Bengaluru, India, whose responsibility will be boosting domestic operations. “The Operations Program Manager (OPM) will lead Apple’s new products ramp in India with superior product quality and maximum customer availability. This individual will also own operational success of the products throughout their product life cycle,” the job ad reads, while the responsibilities section adds that this employee would be in charge of “driving ramp readiness with engineering, operations and OEM teams, planning capacity and manage factory budget.” Making iPhones in India will allow Apple to benefit from one of the fastest growing mobile markets in the world, likely to become the second after China as soon as 2017. At this point, iPhones are sold through third-party retailers in India, which barely gives Apple 5 percent of the Indian mobile market. #Apple#iPhone#India#iPhone production subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Requesting Financial Incentives to Build iPhones in India Apple's Fifth Beta Release of iOS 10.2 Now Available to Public Testers and Devs Apple Wants to Sell iPhones in India by Any Means India to Buy Technology to Hack Password-Protected iPhones New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    Apple will start production in India in April new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments iPhone 7 Plus Cameras Turn Black and Stop Working, Users Complain more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Drivers have time and again proven themselves incapable of exercising good judgment in those cases. Sometimes, however, companies that implement the technologies, or rather fail to implement them, should be held accountable as well. That seems to be the reasoning behind a lawsuit filed in Texas against Apple, accusing it of not implementing a FaceTime patent it held which could have prevented the death of a five-year old girl in a tragic 2014 vehicular accident. It was 24th December 2014 in Texas and the Modisette family car, which was driving slowly because of road congestion, was hit from behind by another car driving at 65 mph. James, the father, and five-year old Moriah were gravely injured. Sadly, Moriah didn’t survive. The twenty-year old driver would later admit that he was using Apple FaceTime at the time of the accident. In fact, FaceTime was still running when police arrived on the scene. While it’s undeniable that the whole tragedy could have been prevented with responsible driving, a rare trait among young people, the plaintiffs argue that Apple could have also done better. According to the lawsuit, Apple filed for a patent in 2008, which was granted in 2012, that would have locked drivers out of FaceTime when the iPhone or iPad determined it was in a moving vehicle. The lawsuit uses very strong words, painting a picture of a company that willfully and knowingly disregarded the safety of its users for the sake of profit, especially when the cost of implementing the patent wold be minimal. The lawsuit is seeking monetary damages, medical expenses, and others, though doesn’t exactly demand that Apple implement the said patent. It is still uncertain whether the suit’s claims have technological merits, though, should it win, it could set a legal precedent. Apple has, so far, refused to comment.

Here’s a closer look at the tech products that hit the bucket in 2016. iPhone headphone jack Apple (AAPL, Tech30) killed off the jack in September in favor of wireless headphones. The move, which upset some of its loyal users, forced new iPhone 7 users to either use a dongle or invest in wireless headsets. The company also encouraged users to buy its wire-free (and futuristic-looking) set of earbuds,, AirPods ($160) The concept of wireless headsets might take time for a mass audience to accept, but it’s a part of Apple’s big effort to propel the audio market forward. In a few years, we’ll likely look back on how weird it was that we once wore wires dangling from our ears. Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Where do we even begin? Samsung faced a slew of challenges in 2016 but nothing hurt more than the nightmare that was the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. In October, Samsung (SSNLF) halted all production of the device following complaints that it burst into flames. This came after a badly mismanaged recall of 2.5 million Note 7s shortly after it launched. Now, you can’t even bring one on a plane without being it taken away. Analysts believe the Note 7 debacle will put a $9.5 billion dent in sales and eliminate $5 billion in profits. Samsung also recalled 3 million of its washing machines this year due to an explosion risk. VCRs The last VCR manufacturer, Japanese company Funai Electric, ceased production of its video-cassette recorders in July. At its peak, the company sold 15 million VCRs in a year, but those numbers significantly dropped as DVDs, Blu-ray discs and, ultimately, streaming services hit the mainstream. Even so, Funai Electric still managed to sell 750,000 VCRs just last year. Considering the first VCRs were introduced in the 1960s, 50 years of production is still a solid run for any tech device. Hoverboards Hoverboards were the holiday gift of 2015, but this year wasn’t quite as good to the self-balancing scooters. After reports of burns caused by exploding devices, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission deemed hoverboards unsafe. Retailers pulled them from stores, transportation agencies banned them from trains and buses, and, ultimately, more than 500,000 hoverboards were recalled. The devices’ lithium-ion battery packs — the same battery found in Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 smartphones — were blamed for the incidents. Although hoverboards received a slight resurgence later in the year — some manufacturers implemented more safety measurements — the Consumer Product Safety Commission continues issue recalls. Pebble Pebble, once the darling of the smartwatch world, recently sold off its software division to fitness tracking company Fitbit. The news angered existing Pebble users — without software updates, their devices would become obsolete. The deal, which cost $40 million, didn’t include Pebble’s hardware, but it appears the company won’t be making more wearables. Reports indicate Pebble is pulling production on its Pebble Time 2 watch, which recently wrapped up a Kickstarter campaign. Early backers will receive refunds in the near future. Pebble was the first company to make a splash with smartwatches, long before the Apple Watch and Samsung Gear hit the market. Fitbit (FIT) will likely use Pebble’s software assets to move beyond fitness tracking and into the smartwatch space. Microsoft’s Sunrise app Microsoft’s Sunrise app was … well, sunsetted … in 2016. The tech giant acquired the popular calendar app, known for its social features and sleep design, in October 2015. But less than a year later, Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) shuttered Sunrise and blended its features into Outlook, its email service. The new integration brings map integration and makes it easier to set up meetings and Skype calls directly within Outlook. Facebook’s Paper app Facebook’s Paper app — which launched in 2014 — was a unique, beautifully designed approach to displaying both articles and status updates in your news feed. Some even called it the future of reading news. But the app failed to get a loyal audience. Paper was best known for its Instant Articles feature, which allowed users to browse and download articles from popular media outlets directly to their phones. It was also a convenient place to check Facebook messages and your timeline without switching apps. But due to low user numbers, Facebook (FB, Tech30) mostly used it as a testing ground to quietly roll out new features. The social network shuttered the service on July 29. Apple’s cinema displays This summer, Apple (AAPL, Tech30) discontinued its Thunderbolt Display, the company’s only remaining standalone monitor. It was a favorite among among graphic designers, gamers and anyone who needed to connect a Mac computer to a larger display. But considering it hadn’t received an update since 2011, the news wasn’t much of a shock. Apple did, however, partner with LG to roll out 4K and 5K displays — a pricier but better quality alternative. Google Picasa In March, Google (GOOGL, Tech30) pulled the plug on its photo-sharing and storing service Picasa. Google Photos debuted last year with a splashy launch, and running two similar services didn’t make sense. Plus, Google Photos is a far superior product. Picasa attracted a loyal fan base over the years, allowing users to edit and organize digital photos long before the introduction of smartphone cameras. Users weren’t happy about the service’s demise, but Google made the transition as easy as possible; existing photos and albums are still accessible after logging into Google Photos. Motorola Lenovo (LNVGF) killed off the Motorola (MSI) name earlier this year. The parent company now blends the two brands together under a “Moto by Lenovo” moniker. Motorola, the company behind the first walkie-talkie and consumer cell phone, has had a rollercoaster-like few years. It’s been bought and sold twice since 2012. In the first deal, Google acquired Motorola for $12.5 billion, which kicked off the search giant’s step into the hardware business. But sales of the Moto X smartphone were sluggish, and Google eventually sold the company to Lenovo for $2.9 billion. For now, Moto’s lineup includes smartphones, wearables and Bluetooth headsets. Google’s Project Ara Although Google’s modular Ara phone was expected to ship as early as the fall, the company is no longer bringing it to market. Google’s experimental ATAP team spent more than three years developing the innovative concept that would allow people to design their own smartphones. By using small bricks that look like LEGOs, pieces could be swapped, removed or attached based on your preferences. But Project Ara, which underwent testing in Puerto Rico, was reportedly too costly and ran into a series of technical issues that kept it from hitting the mass market. BlackBerry phones BlackBerry (BBRY, Tech30), known for its cellphones with physical keyboards, is no longer making its own devices. The company announced in September that it will lean instead on partners to manufacture the phones, which will still resemble BlackBerry devices. Its main focus will be on developing software — an effort BlackBerry introduced several years ago amid slow phone sales. Before the emergence of the iPhone, BlackBerry devices were so loved by their obsessed user base that they were nicknamed Crackberries. The phones were used by everyone from Kim Kardashian West to President Obama. Vine Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) announced in October it was shutting down its beloved short-form video app, Vine — a move that upset its most loyal fans. But recently, the company announced plans to bring it back from the dead. Sort of. The parent company is rebranding the app as Vine Camera, allowing users to take photos and short clips that can be saved to a camera roll or shared on Twitter. Features such as built-in chat, likes and comments won’t be included in the new version of the app. Vine was acquired by Twitter in 2012 for $30 million. Although capabilities were limited, it played an integral role in capturing movements like Black Lives Matter and gave aspiring artists such as Shawn Mendes — now a bestselling pop artist — a place to promote their brand. Eventually, with the growth of livestreaming apps and video sharing tools, Vine lost its novelty.

(AP) In what can only be reminiscent of Apple’s move to diversify its supply chain from Foxconn in 2013 and divide it with USA-based Pegatron Corporation, the iPhone-maker has chosen Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron to start assembling iPhones in India. According to reports and industry sources, Apple is in talks with Wistron to assemble iPhones in a new plant that is being setup in the industrial area of Peenya in Bengaluru and this might just mean that iPhones could get a little cheaper for Indians. “Apple is in talks with Wistron to start assembly in Peenya. The company is expected to start assembly first and then scale up slowly to complete knock down manufacturing as the demand arises,” an industry source in the know of things, told HT. However, he also said that assembly might not start in April next year but is more likely to start during the last quarter of 2017. But what is interesting is Apple may have ditched Foxconn in India — which is its largest contract manufacturer in the world. Earlier, when Foxconn moved to India, it was believed that it would make Apple products in its upcoming facility in Maharashtra as it does in China in its Hon Hai Precision unit. Interestingly, industry sources claim that the move to start local assembly might be directed more at attaining an exemption on the local sourcing norms and other financial incentives that Apple has been after. “Western might have been a option as the Karnataka state government might end up giving certain sops which helps Apple in some way,” an industry expert said. The iphone-maker has also sought several tax and duty incentives from the Indian government to set up shop here. Interestingly, the government will take a final call on Apple’s demands next month. Apple and Foxconn declined to comment. However, the alliance with Wistron marks Apple second major investment in Bengaluru. In May, Apple announced a design and development accelerator in the city to grow the iOS developer community and also to guide Indian developers to leverage Apple’s programming language Swift and build apps for Apple TV and Apple Watch.The facility will open early next year. tags Apple Iphone Foxconn iPhone-maker Pegatron Corporation more from business Larsen & Toubro bags smart city project for Pune Jan 02, 2017 12:54 IST How will 2017 be for the job market?

This time by ditching the 3.5mm headphone jack on its upcoming Galaxy S8 smartphone and releasing a wireless earphone instead. A new report has confirmed the rumour. The wireless in-ear headphones may launch along side the Galaxy S8, although it is not clear whether they will ship with the phone or sold separately. The report states that Samsung will look to compete with Apple's AirPods and going wireless is the only way to do that. Samsung's recent acquisition of Harman audio may indicate that earphones may come with Harman tech inside. The 3.5mm analog headphone jack was on the way out this year. Apart from Apple, major device makers like Motorola also ditched the jack as seen in the Moto Z. With hi-res audio becoming the next battleground for smartphones, it is likely that 2017 will see more smartphones come out without the headphone jack. The headphone jack is an ancient tech that was designed originally for telephone switchboards in the early 20th century. It doesn't have the ability to transfer as much data as a digital connector. Moreover, the 3.5mm jack can only trasmit information one-way, from the power source to the speaker. It was high time that this ancient technology was done away with. In the 21st century where we are more mobile than ever, wires are a cumbersome proposition. Wireless headphones are both convenient and enjoyable and comes minus the pain of untangling wires. Apple started the trend and in retrospect, it seems the move was for the greater good of making digital audio sound the way they should. An analog jack was a hindrance towards that step and it is but natural to see more and more device makers jumping ship. However, the wireless earphones out in the market currently (apart from the AirPods) connects using Bluetooth, which comes with it own set of annoying limitations. To truly embrace the potential of digital audio, the industry needs to rethink wireless audio from the ground up. And there's no one better to do it than Samsung.

By Sarmistha Acharya December 30, 2016 09:58 GMT Apple might finally begin iPhone manufacturing in India Reuters/Arnd Wiegmann Apple is reportedly planning to manufacture iPhones for Indian consumers in the Silicon Valley of the country, Bengaluru. Wistron, a Taiwanese original equipment manufacturer for Apple is setting up a facility in Peenya, the industrial hub of the city. The facility will begin production from April next year, industry sources told daily news outlet The Times of India. There has been no official word so far about the project. The sources told TOI that Apple is quite serious about starting the assembly operations. The full manufacturing line is expected to begin sometime at the end of next year. The sources said, "Bangalore is being looked at seriously." Apple has even posted job opening on its portal at its OEM's factory in Bengaluru for positions such as operations programme manager and product quality manager. Taiwan-based OEM, Foxconn, was earlier expected to set up a manufacturing plant in the western state of Maharashtra. While there were reports suggesting the plant would make only Apple products, but sources say that Foxconn seems to have tied up with firms such as Xiaomi and OnePlus. Setting up facility is not the first biggest announcement Apple made for India. In May this year the company said it would establish a Design and Development Accelerator in Bengaluru, which the company is calling as first-of-its-kind center to support developers creating mobile apps in India. The iOS App Design and Development Accelerator is expected in early 2017. According to data shared by Counterpoint Technology Market Research, Apple sold 2.5 million iPhones in India from October 2015 to September 2016, marking a rise of more than 50% over the year-ago period. It made INR 9,997 crore (£1.19bn) in 2016 financial year, a 56% growth from INR 6,472 crore earlier.

Apple Sued After iPhone Driver Using FaceTime Caused Fatal Accident GO Cupertino failed to add driving restrictions to iPhones, the suit claims, and this makes the phone defective Dec 30, 2016 09:33 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Apple is being sued by two parents whose daughter was killed in a car accident for not implementing limitations on its iPhones when being used behind the wheel. Specifically, James and Bethany Modisette are blaming Apple for not restricting the use of iPhones when driving, claiming that this is one of the reasons a 20-year-old driver crashed their car on December 24, 2014 and killed their little girl. In lawsuit documents that were published by AI, the parents explain that they were driving their car on the highway but slowed down because of the traffic, when another driver smashed into their vehicle because he was in the middle of a FaceTime call on his iPhone. The driver didn’t see the car in front braking, and the violent collision led to the death of the couple’s 5-year-old girl. Apple patented tech in 2008 In the lawsuit, the two explain that Apple has already patented technology that would allow restricting the use of iPhones behind the wheel, but say that Apple never implemented it on its devices, which makes the existing generations “defective.” This is why Apple is considered partly guilty for the accident, and now the parents are seeking damages from the firm. “Apple has had the technology to prevent these events, and the Modisette’s injuries specifically, since at least December 12, 2008, when it filed an application with the US Patent Office for a ‘driver handheld computing device lockout,’” the lawsuit states. “Apple’s 2008 patent application reveals that Apple expressly knew and/or should have known of the risks to human life and safety associated with, and created by, the intended or reasonably foreseeable use and misuse of certain functions available on the iPhone.” This is undoubtedly a long shot and what’s more important to note is that the parents do not try to convince Apple to implement this feature on its iPhones and prevent similar accidents in the future, but they want Cupertino to pay damages probably worth millions of dollars. #Apple#lawsuit#iPhone#FaceTime subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Pulls Nokia Products from Stores Following Patent Lawsuit No Joke: iPhone 7 Owners Try to Create Headphone Jack by Drilling Hole in Phone Apple Sued for Wi-Fi Technology Used on the iPhone Apple Sued Because Its iPhone Can Make Phone Calls and Send Emails New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    Using phones behind the wheel once again proven to be fatal New Mac Apps Free Download Manager: Download manager and accelerator that can handle HTTP, FTP, and BitTorrent protocols, while also being able to download YouTube content CheckMark Payroll 2017: Enables you to do-it-yourself payrolls and is the ideal solution for accountants, small businesses and professional payroll services.

At least, that’s what we’re told on a daily basis, by people who should know better. Still, 2016 wasn’t all sunshine and roses for the tech giant. In fact, it’s been a mixed year for Apple, with some cracking hardware but also some missing hardware, the odd blunder, and more dongles than you could shake a stick at. Here are the highs and lows as we saw them… The good iPhone 7 and 7 Plus Yes, we know: no headphone port. But get past that and Apple again released a great pair of smartphones. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are waterproof and blazing fast, look great, and feature stereo speakers. What’s more, the Plus’s dual-camera system has serious smarts when it comes to snapping portraits and zoomed shots. Apple Watch Series 2 It might look almost identical to its predecessor, but the revamped Apple Watch in tandem with watchOS 3 impresses. The Series 2 is waterproof, so can track swimming (or be worn in the bath, if that’s your thing), along with being faster and more powerful than the original. And watchOS improvements have made hardware and software alike noticeably zippier and more usable. MacBook Pro You’ll feel like your wallet’s been mugged on buying the new MacBook Pro, but there’s no denying it’s a lovely notebook. The Touch Bar smacks of gimmick, but third-party support’s improving daily, the display is dazzling, and, hey, it even retained a headphone port. (Although if you don’t like USB-C, you’re gonna need some dongles.) 9.7-inch iPad Pro The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is superb, but a bit unwieldy. Its smaller sibling turned out to be more manageable. Moreover, it also has a better camera than the original iPad Pro, and a superior display. The only snag is it’s a bit spendy. macOS Sierra Frankly, we’d add macOS Sierra to this list just because of the name – Mac OS (or, rather, macOS now) was always right for the Mac’s operating system. But Sierra also deserves its spot from a features standpoint, welding Siri to the Mac, flinging tabs everywhere, and vastly improving finding old photos. We’re still a touch wary of iCloud Desktop sync, though. Read more Apple macOS Sierra review Super Mario Run Gripe all you like about the price (eight whole pounds!) and controls (one-thumb auto-running Mario), but Nintendo bringing its most famous character to the iPhone is a big deal. And if you can get over yourself, you’ll find Super Mario Run a well-designed, playable, colourful blast. iOS installations According to stats nerds, it took just two weeks for iOS 10 to overtake iOS 9 in usage – a far cry from Android’s tendency to strand devices on whatever OS they had when first fired up. On iPhone and iPad, developers can now blaze ahead, making use of new APIs, and users get fab new features. Everyone’s a winner. (Apart from whoever decided on iOS bugging you daily until you comply. That person needs a slap. Still, it gets the job done, we suppose.) Hiding stock apps Honestly, this never bothered us that much, but if you hate the iOS Stocks app with a passion, you can now delete it, along with most other default apps. You still can’t assign a non-Apple app as a default for something like email or mapping, but, hey, baby steps. Swift Playgrounds The thinking behind Swift Playgrounds is to provide a fun environment for kids – or anyone else – to learn to code. This is nice enough, but we mostly like what it represents: coding for iOS on an iPad. Our hope: we’ll one year soon be beaming about Xcode for iOS. Apple’s accessibility website Although Apple’s October 2016 keynote was mostly about the MacBook Pro, with a sprinkling of Apple TV, it also marked the launch of Apple’s new accessibility website. That might not twang your tech gland in an exciting way, but technology is at its best when it’s inclusive. And whatever else you might think about Apple being an industry leader, it very much is in accessibility. Long may that continue. The bad So. Many. Dongles 2016 was Apple’s year of the adapter. iPhone headphone jack: gone. In its place: preposterous solutions for people wanting to charge and listen to wired headphones simultaneously. The new MacBook Pro: ALL THE USB-C! Apple’s response: dongles (and then discounted dongles). And for all of this ‘bravery’, you still can’t plug Lightning devices into a Mac – or USB-C kit into an iPhone. Lack of desktop Macs 2016 saw Apple revamp the MacBook Pro and update the MacBook. But desktops languished. The last iMac update was in October 2015. The Mac Mini and Mac Pro fare worse, last updated, respectively, in October 2014 and December 2013. Not good enough. Earnings in decline It had to happen eventually, but it turns out 2016 would be when Apple discovered it had sailed past ‘peak profits’. For the first time in 15 years, the company had a decline in annual sales and profit. The sliver of a silver lining: a ‘mere’ $215.6 billion in sales. Not too awful, then. Calendar spam Spam ramped up in 2016 for users of iCloud and Calendar, reaching epidemic proportions in November. Apple rumbled into gear eventually, with an apology and saying it’d fix things. Even so, why Calendar lacks a ‘Fire this message into the heart of the sun’ button, we don’t know. (We’d settle for ‘Mark as spam’.) Read more Apple iOS 10 review No more Apple displays and routers The – ahem – more seasoned Stuff staff members recall a time when Apple made all kinds of accessories, including printers. They were often a distraction, and we’ve mostly been thrilled when the company cut things back and focussed. But the death of Apple’s ‘iMac without the Mac’ Thunderbolt Display feels like a big loss. And Apple’s Airport kit was just so much nicer than the competition. iCloud woes It’s 2016. People have iOS devices capable of recording 4K video. They have iPhones and iPads with loads of storage and apps. And yet Apple still offers only a miserly 5 GB of free iCloud space, no matter how many devices you buy. It’s about as subtle an upsell as the iPhone showing a picture of Tim Cook yelling “PAY ME!” on the Lock Screen. Worse: schools using managed Apple IDs can’t even pay to upgrade, which is nuts. The 16 GB iPhone SE How we cheered when Apple unveiled its new iPhones, starting at 32 GB. How we whooped when it also eradicated 16 GB models from the entire iPad line-up! And then we spotted that the iPhone SE still started at 16 GB and maxed out at a miserly 64 GB. Still, at least we now know SE stands for ’stuffed excessively’. Social network blunders Remember Ping? Connect appears to be heading the same way, after it turns out no-one cares about a rubbish social network shoved into Apple’s music ventures. And on Twitter, Apple didn’t fare much better in 2016 either, its nadir being tweeting an iPhone 7 video before the new smartphone had even been announced. No more cheap Apple TVs The third-generation Apple TV was long in the tooth and limited to whatever apps Apple wanted to supply, but it had the advantage of being cheap(ish). Now, the lowest-priced Apple TV is £139. Amazon’s Fire TV stick, by contrast: £34. (And if you’re in the UK, almost no TV stations have a tvOS app. Double badness.)

Voice-activated chatbots are the new battleground for tech companies, with Amazon Alexa , Apple Siri , Microsoft Cortana and Google Assistant all vying to become your virtual personal assistant. Interacting with these bots may seem unnatural at first, but as they become integrated into more devices around the home, and AI technology improves, people may start to see them as a more intuitive way to access services than tapping on a screen. Amazon Echo Virtual reality technology is finally ready to hit the mainstream, thanks to the launch of Oculus Rift , HTC Vive and PlayStation VR in 2016. The price of these VR headsets is still astronomical, but as more immersive entertainment options become available, and competition in the market continues to grow, they will gradually become more accessible.

Augmented reality in Pokemon Go (Photo: Reuters) A variety of tech companies and app developers, including Apple , are promising to explore the technology in more depth next year. 2017 marks the tenth anniversary of the launch of the first iPhone, and Apple is expected to mark the occasion with an overhauled flagship smartphone, thought to be called the iPhone 8 .

The cyber security industry needs to be ready to fight back with new methods of online authentication that are more reliable than passwords , following the alarming number of high-profile hacks and data breaches in 2016. Finally, trials of reusable rocket launchers by the likes of Blue Origin and Space X are also helping to reduce the cost of space travel, raising the thrilling prospect of a manned mission to Mars within the next 20 years.

Garrett Wilhelm, 22, was allegedly using FaceTime when he drove into the back of James and Bethany Modisette’s car at 65mph, killing their daughter Moriah. Manhunt for three people who photoshopped king into gay porn scene The driver, who now faces a manslaughter charge, still had FaceTime active when officers arrived on the scene, according to Mail Online. But the parents, from Texas, claim that Apple’s app was also a ‘substantial factor in causing the plaintiffs’ injuries and decedent’s death.’ The wrongful death suit stated that Apple was liable because the design should automatically ‘lock out’ a user while driving. James and Bethany, from Texas, filed the lawsuit against Apple (Picture: Facebook) Garrette Wilhelm was driving to see his parents (Picture: Facebook) It stated: ‘…defendant Apple has consistently and continuously failed to implement a safer, alternative design that would lock-out and prevent use of FaceTime while driving.’ The couple claim that by failing to use the technology, the company has ‘breached a duty of care to plaintiffs’.

Wilhelm, who was on his way to visit his parents, had allegedly ploughed into the back of the family’s Toyota Camry. The couple also have an eight-year-old daughter who survived the crash.

So it seems. According to market research firm NPD, even though Apple made merry this holiday season, it was Samsung that in fact ran away with the bigger share of the pie. "Apple's share was lower and Samsung's was slightly higher from last year," said the report. Clearly, the Android fan-base remained committed to the platform in general, and to Samsung in particular during the season. Also Read: There are over 1 million brave people still using Galaxy Note 7 One would think, the Note 7 battery explosion fiasco would have given Apple some room to breathe, but the NPD report suggests Samsung still ruled the roost at the end of the day. Those looking to buy a high-end phone seemingly switched to buying the Galaxy S7 or the Galaxy S7 Edge. This should help boost expectations for the upcoming Galaxy S8 as well. "Most of those who bought or wanted to buy a Note 7 opted for a different high-end Galaxy phone," NPD analyst Stephen Baker told The Wall Street Journal . A Korea Joongang Daily report had claimed in October that, millions of people around the world were still holding on to the Note 7, because well, they seemed to have taken a liking to Samsung's all-new explosive phone, even though the South Korean major has itself -- sort of -- disowned the device. Either that or some of them were just too weary to go through the grueling process of exchange or refund. Samsung had pulled the plug on the Note 7 on October 11. A majority of Note 7's have either been returned or replaced, since then. The company is planning to remotely disable the ones that still remain in the wild. It is planning to move on, as it should. As such the Galaxy S8 is a very important device for the company. All said and done, the NPD's report should be taken with a grain of salt, because well, Apple is yet to report its December quarter results, including the first full quarter of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus sales. It will do so in sometime in January and going by the general consensus, the new batch of iPhones are off to a great start. Samsung, even though, it seems to have the upper hand (because well, the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge are equally fabulous devices, if not better) can't afford to play lenient. Multiple reports have suggested that the one prime reason why the Note 7 backfired was because Samsung wanted to launch it ASAP, well before Apple was out with its iPhones. Hopefully, it would be a little more patient this time, so as to save itself from more embarrassment.    Also Read: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 battery explosion fiasco gives Apple some room to breathe The company was caught foot in mouth when multiple reports of the Note 7 exploding started emerging. Samsung, thereafter, issued a global recall of the Note 7 and announced that it will give buyers who had already purchased the device (in the US, for instance) a replacement over the coming weeks. Much to Samsung's dismay, even some of its replacement Note 7s which were deemed safe for use, encountered a similar fate. The Note 7, as of now, is dead and chances are Samsung might discontinue the Note-series altogether.   For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @IndiaTodayTech and on Facebook at facebook.com/indiatodaytech For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in.ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.   Most Read Legion hackers: Who are they and how they are hacking Indian Twitter celebrities Android malware Gooligan affects over 1 million Google accounts iPhone 8: Everything you need to know about anniversary-special Apple phone OnePlus 3T review: Best phone in India right now Reviews Lenovo K6 Note review: Another Note in the wall LG V20 Review: Android Nougat supercharged Coolpad Note 3S Review: Looks good, runs fine Moto Z Play review: Die another day Asus ZenFone 3 Ultra review: The Director's Cut of smartphones VIDEOS 5 things you should know before ordering cash through Snapdeal Asus ZenFone 3 Ultra review 5 ways you can reuse your old smartphone more Tech Tips Tips to take stunning photos using smartphone Here are 4 tips to use Paytm safely Yahoo hack: Lessons to learn from biggest data breach ever Twitter security for dummies: How to keep your account safe How to use Paytm and other e-wallets?

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     AirPods Are A Runaway Success According To Tim Cook Posted: Dec 29 2016, 11:59pm CST | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Apple     Despite battery issues AirPods are selling like hot cakes.  During a recent tour of the New York Exchange the Apple CEO Tim Cook has described the AirPods to be a Runaway Success. The CEO was asked for a comment with his nephew. At first he declined to comment on business but he did mention how the AirPods have been a hit since its release. Don't Miss: Latest Science and Medical Discoveries The AirPods shipping started on 19 December. While both Apple Stores and third party resellers have been getting regular shipments the general public has found it difficult to get their hands on the AirPods due to their popularity. To much surprise Apple has been accused of creating artificial product shortages for a long time but there are no suggestions of something like that afoot here. Tim Cook while on his visit mentioned that the company is producing them as fast as they can. Those who have actually been successful to get their hands on the AirPods have given positive reviews. However some problems with the batteries haven been reported but the issues are far from being widespread. Those who are experiencing such an issue can make use of the updated warranty service provided by Apple. This is Apple’s first genuine attempt of making wireless earphones. The AirPods feature the W1 chip and have made the pairing the process of earphones easier than ever. The AirPod decision was crucial especially after the removal of the headphone jack from the iPhone. Now it seems like this technology is here to stay.

A lot of very good phones, no doubt. But he thinks they're missing something special. This year will live long in the memory, but not for its smartphones. While other areas of tech have flourished, phones have stuck pretty stagnant all year. Apple, Samsung, HTC, Sony have all done good things, but without the innovation needed to make them exciting. But 2017 is going to be a different story. I hope, anyway. Video: Best Smartphone 2016/17: A rare Apple misstep It’s hard to think of a year in recent memory that has been so polarising for Apple. The veneer of the once near universally celebrated brand has started to slip, and it’s not hard to see why. The new MacBook Pro range has been met with mixed response, while the iMac and MacBook Air have seemingly been left with barely a passing mention. The Apple TV has failed to revolutionise television with its meagre selection of apps (in the UK, at least) and then of course there’s the iPhone. Kicking off the year by re-releasing a three-year-old phone with slightly updated internals was hardly met with enthusiasm, but the iPhone SE is probably my favourite Apple phone of the year. The iPhone 7 was a disappointment; with poor battery life, upgrades in all the wrong places and no headphone jack. I like the 7 Plus more, but it’s still a hulking device that is both far bigger than it needs to be and lacking some basic features – quick charging being one – I have come to expect from phones. But, I’ve got a sneaking suspicious 2017 might be different. On the phone side of things, at least. Next year marks the tenth anniversary of the iPhone. Yes, it’s really been a decade since Steve Jobs introduced arguably Apple’s most important ever product. The original iPhone changed how we look at our phone, and hopefully the iPhone 8 (or just 'iPhone' as I suspect it will be called) might do the same. Related: iPhone 8 news and rumours Apple loves dates, anniversaries and anything it can celebrate (remember that nostalgic look at its laptops before the new MacBook Pro was announced?) and the rumours point to a big change for the iPhone in 2017. A curved OLED display has been rumoured, wireless charging, higher-res display, multiple new size options, new colours. I’d hope for something more, something that would change the way we see phones as much as the original did. However odd they look, the AirPods might be the first clue into Apple’s all wireless future. They cleverly connect without a fiddly setup and can be accessed from all your other Apple bits again without any sort of setup. It’s a far cry from the cumbersome state of Bluetooth currently. Imagine a charger that intelligently works in the same way, altering the charging speeds dependant on your situation and working with other accessories like the Apple Watch. It’s even more of a shame that Apple didn’t capitalise and innovate this year, because it hasn’t been the best year for Android phone makers either. It’s been a year of iterative updates, that might be excellent but lack that showstopping feature. 2017 is hopefully the year this will change. Iterative Android Take the Samsung Galaxy S7 – a great phone (our favourite of the year) but in many ways it’s the same as S6. The same can be said for HTC 10 flagship, and even more so far Sony’s Xperia line. I think we’ve reached the peak of smartphones as they currently are. They don’t need to be any faster because there aren’t any apps that demand this much power; the screens don’t need to any sharper because our eyes can even distinguish the pixels anymore. So, where do we go from here? Well, hopefully onto new features that actually make a difference. Improve the experience. Another big year for Samsung A couple of the rumours surrounding the Samsung Galaxy S8 could just tick some of these boxes. It could get rid of the bezel completely, sticking the classic fingerprint sensor and home-button inside the screen itself. Aside from sounding ridiculously futuristic, it would help phones to be smaller – something that the majority of people I speak to still want – but with bigger screens. Related: Samsung Galaxy S8 – All you need to know Another rumour, that stemmed from a setting buried inside the Android 7.0 Nougat updates for the Galaxy S7, show a variable screen resolution mode. People have been calling for 4K screens on phones since quad-HD became the mainstream, but why? In reality there is minimal need for a 4K or UHD phone screen. We would struggle to notice the difference on such a small display, and the likely detriment to performance and battery just isn’t worth it. But, if you could alter the resolution when you needed it? That sounds like something much better. Switching the resolution to 4K when you’re using a virtual reality headset makes sense – this one of the occasions where you would notice the extra resolution – seems a smart move. If Samsung wants to push mobile VR, without sacrificing overall performance, this could be a very clever decision. There’s also HDR, a feature that’s arguably more important on TVs than 4K. HDR – or high dynamic range – gives you better black levels and more realistic colours and it’s glorious. Samsung first introduced it on the ill-fated Note 7, but due its short life-span the support simply never gained traction. I’m sure it’ll come to the Galaxy S8 though, and that’s exciting. Related: What is 4K? Wait, Microsoft? You probably hadn’t come into this article expecting me to talk about Microsoft, but a recent announcement has given it the chance to finally, finally, do something interesting with its phone. The computing giant just revealed that it will support ARM chips, notably the new Snapdragon 835, for emulating actual desktop apps. This could finally make Continuum work: Imagine plugging your phone into a display and having really apps like Chrome, Photoshop and whatnot available. This could also lead to much more powerful phone apps and the idea of a Surface Phone with this ability is the ‘something different’ I have been looking for. Of course, they'll be other stuff too. We'll probably see more attempts at modular phones, high-end components falling in price and turning up in cheaper phones and there will of course be a load of Chinese brand's driving the prices down. But I am looking for something else, and I think 2017 might just bring it. WATCH: Google Pixel vs iPhone 7 What are you looking forward to in 2017? Let us know in the comments below 0 shares Read Comments Phil December 30, 2016, 2:17 pm Proof reading is going to pot... Dominic Feltoe December 30, 2016, 4:55 pm Variable resolution is something I wish TV manufacturers would consider adopting. Standard definition content still looks as good as it ever did on an old standard definition screen, but play it on an HD (or higher) TV and it looks soft and washed-out. I don't know if it would be possible, but being able to play DVDs or SD recordings/broadcasts at SD resolution on a modern TV rather than upscaling to HD or 4K would be a real breakthrough, wouldn't it? Ed December 31, 2016, 10:56 am I think you've slightly misinterpreted the idea of a variable resolution screen. What you're describing is inherently impossible - by definition you need to upscale a lower resolution to make it fit on a higher resolution. What you're asking for would simply be a tweak to how scaling algorithms work. In fact, what you've touched on is precisely why Apple's Retina displays work while high resolution on Windows is problematic - Apple chose to simply double the resolution, making upscaling far simpler. Otherwise you'd need to have a TV that could physically alter the size of its pixels, which is not possible right now. What Max is talking about is also not possible in terms of a physical change but rather it would be just like when you change the resolution on your PC - there's still a circuit in the display that's stretching the resolution to fit the number of pixels on screen but the rest of the phone's electronics only has to deal with the fewer pixels of the lower resolution (just like how people game at lower resolutions to get better performance), which means less processing and longer battery life. MarmiteSoldier December 31, 2016, 12:27 pm It would be difficult to know what additional features manufacturer's could add to make phones interesting again. I guess most people would like to know that the battery will last all day regardless of how much they use their phones. Maybe an inbuilt accelerometer to charge the battery when you walk? toboev December 31, 2016, 5:56 pm It is surprisingly difficult to imagine what would be the next great thing on a smartphone. Iterative improvements, sure; longer battery, faster charging, better speakers, etc. But geninely new benefits, things that curent phones simply can't do, and which would be useful moreover, that's hard to conjure up. Microsoft''s continuum thing might be it. If I can really just connect my phone to existing large screen and keyboards and it becomes a desktop, that simple, that would be good. But If it is a whole faff of extra intermediary bits and pieces forget it. Dominic Feltoe December 31, 2016, 11:51 pm That's fascinating, thank-you. I did think what I have been hoping for since the advent of HD screens was probably not technically possible, but it would be wonderful if some clever person could find a better solution to current TV upscaling of lower-definition sources!

That importance has now manifested in the form of Apple deciding to open a manufacturing facility in Bengaluru. Taiwanese manufacturing company Wistron will be opening a facility in Peenya, Bengaluru's industrial hub. Production will start as early as April, Times of India reported. Apple will first begin assembly operations in the Bengaluru plant and then move on to fully manufacture iPhones by the end of 2017. The move comes as India's demand for iPhones surged . According to Hong-Kong based Counterpoint Technology Market Research, the company sold 2.5 million iPhones in India from October 2015 to September 2016, marking a 50 per cent rise in sales. Sales were up to Rs 9,997 crore in 2016 from Rs 6,472 crore- a 56 per cent rise. Net profits also rose by 21 per cent. Apple will surely look to make the most of this. Manufacturing the phones locally will allow Apple to price their phones even more competitively as importing them comes with 12.5 per cent duty. This is Apple's second announcement for Bengaluru this year. Earlier in May, Apple had announced plans to open a design and development accelerator there with the aim of leveraging India's increased interest in mobile development to make apps for Apple devices. Apple's largest manufacturer Foxconn was also committed to opening up a facility in Maharashtra earlier this year. But it was later learnt that the plant was not for exclusive iPhones manufacturing. Foxconn had tied up with companies like Xiaomi and OnePlus to locally make their phones as well.

Apple is turning to Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron, which will utilise PC-maker Acer's facility, a top government source confirmed. Wistron was spun off as a separate legal entity from Acer in 2002, focusing on the original device manufacturer market. "They have taken an Acer facility here. The initial plan is to make iPhones for the domestic market and then we can look at exports," said a government official, who did not want to be named. "The domestic manufacturing policy is clear.. they will be entitled for all incentives under that," the official added. Wistron has, in the past, won contracts to build Apple's affordable iPhone 5c and iPhone SE models. According to a recent report in Chinese publication Economic Daily News, Wistron would be the third assembler of iPhones for upcoming models, joining Pegatron and Foxconn. Wistron's board approved the proposal for the Bengaluru unit early this week and it would take around four months to begin production, another official said. Foxconn, another Taiwanese firm, is also looking at setting up factories for Apple in India, but has not firmed up any plans. Apple has been stepping up its efforts to grow its business in India, exploring local manufacturing as a way to lower the cost of its devices and open brand-owned stores. Earlier this year, the Department of Industrial Policy and Procurement had relaxed local sourcing norms for Apple to open its stores in the country. India has emerged as one among the fastest growing markets for Apple's iPhone in the world, with sales growth crossing 50 per cent in the 12 months that ended September. While the base is still tiny, at around 3 million units per annum or just 2-3 per cent of the market, Apple is already the second largest smartphone maker in India in terms of revenue.

Foxconn, another Taiwanese firm, is also looking at setting up factories for Apple in India, but has not firmed up any plans. Apple has been stepping up its efforts to grow its business in India, exploring local manufacturing as a way to lower the cost of its devices and open brand-owned stores. Earlier this year, the Department of Industrial Policy and Procurement had relaxed local sourcing norms for Apple to open its stores in the country. India has emerged as one among the fastest growing markets for Apple's iPhone in the world, with sales growth crossing 50 per cent in the 12 months that ended September. While the base is still tiny, at around 3 million units per annum or just 2-3 per cent of the market, Apple is already the second largest smartphone maker in India in terms of revenue.

Home Industry Technology Smartphones in 2017: Most anticipated devices to watch out for Smartphones in 2017: Most anticipated devices to watch out for With the new year knocking on the door, the tech world is bound to be filled with anticipation about many new smartphones which are expected to be launched. By: Sumit Chakraborty | Updated: December 30, 2016 1:16 PM Here is a list of the highly-anticipated smartphones which are expected to be launched in 2017: (Picture: Reuters) With the new year knocking on the door, the tech world is bound to be filled with anticipation about many new smartphones which are expected to be launched. Both the giants Samsung and Apple will be focussed on rolling out their flagship devices but will have a different marketing strategy. While Apple will be keen to bring out a device with some great innovative technology, Samsung will look to make sure it overcomes the Galaxy Note 7 debacle. Apart from them, other companies will have to be aggressive in their launches as well. Nokia will try to make a comeback in the mobile phone market, with a new owner, while Chinese smartphone makers will continue their surge in user base. In 2017, we will be witnessing a lot of new technologies fitting into the devices, including VR/AR, wireless charging, bezel-less displays, 4K screens and much more. Here is a list of the highly-anticipated smartphones which are expected to be launched in 2017: Apple (Source- Instagram: Apple_concepts) iPhone 8: Festivities around the Apple’s latest iPhone 7 isn’t over yet, but several leaks and rumours about the next smartphone have started doing the rounds on the internet. Apple will reportedly celebrate the 10th anniversary of the popular iPhone in 2017 by rolling out a drastically upgraded version of its flagship device. The most intriguing speculation that has come to the fore about the iPhone 8 is that it could have a curved flexible OLED display panel, but it will probably be present only in the premium variants. OLED is a very next generation tech because it works without a backlight which is able to save battery and also make the device thinner and lighter, apart from getting larger contrast ratio. The Cupertino giant has been reported to be testing more than 10 prototypes of the iPhone 8 with an aim to reduce the price as much as possible since the OLED screens are currently quite costly. There have been reports in KGI Securities and similar websites that iPhone 8 will feature the first wireless charging technology along with quicker charging speeds. Samsung (Representative image: The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge) Galaxy S8 & Galaxy Note 8 Samsung needs to tread carefully right now with its hardware after it found itself amidst a lot of negative criticism, though that has not let that fact pose a hindrance to the development of new technologies and incorporating them into its devices. This might give rise to a great new flagship smartphone next year. The leaks suggest that Samsung’s next device, the Galaxy S8 will bring forth innovative and novel functionalities and the display being the most interesting feature for the Galaxy S8 device too. Samsung might remove the fingerprint sensor and the novel way it might incorporate in the display panel will end in a really think device. Reports also suggest that the Galaxy S8 will be the first smartphone to get the all new Bluetooth 5.0. Samsung is globally the largest smartphone maker and it had announced that it had acquired Viv Labs Inc, which is a firm run by a co-creator of Apple’s Siri voice assistant. The tech giant is planning to introduce the San Jose-based company’s AI platform, into the next Galaxy devices. Microsoft The Carl Zeiss lens. (Source: Reuters) Surface phone Microsoft, with the enterprise sector in mind, is expected to introduce three new smartphones from the Surface Phone line-up in 2017. These new smartphones are rumoured to feature better hardware and top-notch features. Some of the expected features which these models will carry are a fingerprint reader, compass, barometer, proximity sensors and a 20-megapixel Carl Zeiss rear camera. These three models may sport an Intel Atom X3 processor, encased in an aluminium and magnesium structure, furnished with a 5.5 inch Active-Matrix Organic Light-emitting Diode display, a USB Port and a liquid cooling technology. The best of them is likely to have a 8 GB RAM, which combined with the rumoured 512 GB of the onboard storage. Microsoft had informed about working on the ‘Bridge solution’ which enables iOS and Android developers to load their existing app onto the Windows 10 with minimum coding. OnePlus (Source: Reuters) OnePlus 4 or OnePlus 5 Chinese smartphone maker, OnePlus had earlier said that it will be focussed on rolling out only one flagship smartphone each year, and in 2017 it is expected that it will launch the OnePlus 4. With the rising popularity of the OnePlus brand, this new device will surely make waves in the tech market. Weibo tipster KJuma reported that the OnePlus 4 will sport 6GB or 8GB of RAM. Interestingly, in China, the number 4 is considered unlucky, so OnePlus might just name its device the OnePlus 5. OnePlus 4 or 5 is expected to come in an all glass body and will likely be powered by latest technologies including either a Qualcomm Snapdragon 830 processor or a Snapdragon 835 SoC. The device will come with 128GB of storage and a big 4000 mAh battery. Nokia Nokia 150 Series of smartphones One a pioneer in the mobile phone market, Nokia and its comeback is the talk of the town right now. HMD Global the new owners of the Nokia brand will be manufacturing some new smartphones and the latest devices are speculated to be launched early in 2017. The new owners of the brand name Nokia announced a new ‘dumb’ phone, the Nokia 150. A new device called Nokia P appears to be on the cards by the company, according to certain leaks on popular websites like China’s Weibo and PokcectLint. These reports suggest a few specifications regarding the Nokia P device. The next by Nokia will feature a Quad HD display resolution, 6GB RAM and will be powered by the Snapdragon 835 processor. The device will pack a 23-megapixel camera at the back with the famous-for-Nokia Carl Zeiss lens. Nokia is also expected to launch its latest smartphones D1C and Pixel at the Mobile World Congress 2017. Nokia has reportedly been trying to revive its smartphones in a market it once dominated but was overcome by the likes of Apple and Samsung. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Photograph: Tony Avelar/EPA Samuel Gibbs Friday 30 December 2016 02.00 EST Last modified on Friday 30 December 2016 02.04 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close While there were some good things in technology released this year, there were also quite a few let downs. From detonating devices to damp squibs, these are the biggest let downs of 2016. LG G5 and modular smartphones Facebook Twitter Pinterest Modular smartphones such as the LG G5 held so much promise and didn’t deliver. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The LG G5 promised so much, but delivered little. As a smartphone, it is a decent if not spectacular entry, with dual cameras on the back and solid specifications. But it was the slot in the bottom of the smartphone that got the hype cycle churning. It was the first modular smartphone from a big-name brand. The G5’s chin and battery could be swapped for fresh cells, a set of speakers, a camera control and extended battery grip and a few other so-called Friends. The trouble was the “friends” were few and far between and those that actually arrived weren’t that great. On paper it was great, in practice it didn’t work. But the G5 wasn’t the only modular smartphone to fail last year, Google also pulled the plug on its Project Ara modular phone while Lenovo’s Motorola released the Moto Z with add-ons that slightly more elegantly magnetically attached to the back. Whether anyone bought the add-ons though remains to be seen. Apple MacBook Pro Facebook Twitter Pinterest The 13in MacBook Pro with its new Touch Bar at the top. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian After four years of waiting for anything more meaningful than a specification bump, the new 2016 13in MacBook Pro arrived. It was thinner, lighter, had a better screen and was slightly more powerful than the last one released in 2015. It had a new-fangled “Touch Bar” instead of traditional F and control keys. It even had Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint scanner, a headphones port and a starting £1,749 price tag. What it didn’t have were any data ports other than USB-C - no traditional USB, no ethernet, no Mini DisplayPort, no HDMI or even a MagSafe power connector. There were four USB-C ports ready to accept a plethora of dongles. Any of them could also be used for power, which is a good thing as the battery life was pretty poor. It’s certainly beautiful, but after four years in the making, style without substance didn’t cut it for even some die-hard Apple Mac fans. Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Galaxy Note 7 started well but ended up a hot potato. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Life for the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 started so promisingly. It was a cutting-edge device, worked brilliantly, garnered praise from all sides and even had an iris scanner - one of the first smartphones to do so. It was predicted to sell in the millions, to propel Samsung to even higher heights and cement the South Korean brand’s lead in big-screened smartphones. That was until one exploded. Then another and another. A halt to sales was called for safety concerns around the battery. It was pulled from shelves and the UK launch was cancelled. A fix was applied and the offending batteries taken out before being relaunched. The problem was that the replacement Note 7s started catching fire too. The numbers were small, but the risk was great. Eventually Samsung pulled the plug and terminated the Note 7. Even still some users refused to give up the phone. Samsung was forced to hobble it before rendering it inoperative with a software update. There the sad tale of the Note 7 ended. Pushing boundaries in design and technology can win you plaudits and sales, but Samsung pushed too far this time. PlayStation VR Facebook Twitter Pinterest PSVR costs about £350 and works using a PS4, not a £1,000+ PC. Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images It was heralded as the best VR for normal people. PlayStation VR promised to bring great virtual reality experiences only possible on a desktop-class system but without the need for a £1,000 PC to run it. The trouble was that it lacked the best-in-class controllers that really made VR in 2016. It was cheap and provided a cheap experience. And a cheap VR experience just didn’t cut it. Whether that will be enough to see it go mainstream in 2017 remains to be seen, but it certainly wasn’t the rip-roaring success many hoped it would be. Apple iPhone 7 Facebook Twitter Pinterest The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus dropped the headphone socket, but with it, battery life and design innovation too. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The highly anticipated 2016 edition of Apple’s flagship smartphone, the iPhone 7, was meant to set the world alight. It was waterproof, had a much better camera and its Plus edition even had two cameras on the back. The physical home button was gone, instead using force touch and so was the headphone socket. But what the iPhone 7 will be remembered for will be its terrible battery life. Less is certainly not more when it comes to how long it lasts in a day, and constantly having to hunt for a charger gets old really quickly. Especially when you can’t even listen to a wired set of headphones and charge it at the same time. Facebook Snapchat clones Facebook Twitter Pinterest This is what Facebook wants so badly. Photograph: Alex Hern for the Guardian Snapchat. It’s an app. You share pictures with it, draw stupid things and can even discover news on it. It’s biggest asset is a younger audience than most other services, the untapped market so many are after, including Facebook, which keeps trying to clone it after failing in its attempt to buy it. Facebook has tried to clone Snapchat, copying features and launching apps not once, not twice, not even three times. 2016 saw Facebook try to clone Snapchat for the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth time. It’s getting old. Maybe Facebook should direct some of that engineering talent to working on more pressing matters. Dyson Supersonic Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Dyson Supersonic didn’t blow enough hot air. Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian The Dyson Supersonic took the humble hairdryer and infused it with the vacuum-firms technology. A high speed fan in the handle for weight distribution, it’s trademark air multiplier head to blast air in your face, magnetically attaching nozzles and a round of digital buttons for controlling temperature and air speed. It looked like the hairdryer finally dragged kicking and screaming into the gadget age. Sadly in group tests up against hairdryers half the Supersonic’s price it was found to be a lot of hot air. Attach a nozzle and all that fancy airflow dropped to a level “akin to blowing through a drinking straw”.

After recent talks with Indian Government to manufacture in India, Apple has now started the process and the first production phase might well start in April 2017. As per a report by Times of India, Wistron, one of Apple's manufacturing partner is said to be setting up a plant in Peenya, Bangalore to assemble or manufacture iPhones. Further, the report also claimed that the first round of production is all set to begin as soon as early April 2017. Meanwhile, Foxconn which is a known partner is also reportedly looking for land in Maharastra to set up a manufacturing plant. However, one should know that Foxconn has also joined hands with OnePlus and Xiaomi, other than Apple, to start the production in India. Apple's CEO Tim Cook met India's Prime Minister Mr Narendra Modi back in May 2016 and since then Indian Government has been insisting the Cupertino-based giant to start manufacturing in India. Apart from Apple, the Central Government is also in talks with Chinese handset manufacturers like Xiaomi and OnePlus. If all this reported above comes true, then we can somewhat assure you that smartphones from the above said manufacturers will be sold at cheaper rates in future. Apple products which are currently imported come with 12.5 percent of duty on it. With iPhones being manufactured in India, there will be a decent amount of difference in the selling price of iPhones. Further, Apple is also in talks with the authorities to set up and spread its own branded stores and the company is reportedly seeking permission for that as well. With Apple-branded stores, the after sale service will be drastically improved as against the service currently provided by authorised dealers.

Home Industry Technology Made in India: Apple could be starting production of iPhones in Bangalore from 2017 Made in India: Apple could be starting production of iPhones in Bangalore from 2017 The plant to manufacture and assemble iPhones will reportedly be set up by Apple's Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron, in Bangalore. By: FE Online | Published: December 30, 2016 11:39 AM According to a report by IDC, India in 2017 will become the second biggest smartphone market after China, and the US will go to the third spot. This will give a big boost in the sales of Apple devices, especially iPhones which still have not made much of a mark in a big smartphone market like India. (Reuters) US tech giant Apple is reportedly planning to set up a plant in Bangalore directed towards the production of iPhones, according to a Times of India report. The TOI report said that Apple declined to formally comment on the matter. But the report quoted industry sources who said that the production will start from April, next year. The plant, according to TOI will be set up by Apple’s Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron, at Peenya in Bangalore. Apple has reportedly been discussing the plausibility of making the iPhones in the country, with the government, with an aim to make inroads in the South Asian market. Recently a source told FE that, the company had sought information on the kind of incentives, including taxation and other things, it would be provided if it starts manufacturing in India. Sources also said that an inter-ministerial panel might be discussing the likely incentives Apple would be provided if it wants to manufacture or assemble in India. The meeting between ministries of finance, industry, electronics and information technology, and commerce and environment could happen next week itself. Apple has also reportedly forwarded a wish list to the government.

According to a report by IDC, India in 2017 will become the second biggest smartphone market after China, and the US will go to the third spot. This will give a big boost in the sales of its devices, especially iPhones which still have not made much of a mark in a big smartphone market like India.

Rohit KVN   December 30, 2016 10:58 IST 2 Shares 2 Shares  [Representational image] Make in India: Apple to commence assembling of iPhones in Bengaluru from second quarter of 2017 In Picture: Apple logoREUTERS/Mike Segar American technology major Apple has reportedly selected Bengaluru to manufacture iPhones for the Indian market. Apple's OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) partner Wistron has commenced building an assembling plant at Peenya, a well developed industrial hub located in the west of Bengaluru. If things go as planned, the company will start manufacturing limited units of iPhones in April 2017, and start full-fledged production by the end of next year, reported The Times of India. Also read: Apple iPhone 8 to have a dual SIM? Patent filing indicates this just might be true Giving credence to the reports, Apple India, in its job portal has listed two production related job offers in Bengaluru-- one, iPhone Operations Program Manager (OPM) and a New Product Introduction (NPI) Product Quality Manager. Make in India: Apple to commence assembling of iPhones in Bengaluru from second quarter of 2017Apple India (official) Job portal In August, Apple's primary supply partner Foxconn entered into pact with the Maharashtra government to setup a phone manufacturing unit and was believed to be used for making iPhones alone. Now, it has come to light that Foxconn is using the same facility to assemble Xiaomi and OnePlus devices, but there is no sign of iPhone manufacturing yet.  Make in India: Apple to commence assembling of iPhones in Bengaluru from second quarter of 2017Apple India (official) Job portal-screen shot Since the visit of Apple CEO Tim Cook to India in May, the company has shown serious business interest in the Indian market. During his weeklong visit, Cook inaugurated Map Development Center in Hyderabad and new iOS App Design and Development Accelerator in Bengaluru. Read more: Apple to set up iOS app design and development accelerator in Bengaluru Apple officials also had a series of meetings with the central government over setting up of a manufacturing unit and a flagship store. In the recent round of meetings, Apple has urged the Indian government to provide incentives to manufacture iPhones and also exemption from the requirement to print product information on the devices, as it would alter the device's minimalistic design. Currently, Apple holds a meagre 2 percent share in the Indian smartphone market and one of the prime reasons for this figure is the iPhone's expensive price due to a high import tax. Currently, around 12.5 percent of import tax is levied on each iPhone sold in India. But the growth in iPhone sales in the recent months has been quite healthy, as rival Samsung's Galaxy Note7 was banned in India after instances of the phone exploding in different parts of the world were reported.  If iPhone is manufactured locally, Apple will get tax breaks and pass on the benefits to the people by reducing the cost of the devices.  Time seems ripe for Apple to start making phones in India, touted as the world's fastest growing smartphone market. It is poised to overtake US as second biggest mobile business market next year. Watch this space for more news on Apple products.

According to Patently Apple, James and Bethany Modisette have sued Apple for not including a patented technology on iPhones that could keep FaceTime from being used by a driver. Tragic Loss The lawsuit was filed after the Modisette’s two young daughters were killed by injuries sustained in a car wreck. The person who rear-ended them was talking on FaceTime on his iPhone at the time of the accident. That’s according to his own statement to police and to a police report that said FaceTime was still active when they arrived on the scene. The couple is suing Apple because of a 2014 patent (filed in 2008) for a method capable of, “disabling any function of a handheld computing device that may interfere with the safe operation of a vehicle by a driver.” The family believes Apple is culpable for not including that method/technology in its iPhones, and that if Apple had, this accident wouldn’t have happened. Let me crystal clear on this: the family’s loss is tragic. That two young girls were killed by a driver because he was FaceTime video chatting while driving is tragic. I can’t imagine their loss. Accountability But that loss isn’t Apple’s fault. It’s the fault of the driver who hit them. There is such a thing as personal accountability. Or there should be. Some brief notes: Patenting a method doesn’t necessarily mean a technology is shippable Or foolproof While drivers shouldn’t video FaceTime or text, I would be shocked if any company was close to being able to limit drivers without also limiting passengers To that end, screw any lawsuit seeking to shift all personal accountability onto companies that make products rather than the people who use them For the love of all that is remotely sane, don’t text, Waze (unless you’re using it hands-free), video chat, or play Doodle Jump while you’re driving I get it. It’s human nature to look for someone to blame in the wake of tragedy. There are plenty of times when companies are responsible for tragic events, on a large and small scale. There are plenty of companies who have acted irresponsibly, or even been criminally negligent. I’m in no way defending such things. But this isn’t one of those times. The idea of a company being sued for not shipping a patented method because a person was irresponsible is philosophically repugnant to me. Your mileage may vary. Not a Lawyer Lastly, Patently Apple took a detailed look at the patent in its coverage, including examining the wording. Though the lawsuit specifies FaceTime, the patent doesn’t specify FaceTime. As usual, I’m no lawyer, but I can’t imaging the merits of the case will center on that specificity or lack thereof. Hopefully it will center on whether a company has a legal obligation to ship patented methods. Spoiler: no, they don’t*. *I’m still no lawyer. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Email Print Tumblr 13 Comments Add a comment MuppetGate December 30, 2016 Don’t blame the parents. Blame the scumbag lawyers who pursuaded them to file a lawsuit. I find it hard to believe that the parents came up with this idea on their own so soon after such a devastating loss. December 30, 2016 at 12:09 EST AM Andhaka December 30, 2016 As MuppetGate said, this is probably a lawyer trying to capitalize on his client’s loss and grief to get his 5 minutes in the spotlight going against the “big bad corporation”. It’s a tragic, sensless loss of two young girls, but it’s the driver’s fault, 100%. Cheers December 30, 2016 at 5:00 EST AM RonMacGuy December 30, 2016 Oh, if only I could sue others for my own stupidity!! Oh, how rich I would be!! 🙂 December 30, 2016 at 8:37 EST AM furbies December 30, 2016 With apologies to Douglas Adams: Lawyers: “a bunch of mindless jerks who were the first against the wall when the revolution came.” Ambulance chasers should be shot on sight ! How could an iPhone know who using it when it’s travelling at more than a snail’s pace ? Disabling features based on velocity would be a pain for folks on planes, trains, trams, busses. (of course none of these ‘users’ should be in charge of a moving ‘vehicle’) December 30, 2016 at 10:20 EST AM Intruder December 30, 2016 The lawyer is hoping that Apple will settle out of court rather than face the bad publicity (warranted or not). December 30, 2016 at 10:42 EST AM dhp December 30, 2016 Another possibility is that the family is suing in hope that Apple will add this functionality to the iPhone to help prevent future tragedy. But please, continue to make it about blood-sucking lawyers and greed. December 30, 2016 at 10:58 EST AM xmattingly December 30, 2016 Apple is not at fault, and in no way should bear responsibility for how people use their phones. I don’t take issue with that. But I do take issue with their arbitrary, politically motivated and cynical “safety” concerns. Such as replacing the pistol emoticon with a toy ray gun. December 30, 2016 at 11:00 EST AM mjtomlin December 30, 2016 @xmattingly: You have no idea what the reason was for replacing the gun emoji. It could’ve simply been because they wanted it to be about fun as with all the new fun features added to iMessage. I also don’t remember anyone being upset with Microsoft when their gun emoji was a toy ray gun. December 30, 2016 at 11:32 EST AM Jamie December 30, 2016 You aren’t alone, it’s philosophically repugnant to me, too. Even worse is the lawyer that thought it was a good idea, and further, if it indeed occurs, the judge that is actually willing to take it seriously. People’s sense of personal responsibility and accountability seems to die a little more with every passing day. December 30, 2016 at 2:17 EST PM Jamie December 30, 2016 PS: DHP – it isn’t Apple or any other company’s responsibility to arbitrate a matter like this. I doubt very much it would even be a legal possibility. Whether one likes it or not, the responsibility and subsequent consequences for our own bad choices in life fall squarely on our own shoulders. It’s a very sad incident, but laws don’t exist for the purpose of placating people. December 30, 2016 at 2:27 EST PM geoduck December 30, 2016 dhp: I’m sure that’s how the lawyer sold the idea to the family. December 30, 2016 at 5:57 EST PM d'monder December 30, 2016 Order the lawyer to pay a few million to the family, for predatory abuse and the pain and suffering HE caused. December 30, 2016 at 7:02 EST PM ibuck January 1, 2017 Why stop at Apple? Self-driving and braking technology also exists, so why not include the auto manufacturer for not installing that on the texter’s vehicle?
