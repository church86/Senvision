Sure it was a little rude, but at least it gave Apple fans something to do while all eyes were focused on Google. We already showed you how to install iOS 10.1 beta 2 on your iPhone or iPad even if you don’t have a developer account, and it’s ridiculously easy to do. Some people prefer to keep things legit though, and luckily the wait between Apple’s developer beta releases and its public beta releases isn’t long at all. DON’T MISS: iPhone 7 vs. Galaxy S7 blind camera test: Guess which model hardcore Apple fans picked Apple on Wednesday released the latest beta version of its iOS 10.1 software, iOS 10.1 public beta 2. The new build is packed full of bug fixes, and you’ll also find refinements as well as a few new features. What’s more, iPhone 7 Plus users who install iOS 10.1 public beta 2 will gain access to Apple’s Portrait Mode feature, which uses the 7 Plus’ dual lens camera to create a bokeh effect on photographs so that they look similar to photos captured using a high-quality DSLR camera. If you want the new iOS 10.1 public beta 2 software on your iPhone or iPad, all you need to do is sign up on this page on Apple’s website. You’ll then be able to download and install a special beta profile on your iPhone or iPad, which will give you access to iOS 10.1 public beta 2. Once the profile is installed, simply go to Settings > Genera > Software Update and follow the on-screen instructions to install the update.

The iOS 10.1 Public Beta 2 went live within the last 24 hours, with developers and the public clamoring to get their units updated with the latest iOS 10 version. According to industry blog Apple Insider, the iOS 10.1 Public Beta 2 is free and available for download to anyone. AI also noted a new feature in the iOS 10.1 Public Beta 2 that is exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus. “While the finished 10.1 update will likely deal mostly with interface tweaks and maintenance issues, its signature feature is a promised ‘Portrait’ mode for the iPhone 7 Plus, simulating bokeh effects to blur out backgrounds. “The feature is restricted to the Plus because it requires the phone’s dual-lens camera, which allows iOS to gauge the depth of a scene and separate the subject.” One feature of the new iOS 10.1 Public Beta 2 noted by Mac Rumors is its warning message about the impact of using a 32-bit app. For people who may not be familiar with the differences in bits or why it matters, the lower bits slow down processors and use more energy, a deal-breaker on newer iPhone 7 models. iOS 10.1 Public Beta 2 was released less than a month after the release of the iPhone 7 and the new iOS 10. [Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] As a result of the 32-bit apps slowing down devices and eating away at battery life, Apple has required that all new apps in development be 64-bit, which will improve performance on iOS 10 and presumably on the latest iOS 10.1 Public Beta 2. As for the warning message, Mac Rumors notes it was appearing in previous betas and will be permanent when iOS 10.1 public beta 2 moves from its current version to the latest iOS 10 update for iPhones. Apple has gotten so serious about these older apps that Mac Rumors notes the company is playing hardball with developers, not just testers, of iOS 10.1 Public Beta 2. “Apple has likely reinstated the 32-bit alert message as part of its crackdown on older, outdated apps to clean up the App Store. In early September, Apple notified developers about an upcoming plan to remove apps that have not received compatibility updates, do not comply with current review guidelines, or that no longer function as intended. “Notices started going out on September 7, with developers given a 30 day period to fix problematic apps. After that period, Apple will be removing outdated apps from the App Store.” BGR notes the release of iOS 10.1 Public Beta 2 coincided with Google’s release of the Pixel smartphone, an iPhone 7 competitor. “Sure it was a little rude, but at least it gave Apple fans something to do while all eyes were focused on Google,” the website noted. As for whether it is worth downloading the iOS 10.1 Public Beta 2, no website we visited necessarily advertised it as the smart thing to do. If you are like me, you have waited to even update to iOS 10 until the kinks are worked out. One would assume the iOS 10.1 Public Beta 2 will eventually work out the kinks and get the new operating system moving in the right direction for users who have complained of apps losing some level of functionality or others who have complained about the lack of a swipe feature to open iPhones in lock mode. iOS 10 was released at the same time as the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in September 2016. [Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] A final release of the non-beta version of the iOS 10.1 operating system has not been released, though if history is a guide, typically only two versions of a beta operating system update are released before a full rollout. Will you take the plunge and download the iOS 10.1 public beta 2 now or wait until it is rolled out as a standard update to all iPhone users? Tell us in the comments section below.

A release date for the new MacBook Pro is likely to be unveiled at the Apple event on 27 October later this month. Some of the latest spec rumors include the OLED touch bar, keyboard, and design. The core design of the MacBook Pro is not expected to be much different. There may be a gold edition for the 12-inch model, and it is going to be thinner and lighter. There are rumors of a new hinge design, according to Tech Rader: “Metal injection-molded hinges inspired by Microsoft’s Surface Pro line purportedly began shipment back in June for the 13-inch MacBook Pro. Meanwhile, the 15-inch model’s hinges were set to arrive in the third quarter of the year, making the late October release window argument even more convincing.” Will The 2016 MacBook Pro 15 Eclipse The Dell XPS 15?https://t.co/VVUG2hWiNC — Gabor Toth (@gabordrot) September 30, 2016 The touch bar feature will have an OLED display, which is a form of LED display that may highlight certain functions or apps in the MacBook Pro. It is expected to appear above the keyboard. Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint system is expected to mirror those found on other Apple products such as the iPhone. It is unclear where the fingerprint scanner will appear on the MacBook Pro. Some rumors suggest that the MacBook Pro will feature a fingerprint power button, while others anticipate a new magic trackpad update. We can expect to see sixth-generation Skylake processors powering the MacBook Pro and powerful graphics cards. The last Macbook had fifth-generation Broadwell chips, so Apple is going to set high goals for the latest MacBook installment. A better processor will improve the speed and battery life of the new Macbook Pro. Tech Radar reports on some of the benefits and drawbacks of the rumored processor: “Skylake has some tricks up its silicon sleeve that Broadwell lacks, including support for WiGig and WiDi short-range, high speed data transfer as well as wireless charging. We may not see that flip of the switch in this year’s notebooks, but it’s possible nonetheless for Apple to tap into this functionality later on.” It is also possible that Apple moves up to Intel Kaby Lake processors. However, a sixth-generation processor is more likely due to the timing of the MacBook Pro release. The publication reports on a 5K external device: “However, one thing Skylake can’t do is output 5K resolutions over a single cable stream. That’s why, in June, sources told Buzzfeed reporter John Paczkowski that Apple is working on a 5K external display complete with its own integrated graphics chip based on AMD’s Polaris architecture.” The new MacBook Pro is rumored to feature a butterfly key mechanism. With the iPhone 7 coming with no headphone jack, Apple may dedicate the rest of its 2016 releases to this risky leap. MacBook Pro 2016 release date, specifications, rumors: Apple's next-gen MacBook coming in October https://t.co/gyWav33FOk pic.twitter.com/u5rWWybdP8 — PC-Tablet (@pctabletin) September 27, 2016 The lightning headphone may be Apple thinking ahead. Either way, don’t be surprised if the new MacBook Pro does not future a headphone jack. The new Macbook Pro is likely going to come in a 13-inch model and a 15-inch model. The price range will likely remain the same as expected with Apple products. The current MacBook Pro range starts at $1,099 for the 13-inch model, rising to $1,119 for the cheapest 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro, and it cost $2,099 for the 2.5GHz 15-inch Retina version. While many tech analysts thought that the tablet would overtake the laptop, the MacBook Pro is still in high demand and is not out of style. AMD and nVidia are expected to launch new GPUs in 2016, and some reports speculated whether one of these new products will launch with the new MacBook Pro.

Follow TechnoBuffalo There are few things worse than buying a phone that comes with carrier apps preloaded. It’s a practice that, even in the year 2016, continues to exist much to the dismay of virtually every smartphone owner. So, you’ll be sad to hear that Google’s new Pixel will also come with bloatware if you purchase it through Verizon. Considering how closely Google is trying to follow the Apple model with its Pixel phones, we’re a little surprised to learn these devices will come with bloat. Apple’s iPhone never comes with carrier apps preinstalled (Apple bloat is another story) and it looks like it’ll remain that way for the foreseeable future. The good news is that Verizon will only preload three of its apps from the Google Play Store, including My Verizon, Go90, and VZ Messages. The wording here is a little tricky and we won’t know until the Pixel launches for Verizon later this month, but because the apps are considered “preloaded Play Store apps,” it suggests customers will be able to delete them. Under the “preloaded Verizon apps” section (image below), Verizon doesn’t list anything, so customers won’t have to deal with apps like VZ Navigator or Verizon Cloud. Typically, Verizon devices running Android come with upwards of 10 preloaded apps, so three is a pretty big improvement. Some of the other preloaded Play Store apps, at least on Verizon, include Allo, Duo, Android Pay, Docs, and Keep. I wouldn’t be surprised to see these apps also preloaded with unlocked models as well when they’re available The Google Pixel is currently available for preorder at the Google Store for $649.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Did Apple reschedule its earnings call so it could reveal new Macs? Oscar Raymundo 7 October, 2016 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News Apple had set a date for its quarterly earnings call later this month, then that date mysteriously changed. Apple has rescheduled its FY16 fourth quarter earnings call to Tuesday 25 October. Originally, Tim Cook and company had planned to publicly share quarterly earnings with shareholders on Thursday 27 October. The speculation is that the earnings call date was changed in order to accommodate the announcement of a new MacBook Pro. Moving the earnings call to earlier in the week gives Apple a chance to quickly move past potentially disappointing quarterly earnings. Otherwise, the company would risk overshadowing a flashy new product announcement with news of less than stellar iPhone 7 sales. According to 9to5Mac, this is not the first time that Apple has changed the date of its earnings call. Earlier this year, Apple rescheduled so that execs could attend the memorial service of board member Bill Campbell. This time, however, Apple has not disclosed why it switched the date, suggesting that it may have to do with yet-to-be-announced products. The story behind the story: The world is seriously due for some new Macs from Apple. We’ve been hearing about a new MacBook Pro since April, and rumour has it that the device will be announced this month. This new model would integrate Touch ID and an OLED touchscreen bar at the top of the keyboard. This summer, new rumours surfaced about the rest of the Mac lineup that may be announced. Bloomberg reported that Apple is also prepping to announce a MacBook Air with USB-C ports, iMacs with new AMD graphics processors and a 5K monitor in collaboration with LG.

Spotify and Apple Music get unofficial mixes, the best part of SoundCloud Posted Oct 6, 2016 by Josh Constine (@joshconstine) 0 SHARES Next Story Buying Washio’s assets, Rinse cleans up part of the on-demand laundry market SoundCloud’s big differentiator is its offering of unofficial, user-uploaded content that the major labels don’t release and that isn’t on Spotify or Apple Music. Or at least they weren’t. The first unofficial single-track remixes just went live on Spotify and Apple Music thanks to their partnerships with music rights management service Dubset. Apple struck a deal with Dubset in March, and Spotify did in May, BPMSupreme reported. But the remixes are finally beginning to stream today, starting with this DJ Jazzy Jeff remix of Anderson .Paak. We’ve reached out to Spotify and Apple for comment. [Update: Spotify confirms that short-form mixes are now available. This is apparently just a small part of its integration with Dubset. It says the bigger part is when long-form mixed content becomes available, but there’s no definite timing on that.] Still missing are the multi-song mixsets DJs often share from their gigs. But Dubset is also equipped to distribute royalties from those and its deals permit them. Dubset CEO Stephen White tells me “Mixes are coming next!” Dubset works by scanning an entire mix and matching every part of the track to its Mixbank of snippets of official songs based on Gracenote’s audio fingerprinting database. Dubset matches the samples in a mix to these snippets, then distributes royalties for the play evenly to the original rights holders. In this case, Anderson .Paak’s rights holders would get paid because his music is the basis of Jazzy Jeff’s remix. White says 700 million people a month listen to mixed content, making it a big opportunity. But record labels have historically fought against unofficial mixes because they considered them piracy since they weren’t getting paid. Dubset gives them a fair share, so they’ll permit remixes and mix sets to stream on the major platforms. Royalty revenue from the platform is shared with rights holders while Dubset gets a cut. “Content owners have been very supportive. The publishing and label deals we have under license provides a large catalog to work with,” White tells me. This “allows some of the content that until now has only been on YouTube and SoundCloud to come to these great paid services where content owners will get paid!” The fact that unofficial content is now going live on Spotify and Apple Music could reduce the acquisition potential for SoundCloud, which the Financial Times says is in late-stage negotiations to be bought by Spotify. TechCrunch’s sources confirm the two have recently been talking about M&A. But if Spotify can get the best of SoundCloud’s content without coughing up a ton of money for a broken company that’s been struggling for years… Without the legal grey area of music as a differentiator, Spotify and Apple Music will end up competing on product features like Spotify’s Discover Weekly playlist and Apple’s Beats 1 live radio station, as well as on exclusives and early access to big releases from top artists. The real winners here, though, are the artists and listeners. Original rights owners will get paid, remix producers and mixset DJs can share their creativity without being pirates and listeners can hear the music they want no matter how it got made. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Music Description All the ways you love music.

Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie (groin) and Cornerbacks Eli Apple (hamstring) both were limited participants in practice on Thursday. Rodgers-Cromartie dressed for Monday's game against the Vikings as an emergency option, but did not play. It looks like the veteran is on track to return for Sunday's game at Green Bay. OBJ apologizes, says he doesn't want to be a bad example for kids Apple was inactive for the Vikings game. He did more on Thursday than he did on Monday, but the rookie said he doesn't know yet if he'll be ready to play on Sunday. It does not look like safeties Darian Thompson (foot) or Nat Berhe (concussion) will return for Sunday's game. Thompson hasn't practiced since Sept. 22 due to a sprained foot. Berhe has been sidelined since suffering a concussion in the third game of the season on Sept. 24. There is no timeline for either player's return. If Thompson and Behre are out, the Giants again will likely lean on undrafted rookie Andrew Adams to again play alongside strong side Landon Collins. The Giants worked out a handful of veteran safeties on Sunday, but have not signed any. Here is Thursday's full injury report: GIANTS DID NOT PRACTICE •FS Darian Thompson (foot): Thompson remains sidelined with a foot injury. •S Nat Berhe (concussion): Berhe remains sidelined with a concussion. •TE Larry Donnell (concussion): Donnell hasn't practiced since suffering a concussion on Monday night. It seems unlikely that Donnell will play against the Packers, so the Giants should be down to Will Tye and rookie Jerell Adams at tight end.  •OL Marshall Newhouse (calf): Newhouse worked on the side on Wednesday, but was not at Thursday's practice. He has been sidelined since injuring his calf in Week 2. LIMITED PRACTICE PARTICIPANT •CB Eli Apple (hamstring): Friday's practice will be crucial for Apple, who is making progress from his hamstring injury. •CB Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie (groin): Rodgers-Cromartie is trending toward playing on Sunday. •DE Olivier Vernon (wrist): Vernon has been dealing with a wrist injury since Week 2. He was limited in Thursday's practice for the first time since Sept. 16. Giants defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo said Vernon's wrist injury is affecting him more than people realize. •RB Rashad Jennings (thumb): Jennings missed the last two games after being a limited participant in practice both weeks. There is no word yet if he'll be ready to return on Sunday. FULL PRACTICE PARTICIPANT •DT Robert Thomas (illness): Thomas was a full participant in practice for the first time since Sept. 7.

"We are a fitness social network that is coupled to hardware, and we are on the cusp of transitioning the mission and purpose of our company from a consumer electronics company to a digital healthcare company," Park told "Mad Money" host Jim Cramer on Thursday. Fitbit's focus is very different from Apple, Park said. The company aims to encourage users to become healthier and more active, whether it is through the use of its devices, software or services. Park said the social aspect of the product drives Fitbit's growth. Mark Neuling | CNBC James Park Fitbit's stock has had a rough ride this year, falling more than 50 percent. It was a routine that Cramer could count on like clockwork. He noted that every quarter, Fitbit would report incredible sales and earnings, but then provide disappointing guidance that would cause the stock to fall. However, the stock has gained traction lately, up 15 percent since June. Fitbit also finally delivered in-line guidance in its last quarter. Park told Cramer that he was baffled at Wall Street's response to new products released. "Fitbit Charge 2 is the No. 1 best-selling fitness tracker on Amazon. You know, we launched two other great products earlier this year – Alta and Blaze – and if you remember, the investor reaction to Blaze was … I couldn't understand it at all. Even today, Blaze is the No. 1 selling smart watch on Amazon," he said. Moving forward, Cramer thinks the "big money" in Fitbit is with digital health plans. According to Fitbit, a third party study announced this week that for employers, the average cost of health care for employees that opted into a Fitbit wellness plan was 25 percent less. That translated into approximately $1,300 in savings versus someone who did not opt in. Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world? Hit him up!

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive This Desert Life: Apple Valley, the Eighth Wonder of the World Thursday Oct 6, 2016 at 3:53 PM Nov 10, 2016 at 10:13 AM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe I’ve aimed to err on the side of optimism in this column from the get-go, but even I — a staunch defender of this High Desert — scoffed at a magazine published by the Los Angeles Examiner that was graciously donated to me on Monday. There’s no publication date, but “The Golden Land of Apple Valley California” must’ve been printed circa 1955 given the mention of “Kismet,” the Vincente Minnelli-directed film starring Ann Blyth, one of the magazine’s three contributors. Comedian Bob Hope and newspaper publisher Lucius Beebe round out the trio that shares 15 pages to expound — seemingly out of the goodness of their hearts — on what sets Apple Valley apart from virtually the rest of the known world. Hope led off the proceedings and suggested something staggering. “... I’ve covered pretty close to most of the globe in the last few decades,” Hope wrote. “I have been around. They’ve shown me the Seven Wonders of the World, and I’ve run into fellows who pointed out places they thought qualified for slots eight, nine and ten on that hallowed list. “… But I’m here to tell you that for pure relaxation, pure joy and untroubled happiness, there is a little saucer of land not two hours drive from my home in North Hollywood that measures up to them all. I refer to Apple Valley — where I, and many of my friends have passed some of the happiest days of our lives.” Blyth offered more of the same, albeit in a slightly less exalting fashion. Like Hope, Blyth marveled at Apple Valley’s proximity to Los Angeles, which made vacationing easy for her and her husband, Dr. James McNulty, despite schedules that often conflicted. “When one has those precious free days, the other usually finds it impossible to get away,” she wrote. “ Apple Valley is our answer, for it’s within only a few hours of our work. Even a day spent in its restful atmosphere produces amazing results and we can relax knowing that any emergency may be dealt with in a safe margin of time.” And so the magazine is one big, sepia-toned ad for Apple Valley as a vacation destination, but it’s an intriguing one because it presents an extensive glimpse into — if the words are genuine — an out-of-town view of the desert that tends toward the romantic. Celeste De Blasis — who lived out most of her 54 years on Kemper Campbell Ranch — agreed that proximity factored into what brought the glamorous to the High Desert, although she attributed that mass migration to the sobering reality that was the Great Depression. “By 1932,” De Blasis wrote in her 1991 memoir, “those Californians who’d had money to travel in luxury to exotic, faraway places now needed a closer — and more affordable — retreat. The first paying guests appeared then, which turned out to be the beginning of the guest ranch, a business that would continue until 1975 and would host people from all over the United States and from Europe.” Of course, they continued to travel to Apple Valley, too, well after the Depression’s negative residuals diminished, but I wonder if it was truly for amenities like the country club’s golf course that Hope wrote was “as green as the carpet in my den where I practice putting.” In my column on the 1965 comedy, “Saturday Night Bath in Apple Valley,” I suggested that Newt Bass saw the movie as an opportunity to promote his town to prospective land buyers. It’s a logical conclusion given the number of goofy characters who utter “Apple Valley” so often that the film could easily influence a highly effective drinking game. Jump back a decade now to the “Golden Land” publication. If Hope, Blyth and Beebe wrote pro bono, the Examiner certainly didn’t publish the magazine for the same price. My assumption is Bass paid a pretty penny to tout his growing town as the Eighth Wonder of the World. The magazine’s donor informed me of Bass’ hand in the development of Beverly Hills, as well, so he probably had his star-studded connections nailed down long before Apple Valley was on his and Bud Westlund’s radar.  So the likes of Jane Russell, Ruby Keeler and George Reeves could be rounded up with ease and planted in front of the Apple Valley Inn to inject into the magazine’s photographs an added layer of elegance that no doubt attracted would-be holiday seekers with money to spend. But, of course, desert vacationing is not desert living, which can be a hellish existence. Surprisingly, Beebe — who worked as a journalist before becoming a Rolls-Royce driving publisher — included that fact in his write up. “And the Southern Deserts are still potentially fatal," Beebe wrote. "Every year sees them take their toll on human life that ventured too far from the water hole or mistook the trail at the crossing. From the swimming holes and fairways of Apple Valley it is possible to look upon desolate mountain-sides that are forever a suburb of Gehenna.” That Beebe managed to slip in Apple Valley’s metaphorical proximity to scripture's synonym for Hell is impressive, but his retreat from there is swift. “But these things are for the historians whose eyes strain endlessly into the mirrors of the past,” he continued. “Satisfactions and wonderments of the immediate now are equally at hand, and for everyone.” Certainly the Apple Valley of Bass’ day is an amalgam of the two extremes. For beyond the borders of the glamour shots depicting a resort-like pocket “developed according to a blueprint for near perfect living,” exists a rural landscape urban writers who merely pass through often liken to the world after apocalypse. And I, for one, appreciate the juxtaposition, even if both interpretations are, at best, exaggerations of reality. Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254.

The latest Best Global Brands report from Interbrand, the brand consultancy, judged Apple to have increased its value by 5% to $178.1bn in 2016, some $45bn ahead of Google, which itself rose 11% to an estimate value of $133.2bn. It meant Apple and Google claimed the top positions for the fourth consecutive year, although the world's five top growing brands included Facebook (48%), Amazon (33%), LEGO (25%), Nissan (22%) and Adobe (21%). Joining Apple and Google in Interbrand's top 10 were, in order, Coca-Cola ($73.1bn), Microsoft ($72.8bn), Toyota ($53.58bn), IBM ($52.5bn), Samsung ($51.8bn), Amazon ($50.33bn), Mercedes-Benz ($43.49bn) and GE ($43.49bn). As in previous years, Interbrand based its rankings on three key components – the financial performance of the branded products and services; the role the brand plays in influencing customer choice; and the strength of the brand has to command a premium price or secure earnings for the company. On that basis, Interbrand said the its top 100 brands had a combined total value of $1,796.38bn, up 4.8% since 2015, while technology and automotive brands accounted for a combined 29 places. Interestingly, Tesla Motors – the electric car firm that crosses over into the tech sector – entered the rankings for the first time at 100th place. "It's clear the best global brands are not just weathering change, but driving it," said Jez Frampton, Interbrand Global CEO. "They understand their Anatomy of Growth is complex, unique and personal; they look inward and outward, expand into new markets, and create better experiences to grow their brands and businesses." That's why, he added, "the challenge for leaders is to create the conditions, strategies, and experiences to enable growth, and today's demanding employees and customers expect flawless, seamless and enjoyable products and services."

The company explained that ads will be presented in light blue boxes at the top of App Store search results and that clear labelling will ensure users know the search results are paid promotional content. It means popular search queries, such as "to do list", deliver a banner ad for promoted apps above the search results, although in addition to general category queries, Search Ads will appear in targeted searches for specific app titles. "Search Ads is an efficient and easy way to promote your app on the App Store for iPhone and iPad in the US, helping customers discover it at the very moment they are searching for apps to download," Apple said on its website. Jason Hartley, VP Search Marketing Practice Lead at digital agency 360i, agreed that Apple's initiative will be important for all businesses that rely on apps. "If an app is important to your business you need to be all over this. We have clients where the app is vital to what they do," he told Advertising Age. "If someone can be the top listing, and it is super relevant to what you are doing, you want to be on top. The question will be if you're not going to protect that No. 1 spot, assuming you have been getting it, you should at least measure it and see what the cost is going to be." However, he cautioned that a major difference between Apple's approach and the likes of Google and Facebook is Apple's well-known concern about user experience. "The targeting they have is extremely limited," Hartley said. "There is nothing that says, 'I want to target someone that has shopped at Target in the last six weeks'. If Apple really wanted to do that people would be rushing to sign up, but it's not willing to give that information. Google and Facebook are."

With its ability to create an intelligent BMW ID based on a user’s travel patterns over time, BMW Connected users get a personalized experience over all available touchpoints, including smartphones, smartwatches, and Alexa-enabled devices. Download BMW Connected for iOS Download BMW Connected for Android The update further improves convenience and connectivity. BMW Connected was initially available for Apple iPhone users and starting today, Android-based smartphones will also be supported. The update of BMW Connected also covers the new Apple Watch Series 2. Customers are now able to call up information such as driving times based on current traffic, as well as a map showing the navigation destination on the watch, and use that information without having to take out their smartphone. Plus, integration into Alexa allows users to control vehicle functions from home via voice commands. Typical functions that can be controlled include vehicle door lock and battery charge status. With BMW Connected, mobility begins before the user gets into the car and does not have to end once they park. Last mile navigation displays the route users need to take from their car to their final destination on their mobile device. The new update to BMW Connected also sees users benefitting from first mile navigation – the route back to their vehicle is now accessible via BMW Connected. New filter functions allow BMW Connected to be adapted even more precisely to personal needs. For instance, searches for charging stations for BMW i models or BMW iPerformance vehicles can be refined using criteria such as the charging method involved, membership in the ChargeNow network, and the accepted payment method(s). Charging stations which do not meet the selected criteria are not shown. Furthermore, users can access more information on their vehicle, such as the tire pressure and engine oil level. The new BMW Connected visual design increases ease of use, with upgraded graphics that sharpen the focus on the desired information. In order to increase the run time of the devices in use, BMW Connected now also offers an additional mode which conserves battery life. Amazon Alexa brings BMW Connected into your home. “With the availability of BMW Connected as an Alexa skill in USA, customers will for the first time be able to manage their personal mobility agenda and operate vehicle from their homes. The integration between Alexa and BMW Connected is underlining BMW’s promise to constantly integrate BMW Connected into new touchpoints and to expand its digital services,” says Dieter May, Senior Vice President Digital Services and Business Models at BMW Group. The first version of BMW Connected, available in the U.S. since March 2016, focused primarily on journey management and remote services. Now, BMW Connected is literally coming home. With the availability of BMW Connected as an Alexa skill on all Alexa-enabled devices, such as the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot, it is now possible to use voice commands to check the vehicle’s battery charge and fuel level, for example, as well as lock the vehicle remotely. The BMW Connected Alexa skill allows users to learn about their next scheduled trip, find out what time to leave, and send the destination to their BMW. “We’re excited to work with BMW to bring their Alexa skill to customers,” said Rob Pulciani, Director, Amazon Alexa. “Never before have BMW and Alexa users been able to control their connected cars using hands-free voice control from their home — and now with the BMW Alexa skill, customers can use Alexa voice technology to lock their car doors, check their fuel level, and more without lifting a finger. We can’t wait for customers to try it out.” The skill works by using the activation word “Alexa,” followed by the invocation name “BMW,” which allows users to access the relevant functions, e.g. “Alexa, ask BMW when I should leave for my next appointment.” The vision of BMW Connected integrated with Alexa was first revealed earlier this year at CES 2016 in Las Vegas. The vision has now become a reality, and we expect to continue to release more innovative Alexa updates in the coming months. Today, users in the U.S. can access BMW Connected through enabling the Alexa skill and linking their BMW Connected account in the Amazon Alexa app. BMW Connected for Android. The BMW Connected portfolio is constantly evolving into other relevant digital ecosystems and touchpoints to broaden and improve the customer experience. BMW Connected for Android is now available in the USA, bringing the service to more devices and more customers.

Roston - Oct 6, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Staples now supports Apple Pay on the mobile web, allowing its customers to pay with Apple’s mobile payment system via their smartphone. Assuming they’re shopping on its “m.staples.com” website and using Safari, customers will be able to checkout using their iPhone’s Touch ID, skipping the usually extensive and cumbersome payment process. The mobile web support joins Apple Pay support both in Staples stores and through its iPhone app. Apple Pay and other platforms like it greatly expedites the payment and checkout process by removing the need to manually enter things like billing addresses and payment card details. By adding support for Apple’s mobile payment platform on its website, Staples has covered all the bases for its customers, ensuring all avenues of purchase are covered. While Staples has elected to use an existing mobile payment system, not all retailers have done the same. Walmart most notably decided to create its own platform called Walmart Pay, which has now rolled out to its stores throughout the US. CVS Pharmacy, to many people’s surprise, decided to do the same, launching its own mobile payment system called CVS Pay. Most recently, the retailer Kohl’s has announced the launch of Kohl’s Pay, a mobile payment platform exclusively for its Kohl’s Charge cardholders. Those with the card can add the info to the Kohl’s mobile app, then use the Kohl’s Pay platform to pay for their purchases.

by Brent Simmons Apple’s Judicial System (Update Oct. 10: see Dash and Apple’s statement.) Apple has a judicial system — that is, they have a system where they make judgments and enforce penalties. It’s not a criminal judicial system, and so the state and federal laws that govern that system don’t apply. Apple is allowed to run this system however they want to. And we can’t see in, so we don’t know how it runs. But we have learned — in the case of Dash — that one of the features of the system is that Apple may accuse a developer of fraud, not provide any evidence to the developer, and then remove that developer’s apps, with no appeal allowed. While this is legal, and within Apple’s rights, it’s not what we’ve come to expect from a moral judicial system. No matter what the context, we expect that the accused see the evidence against them, we expect avenues for appeal to be made available, and we expect proportional penalties. Otherwise, here’s what happens: if you’re well-known enough and have a good app, other people will raise a fuss on Twitter and on blogs and possibly in the press, and maybe something will happen. Maybe. That sucks. That’s a middle-ages way of handling things. Apple is allowed to run it that way, if they want to. Of course. They own it. But any adult would expect the same basic morality that people accused of crimes get: that is, again, the right to see the evidence against them, an avenue of appeal, and proportional penalties. In the meantime, it’s our job to presume innocence in the absence of evidence. This is also a moral issue, and it’s true even if you’ve never heard of the developer. 06 Oct 2016 Archive What I work on at Omni OmniFocus for Mac • OmniOutliner for Mac Swift Diary Vesper Sync Diary • How Not to Crash Apps I’ve Made • RSS © 1999-2016 Brent Simmons Made in Seattle.

The iOS 10.1 Public Beta 2 went live within the last 24 hours, with developers and the public clamoring to get their units updated with the latest iOS 10 version. According to industry blog Apple Insider, the iOS 10.1 Public Beta 2 is free and available for download to anyone. AI also noted a new feature in the iOS 10.1 Public Beta 2 that is exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus. “While the finished 10.1 update will likely deal mostly with interface tweaks and maintenance issues, its signature feature is a promised ‘Portrait’ mode for the iPhone 7 Plus, simulating bokeh effects to blur out backgrounds. “The feature is restricted to the Plus because it requires the phone’s dual-lens camera, which allows iOS to gauge the depth of a scene and separate the subject.” One feature of the new iOS 10.1 Public Beta 2 noted by Mac Rumors is its warning message about the impact of using a 32-bit app. For people who may not be familiar with the differences in bits or why it matters, the lower bits slow down processors and use more energy, a deal-breaker on newer iPhone 7 models. iOS 10.1 Public Beta 2 was released less than a month after the release of the iPhone 7 and the new iOS 10. [Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] As a result of the 32-bit apps slowing down devices and eating away at battery life, Apple has required that all new apps in development be 64-bit, which will improve performance on iOS 10 and presumably on the latest iOS 10.1 Public Beta 2. As for the warning message, Mac Rumors notes it was appearing in previous betas and will be permanent when iOS 10.1 public beta 2 moves from its current version to the latest iOS 10 update for iPhones. Apple has gotten so serious about these older apps that Mac Rumors notes the company is playing hardball with developers, not just testers, of iOS 10.1 Public Beta 2. “Apple has likely reinstated the 32-bit alert message as part of its crackdown on older, outdated apps to clean up the App Store. In early September, Apple notified developers about an upcoming plan to remove apps that have not received compatibility updates, do not comply with current review guidelines, or that no longer function as intended. “Notices started going out on September 7, with developers given a 30 day period to fix problematic apps. After that period, Apple will be removing outdated apps from the App Store.” BGR notes the release of iOS 10.1 Public Beta 2 coincided with Google’s release of the Pixel smartphone, an iPhone 7 competitor. “Sure it was a little rude, but at least it gave Apple fans something to do while all eyes were focused on Google,” the website noted. As for whether it is worth downloading the iOS 10.1 Public Beta 2, no website we visited necessarily advertised it as the smart thing to do. If you are like me, you have waited to even update to iOS 10 until the kinks are worked out. One would assume the iOS 10.1 Public Beta 2 will eventually work out the kinks and get the new operating system moving in the right direction for users who have complained of apps losing some level of functionality or others who have complained about the lack of a swipe feature to open iPhones in lock mode. iOS 10 was released at the same time as the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in September 2016. [Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] A final release of the non-beta version of the iOS 10.1 operating system has not been released, though if history is a guide, typically only two versions of a beta operating system update are released before a full rollout. Will you take the plunge and download the iOS 10.1 public beta 2 now or wait until it is rolled out as a standard update to all iPhone users? Tell us in the comments section below.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 6, 2016 at 2:00PM Many tech investors chase high-growth stocks, but others like to bottom-fish for contrarian bargains. However, it's important to recognize the difference between a broken stock and a broken company -- the former might recover, while the latter might not. Let's examine three such broken companies which I never plan to buy. Image source: Getty Images. InvenSense InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) makes motion sensors for smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and other devices. While those sound like solid growth markets, the company respectively generated 40% and 16% of its sales from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung last year. Peaking sales of both companies' mobile devices are weighing down InvenSense's revenue, which is expected to decline 24% this year and another 52% next year. To make matters worse, InvenSense faces fierce competition from larger rivals like STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) and Bosch. Apple installed STMicro's motion sensors instead of InvenSense's into the Apple Watch last year -- raising concerns that Apple would eventually use STMicro's motion sensors for its flagship iOS devices. InvenSense tried to offset that loss by diversifying into virtual reality headsets and Internet of Things gadgets, but both rivals are expanding into the same markets. Facebook's Oculus Rift, for example, uses Bosch's motion sensors. This ongoing competitive pressure could eventually crush InvenSense's margins. InvenSense was unprofitable by both non-GAAP and GAAP measures last quarter, and its losses could keep widening due to slowing sales and rising competition. FireEye Cybersecurity firm FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) provides threat detection services which monitor the perimeters of enterprise networks. This market is a growing one due to rising data breaches, but it's saturated with many rivals like next-gen firewall provider Palo Alto Networks and networking equipment giant Cisco's bundled security services. Image source: FireEye. That competition caused FireEye's sales to rise just 19% annually last quarter, compared to 34% growth in the previous quarter and 56% growth in the prior year quarter. FireEye expects sales to rise just 15% to 17% this year, compared to 46% growth in 2015. The company attributes that slowdown to its shift from on-site appliances to its new cloud-based platform, FireEye as a Service (FaaS). Appliances generate revenue immediately, but subscription-based FaaS revenues are recognized over longer periods of time. But with sales growth slowing down, FireEye's net losses will likely widen -- and its hefty stock-based compensation expenses (35% of its revenues in the first half of 2015) could prove unsustainable. The company's cash and equivalents also fell from $402 million at the end of 2015 to $184 million last quarter -- raising the possibility of additional secondary or convertible debt offerings. To top it off, FireEye's longtime CFO Michael Sheridan resigned last July amid cash burn concerns, and CEO Dave DeWalt resigned in June. FireEye's new CEO Kevin Mandia wants to cut costs to improve profitability -- but that strategy could reduce its competitiveness and result in even slower sales growth. Seagate Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) has constantly struggled with declining sales of its core HDDs (hard disk drives), which are being replaced by smaller, faster, and more power-efficient SSDs (solid state drives) -- which the company lacks a meaningful presence in. The ongoing slowdown in PC sales has also exacerbated that decline. Image source: Pixabay. Seagate's revenue fell 19% in 2015, and analysts expect its top line to fall another 5% this year due to weak PC sales and demand from data centers. Its earnings are expected to rise 35% this year, partially recovering from its 84% decline last year. Those forecasts sound bullish, but they're inflated by easy year-over-year comparisons and buybacks. Seagate relies heavily on buybacks, spending over $1 billion on debt-funded buybacks over the past 12 months. To make matters worse, it's promised to keep paying its forward dividend yield of 6.5% -- which looks unsustainable relative to its earnings payout ratio of almost 300%. Meanwhile, low interest rates have caused investors to flock to high-yielding stocks like Seagate, boosting its trailing P/E to 47 -- a steep premium to the industry average of 19 for data storage companies. Seagate also refuses to make a major acquisition, like Western Digital's purchase of SanDisk, to remain relevant in the flash storage and SSD markets. Instead, CEO Steve Luczo convinced activist investor ValueAct Capital to take a big stake in the company and help the company turn around its data storage business. That bizarre move indicates that Luczo simply doesn't have a clear plan for Seagate's future. The bottom line InvenSense, FireEye, and Seagate all still have bullish supporters, but I'm not buying their turnaround stories. InvenSense remains at the mercy of larger rivals, FireEye is shrinking its business when it needs to expand, and Seagate is treading water with big buybacks and unsustainable dividends. Therefore, investors should look elsewhere for better contrarian plays. Leo Sun owns shares of Cisco Systems. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple, Facebook, FireEye, and InvenSense.

What’s next for Twitter: Salesforce or the abyss? Posted on Thursday, October 6, 2016 by CNN in Business News Would you rather see Twitter stay independent or get bought by a company that calls itself a “customer success platform?” This suddenly appears to be the most likely choice facing the ailing social network, and the answer to the question may simply be: damned if you do, damned if you don’t. Twitter stock surged on rumors that Google, Disney and Salesforce were interested in an acquisition, with the potential for others like Apple to sniff around. But on Thursday, the stock plunged nearly 20% following a report from Re/code that Google, Disney and Apple aren’t planning to bid for Twitter. A separate report from CNBC said other bidders are “taking a look,” but remained vague. Reps for Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. That leaves Salesforce as the clearest bidder. The corporate pairing has caused a fair amount of hand wringing among tech analysts, Salesforce investors and Twitter fans. “Dear God, Please don’t let Salesforce buy Twitter. Amen,” one user posted on Twitter Thursday. Twitter’s cultural impact has arguably never been greater, as evidenced by its prominent role in the U.S. presidential election, but its viability as a standalone business has never seemed more precarious. Investors aren’t exactly hot on the acquisition either. Salesforce’s stock fell this week on concerns about a pricey deal for an unprofitable company with no growth. Under CEO Marc Benioff, Salesforce has made a number of acquisitions to provide additional software tools and data that help businesses and marketers manage relationships with customers. Twitter would almost certainly be the largest, with a price tag of at least $15 billion, or about a third of Salesforce’s market cap. Buying Twitter would give Salesforce access to valuable data on more than 300 million users, months after Salesforce lost out on its bid to buy LinkedIn. An acquisition would also give Salesforce control of a social platform that is already a powerful tool for brands to market themselves and field customer feedback. For Twitter, however, it’s unclear if having Salesforce as an owner solves any of its core problems. Unlike Disney, Salesforce isn’t particularly well suited to build up Twitter’s streaming entertainment and news offerings. Unlike Google or Apple, Salesforce may not have the technical chops to build innovative features and address harassment. And unlike any of these companies, Salesforce doesn’t have a track record of being profitable. “You can make the case for Salesforce to acquire them, but ultimately it boils down to how are they even going to pay for it, and are they the company that can extract the most value,” says James Cakmak, an analyst with Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. “I just don’t see it.” After Salesforce stock took a hit from the deal rumors, Benioff was careful to manage expectations about an acquisition. “The reality is we have to look at everything. We are going to pass on most things,” Benioff said in an interview on CNBC Wednesday. If Salesforce passes on buying Twitter, or simply can’t afford to make a bid compelling enough to persuade Twitter’s board, the social network may still find itself in a dire situation. “If that is the case, then I think Twitter will likely have to remain independent until a more reasonable valuation is available,” says Cakmak. Translation: If Twitter doesn’t sell after the latest flurry of rumors, its stock will continue to nosedive as investors lose hope of an easy exit. Once Twitter gets cheap enough, it’s possible suitors may take another stab at buying the company. Any significant stock decline would likely hit the morale of employees as Twitter leans heavily on stock-based compensation to retain talent. Many inside the company have either been looking for jobs elsewhere, or are waiting for their stock options to vest with the hope of a better financial return from an acquisition, according to interviews with former employees. Even if employees don’t flee at once, many could be pushed out. Twitter might be forced to cut costs to show investors it can improve profits if it can’t improve user numbers or sales growth. Twitter laid off 8% of its staff last year, but still has 3,860 employees globally, according to its website. Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s cofounder, has struggled to reignite growth in the year since taking over as permanent CEO. In the absence of clear progress toward a turnaround, Twitter’s ailing stock has only shown signs of life for one reason this year: the acquisition rumors. It started with talk of News Corp. buying up Twitter in January and continued with chatter that venture capitalist Marc Andreessen or former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer might make a bid. No dice. Inevitably the stock would fall as investors realized there was no quick solution for Twitter’s woes. “The whole company always wished it had never gone public, to be honest,” the former Twitter employee says. Ryan Sarver, a former Twitter exec, echoed that sentiment in a tweet on Wednesday. “Hope [Twitter] goes to a good home. Still so much potential but needs to go private to be fixed.” 'Tis the season of VR, but it's not quite ready for the masses Zuckerberg lays out Oculus' long-term VR plans Related Posts More than 3,300 crash claims filed against GM as window closes Amazon launches restaurant delivery service in Seattle Hillary Clinton slams Wells Fargo for ‘bullying’ workers GM union deal includes additional $1.9 billion for US operations Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Apple Watch | 06 Oct 2016 | Print  | Comment (0) An iPhone and Apple Watch Dock Living in a Material World by Josh Centers I used to think Apple Watch docks were pointless, but after reading Julio Ojeda-Zapata’s dock roundup (see “Eight Apple Watch Stands That Stand Out,” 5 August 2015), I decided to try an inexpensive one, settling on the $9.99 Orzly Compact Stand. That cheap little stand was an eye-opener. By putting the charger in a fixed position, I was able to tuck the Apple Watch’s absurdly long charging cable behind the nightstand. It made charging easier too, since I just had to set my Apple Watch on the dock at night. Also, I no longer had to worry about my watch sliding around my nightstand, the charger coming loose, or the watch falling off the nightstand. It was $10 well spent. I wasn’t looking for an upgrade, but when I saw the Material Dock by Studio Neat, I immediately wanted one. I’ve long admired the company’s products, but the Material Dock is the first that solves a real problem for me, by docking both an iPhone and an Apple Watch. It’s not the first dock to handle both, but it’s the first I’ve seen that deals with both in a sensible fashion by placing the watch edge-down in front of the iPhone. This way, you can use the watch in Nightstand mode while also being able to see most of the iPhone screen. It’s also adjustable to accommodate different iPhone sizes, even those in cases. On the downside, the Material Dock’s design makes controlling the iPhone more difficult while it’s on the stand — activating Control Center is difficult, though higher screen elements are still easy to reach. This design also makes turning off alarms tricky, since the Stop button appears at the very bottom of the iPhone’s screen. Personally, I find this to be a fringe benefit, since requiring a little more effort reduces the chance I’ll go back to sleep. However, the Snooze button is easy enough to reach, and you could always set alarms on your Apple Watch instead. The Material Dock comes in two variants: an iPhone-only model for $45 and the combined iPhone and Apple Watch dock for $70. Studio Neat provided me with a review unit of the latter. The quality of the materials and construction account for the price. The base is made of solid walnut, and the bumpers are cork. You must supply your own charging cables, which you install yourself and route through channels milled in the bottom of the base. That’s right, as with the Twelve South HiRise stand for iPhone (see “A Game of Docks: Apple Versus Twelve South,” 25 September 2013), some assembly is required. This annoyed me three years ago when I reviewed the HiRise, but I’ve since wised up to the virtues of “hobby kit” stands: they can be adjusted to fit any size iPhone and case, and you can replace the cables if something goes on the fritz. Assembling the Material Dock took less than 10 minutes, even with some fumbling on my part. You need a screwdriver, but the package includes a rather nice one. The Material Dock requires an official Apple Lightning cable. Unfortunately, I don’t have many of those with their insulation intact. I decided to put a worn-out, yet functional cable in the Material Dock, figuring that if the cable survived the installation process, it would then be stationary and not suffer more damage. So far, that’s been a smart choice, and saved an otherwise unusable cable. Studio Neat’s directions are pretty clear, and most of the assembly is common sense, but I’ll add a few tips: Look closely at the photos, because they’re often more helpful than the written directions. Give the Lightning cable a good tug to seat it well. Otherwise, the bend in the cable will stick out and make the Material Dock wobbly. Test every step of the way. When you get the iPhone section assembled, make sure your iPhone fits correctly and gets a charge. You can adjust the position of the cork bumpers and the height of the Lightning cable to get an exact fit for your iPhone and case. Don’t push the Apple Watch charging puck in too far or the Apple Watch may have trouble staying connected. Once you’ve assembled the unit, it’s time to put it in its semi-permanent resting place. The sticky pads on the bottom come covered in plastic, which you can easily remove with a piece of tape. My advice is to play with the dock’s location before removing that plastic, because once you set it in place, it sticks well. The sticky pads have a micro-suction surface — little sponge-like holes that act like hundreds of little suction cups. The Material Dock perhaps sticks a little too well. I had to remove it to make some adjustments, and it took some of my nightstand’s finish with it! My nightstand is kind of beat up anyway, but you might not want to place the Material Dock on any family heirlooms. If you get gunk on the sticky pads, like your nightstand’s finish, you can wash it off with soap and water. However, that’s a little trickier than I’m making it sound because you first need to remove all of the cables. Plus, the micro-suction surface soaks up soap and water, making it hard to get them totally clean. Some tips: Use the smallest amount of soap possible. A drop is too much. Push out all remaining soap residue with your finger Employ a cotton swab to dry hard-to-reach places on the dock, such as the cable channels and around the sticky pads. When finished, let the pads air dry for an hour or two. They won’t stick if they’re damp. Once clean and dry, the pads should be as sticky as they were out of the box. The upside of this mega-suction is that you can easily lift your iPhone from the dock without placing any downward pressure on the dock itself. Simply lift the iPhone, tugging as hard as necessary. Placing your devices on the Material Dock requires a little more care than removing them. As I mentioned above, getting the Apple Watch puck placement right is key. Otherwise, it will ding at you all night as it connects and disconnects — that’s as much the fault of the weak magnet in the puck as the dock. The other difficulty involves setting the iPhone in place, since the Lightning connector is so small. It’s easy to do in a well-lit room, but more difficult when the lights are out. Despite these quirks, I like the Material Dock. It’s handsome, it stores my iPhone 7 Plus and Apple Watch tidily, and Studio Neat was quick to respond to my questions and concerns. If you want a premium wooden dock for your Apple Watch and iPhone, the Material Dock is worth a look.   READERS LIKE YOU! Support TidBITS by becoming a member today!

News Windows 10 Windows 10 Anniversary Update Gaming About Apple starts auto-downloading mac OS Sierra in a Windows 10 style WE RECOMMEND: Click to free scan your PC for malware & improve performance 0 0 0 Apple has adopted the auto-download feature for their latest macOS Sierra on Mac devices. But the upgrade will only instigate if the mac PC is eligible for supporting the new OS. The macOS 10.12 will be automatically downloaded but not automatically installed but requires  certain storage capacity to stomach the download.  But if a computer has a limited or no free storage space, the auto-download won’t initialize. Even if it does and the memory space starts running short, the update will be terminated and the downloaded files would be deleted. The users,however, can decline the upgrade process in the authorization permission notification that pops up to inform users of the downloading of OS. Ironically, it is the same approach that Microsoft adopted last year and faced immense criticism for it as well. Although the Apple approach is a little varied and provides some impartiality to its users whereas Microsoft basically forced their update on users that caused a havoc. “On Mac [automatic downloading] has been available for all software except major releases until today [emphasis added],” an Apple spokeswoman informed via an email. Though users still have the equity to turn it off so it’s not all that bad. If you want to prevent your Mac PC from upgrading to the latest mac Sierra OS, just navigate to System Preferences, choose the App Store and deselect the automatic downloading option. Some updates were automatically downloaded on Mac computers previously, for instance, the updates given version number 10.11.4. But now, what is termed as ‘annual upgrades’ by an Apple spokesperson, are not being pushed automatically to Macs. This latest trend of automatic downloading that Apple has adopted, puts their OS Sierra in the same standing as tvOS, an operating system of the Cupertino, Calif. company. Both OS would ultimately download major releases of their upgrades to the devices running them – for example, iOS after a period would auto-retrieve upgrades and updates sans additional user authorization despite cancelling previously inquired ones. Mac devices running the previous two OS X Yosemite updates- 10.11.5 or 10.11.6, would auto-run the Sierra upgrade – presuming that App Store settings for download preferences have been set to default on a system; as stated by Apple.

Thanks to less than stellar roll-outs for services like Apple Maps and Siri, not to mention persistently wonky iCloud issues, iOS users have reluctantly come to accept the fact that Apple often needs a few years before it gets even an elementary handle on a particular service. Part of the problem is that there have been a few reports of in-fighting across some of Apple’s services-based engineering teams. Most notably, The Information reported this past April that “political infighting” between Apple’s iCloud and Siri engineering teams were preventing the company from addressing serious technical issues affecting both iCloud and iTunes. DON'T MISS: Under no circumstances should you buy a Galaxy Note 7 Looking to address the issue head-on, Bloomberg reports that Apple is now planning to unify all of its disparate services under one umbrella by moving all of its services-based teams into the company’s new Spaceship campus. In short, all of the teams that work on Siri, Apple Maps, iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple News and parts of Apple Music and iTunes will be under the same roof for the first time. As it stands now, many of Apple’s services-based teams work on technologies independently, typically in off-site locations close to Apple’s current campus at 1 Infinite Loop. “The current structure contributes to software bugs and slow product development,” Bloomberg reports. “Bringing the teams together at a single, dedicated campus is designed to improve growth of the services business and fight competition from Google and Amazon, the people added.” All in all, this is welcome, if not long overdue, news that will hopefully bring Apple’s suite of services up to snuff with its hardware and with its more reliable non-services oriented software products. Also interesting, in light of Apple’s concerted efforts to improve the reliability of its services, is that Apple is intent on rolling out its own cloud infrastructure that will reportedly “give Apple more control” over the backend and will, in turn, help “speed up load times.” Siri, Apple News and the iTunes Store are already on Apple’s new backend, the report notes, with other services slated to make the migration in the future. Notably, word of Apple’s plan to develop its own cloud infrastructure first surfaced earlier this year. Citing a source familiar with Apple’s plans, VentureBeat this past March reported that Apple was intent on developing a proprietary infrastructure to lessen its reliance on services from the likes Amazon and Microsoft. Apple isn’t happy with the fact AWS is not able to very quickly load photos and videos onto users’ iOS devices, according to VentureBeat’s source. Apple has bought land in both China and Hong Kong to build out data centers, the source said. Nearly all of iTunes is currently outsourced to other infrastructure, primarily Azure, according to the source. That said, the company certainly could be using Google’s public cloud in addition to Azure and AWS... ... Apple executives believe that building out the company’s own infrastructure footprint to cover its cloud computing and storage needs will pay for itself within three years, the source said This all sounds great, but only time will tell if Apple can, at long last, finally reach a point where its services can compare with other industry leaders as it pertains to performance and reliability.

If you want to use Apple Pay when making purchases in the Staples’ App, on the Staples’ mobile website, or in Makr, a personalized design and print service that has an iPhone and iPad app, Apple Pay is compatible with the iPhone 6, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPad Pro, iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 and later. The office-supplier already offers Apple Pay in Staples’ iPhone app for business customers, regular customers and in stores. If you plan on using Apple Pay in stores you can use iPhone 6 and later as well as Apple Watch. Grand and Toy, the company’s largest Canadian office-supply competitor, currently doesn’t offer Apple Pay on its mobile website. This is just one small move in the gradual growth of Apple Pay in the Canadian market as more Canadian banks have been adding the service to their roster including Scotiabank, BMO, TD, ATB, RBC, CIBC, Tangerine, Desjardins Canadian Tire MasterCard, President’s Choice MasterCard and American Express.

Apple has struggled in the cloud for much of the past decade while its competitors — basically every big name: Amazon, Google, Microsoft — have managed to create successful services or hosting platforms. Apple is now hoping to pick up the pace, according to Bloomberg, in part by moving all of its cloud service teams together under one roof. » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   You Might Like Other recent news in Technology Ghost in the Shell director defends controversial SCARLETT JOHANSSON casting MARK ZUCKERBERG warns about Facebook 'becoming arbiters of truth' DONALD TRUMP's environmental plan and more in the week that was Watch the largest SUPERMOON in 68 years Vudu's upgraded MOBILE APP brings offline rental viewing Cox brings its internet data caps to FLORIDA and Georgia The newest BEATS HEADPHONES combine rock solid wireless tech with awesome battery life Westworld vs. JURASSIC PARK: when playing god is clearly a bad idea A second Spectacles vending machine popped up in BIG SUR, California Hillary Clinton blames FBI email investigation for her ELECTION LOSS to Donald Trump Twitter Facebook Page People Donald Trump Gary Sinise Chevy Chase Leon Russell Dave Chappelle Current Topics New Zealand Earthquake Tsunami Christchurch Spotlight 📺 Live TV 📺 ONP TV Movie Reviews Totally Aesthetic Staff Stories Would Bernie Sanders Have Beaten Trump?

Unlike what happened with the previous iPhones, the iPhone 7 arrives only a month after Tim Cook took the stage in San Francisco and unveiled Apple's latest phones. Apple has also updated its previous lineup of devices. The Apple Watch Series 1 now comes with an upgraded chipset, the same one found in the Apple Watch Series 2. In addition to this, all the existing iPhone models have been given a memory boost. The 16GB storage variants have been completely done away with. The iPhone 6S starts from 64GB storage and goes all the way to 256GB. The 16GB variant of the iPhone SE has also been discontinued. Looks the same, yet radically different The iPhone 7 doesn't offer anything massively different in the design. Apple has only finetuned the design it achieved with the iPhone 6S. The antenna lines have become less apparent now, it is now a little lighter and there is no 3.5mm headphone jack. The new iPhones comes with an IP67 water and dust resistance rating, allowing them to survive under 1 meter of water for 30 minutes. They also now come with dual stereo speakers and there's two new colors- Black and Jet Black which comes in only 128GB and 256GB of storage. The home button too has received a makeover. It is no longer a physical button. Instead, Apple has put a capacitive, touch-sensitive panel connected to the same taptic feedback engine that is used for 3D touch in the display. While the screen size and the core technology behind the screens remain the same, Apple has boosted the brightness levels and added support for wide color gamut that is used in cinema displays. Powering the iPhone 7 is the new A10 Fusion processor which also happens to be first quad-core chip from Apple. Two of these cores are high-performance cores that Apple claims is 40 per cent faster than the iPhone 6S's A9 dual-core chip. The other two cores in the A10 Fusion chip are low power that come into play through an Apple designed controller, making the iPhone 7 more power-efficient. Apart from this, there is also a new graphics processor which is 50 per cent faster than the older generation chip. But the upgraded hardware aside, it's the camera system in the new iPhones that are once again the most attractive feature. The smaller 4.7-inch iPhone 7 gets a 12-megapixel camera with a 6-element lens and a wide f/1.8 aperture. There is also optical image stabilization, which was not there in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S. You also get a flicker sensor and a quad LED truetone flash system. Apple claims its new ISP on the A10 Fusion Chip can use machine learning algorithms to merge different images to form the best image among them. There is support for RAW format images. But it is in the iPhone 7, that Apple has weaved real magic. There's not one, but two 12-megapixel rear cameras. One of them is the 12-megapixel wide angle lens seen in the standard iPhone 7 while the other is a 12-megapixel, 56mm telephoto lens with f/2.8 aperture. The dual camera system allows for 2X optical zoom and with a later update, Apple will include the option to take information from both cameras and create a DSLR-esque blurred background. As for audio, the iPhone 7 ships with lightning earpods, along with a 3.5mm to lightning adaptor. But Apple has trained its crosshairs on wireless future. It has also released a pair of wireless earphones, called AirPod. The AirPod earphones uses a specially built chip by Apple for smarter pairing with the iPhone. They come with a case that also charges the earphones. The AirPod will arrive later in the month for a price of Rs 15,400. The iPhone 7 runs the latest iOS 10, which is one of the biggest upgrades of the operating system. You get a smarter, more open source Siri, an iMessage with its own app store and widgets, along with using machine learning across the OS to make it smarter. Apple also cares for your privacy by offering differential privacy. The iPhone 7 starts from Rs 60,000 for the 32GB storage variant, followed by Rs 70,000 for the 128GB storage variant and Rs 80,000 for the 256GB variant. The iPhone 7 Plus will cost Rs 72,000 for the 32GB which is the same price last year's big iPhone launched at. The 128GB variant will cost Rs 82,000 while the 256GB will cost Rs 92,000. The faster and smarter Apple Watch Series 2 In addition to the new iPhones, Apple has also launched the new Apple Watch Series 2 which will start from Rs 32,900. A special Nike+ model has also joined the lineup with dedicated Nike watchfaces and a perforated strap. You get a few dedicated Nike apps along, for the same price of Rs 32,900. Apple also launched a ceramic version of the Apple Watch named the Apple Watch Edition priced at a steep Rs 1,10,900. The Nike+ variant will arrive later in the month, and the Edition variant will be sold in limited numbers from today. Although the new Apple Watch look and feel the same as the previous one, it is 50 per cent faster thanks to the new S2 processor powering it. You also get GPS and a barometer which will come handy for fitness freaks. Apple has also improved the water resistance, allowing users to take the Apple Watch Series 2 for a swim. Apple makes use of the speaker grill to drain out the water from watch. The touch input on the screen is also suspended when the watch is under water. The new Apple Watch models come with 18 hours of battery life when used with the GPS turned on. Without it, it is even more. It runs on the watchOS 3 that uses a different memory management system to make the watch faster. The new OS update also bring s a host of new fitness focused features like the Breathe meditation app. Apart from this, Apple has also updated its older Apple Watch. It is now called Apple Watch Series 1 and comes with the new S2 processor. It starts from Rs 23,900.

Dash is quite a popular application from a lauded developer, Bogdan Popescu, and yesterday, when he broke the news, he had no idea what the reasoning was. Other famous Apple developers expressed their worries, and now we have an update from Popescu, with Apple's explanation: Apple contacted me and told me they found evidence of App Store review manipulation. This is something I've never done. Apple's decision is final and can’t be appealed. I can't update Dash for iOS anymore and I can't distribute it outside of the App Store. Dash for macOS will continue to be supported outside of the App Store. If you purchased Dash on the Mac App Store, you should migrate your license as soon as possible. At the moment you are not able to download Dash from your App Store's Purchases tab anymore, so if you lose access to your currently activated version of Dash you won't be able to migrate your license anymore. Apple has pretty much nuked his entire account from orbit. Even people who own Dash can no longer install it from the Mac App Store - they'll have to migrate their license. Dash for iOS can't be distributed this way, of course, and is pretty much done. Dash is quite a popular tool among Apple developers, and it seems incredibly unlikely that its developer would need to resort to manipulate App Store reviews, but obviously, none of us know the whole story. For all we know, a competitor manipulated the reviews. In any event, all this - again, sadly - illustrates what I've been saying for years: building your business atop Apple's iOS or Mac App Store is a terrible business decision. You are completely and fully at Apple's whim, and while you may have some recourse if you're favoured by Apple's popular bloggers who can bring your case to the limelight, if you're not... Well, too bad for you.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Extreme Rolling Update: The automobile is the next great app platform Rolling Update: The automobile is the next great app platform By Ben Algaze on October 6, 2016 at 2:02 pm Comment There’s no question information technology has invaded the automobile in a big way. Our once-state-of-the-art choices, as little as a decade ago, consisted of Bluetooth for our cell phones, a CD player, satellite radio for audio, and perhaps a rear-seat DVD playback system (here’s an example the current state of the art). Today our car infotainment systems may have cellular data connectivity, Wi-Fi hotspots for multiple devices, apps for various audio content sources, and apps to connect to navigation or otherwise enhance the “mobility experience.” We can thank the rapid evolution of the smartphone that has brought the underlying software and hardware technology to the mainstream, and also for stoking consumer demand to have the same connectivity choices in their cars as they have in their pockets. But while the technology in the car is similar, it’s not quite the same. Auto infotainment systems must interface with a variety of proprietary and industry standard protocols that have existed for years. There are some basic software layers: operating systems (tailored for automobiles), auto specific middleware, HMI (Human Machine Interface) middleware, and layers you might expect for auto applications and the all-important integration with smartphones. Source: IHS Markit Part of this shows the increasing complexity of the modern infotainment system. The chart above doesn’t really account for the complex architecture of adding autonomous driving, safety, and infrastructure aware applications that are being developed. Automakers are rapidly ramping up their software skills as the importance of the in-car infotainment experience becomes clearer. In a recent report by consulting firm PWC, 56% of new car buyers said they would switch to a different brand if the one they were considering didn’t offer the technology and features they wanted. Similarly, 48% of car buyers said they would walk away from a vehicle they liked if the technology was difficult to use. Clearly, connected applications and technology are becoming a much more important consideration in which vehicles consumers choose and buy. Infotainment systems are also figuring heavily into consumer perceptions of automotive quality. Ford’s well publicized problems with previous versions of Sync resulted in low ratings from Consumer Reports and JD Power quality surveys. The encroachment of computing technology in infotainment came on the scene years before the iPhone and Android smartphone revolution. Microsoft’s original embedded automotive solutions based on Windows CE, and later embedded Windows XP, made headway in infotainment over 10 years ago. Perhaps the biggest win for Microsoft was in powering the original (and maligned) Ford Sync. Ford’s current Sync 3 is now based on QNX. QNX, now part of Blackberry, has long been in the embedded space, and reportedly commands over 50% of the infotainment OS market. Operating systems based on open source Linux make up the rest, and industry consortiums like Genivi aim to develop Linux-based software stacks to standardize parts of the infotainment platform to accelerate innovation. It is the smartphone, its connectivity, and its wide range of application choices that is driving much of the innovation in infotainment systems today. Consumers want the same ease of use and choice of the smartphone in a way that is safe to use in cars. In that respect, automakers have responded by adopting smartphone interface technology in cars, sometimes with mixed results. Systems with touchscreens like Ford’s Sync and Cadillac’s Cue have been criticized for slow response and laggy input. In some instances, where automakers sought to replace hard buttons with touchscreen interfaces, they discovered usability suffered and went back to redundant physical controls for oft-used features like climate and audio control. Pinch to zoom is great on a smartphone, but it requires far more concentration in a moving car than when you are using a smartphone (and hopefully not using said smartphone while you’re driving). Scrolling through menus using touch – even when the performance is acceptable – is still not a great experience while driving. Automakers have continued to innovate on HMI, with gesture control, handwriting recognition on touchpads, and enhanced voice control all vying to deliver a better in-car experience. With the dominance of Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android, consumers are increasingly demanding the same familiar interface and app choices while they are moving. Automakers have responded by having their own miniature app ecosystems via partnerships with app developers and internet content services. Examples abound from all the automakers in recent years; Google search and maps integration for Audi and BMW systems, Garmin navigation and Yelp for Chrysler’s Uconnect system, Pandora streaming on a large number of automaker systems. Some rely on smartphone integration, and some have integrated connectivity (for example LTE on a variety of GM models) where apps can function on their own. Apple and Google’s smartphone dominance have practically forced automakers to offer support for CarPlay and Android Auto. In many cases, neither system (at least today) delivers functionality that isn’t offered on existing infotainment systems. Load up CarPlay in a new car, for example, and you get Apple Maps, messages, music, Siri, and a handful of compatible apps like Pandora. All of these functions have already been offered (sans Siri, but sometimes offered via live concierge services like OnStar) in existing infotainment systems. It does offer a familiar, if dumbed-down and simplified — but easier to use — experience that requires almost no knowledge ramp. The ultimate promise of CarPlay and Android Auto is to bring the rich app ecosystem of the smartphone platforms to the car. For automakers that didn’t originally employ touchscreen infotainment interfaces (notable German luxury brands like Audi, BMW, and Mercedes) they present a technical challenge to incorporate as well. The standardization of the infotainment interface can be a threat to automakers by taking away some of the differentiation in the in-car experience. On the other hand, it may be an opportunity as well. For example, automaker voice recognition/AI technology is no match for the sophistication of Apple’s Siri and Google Now/Assistant, or Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft Cortana for that matter. The opening up of these voice platforms will present new opportunities for automakers to offer applications that integrate the car (and its data) better with your personal information, likes, desires, home automation, and a host of other uses I’m not creative enough to foresee. While apps may ultimately dominate the interface and experience, part of the business model for both the technology companies and the automakers may be who controls the data. As Google and Facebook have built huge and highly profitable businesses from the consumer data they collect, automobiles are and will continue to be great generators of valuable data. Apple’s secretive and much-rumored car project reportedly held discussions with Daimler and BMW that fell apart over control of the data from the car. The automakers are wary, not only of ceding some control of the experience to the technology companies, but also of giving up future business opportunities with all the data that will be collected. The battle over the in-car interface will become more important as self driving capabilities become reality. When “driving becomes the distraction,” the ecosystem of apps and services become the mobility experience. The experience will not be about driving, but preparing for the activity ahead, learning more about where you’re going, or perhaps researching things of interest you otherwise might not have time for. This is where the ecosystem companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have inherent advantages with important technology positions across widely used information and entertainment services. You can’t count out other providers – too many to list – like Facebook, AT&T, Verizon, and others that will want a stake in the system. Automakers will have their work cut out for them to maintain their brand identity and customer image in an increasingly information-centric mobility experience.

By the time a Change.org petition lobbying for the rule change amassed 40,000 signatures, it was already a done deal. Although the eligibility revision was announced June 16, nearly a month after Coloring Book debuted on Apple Music, academy executives say it was introduced in March and ratified internally in May, two years after members first proposed allowing “free” recordings into the Grammy sweepstakes. “It’s important to note that we didn’t make this change for any particular artist because we felt, ‘Oh, this artist is not going to be eligible and that’s going to make us look bad,’ ” Recording Academy senior vp awards Bill Freimuth tells Billboard. “It’s really more about trying to stay ahead of changes in a very dynamic industry.” According to Freimuth and other academy sources, a rule change was first proposed in spring 2014. But it wasn’t until a year later that a subcommittee of digital industry players was formed to draft the version that was ratified. Grammy eligibility now extends specifically to albums streamed on Spotify, Tidal, Google Play, Apple Music and Amazon, which brings into the competitive mix Kanye West’s The Life of Pablo, by far the biggest release to qualify under these rules. (West is selling Pablo as a $20 download on his site, which on its own would not satisfy academy rules about commercial ubiquity.) Also presumably qualifying: Frank Ocean’s Apple-exclusive streaming video album Endless — although that odd, contract-fulfilling blip in his catalog likely will be ignored in favor of Blonde, the separate album Ocean put up for sale everywhere a week after its release. Ocean’s streaming-only Endless album and West’s The Life of Pablo will be eligible for Grammy consideration under The Recording Academy’s recent rule change.Courtesy Photo Right now, says Freimuth, “it appears that there are very few things that are available only through streaming. The vast majority of people want to monetize any way they can, and if you can pay your 40 bucks to TuneCore and get [an album] distributed everywhere, why not do that?” It turns out Chance jumped the gun when he tweeted in June that the Grammy rule change would affect “all the SoundCloud albums that may now be recognized for excellence.” SoundCloud is not among the big five streaming services counted by the Grammys. For a recording to be eligible, “it has to be on a full-catalog, audio-only subscription service,” and the service itself at least a year old, says Freimuth. “Though we didn’t know this was going to be the case, it turns out that gives us a year to examine what we’re going to do about the SoundCloud Go and YouTube Red audio-only subscription services,” which debuted, respectively in October 2015 and March. Streaming, in any case, is how most Grammy voters will hear the nominees. From the time the first ballot goes out in mid-October through the close of voting a month later, would-be nominees can post their recordings on the members-only Grammy PRO website, though typically only more obscure independent artists do. “If Joe Smith from Poughkeepsie has something he wants to get noticed for best improvised jazz solo, he can post it there,” says Freimuth. “I don’t think any [voter] is going to have too much trouble finding an Adele record if they need to hear that.” Once nominations are announced Dec. 6, the finalists will be cleared by labels and music publishers and streamed on a different section of the PRO site. Unlike the Academy Awards, the CD equivalent of a “screener” is not sent out, partly “because that would get very expensive when there are 13,000 voters,” and partly because the academy balks at sharing those 13,000 names. “Before my time, we had a partnership with a service where voters could purchase LPs at a substantial discount,” recalls Freimuth with a laugh, “and a lot of folks, I’ve heard, were sad to see that go away.” This article originally appeared in the Oct. 15 issue of Billboard.  FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Comments Magazine Customer Service Subscribe Buy this issue Billboard biz The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.

Dash developer Bogdan Popescu was given no explanation for why the app had been pulled aside from "fraudulent conduct," but after a conversation with Apple, he's been accused of manipulating App Store reviews. Popescu received a "Notice of Termination" email yesterday and his iTunes Connect account was shut down. Apple initially declined to offer more information, but after Dash's App Store removal started making headlines, Apple told Popescu it was due to App Store review manipulation, such as paying for positive reviews, something he denies doing. Update: Apple contacted me and told me they found evidence of App Store review manipulation. This is something I've never done. Apple's decision is final and can't be appealed.Despite Popescu's denial, Apple appears to be adamant that some sort of fraud took place. Apple's marketing chief Phil Schiller has stepped in and commented on the situation, through an email sent to Matthew Els, who asked him about the situation. Hi Matthew, Thanks for your email about this app. I did look into this situation when I read about it today. I am told this app was removed due to repeated fraudulent activity. We often terminate developer accounts for ratings and review fraud, including actions designed to hurt other developers. This is a responsibility that we take very seriously, on behalf of all of our customers and developers. I hope that you understand the importance of protecting the App Store from repeated fraudulent activity. Thank you, PhilAt this time, Popescu says that Apple's decision is final and the app will not be returned to the App Store. The developer community seems to be surprised by the accusation, with many calling Dash a quality app that wouldn't have needed to boost its reviews. @marcoarment @stroughtonsmith You see how many people now write good things about Dash? Busted. :)— Jacob Gorban (@jacobgorban) October 6, 2016 It's not clear what's going on, and the App Store reviews for Dash are no longer visible as the app has been pulled. As developer Steven Troughton-Smith points out, if Popescu didn't manipulate his own reviews, it's possible he's been targeted maliciously by a third party or that Apple's flagging system made a mistake. With Apple's Phil Schiller having looked into the situation, the latter option seems unlikely. Dash by @kapeli is used by thousands of devs and has been for years. I use it myself for my iOS reviews. They don’t need to buy reviews…?— Federico Viticci (@viticci) October 6, 2016 Dash for Mac remains available outside of the Mac App Store, and Popescu is encouraging Dash for Mac users to migrate from the Mac App Store version. It is unclear if the iOS version will be reinstated.

Especially if Phil looked into this personally, he'd have known the media fallout and confusion from this. Plus I don't just think it's a case of a competitor hiring fake reviews on his app — Apple would definitely have considered and looked into that. Now, the email from Phil said: "including actions designed to hurt other developers". What if we're looking at this the wrong way? What if he was hiring bots to spam bad reviews on competitors' products? There's something they're not telling us. The more I think about it, the more of a mystery it's becoming.

Rating: 19 Votes nagromme 6 weeks ago Speculation: maybe they used a bulk review/rating service, or a marketing service that includes that, and then when Apple was able to detect that kind of bulk, all of that service's clients got canned? (Probably not just this one.) Review spam and fake ratings are certainly a huge problem for App Store users, and I am not 100% certain that second chances are the way to go: then it's "may as well try the spam, no harm done if we're caught!" It's not as if there haven't been warnings against this for years. Now, IF it's a straight-up error and this company never used ANY such methods, I hope the error is corrected (as Apple generally does with their review/removal errors, though the remedy gets less blog attention than the initial Godwin's Law hysteria). Seems like a worthwhile app that need not game the system, and Apple can have a stated "no second chance" policy, but they can ALSO bend their decisions when called for. It happens. And if some fraudulent marketing company tricked this developer into not knowing what they were signing up to receive, I hope the dev can make a legal case against them. Similarly, if an attacker is behind this, taking actions PRETENDING to be this dev, I hope that comes to light (and it probably will, because this won't be the only victim). I find that sadly plausible. We may never know the facts. Won't stop us jumping to conclusions :) Rating: 18 Votes turbineseaplane 6 weeks ago This sort of stuff is precisely the worst part of a single gatekeeper to an App ecosystem / Place to earn your living.

The offer will go live on Snapdeal at 00:00 hours on October 7, 2016,” it said. Unveiled last month, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus would be available in India from tomorrow at a starting price of Rs 60,000 across multiple platforms. This is an exclusive partnership under which Amex is giving a special price to its card users when they purchase an iPhone 7/7 Plus on Snapdeal using an Amex card, Snapdeal said in an emailed statement. The discount can also be clubbed with the on-going exchange offers on the e-commerce portal on phones and zero cost EMIs, it added. “We have entered into a strategic partnership with American Express and are excited to bring yet another much sought after and iconic product to our customers with an attractive offer,” Snapdeal co-founder Rohit Bansal said. The latest version of Apple’s smartphone would be available on platforms like Flipkart and Tata CliQ as well. Tata CliQ is offering its customers Rs 10,000 deferred cashback with HDFC credit and debit cards (issued in India). The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be available in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB storage variants in silver, gold and rose gold colours. The new jet black colour variant will come only in 128GB and 256GB variants. While the 32GB phone will be available for Rs 60,000, the pricing of the other models has not been disclosed. iPhone 7 features a 4.7-inch display with 3D touch, while iPhone 7 Plus has a 5.5-inch Retina HD display with 3D touch. Both the smartphones are powered by a new quad-core Apple A10 Fusion processor, which it claims is 40 per cent faster than the previous generation.

PT Written by Dave Mark First read this morning’s post, about the Dash Mac app being suddenly removed from the App Store. This afternoon, Dash updated their blog with this chilling message: Apple contacted me and told me they found evidence of App Store review manipulation. This is something I’ve never done. Apple’s decision is final and can’t be appealed. Certainly, only Kapeli (the Dash developer) and Apple know if there was any App Store review manipulation. But this feels heavy-handed. Dash is a tool used by lots of developers. Not only does this hurt Dash, but it hurts the developers who use it. And this is being done, seemingly, without due process. One thing for sure, there is a big wave of developer response to Kapeli’s blog post and all of it (at least what I’ve seen) is supportive of Kapeli. That should tell Apple to take another look at the evidence. Dash just doesn’t seem like it needs App Store review manipulation. Prof. Peabody Depends on the details. What kind of manipulation and who’s doing it etc. Caleb Hightower We need some transparency here. Andy Orr What prevents a third-party from doing the manipulation to get a competitor removed? Apple should be forced to show the accused the actual evidence (just like in a real court of law). Steven Fisher I think you’re being excessively paranoid here. Dash even having a competitor would be a surprise to me. I think it’s more likely that something Apple did triggered their own fraud detection. Sumocat Zeal https://zealdocs.org/ Not suggesting they did it. Just surprising you. That said, I agree competitor is probably a step too far, but third-party is a plausible option, assuming both Kapeli and Apple are being forthright. Rather than a direct competitor, it could be a rival in another way. Could be a jerk who just doesn’t like Kapeli. Could be someone testing a review scam bot and Dash was the random unlucky test subject. Third-party leaves a lot of possibilities open. Steven Fisher Depending on how Apple measures, it could just be a bunch of users in a country known for posting fake reviews. I could see that as a real problem for development tools. Andy Orr I agree that a third-party manipulator is highly unlikely in this case. It could be attempted though, and my point was really that Apple needs to disclose evidence. I agree with Brent Simmons on this — http://inessential.com/2016/10/06/apples_judicial_system freedonuts Paranoid is thinking that Apple triggered their own fraud detection without noticing it.. The Cappy That’s not paranoid, though it might be wrong. We don’t know anything about Apple’s fraud detection theory, so we have no idea what’s likely or unlikely. That’s why the calls for transparency are so important here. mdelvecchio and revealing how it works could aid fraudsters. the reality is this is an internal matter between Apple and the guy. wince The whole “we have ‘evidence’, you can’t see it, we made a decision, you can’t appeal it” thing needs to be made illegal. Paypal does it, Amazon does it, and now Apple does it. (I’m sure others do, as well, those were just high-visible examples.) If Apple thinks there was manipulation, then present the evidence and let the developer defend themselves. This whole process is entirely subjective, so if someone has a bad day, doesn’t like the developer, or mis-reads something, “the decision is final” and too bad for you. There is simply no place for this kind of tyranny (and there’s no other word for it) in the area of a developer’s income. The Cappy It’s not illegal because devs sign an agreement saying they accept it. But it’s a process that can be misused, and the sense here from a lot of people is that this is a case where it’s being misused. mdelvecchio making it illegal is laughably absurd. it’s apple/whoever’s private playground, not a public park for god’s sake. getting a bad rap for being overly harsh is their incentive to not use their power inappropriately. rick gregory I really really dislike the whole “you can’t see the evidence and you can’t appeal this” BS. I have no love for any kind of fraud, but this approach is just too highhanded. David Stewart It bears keeping in mind that the Dash developer has no personal interest in releasing anything that might incriminate him. It’s easy to blame Apple, but I’m not going to blindly take the word of the developer. Mau Sandoval Looks like it was rather easy to blindly blame the developer. And it’s not like Apple’s policing of the App Store has never been unfair to any developer. There’s precedent. David Stewart Apple has certainly had its share of missteps with the App Stores and developers. Mau Sandoval Thinking about this a bit more, wouldn’t it be even dumber from Kapeli to make this public if they knew they were indeed caught red-handed by Apple? If they are fraudulent, they would’ve pack their things and invent something else on why they are no longer at the Apple Store. But I’m done here, we’ve all just wasted plenty of time on this. 😏 David Stewart It’s far easier to claim innocence and blame Apple. Apple is unlikely to produce the evidence as there are legal and privacy implications (and it’s not their style anyway). It is just a he-said she-said. The Cappy True. But as has been pointed out, it is a well-liked and very useful app. Hrunga Zmuda Truly unacceptable, and completely contrary to the image Apple projects about itself. Apple should be ashamed at the lack of appeal for such decisions. How would they like it if someone who worked for Apple were to be discriminated against by the government for being gay, or black, or from Pakistan, and told there is no appeal? If what this developer says is true, Apple has really shown an ugly side of their nature. David Stewart We don’t know that there weren’t many warnings and chances to change behavior. It would seem unlikely this is the first and final action. Ruurd Pels It really sucks. You could use the app to look up documentation on your iOS device that you requested on your laptop. Real killer feature apart from the excellent service we could get from it. I hope they fix it asap. The Cappy What’s troubling to me here is the idea that your first warning is application of the death penalty. If there’s been repeated violations, as Shiller says, shouldn’t they give a warning? Then with further violations, terminate the app? From what we’ve heard so far, that at least hasn’t happened. mdelvecchio heard from who? the guy accused? if he really were guilty of repeat offenses, why would his word be good? it isn’t and can’t be. none of us will know the facts and that’s just the way it is. Dean Lewis I find this whole thing a bit tawdry, actually. We are only getting one side of the story, and Apple has no obligation to say anything at all to us, the public. Among geeks and techs, many of us will discuss it a couple days and then it will blow over and maybe appear as a whiff of something when someone is dissatisfied a year or so from now. Among the vast number of users, it’s nothing. Beyond that, however, I’d like to see this given at least more time by the developer to work with Apple before it was plastered all over the Internet. I can understand frustration, but I think the developer moved too soon, and might have even pushed Apple to make a quick decision that even it didn’t do properly. We are all conditioned these days to think everything needs to be immediate, but that just isn’t the case for so many things, and we need to let it work itself out reasonably, rationally, over a decent amount of time. How long is that? Well, it certainly isn’t a day or less. Fahim Farook Dean, it sounds to me as if you’ve never actually dealt with Apple as a developer. Apple does not give you time to work things out. They just tell you “this is the case and this is what we’ve done” and that is the end of that. As far as I’m aware, you generally have no recourse to anything at that point except perhaps an appeal in the case of app reviews. So no, I don’t think the developer jumped the gun. They did the only thing they could (and the only thing that seems to have worked in the past) when you get arbitrary decisions from Apple. I’m not saying that the developer is right or that Apple is wrong since I don’t know the data which led to this decision. But to say that the developer going public is what prompted Apple to make a quick decision would be totally wrong. Apple had already made the decision. Dean Lewis He didn’t get an “arbitrary decision” until after his first public posting. It could have very well been a glitch or mistake. I believe he even questions it in his first post, but he makes no indication of what official channels he went to before the actual notification came. I’m holding out a decision for myself to support either side of this until we have more information. I maintain it didn’t have to be public yet, but it is, so I’m content to wait and see what happens. avbelow Phil Schiller has apparently looked into the matter, and says Apple stays with the decision. That does not sound as if Apple is doing it lightheartedly. Maybe Jim can get a better inside look? Dave Aiello All I can say is: 1) I use Dash every day that I am working on RinkAtlas, because it’s the best solution I’ve found to the problem of reading documentation for AngularJS, NodeJS, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. 2) I’ve contacted Kapeli once with a technical questions and Bogdan Popescu, the main developer of Dash responded to me personally in less than 12 hours and gave me the answer I was looking for. I would need to know more details before I’d say that Apple should take action against an indy developer like this. George The “truth” is that Apple is a big company and their process is probably highly arbitrary, just like Google or other companies. It took me more than a month to have a rip of my Android app removed that used my Android screenshots on Apple’s store.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     How to use Digital Touch in Messages for iPhone and iPad By Christian Zibreg, Oct 6, 2016 Tweet 5 Comments Digital Touch debuted as a sort of gimmicky feature of the Apple Watch software. On iOS 10, Digital Touch has made its way into the stock Messages app, making it easy and to add various effects to photo or video attachments, send sketches, taps, kisses, heartbeats and more. In this step-by-step tutorial, you’re going to learn how to express your feelings in style with the Digital Touch features on your iOS 10-enabled iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Digital Touch system requirements Digital Touch is supported on any iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with iOS 10 or later. Digital Touch-enriched messages created on iOS devices render properly on Macs with macOS Sierra, as well as on the Apple Watch with watchOS 3 or later. On the downside, you cannot send Digital Touch effects from your computer because Messages for Mac lacks a built-in Digital Touch interface. The Apple Watch permits you to send Digital Touch sketches, taps, your heartbeat and other animated expressions to friends and family, just like you can with Digital Touch on iOS 10 devices, with the sole exception of Digital Touch-enhanced photos and videos that do show up on the Apple Watch but cannot be created from your wrist. What you can send with Digital Touch Use Digital Touch to send the following things to your friends and family: Sketches Taps Kisses Your heartbeat Broken hearts Angry fireballs You can access Digital Touch features whilst responding to an incoming message, composing a new message from scratch or replying to anyone you have an open conversation with already. Creating animated sketches Digital Touch makes it easy to create sketches by way of drawing with your finger on the screen. Digital Touch-enhanced sketches animate for the recipient the way you drew them. 1) Create a new conversation in Messages or tap an existing chat in the conversation list, then hit the Digital Touch button, it’s the middle icon to the left of the Messages text field. 2) Tap and hold with one finger, then drag the finger across the Digital Touch canvas to sketch anything you want on the screen. To take the Digital Touch canvas full screen, tap the upwardly pointing arrow in the bottom right. You can sketch to your heart’s content before sending your creation. To use a different color, select it on the canvas then start drawing again. You can pick from any of the following colors: Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Purple White 3) Tap the circled up arrow to send your finished digital sketch. This is what an animated sketch will look like on the recipient’s end. To clear it and start from scratch, tap the “x” in the upper left while you’re in the canvas. Sending animated expressions In addition to sending quick sketches, Digital Touch supports sending a single tap or a more complex pattern comprised of multiple taps. As a cool bonus, Messages makes it easy to express your feelings with big, nicely animated hearts, kisses, fireballs and other objects. How to send taps Open Messages, tap the Digital Touch button to the left of the text field, then tap anywhere on the canvas with one or more fingers to create a burst of color. Your taps are sent automatically as soon as they dissolve from the canvas. You can also change the color for your taps. If you’re fast enough and change the color before your existing taps dissolve, you’ll be able to keep adding new taps to the sequence. Here’s what your custom tap sequence may look on the recipient’s end. On the Apple Watch, the built-in Taptic Engine produces a vibration on your wrist for each received tap or tap pattern. On the iPhone, a Digital Touch tap may produce a single vibration. Attention to detail: The entire tapping sequence is replicated on the recipient’s side in the correct order complete with the position of your taps. How to send kisses Open Messages and tap the Digital Touch button to the left of the text field. Next, tap the canvas with two fingers simultaneously, then let go to send an animated kiss to the recipient. Digital Touch kisses always appear in purple and changing color has no effect on them. This is what your digital kisses may look like on the receiving end. Attention to detail: The angle of the kiss graphics matches the angle between your fingers, as you’re seeing on the screenshot above. How to send a heartbeat Open Messages, tap the Digital Touch button to the left of the text field, tap and hold with two fingers on the canvas to produce a single animated heartbeat, then let go to send it away. Once the recipient receives your heartbeat, this is what they may see on their iPhone. Attention to detail: If you own an Apple Watch or another wireless sensor that captures heartbeat data, Messages will use it to send your actual heartbeat. Your Apple Watch-totting recipient will feel your captured heartbeat on their wrist. How to send a heartbreak To send a heart that splits in two, open Messages and tap the Digital Touch button to the left of the text field. Tap and hold anywhere on the canvas with two fingers until you see a heartbeat, then drag down to break the heart and then it will be sent to the person you’re messaging. You can tap and hold for as long as you like before you split the heart in two pieces. This is what the heartbreak will look like for the recipient. Attention to detail: For the recipient, the heart will pulse for as long as you were holding your fingers pressed against the screen before it ripped into two pieces. How to send a fireball Open Messages and tap the Digital Touch button to the left of the text field. Now tap and hold with one finger, or press and hold with one finger on 3D Touch-enabled devices, and let go to shoot an angry fireball at the recipient. This is how a person on the other side sees your fireball. Attention to detail: The animation will loop on the recipient’s end for as long as you were pressing the Digital Touch canvas with your finger. Pulling up animated expressions cheat sheet If memorizing all those gestures for animated expressions is proving too much for your gray matter (and you’re not alone: I, too, have a heard time recalling them), Messages has you covered with a built-in cheat sheet for Digital Touch gestures. To bring up an overlay listing all of the gestures required for producing Digital Touch taps, sketches and animated expressions, tap the area to the right side of the Digital Touch canvas. Animated expressions on Mac and Apple Watch As we mentioned before, animated expressions of your feelings will render properly in Messages for Mac and Messages for Apple Watch. You can also create and send these things from your wrist with Messages for Apple Watch (minus effects on photos and videos), Messages for Mac cannot create any Digital Touch-enhanced messages. TUTORIAL: sending animated Digital Touch expressions from Apple Watch How to draw over photos and videos In addition to applying Digital Touch effects to a black background, Messages supports sketching, drawing or stamping animated expressions on top of your photos or videos. 1) Create a new conversation in Messages or tap one of your existing chats in the conversation list, then tap the Digital Touch button to get to the canvas. 2) Tap the round Camera button on the left side of the canvas to invoke the built-in camera feature. 3) You can now tap the round black button to take a photo attachment, or start capturing a video attachment by tapping the round red button. 4) After the photo has been taken, add a Digital Touch effect to it. Digital Touch effects can only be added while the video is being recorded, not after the fact. 5) Tap the Send button to send your Digital Touch-enhanced media as an iMessage attachment. You cannot add Digital Touch effects to existing media in your Photos library. Instead, take advantage of a built-in Markup feature to edit photos or videos from your Photos library before they’re sent with Photos’ built-in editing tools, filters and vector drawing tools, without ever leaving the context of the Messages app. TUTORIAL: How to edit, annotate & manage attachments in Messages for iOS Messages for iOS deletes received video messages after two minutes, and this includes any Digital Touch-enhanced video clips. Your recipient can tap Keep below the message to save the video permanently in Messages, or tell iOS to always keep all received messages by selecting Forever in Settings → Messages → Keep Messages. TUTORIAL: using Messages low-quality image mode to preserve cellular data Unfortunately, iOS 10 does not provide a dedicated switch that would let you tell Messages to always keep received video attachments on the device.

The tech giant wants to bring the teams for Siri, Maps, iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple News, iTunes and Apple Music to its Infinite Loop headquarters in Cupertino, California, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. The teams are currently working separately in different offices, and developing for Apple remotely. Working under separate locations has contributed to software bugs and slow releases, according the report. Apple didn't respond to requests for comment. The move is likely motivated by a push to compete with Google and Amazon on cloud-based services. As Apple moves its cloud services teams together physically, the company also hopes to push them together digitally, said Bloomberg. A rumored project, code-named Pi, is expected to help Apple with its cloud services, providing faster loading times and more control by putting them on a single platform. Siri, iTunes and Apple News have already been moved to Pie, sources told Bloomberg.

Anonymous sources close to this issue have told Bloomberg that Apple plans to unify its cloud development teams in the same space, potentially making the production of services like Siri, Maps, iCloud, and Apple Music easier for everyone involved. Apparently the way things are now leads to “software bugs and slow product development,” according to the write-up, complaints that aren’t too uncommon from users of Apple’s Cloud services. Bringing all of these teams together could cut back on those bugs and bring about a faster development cycle, allowing these teams to launch new features to their respective products more frequently. Apple’s new campus, which is set to open next year, may facilitate this unification. Apple’s cloud teams won’t be moving to the company’s new campus, however, instead coming together at the old campus as other employees and teams move out. Whether or not this is all true is unclear, but it makes a degree of sense to bring these teams together, especially if it means fewer bugs and more features for Apple’s cloud services. Those are increasingly becoming a larger part of the company’s business, and bolstering their offerings would likely translate to more money. The report also says that Apple is developing its own system – codenamed Pie – to host its cloud services, potentially decreasing load times and making Apple less dependent on server hosting provided by competitors like Google and Amazon. Assuming that’s true, the idea that Apple would merge its cloud services teams becomes even more believable.

Kapeli Dash for macOS Blog Twitter Contact Ramblings from Kapeli's sole developer Home Archives About Menu Home Archives About Apple Has Removed Dash from the App Store Oct 5th, 2016 Earlier today, Apple cancelled my developer account and has removed Dash from the App Store. What Happened? I don’t know. Yesterday I sent Apple a request to migrate my account from an individual one to a company one. Once I verified my company with its D-U-N-S Number, they notified me that some features in iTunes Connect won’t be available during account migration. A while later my iTunes Connect account started showing as “CLOSED” and my apps were removed from sale. I thought this was normal and part of the migration. Today I called them and they confirmed my account migration went through and that everything is okay as far as they can tell. A few hours ago I received a “Notice of Termination” email, saying that my account was terminated due to fraudulent conduct. I called them again and they said they can’t provide more information. Update: Apple contacted me and told me they found evidence of App Store review manipulation. This is something I’ve never done. Apple’s decision is final and can’t be appealed. Going Forward I can’t update Dash for iOS anymore and I can’t distribute it outside of the App Store. Dash for macOS will continue to be supported outside of the App Store. If you purchased Dash on the Mac App Store, you should migrate your license as soon as possible. At the moment you are not able to download Dash from your App Store’s Purchases tab anymore, so if you lose access to your currently activated version of Dash you won’t be able to migrate your license anymore. I don’t know if/when things will go back to normal. © 2016 KapeliDesigned with at Zebra LabsLegal

Apple has struggled in the cloud for much of the past decade while its competitors — basically every big name: Amazon, Google, Microsoft — have managed to create successful services or hosting platforms. Apple is now hoping to pick up the pace, according to Bloomberg, in part by moving all of its cloud service teams together under one roof. Apple has been perpetually behind Google on cloud services That'll mean having the iCloud, Siri, Apple News, Apple Pay, and Maps teams, as well as parts of the iTunes and Apple Music teams, all at the Infinite Loop campus, rather than spread across multiple smaller sites, according to Bloomberg. One can question how much putting people in the same building can cure years of sluggish development, but Apple apparently thinks it'll speed things up and guard against buggy software. Perhaps more consequentially, Apple is also taking steps toward taking over the hosting of its cloud services, which are currently handled in part by Amazon and Google, according to Bloomberg. It's reportedly developing software, called Pie, meant to put all of its services in a single place; it's also said to be developing a photo storage system that Apple could host on its own. That might be a big help for Apple. Where Amazon and Google both offer limitless cloud storage options for photos, Apple charges its customers for anything beyond the bare minimum. It's led to real usability issues on both the iPhone and the Mac — we wrote yesterday about the iCloud pricing problem, and I discussed it extensively in my review of macOS Sierra, too. Apple getting it together in the cloud isn't simply a matter of bugs, it's likely also a matter of lowering costs so that it can match competitors' compelling offerings.

The company is under the Acacia Research Corporation's umbrella – a company referred to as the Mother of all Patent Trolls. Another subsidiary of Acacia Research known as Cellular Communications Equipment recently won a partial case against Apple. Apple was found guilty of infringing one of the five patents in the case. In this latest case with Parthenon, Apple put forth a motion to 'stay' or temporarily stop the judicial proceedings due to the fact that four of the patents that they're being accused of infringing are now in the process of being deemed invalid by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB).   Apple argued before the Court that "The parties expect final written decisions covering three of the patents-in-suit on January 6, 2017 and final written decisions on the other two patents by March 30, 2017. Apple requests that the Court stay the entire case through March 30, 2017 at which point the PTAB should have issued final written decisions in all of the pending IPR proceedings concerning the asserted patents."   The Judge's order issued yesterday states that "Having reviewed the Motion, the Court is of the opinion that it is in the best interest of judicial economy to SEVER Plaintiff's claims concerning U.S. Patents Nos. 7,321,368; 7,542,045; 5,960,464; and 5,812,789 (the "stayed patents") into a separate cause of action (the "new action"). Immediately upon such severance, the new action shall be STAYED until further order of this Court. As to the remaining claims which are not severed (principally concerning U.S. Patent No. 7,777,753 ("'753 Patent")), the Court ORDERS that Jury Selection for trial in this case is now set for November 4, 2016 at 9:00 A.M. The Court anticipates beginning trial in this case on Monday, November, 7 2016.   The above-entitled and numbered cause of action was referred to the Honorable Roy S. Payne for pretrial purposes. Judge Payne held a pretrial conference on September 14, 2016 during which he heard oral argument on the Motion. Judge Payne denied the Motion at the pretrial conference due to the advanced stage of these proceedings and the fact that the PTAB declined institution of IPR on five claims pertaining to one of the five patents-in-suit, the '753 patent.   On September 26, 2016, this Court vacated the referral of this case and reset Jury Selection from October 3, 2016 to November 7, 2016. (Dkt. No. 249.) In light of the above, the Court has carefully reconsidered the Motion as presented to Judge Payne at the September 14, 2016 hearing.   In view of the changed status of this case and the forthcoming date for the final written decisions covering all the asserted claims regarding two of the patents-in-suit during early next January, the Court is of the opinion that it is in the best interest of judicial economy to sever Plaintiff's claims concerning the stayed patents into a new action. Such new action shall be stayed until further order of this Court.   To assist in keeping this Court informed, the parties are ORDERED to jointly shall file a notice with the Court in the new action upon the issuance of any written decision or dispositive ruling from the PTAB concerning any of the stayed patents, with a courtesy copy of such notice delivered directly to chambers. Regardless, the parties shall file a joint status report with the Court on April 5, 2017 in the new action, with a courtesy copy of such report delivered directly to chambers.   Further, the Court ORDERS that Jury Selection is now set in this case for November 4, 2016 at 9:00 A.M.   The court order was issued on October 5, 2016 by U.S. District Judge Rodney Gilstrap, in the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division.

All employees working on Internet services such as Siri, Maps, iCloud, News, and Apple Pay will all be moved into Apple’s main Infinite Loop campus. The move is done to speed up product development and ultimately lead to a better services division. It it also unifying web products to run on a new backend, codenamed ‘Pie’. Apple is able to move employees to its Infinite Loop campus as other employees are being shifted to the new Apple Campus 2 which is nearly done. When the new campus is complete, Apple will not be shutting down the existing Infinite Loop campus. Instead, Apple will double its campus size and reduce reliance on rented buildings within Cupertino. Bloomberg says that most executives want to move their divisions to the new spaceship campus but Cue believes that the internet Services division will run more efficiently in Apple’s Infinite Loop campus. In addition, Apple is also looking to unify cloud resources that back its services like Apple Music, Siri, and News with the new ‘Pie’ backend system. Pie moves the entire cloud infrastructure into one single, Apple created platform. The report says some existing parts of Siri, iTunes Store, and Apple News are already running on the new backend.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Competitions GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: iOS 10 Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / News / Mobile Phone News / Apple has opened an academy and it's completely free Apple has opened an academy and it's completely free by Rupert Radley 06 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments Apple has opened an academy at a university in Italy, making it the first of its kind in the world. The tech giant is encouraging the growth of great developers by offering tuition in the art of app making. The course – which runs for 9 months – will cover coding, app design as well as start-up creation and is part of a plan to continue Apple's involvement in Europe. Watch: iPhone 7 vs 7 Plus The University of Naples Frederico II, Italy is hosting the iOS developer Academy, which is home to 200 students. As you can imagine, the course was hugely oversubscribed – apparently over 4,000 people applied. Fortunately, the course will be expanded next year, maxing out at 400 students. What’s more, thanks to a €10 million investment from both the university and Apple, the course will be completely free. Sounds good, right? Well it gets better. The Steve Jobs juniors will be given a free iPhone, iPad and MacBook to ensure that they’re equipped for learning. Plus Apple has been busy updating the university campus, designing open-plan classrooms to bring work and rest together. Related: iPhone 7 review "Apple thinks that all of these activities, learning and rest and so on, have to stay very close to each other, because this is the best way to ensure that the concepts are absorbed and understood very well”, Leopoldo Angrisani, the professor who created the course, told The Guardian. Tim Cooked has hailed Europe as being home to “the most creative developers in the world”. Apple is “thrilled to be helping the next generation of entrepreneurs in Italy get the skills they need for success”. Watch: iPhone 7 unboxing Is this the dream university course?

Toggle navigation Insanely Great Contact Advertising Submit Restaurants pioneering better service with Apple Watches October 2nd 2016 By Mike Flaminio Shake Hack founder Danny Meyer plans to deploy Apple Watches within his Manhattan restaurant. The restaurant will partner with reservation system startup Resy. Eater.com: When Meyer's 30-year-old Union Square Cafe reopens in Manhattan next month, every floor manager and sommelier will be wearing an Apple Watch. And when a VIP walks through the front door, someone orders a bottle of wine, a new table is seated, a guest waits too long to order her or his drink, or a menu item runs out, every manager will get an alert via the tiny computer attached to their wrist. Reportedly servers won't be wearing the Apple Watches, so it appears to at least initially be used to coordinate service by managers. My first thought is as the number of notifications increase on the Apple Watch I tend to ignore it more. Also I've just conditioned myself to ignore it when it would be inappropriate to be glancing at my wrist, then just check notifications at a later point. This keeps the Apple Watch from being overly distracting, but if the point is to relay critical notifications, it may be a challenge to be attentive to notifications and other tasks.

The tool would end the FBI's high-profile fight with Apple over access to the phone, but Bennett said there was no celebration. "There wasn't high fives, and there weren't people singing down the hallways," he recalled. "It was very much business. 'OK, let's move forward to the next steps. Let's get on the phone. What do we need to do to purchase the tool?'" The iPhone fight exposed a rift between the FBI and Silicon Valley technology companies over encryption, and sparked a debate about the right balance between privacy and national security. Bennett, 52, was a key figure in that battle as head of the bureau's digital forensics labs, which extract evidence from computers and other devices and were tasked with accessing the San Bernardino shooter's phone. Bennett is now in charge of the agency's San Francisco division, where he views his role, in part, as trying to bridge the divide between Silicon Valley and the FBI. He took over as special agent in charge of San Francisco in May after nearly 30 years in law enforcement. He started his career as a narcotics investigator with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and did a stint with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration eradicating cocaine smuggling operations in South America. He has investigated child sex crimes and animal rights extremists for the FBI and previously served as an assistant special agent in San Francisco. "The U.S. government sometimes loses sight of what is important to corporations ... and privacy is incredibly important," Bennett said during a recent interview at his office, where a Thompson submachine gun like the type used by agents in the 1930s sits in a glass display case on a coffee table. Still, he was unapologetic about the bureau's desire to access the phone. "We were pretty surprised that this turned in such a way that it became this national debate," Bennett said. "It was never intended to be. ... We were trying to get on one phone because we had 14 murdered people." The fight between Apple Inc. and the FBI centered on the work-issued iPhone 5c of Syed Rizwan Farook, who with his wife killed 14 people at a 2015 holiday gathering of county workers. The U.S. Justice Department demanded that Apple create software to bypass security features on the phone. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the FBI was asking his company to create a "back door" that could be used to unlock other phones, exposing customer data. Agreeing to the FBI's demand would set a dangerous precedent that could lead to other calls for Apple's help to obtain private information, Cook said. Apple vowed to fight a judge's order granting the FBI's request. It received support from technology giants including Google, Facebook and Microsoft, which warned in a court brief on Apple's behalf that the order would undermine the security of the country's most sensitive data. The two sides were gearing up for a court battle when the Justice Department announced in March that it potentially found a way to get into the phone without Apple's help. The Associated Press and two other news organizations sued the FBI in September to learn who the government paid and how much it spent to hack into the phone. Bennett declined to say who helped the FBI, though he said the business was among a number of U.S. and international companies that approached the bureau with potential solutions. FBI Director James Comey has hinted that the agency paid more than $1 million for the tool. Investigators found nothing of significant value on the phone, Bennett said. He disputed that the FBI was asking Apple for a tool that could access other iPhones, calling it a "one-shot deal." Bennett's desire to build a stronger relationship with Silicon Valley companies is laudable, but the two sides might never agree about encryption, said Denelle Dixon-Thayer, chief legal and business officer at Mozilla, which makes the Firefox web browser. "We can still have some healthy tension," she said. "I think that's positive." Ted Schlein, a venture capitalist with Kleiner Perkins who invests in computer security firms, said Bennett's technology background could help the bureau make better decisions about what to ask of Silicon Valley companies and how to get their help. Bennett acknowledged technology firms and the FBI might continue to disagree over data access, but said the need for dialogue will remain. "There are absolute, good reasons why companies have concerns about cooperating with the FBI. But there are also opportunities we should be able to talk to each other," Bennett said. "What's comfortable for a private corporation that will still provide an investigator the ability to stop or prevent a terrorist attack, a missing child or a national security incident?" © 2016 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple’s school for app developers has opened its doors to students in Naples, Italy By Christian Zibreg, Oct 6, 2016 Tweet 1 Comment Apple’s European iOS App Development Center at the University of Naples has opened its doors to students on Thursday. British newspaper The Guardian visited Apple’s school for programmers in the days leading up to the launch, showing off the facility in a batch of photos. The project was formally announced in January 2016. Specialized curriculum gives students practical skills and training on developing iPhone, iPod touch and iPad apps. Università di Napoli Federico II in Naples, one of the oldest universities in the world, is hosting the tuition. The university is providing a dedicated facility at its new campus in San Giovanni a Teduccio, a coastal suburb east of Naples, with specialized labs and access to the latest Apple hardware and software. Classes have commenced today in Apple-designed open-plan classrooms, with 200 mostly southern Italian pupils set to get their training on writing code based on Apple technology by the end of the year. According to Business Insider, that’s approximately a five percent admission rate—about the same as Harvard, Stanford and other elite colleges in the United States. All told, about 4,000 people reportedly applied for spots. Small groups of students will sit at round tables equipped with special acoustic systems so the teacher can communicate with each table individually about their work. All courses will be taught in English, since it is meant to be open to students from around the world. Couches and a lounge area in the other half of the classroom give the students a chance to rest. The Cupertino company was even involved on details such as the lighting in the classroom and the color of the walls. Each student will be handed the latest iPhone, iPad and Macbook at the start of the nine-month course. Courses are available at no charge thanks to a joint investment of about $11.6 million by Apple and University of Naples Federico II. The academy will be open to about 400 students next year. “We are thrilled to be working with Universita’ di Napoli Federico II to launch the first iOS Developer Academy in Europe,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO, in July 2016. Here’s what Tim Cook said when the initiative was launched in January: Europe is home to some of the most creative developers in the world and we’re thrilled to be helping the next generation of entrepreneurs in Italy get the skills they need for success. The phenomenal success of the App Store is one of the driving forces behind the more than 1.4 million jobs Apple has created in Europe and presents unlimited opportunities for people of all ages and businesses of all sizes across the continent. Both students and teachers can apply at the University of Naples website. The initiative should expand to other countries around the world.

The legendary Apple co-founder died on October 5, 2011 of respiratory arrest related to the pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor he was diagnosed with back in 2003. As we reported, Apple’s boss Tim Cook paid tribute to Jobs by sharing one of his famous quotes on Twitter. He also emailed a touching message to Apple employees, this part stuck with me: “Steve also taught me that life’s great joy is in the journey, not in any particular occasion or event. It’s not about shipping or selling or winning an award. The real joy is in getting there.” Here’s Cook’s full message to employees: Team, I know many of you are thinking of Steve today, as we mark five years since his passing. His presence remains strong here at Apple, and his influence is still felt profoundly all around the world. Personally, I think of Steve every day. His memory is an inspiration and source of strength for me, both in my job and in my personal life. I think of the bold risks he took as an innovator and a leader, and I think of the ordinary conversations we would have almost every day about our company, our customers, our families and friends. They are memories I will cherish forever. More than ever, our daily lives are shaped by the products and ideas Steve brought to life. I wish he could see how popular and powerful iPhone photography has become. And I know he would love the magic and emotion of our new Memories feature in Photos on iOS 10. Apple, the company he built and later rescued, is in many ways Steve’s most enduring legacy. He believed deeply that Apple should inspire us to do the best work of our lives, creating products that enrich the lives of others. Steve made Apple’s values very clear. He showed us how to focus on doing a few things extremely well, and to set the bar incredibly high for ourselves. He demanded that we always strive for simplicity, in our products and our approach. And he knew that by being collaborative within Apple, we could achieve things no other company could do. We owe all of Apple’s success over the past two decades to those basic principles. Steve also taught me that life’s great joy is in the journey, not in any particular occasion or event. It’s not about shipping or selling or winning an award. The real joy is in getting there. Steve was a special, unforgettable person. Thank you for being a part of his legacy, and for joining me on this journey as we carry it into the future. Tim What do you think of Cook’s email?

Creative Electron provided the site with X-ray images of the audio adapter which reveal a mystery chip, likely a DAC. As expected, one end is a simple female 3.5 mm headphone jack, and the other end is a male Lightning connector. But what’s all that silicon around the Lightning connector end? Most of the retail space near the connector is taken up by a single mystery IC. User oldturkey03 managed to slice his adapter open and reveal the markings on the chip. Unfortunately, they only tell us the chip is from Apple. He uncovered that mystery IC by the Lightning connector, marked 338S00140 A0SM1624 TW—which doesn’t tell us much, other than it’s an Apple part number. The chip is believed to contain a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and amplifier, as well as, an analog-to-digital-converter (ADC). So how well does the converter perform? German computer tech magazine c’t ran a bunch of tests on the adapter. Compared to the headphone jacks on the iPhone 6s and iPad Air, sound quality did drop ever so slightly. For example, playing an uncompressed 16-bit audio file saw the dynamic range drop from 99.1 dB at the headphone jack on the iPhone 6s to 97.3 dB at the adapter. However, the wouldn't be noticed by most listeners. Hit the link below for the full analysis!

Reply · Like · Mark as Spam 1 Curtix - October 6, 2016 at 5:23pm Of course it's a DAC. Apple said themselves that the lightening port output is a 100% digital signal. EarPods, speakers, headphones and anything else that vibrates and produces sound is by nature analog. Therefore, it is not possible that the EarPods and the adapter do not have an imbedded DAC. Also, since even the worst USB DAC's are gigantic compared to that lightening to headphone jack adapter, there is no way on earth that Apple did not make substantial compromises to sound quality to not include a headphone jack. The concept is (imo) stupid! Reply · Like · Mark as Spam . - October 6, 2016 at 7:30pm And people assumed the EarPods were the same. Jokes on them! @curtix I found it necessary not to have the jack, but overall I find the concept not as stupid.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel E-commerce major Snapdeal has partnered with American Express to offer the latter's card members a discount of Rs 10,000 when they buy the latest edition of iPhone from its platform. "....an instant Rs 10,000 off on Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus for American Express Card members. The offer will go live on Snapdeal at 00:00 hours on October 7, 2016," it said. Unveiled last month, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus would be available in India from tomorrow at a starting price of Rs 60,000 across multiple platforms. This is an exclusive partnership under which Amex is giving a special price to its card users when they purchase an iPhone 7/7 Plus on Snapdeal using an Amex card, Snapdeal said in an emailed statement. The discount can also be clubbed with the on-going exchange offers on the e-commerce portal on phones and zero cost EMIs, it added. "We have entered into a strategic partnership with American Express and are excited to bring yet another much sought after and iconic product to our customers with an attractive offer," Snapdeal co-founder Rohit Bansal said. The latest version of Apple's smartphone would be available on platforms like Flipkart and Tata CliQ as well. Tata CliQ is offering its customers Rs 10,000 deferred cashback with HDFC credit and debit cards (issued in India). The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be available in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB storage variants in silver, gold and rose gold colours. The new jet black colour variant will come only in 128GB and 256GB variants. While the 32GB phone will be available for Rs 60,000, the pricing of the other models has not been disclosed. iPhone 7 features a 4.7-inch display with 3D touch, while iPhone 7 Plus has a 5.5-inch Retina HD display with 3D touch. Both the smartphones are powered by a new quad-core Apple A10 Fusion processor, which it claims is 40 per cent faster than the previous generation. The iOS 10-powered iPhone 7 sports a 12MP iSight camera and 4K video recording. The iPhone 7 Plus has dual 12MP rear cameras -- one wide-angle and a telephoto lens. The handsets come with IP67 rating, signifying the fact that it is water and dust resistant, a first for the Apple smartphone. The Cupertino-based company is betting big on the Indian market. In July, Apple CEO Tim Cook had said that India is one of its fastest growing markets. In a separate statement, Snapdeal said it has sold over 11 million units during its Unbox Diwali Sale that started on October 2. "Snapdeal sold more than 11 million units during its Unbox Diwali Sale held from October 2-6, 2016. Fashion, home (general merchandise) and electronics were highest selling categories by volume in that order," it added. "The Unbox Diwali Sale has been a great success for us on all metrics. We saw a 4 times increase of new users who shopped at Snapdeal as compared to last Diwali," Snapdeal co-founder and CEO Kunal Bahl said.  Tags  E-commerce Snapdeal American Express iPhone Buy, Hold, Sell ?

Multiple people report unboxing their device for the first time to find that it’s already tied to another Apple ID account with Activation Lock enabled, making it impossible to use the new phones. Activation Lock is a useful feature for keeping other people from using your iOS device if it’s lost or stolen. However, if the security feature is showing up on brand new devices then clearly something is wrong. MacRumors noticed several people reporting the issue on its forums, with many more iPhone owners chiming to back up those claims. The Activation Lock issue appears to mostly affect new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models. Members of our staff have had similar issues after resetting the iPhone 6s Plus. One person reported buying a new iPhone 7 Plus and seeing an Activation Lock on the device associated with an iCloud email account they didn’t recognize. Another Apple customer noted that, after successfully activating a new iPhone 7 Plus, the old iPhone 6s suffered from the same issue. If you run into the issue, your best bet it to head to the Apple Store or call the official support line (1-800-MY-APPLE). The company should be able to fix the problem immediately, assuming you can prove you purchased the iPhone in question. That’s the troubling part of this whole problem: without a proof of purchase, you’re basically showing Apple an iPhone that might otherwise look like it was stolen. What a nightmare.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Fire can't extinguish Apple Valley congregation's compassion for community Thursday Oct 6, 2016 at 8:49 AM Oct 6, 2016 at 5:26 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — Despite a blaze that destroyed property on the campus of Church of Valley, the congregation has not been hindered in its efforts to bless the community. Three months after a teen was arrested for allegedly setting a fire that consumed three storage sheds, the church on Standing Rock Road in Apple Valley is preparing for its two-day, semi-annual rummage sale, which starts Friday. “We have two-acres of great bargains, with all proceeds going toward various church projects and ministries outside the church, such as Moses House and A Better Way,” said Dennis Pond, the self-dubbed Rummage Master of the church. “Friday is a our biggest day and we expect a lot of people.” Pond said “fortunately” the only contents that were consumed in the fire were a shed full of books and some electronic equipment, adding that, “We lost the sheds and a guard shack, but it could have been a lot worse.” Last week, Shed World replaced the three 400-square-foot sheds as the approximate 100 volunteers from COV and Set Free Ministries prepare for the “massive rummage sale,” Pond said. “We are blessed to have the men and women from Set Free coming out to serve the community,” Pond said. “They do most of the heavy lifting and we just couldn’t do this without them.” Pond said the amount of items donated by the community for the rummage sale is “staggering,” with the job of overseeing the project, with its mountain of donations, a yearlong task. “We have a lot of golf clubs, exercise equipment, kitchen appliances, refrigerators, washers, dryers, Christmas decorations, a Bowflex, treadmills, several bicycles, lots of linen and clothes,” Pond said. “There’s actually too many items to list.” Pond said the amount of people attending rummage sales in May and October is dependent on “the weather, the economy and the needs of the people,” with the majority of shoppers “young folks with families and middle-aged people.” "We're on a limited budget and our kids our growing so fast," said Darlene Taylor, 34, a single mother of three children. "The rummage sales gives me the chance to buy affordable clothes that fit now and clothes my kids can grow into." Taylor, an avid reader who lives in Apple Valley, said she also plans to purchase a few books, a lamp, a toaster and a jacket for herself. “We do this because we have a community filled with folks and organizations that need help,” Pond said. “We do this to bless others, because it’s just the right thing to do.” The rummage sales is scheduled from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Friday and 8 a.m. to noon on Saturday at Church of the Valley, located at 20700 Standing Rock Ave. in Apple Valley, just east of the Apple Valley Town Hall and Civic Center Park.

 How Apple could use Netflix to fight Amazon Nathan McAlone Oct. 6, 2016, 11:40 AM 3,872 facebook linkedin twitter email print Netflix CEO Reed Hastings Ethan Miller/Staff/Getty Images Earlier this week, Netflix stock popped over 4% on rumors that Disney might be interested in buying it. It’s not the first time Wall Street has buzzed about the idea of a Disney takeover of Netflix, nor is Disney the only company that has sparked Netflix acquisition rumors. One of the other companies that comes up again and again is Apple, as it’s one of the only ones that could both afford to buy Netflix, and seems to have (largely thwarted) ambitions in TV. But does Apple buying Netflix make sense? In a note on Wednesday, analysts from Bernstein laid out the case both for and against such a purchase. They concluded that while buying Netflix would bolster Apple in certain ways, a partnership between the two companies was much more likely.  Apple's problem The most compelling reason the Bernstein analysts gave for an acquisition was that it could help Apple create its own bundle to combat Amazon Prime, and move Apple away from a transactional business model towards a subscription-based model. If Apple keeps selling you one iPhone at a time, Bernstein thinks Apple is in bad shape. Here’s how the analysts broke down Apple’s future woes: “Apple has a business model problem. The key challenge is that Apple's business principally involves selling hardware — most notably iPhones, iPads, and Macs. The iPhone alone amounts to ~70% of total company profits today. Over time, smartphone penetration will invariably reach saturation, Apple will no longer be able to gain share, and the iPhone business will essentially become a replacement market.” Beyond the iPhone market becoming a replacement market, which is bad in itself, the analysts think people’s iPhone upgrade cycle will get longer, so that replacement market will get less valuable over time. The takeaway is that if Apple continues to play the same game, it will see its profits dwindle. Apple Prime Bernstein has a solution to Apple's big problem: subscriptions. “We believe that Apple should look to sell its hardware offerings as a subscription service rather than as transactional product sales, by offering a compelling and attractively priced services bundle (think ‘Apple Prime’) along with any hardware that is purchased on a subscription plan,” the analysts wrote. So how does Netflix fit in? The analysts say that services and features would be a key to making the subscription model work, and Netflix could help ease Apple fans into the subscription lifestyle. “Netflix's inclusion in Apple subscription bundles could be important, given that consumers are conditioned to purchase Netflix and other video content on a monthly subscription basis,” the analysts wrote. Better partners But the main issue with a potential acquisition is that Apple could still include Netflix in its bundle without actually buying the company, but instead through a deep partnership. “In fact a partnership with Netflix could be mutually beneficial,” the analysts wrote. “Directionally, we believe that Apple and Netflix could look to sell Netflix for $8 or $8.50 per month (vs. $10 currently) to ‘Apple Prime; users (i.e., those consumers who pay for their iPads or iPhones on a subscription basis). A reduced price on Netflix would be part of a broader offering of services to attempt to entice Apple users to migrate to subscription plans. Alternatively, Apple could pay Netflix to provide unique programming and content only to its ‘Apple Prime’ users.” Apple and Netflix could split the cost of the price reduction, Bernstein argues, especially if Netflix could use it to snag new customers. Bottom line: “While the Netflix deal could potentially cost Apple $10+ per user per year, we believe this would be an attractive trade-off to lock in a user to a more predictable annuity revenue stream, and could not only attract new customers, but also could potentially lower churn for Netflix.” Putting together a "lifestyle bundle" would help Apple take on Amazon, which has seen tremendous growth in its Prime program. One potential edge for Apple is that it can make iOS and the iPhone the center of its subscription offering, and use that to drive interest in services and other products like iPads or Apple TVs.  SEE ALSO: Why CBS isn't worried about tanking NFL ratings NOW WATCH: Forget the Oculus — PlayStation VR is the virtual reality platform to own Loading video...

(ANSAmed) - Naples, October 6 - US technology firm Apple on Thursday opened its first European iOS Developer Academy in Naples. The European training academy of the world's biggest tech company kicks off in partnership with the University of Naples Federico II and will be located at the college's San Giovanni a Teduccio campus on the city's eastern outskirts. The Academy's nine-month-long course will start on Monday, with a first wave of 100 students enrolled from around the world. The students were selected from a reported 4,000 applicants for the program, including many from southern Italy. Academy courses will be free and some of the students will have scholarships. "Apple's Academy kicks off, as promised with (Apple CEO) Tim Cook", Premier Matteo Renzi tweeted on Thursday. "Naples has a lot of future ahead - if the south gets started again, Italy gets started again". The location of Apple's first Developer Academy in Europe was first announced in January when Apple CEO Tim Cook visited Renzi in Rome. The governor of the Campania region around Naples, Vincenzo De Luca, said Thursday at the Academy's inauguration ceremony that the regional government had invested 100 million euros in the project and has pledged another 30 million. An additional seven million euros will fund scholarships and free transport services for students, De Luca said, calling the Academy an "extraordinary occasion" for southern Italy. Academy students will be taught how to write code to create apps that will run on iOS devices during the course. They will be provided with a current-generation MacBook, iPhone and iPad. More spots will reportedly be available in next year's program. According to data released by Apple in January, when it announced the launch of its first European iOS developer academy, the company "has contributed in creating over 1.4 million jobs, including 1.2 million attributable to the community of app creators, software engineers and entrepreneurs building apps for iOS, as well as non-IT jobs". The App store has helped developers in Europe earn over 10.2 billion euros from selling their apps around the world, the company also said. In Italy, over 75,000 jobs are reportedly attributable to the App Store. The University of Naples Federico II is the oldest public university in the world and the third university in Italy ranked by enrolled students.

By: PTI | New Delhi | Published: October 6, 2016 9:05 PM E-commerce major Snapdeal has partnered with American Express to offer the latter’s card members a discount of Rs 10,000 when they buy the latest edition of iPhone from its platform. E-commerce major Snapdeal has partnered with American Express to offer the latter’s card members a discount of Rs 10,000 when they buy the latest edition of iPhone from its platform. “….an instant Rs 10,000 off on Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus for American Express Card members. The offer will go live on Snapdeal at 00:00 hours on October 7, 2016,” it said. Unveiled last month, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus would be available in India from tomorrow at a starting price of Rs 60,000 across multiple platforms. This is an exclusive partnership under which Amex is giving a special price to its card users when they purchase an iPhone 7/7 Plus on Snapdeal using an Amex card, Snapdeal said in an emailed statement. The discount can also be clubbed with the on-going exchange offers on the e-commerce portal on phones and zero cost EMIs, it added. “We have entered into a strategic partnership with American Express and are excited to bring yet another much sought after and iconic product to our customers with an attractive offer,” Snapdeal co-founder Rohit Bansal said. The latest version of Apple’s smartphone would be available on platforms like Flipkart and Tata CliQ as well. Tata CliQ is offering its customers Rs 10,000 deferred cashback with HDFC credit and debit cards (issued in India). The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be available in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB storage variants in silver, gold and rose gold colours. The new jet black colour variant will come only in 128GB and 256GB variants. While the 32GB phone will be available for Rs 60,000, the pricing of the other models has not been disclosed. iPhone 7 features a 4.7-inch display with 3D touch, while iPhone 7 Plus has a 5.5-inch Retina HD display with 3D touch. Both the smartphones are powered by a new quad-core Apple A10 Fusion processor, which it claims is 40 per cent faster than the previous generation. The iOS 10-powered iPhone 7 sports a 12MP iSight camera and 4K video recording. The iPhone 7 Plus has dual 12MP rear cameras — one wide-angle and a telephoto lens. The handsets come with IP67 rating, signifying the fact that it is water and dust resistant, a first for the Apple smartphone. The Cupertino-based company is betting big on the Indian market. In July, Apple CEO Tim Cook had said that India is one of its fastest growing markets. In a separate statement, Snapdeal said it has sold over 11 million units during its Unbox Diwali Sale that started on October 2. “Snapdeal sold more than 11 million units during its Unbox Diwali Sale held from October 2-6, 2016. Fashion, home (general merchandise) and electronics were highest selling categories by volume in that order,” it added. “The Unbox Diwali Sale has been a great success for us on all metrics. We saw a 4 times increase of new users who shopped at Snapdeal as compared to last Diwali,” Snapdeal co-founder and CEO Kunal Bahl said. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (63) Post your comment Apple supplier statistics suggest very strong holiday season sales 06 October 2016 Apple's market figures have always been that little bit harder to predict and accurately source. A lot of this has to do with Cupertino's typical discreteness when it comes to revealing sales figures. It also doesn't help that so many analysts and third parties take interest in the matter and publish their own reports. However, a typically accurate way to approach things is to examine Apple's vast supplier chain that is often a lot more willing to share information. In the latest such development, Dialog Semiconductor has reported notable positive earnings. RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani dug into this a little further. According to him Dialog has raised its past quarter earnings expectations by 13% from $290 million to $320 million, now up to $345 million. Apparently Apple typically accounts to 75 to 80 percent of the company's revenue and Cupertino tends to build iPhones 60 days out. Putting two and two together, it becomes quite clear that Apple is preparing from strong sales in the last quarter of 2016. There are a few other observations to back this prediction up as well. First of all, Daryanani points out better than expected preliminary carrier data points. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus duo are proving quite popular. Furthermore, a recent RBC survey among prospective buyers has noted a shifting tendency towards higher priced products. This includes 46% interest in the bigger 5.5-inch handset, up from 38% last year. Also, as far as storage options go, users seem to be more inclined to go for a 128GB model, rather than the now base 32GB one. Naturally, Apple makes more on those. Last, but not least, people seem to be warming up to other company products, like the Apple Watch with 17% interest, compared to 13% last year and Apple Pay - up from 16% to 24%. Plus, we can't fail to account for the whole overheating/battery fiasco Samsung has been going through with the Galaxy Note7. It is sure to excerpt some influence on sales as well. Taking everything into account, Daryanani now estimates a $125 target for Apple stock in Q4. As for revenue, he has raised his Q3 prediction to $47.3 billion from a total of 44.2 million iPhone unit sales. For the upcoming Q4, the numbers are $78.7 billion and 79 million handsets shipped.

The latest update to Apple’s very own navigation system allows users to figure out how they’d get from sea to shining sea via rail. The update builds upon Apple’s previously unveiled support for northeast routes, but seeing as Amtrak runs across the entirety of the country, so too now does Apple Map’s coverage. Whether you’re traveling in the Midwest, Northwest, South, or West (or even in Montreal and Vancouver), you can plan your trip using Apple Maps. Directions are actually quite detailed, as Apple Maps will tell you what time you need to leave your current location, what Amtrak route you’ll need to take, where to transfer, and all those other little details that make planning a trip so stressful. But now that it’s all spelled out on your phone, maybe taking that fall break will be a little less anxiety inducing. Related: Google Maps gains Google Calendar integration, food pic album for restaurants Of course, in order to take advantage of these new features, you’ll have to live in a city where Apple’s mass transit directions are available — so if you’re starting out or ending up in an idyllic spot in the middle of nowhere, you may need a bit more help than just Apple Maps. All the same, it’s a significant step up from what was previously available, and just might make traveling this holiday season less of a hassle. A full list of supported routes can be found below: MIDWEST • Blue Water operating between Chicago and Port Huron, Michigan. • Wolverine operating between Chicago and Pontiac, Michigan. • Cardinal operating between Chicago and New York City. • Southwest Chief operating between Chicago and Los Angeles. • Texas Eagle operating between Chicago and San Antonio. • California Zephyr operating between Chicago and Emeryville, California. • City of New Orleans operating between Chicago and New Orleans. • Empire Builder operating between Chicago and Portland/Seattle. • Illinois Service operating between Chicago and Carbondale, Illinois. • Pere Marquette operating between Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Chicago. • Capitol Limited operating between Washington, D.C., and Chicago. • Hoosier State operating between Indianapolis and Chicago. • Hiawatha operating between Milwaukee and Chicago. • Missouri River Runner operating between St. Louis and Kansas City in Missouri. CALIFORNIA • Capitol Corridor operating between Auburn, California, and San Jose, California. • Coast Starlight operating between Seattle and Los Angeles. • Pacific Surfliner operating between San Luis Obispo, California, and San Diego. • San Joaquins operating between San Francisco area and the Bakersfield area in California. • Sunset Limited operating between New Orleans and Los Angeles. SOUTH • Auto Train operating between Lorton, Virginia, and Sanford, Florida. • Carolinian operating between New York City and Charlotte, North Carolina. • Crescent operating between New York City and New Orleans. • Silver Service/Palmetto operating between New York City and Tampa/Miami. NORTHWEST • Amtrak Cascades operating between Vancouver, B.C., and Eugene, Oregon. WEST • Heartland Flyer operating between Oklahoma City and Fort Worth, Texas. Additional northeastern routes such as the Adirondack, operating between Montréal, Québec and New York, and the Downeaster, operating between Brunswick, Maine, and Boston, are also now supported.

According to Japanese blog Mac Otakara, Apple’s planning a blowout presser at which multiple new iPads are set to launch. The report, courtesy of a “reliable source,” indicates three iPads differentiated by size will launch this spring. The 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch models are reportedly due for a hardware refresh, somewhat predictably. But a new model is joining the burgeoning Pro series, too, in the form of a 7.9-inch iPad intended to succeed the aging iPad mini 4. Related: Apple debuts international versions of the iPad Pro’s Smart Keyboard The new 7.9-inch model will occupy a lower pricing tier than both the 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch iPad Pro models. But despite its budget price tag, the undersized iPad Pro will inherit most, if not all, of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro’s features. A four-speaker array is reportedly in tow, along with a True Tone screen that relies on ambient light sensors to adjust display colors in response to surroundings. It reportedly packs Apple’s proprietary Smart Connector, a conductive material that enables the two-way flow of both power and data. And it likely sports an iSight camera with LED flash array, though its megapixel count and aperture remain a mystery. The comparatively mundane new 12.9-inch iPad is expected to gain a True Tone display. It will reportedly retain the four-speaker sound array and rear-facing iSight camera of the current-generation model. All three new iPad Pro tablets are due for a microphone upgrade, apparently — they will sport quad microphones as opposed to the dual models found on the soon-to-be-outmoded iPad 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch. And they are expected to retain the 3.5mm headphone jacks. Related: How to choose an iPad: A practical guide to Apple’s tablets The new scoop corroborates some of a report published earlier this year by market researcher Ming-Chi Kuo. Kuo, who has a proven track record when it comes to Apple rumors, told investors that the Cupertino, California-based firm was planning to release 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and low-cost 9.7-inch iPad in the next few months. On thing is for certain, though: Apple needs a tablet hit. The company’s third-quarter earnings call in July painted a grim picture of Apple’s once-thriving iPad business — overall sales declined to 10 million from 10.9 million the year prior. Its higher sticker price managed to prop up profits, but the company is likely hoping upgraded models will reinvigorate sales early next year. Mac Rumors notes that Mac Otakara has a mixed track record when it comes to Apple rumors. It accurately reported Apple’s plans to remove the 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7, the inclusion of a Lightning-to-3.5mm audio adapter, and the move from a physical home button to touch-sensitive alternative. But the publication incorrectly pegged the launch of a new MacBook Air models with USB-C ports as “the end of June.” As of early October, Apple had yet to refresh its MacBook lineup.

According to research from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple will sell fewer Apple Watch units during 2016 than it did in 2015. The reason behind this? According to Kuo, the Apple Watch lacks “killer” applications, suffers from an inadequate battery life, and is currently too reliant on the iPhone to properly function. Kuo’s notes were recently obtained by Business Insider detailing his predictions for the Apple Watch. Related: Health insurance giant Aetna to subsidize Apple Watch for its customers The Apple Watch has so far failed to impact sales of devices like the Fitbit, according to Kuo, who goes on to say that the more affordable Series 1 Apple Watch will not necessarily lead to higher sales of the device. Because of what Kuo sees as shortcomings, he has cut his estimates for Apple Watch shipments this year by as much as 15 to 25 percent. It is likely we will not know how many shipments of the Apple Watch are sold — the company does not break down sales numbers for the device and it never detailed how many units it has sold since April 2015, which is when it first started selling the watch. Estimates for sales vary pretty widely, but generally fall in between 1.6 million and 2.2 million units. The decrease in sales does make sense, to an extent. The Apple Watch Series 2, while a great device, did not include as many new features as some were hoping. The device looks identical to the original Apple Watch, however it is waterproof and a slightly brighter display. It is possible that the 2017 Apple Watch will change things — it is expected that the new device will come with a redesign and all-new specs, which could lead to higher sales.

October 6, 2016 WSP On Tuesday, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) launched its own-brand smartphones, risking its relationship with current hardware partners. Based on the latest statistics, four out of five smartphone users use Android, making it the leading smartphone operating system (OS) across the globe. Google, who is the creator of the said operating system held a hardware event on Tuesday where they launched their newest smartphones – the Pixel and Pixel XL , as part of a batch of new devices aimed at grabbing market share from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Along with these gadgets, Google also introduced “Google Home”, a voice-responsive “smart speaker”, a VR headset, Wi-Fi routers and the latest version of its Chromecast streaming device. Google’s Partnerships at Stake According to analysis firm IHS Markit, Android may not be as dominant as the search giant thinks. In relation to Google’s recently launched Pixel smartphone, industry analysts say there are many factors that can potentially hurt Google’s relationship with manufacturers that currently rely on the software. “We’re putting a stake in the ground for the Android ecosystem in terms of what we think is the best from both the software and hardware point of view, which has been developed and made by Google,” stated James Nugent, Pixel’s product manager. The newly-launched smartphones are Google’s first devices to carry their branding without being associated with another manufacturer. A few years back the Mountain View, Calif.-based company partnered with hardware manufacturers like Samsung, LG, Motorola and Huawei to incorporate its software into other devices in an attempt to showcase the viability of Android as the leading OS choice for smartphone users. With the new release of its own hardware, Google has followed in the footsteps of Apple in terms of creating its own ecosystem. This strategy besides putting Google’s relationship with current hardware partners at stake, marks also the beginning of the fight between the two tech giants for the top premium smartphone. Taking on Apple’s iPhone: A Quick Look at Google’s Pixel In an attempt to take on Apple’s iPhone, Google went as far as attacking iPhone’s storage capacity. The company did that by showing a ‘storage full’ message from an iPhone, something Google said its smartphones would avoid with unlimited full res photo and video (4K included) backup using Google Photos’ cloud storage. Google Pixel has a 5-inch screen while Pixel XL is a little bit wider at 5.5 inches, both with elegant aluminum bodies. Both the smartphones have Snapdragon 821, the latest processor from Qualcomm. They are also run by the most recent version of Android 7.1 Nougat. The Pixel smartphones have 12-megapixel cameras which were awarded a rating of 89 by DxOMark, a camera analyst of over 9000 cameras, lenses, and mobile phones. Thanks to their large 1.55 micrometre pixels that help enhance photos taken on low light. The Pixel’s camera is currently the highest ranked smartphone camera, surpassing Apple’s iPhone 7 and Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge with a ranking of 87 and 88 respectively. Another important Pixel feature is the new Google Assistant. Of course, it works just like Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri. The Google Assistant replaces Google voice search and Google Now which was previously available to other Android smartphones. Google Pixel (5-inch) and Pixel XL (5.5-inch ) are meant to be the most powerful and most unified Android phones ever. Both models come in three different color options: Very Silver, Quite Black and Really Blue and are the same price as the iPhone 7, starting at $649 for the small one and $769 for the big one, or you can pay monthly for $27 a month. The smartphones will be available from Verizon and unlocked through the Google Store. They will be compatible with all four major U.S. carriers, too, as well as Project Fi.

The feature eliminates the requirement to manually fill out account, shipping, and billing information repeatedly for a more seamless checkout experience. Likewise, British low-cost airline easyJet, the second-largest airline in Europe by number of passengers carried, has announced that customers can now use Apple Pay in Safari for bookings made on easyJet.com, including both its desktop website on Mac and mobile website on iPhone and iPad. Apple Pay on the web works with iPhone 6 and later, iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, and iPad mini 3 and later. iOS 10 or later is required. Meanwhile, in Russia, Apple Pay can now be used at select BP gas stations in the Moscow, Saint-Petersburg, Pskov, Tver, Smolensk, and Novgorod regions, in addition to on the web with Safari for Russian airline Aeroflot, including both its desktop website on Mac and mobile website on iPhone and iPad. Apple Pay officially launched in Russia earlier this week, two years after its U.S. debut. The mobile payments service is also available in Australia, Canada, China, France, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Switzerland, with New Zealand, Japan, Taiwan, and other regions set to follow in the near future. Apple Pay on the web is a new feature in Safari on iOS 10 and macOS Sierra, expanding upon in-store and in-app payments. The feature started rolling out in September on websites such as Indiegogo, StubHub, and Wayfair, with other committed partners including Airbnb, Fandango, Target, Ticketmaster, and more.

Convergence coming together in multiple industries and spanning differential market segments being made easier to live with/deal with for the sake of making our lives better using technology and mobile computing products. I like Apple Pay and trust Apple Pay so even as little as I fly this is an added bonus and an important feature; the more easily this gains traction, the easier this will be facilitated by more mainstream airlines, including more companies in more cities (including the USA). USVet Rating: 1 Votes jayducharme 5 weeks ago That would definitely cause me some concern. How did you resolve this? Since the transaction didn't go through, I pulled out my debit card and swiped it the "old fashioned" way. The clerk had no clue how Apple Pay was supposed to work in the first place (which might have been part of the problem). My iPhone would give me the "transaction complete" message, but it wouldn't appear in Wallet. I checked my bank statement after and it did show only one transaction (the swipe). There have been other times when I haven't had any problem at Staples, but it's really inconsistent. On the other hand, Apple Pay always works reliably at my local grocery store and Walgreens. So I assume the problem is with Staples.

Currently, most cloud services are developed separately at rented out office parks. Bringing the teams together will hopefully improve growth, help minimize bugs, speed up product development, and fight competition from Google and Amazon. Of course, many Apple executives want to relocate their teams to the new campus being built. A committee of managers is working to reorganize Apple across its various spaces. Originally, Apple expected 13,000 employees to work at Apple Campus 2. That number is now said to increase by thousands and Apple is adjusting internal office space to account for the additional workers. Only management at a vice president level or higher will get a formal office at the new campus, said a source. Previously, senior directors were to get office space. Employees will find bench seating, long work tables, and open cubicle spaces at the location, potentially upsetting those who are used to quiet office environments. Bloomberg also reports that Apple is reorganizing its cloud computing resources, moving infrastructure onto a single, Apple made system. The platform is codenamed 'pie' and it gives the company more control and possibly faster load times. Apple has begun moving over parts of Siri, the iTunes Store, and Apple News to the new platform, one of the people said. Apple plans to move other services, including Maps, to its new system over the next few years. Apple has also developed an internal photo storage system dubbed McQueen to gradually end its reliance on Google and Amazon servers, the people said. More details at the link below...

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple’s iPhone 7 Lightning headphone adapter packs in a surprising amount of circuitry By Christian Zibreg, Oct 6, 2016 Tweet 20 Comments Repair wizards over at iFixit along with their pals at Creative Electron gave Apple’s new $9 iPhone 7 Lightning headphone adapter a thorough X-ray treatment. The analysis has revealed a surprising amount of circuitry inside of the dongle. Most notably, it packs in a pretty unique integrated circuit that’s most likely a built-in digital-to-analog (DAC) converter. There’s actually a lot going on in the diminutive adapter aside from the DAC, writes iFixit, including things like an integrated amplifier and an analog-to-digital-converter (ADC). “We’re surprised how much electronics Apple was able to include inside this little cable,” said Creative Electron, which builds X-ray inspection systems for electronics. Prior iPhones handled both DAC and ADC functions internally via a custom Apple/Cirrus Logic chip on the logic board. The X-ray analysis of Apple’s headphone dongle reveales integrated circuitry marked “338S00140 A0SM1624 TW”. iFixit and Creative Electron think it’s most likely some sort of a DAC chip. The dongle connects legacy 3.55mm headphones to the iPhone 7, with one end providing a standard female 3.5mm port while the other is a male Lightning connector. Here’s a visual comparison of the CirrusLogic audio chip on the iPhone 7’s logic board next to the exposed DAC/ADC/amplifier chip in the new Lightning headphone adapter. The larger iPhone 7 chip “handles more than just DAC/ADC,” explains iFixit, as it also integrates a media codec. It’s not believed to contain an amplifier because there are three dedicated amplifier chips located elsewhere on the iPhone 7 logic board. As for audio quality: The takeaway seems to be that in some areas, the sound quality does measure a bit worse from the adapter than we might be accustomed to. For instance, when playing an uncompressed 16-bit audio file on the iPhone 6s, the dynamic range dropped from 99.1 dB at the headphone jack to 97.3 dB at the adapter. Though keep in mind, this slightly lower measurement is still higher than the theoretical maximum you get from a compact disc (which is 96 dB). So, is it a difference you are likely to notice? If you sit in a quiet room with a really, really good pair of headphones … and you’re a canine, the answer is: maybe. Ultimately, it appears Apple’s engineers “did their job” because, as iFixit writes, the tiny adapter seems to perform “better than most people expected or even thought possible”. Here are the results of a barrage of sound quality tests conducted last month by hi-fi enthusiasts at German computer tech magazine, called c’t. Because the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus lack the 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of Bluetooth headsets or wired Lightning-based ones, Apple’s dongle requires DAC circuitry to convert the ones and zeros from the all-digital Lightning connector to analog signals that audio accessories like 3.5mm headphones need to work. By the same logic, the adapter also needs ADC circuitry to convert analog signals from a headphone’s embedded microphone into ones and zeros that are fed to the handset via the Lightning port. However, both new iPhone 7 models still pack in the CirrusLogic chip in order to drive their built-in loudspeakers and microphones, all of which use analog signals. Later this month, Apple will release its new wireless earphones, called AirPods. The earphones integrate a custom-designed Apple W1 chip that extends battery life over standard Bluetooth connections while supporting advanced features like zero-configuration automatic pairing, seamless switching between devices without re-pairing and more.

It isn’t dealing-breaking for me. Shadowelite123 Exactly! I don’t get why people say it’s a deal breaker. I guess they just hate change so much, yet they want us to have the newest technology and to improve. There can’t really be improvement without change. techfreak23 So far it hasn’t been a huge issue for me. I have run into the situation multiple times though where I want to charge while using my headphones. Usually at night when I’m listening to music in bed. PhoneTechJay You can sleep in you bed with headphones in interesting.. I’d wake up tangled in wires if I tried that lol. The issue with me was using a portable charger then wanting to FaceTime while using headphones because other people were around.. Funny thing is, I don’t care enough to buy those cheap adapters the allow the phone to both at the same time techfreak23 Yeah I’m with you on the splitter. Not worth it to me. And sometimes I like to lay in bed with my headphones, like I am now actually, but I usually don’t fall asleep with them. I’m planning on getting the AirPods later this month! PhoneTechJay Hopefully they have a ping function and they can play a loud enough sound like the “find my phone” tone. jo3y Not a deal breaker by any means, but there are sometimes i wish i can charge my phone and listen to my music with earphones (again that doesnt come up much either) Jack Wong Been using BT earbuds for years, the one from Anker is less than $30 and give almost 5hours play time in my case. n0ahcruz3 Totally not a deal breaker for me lol am i the only one here that thinks the camera bump on the 7/7+ compliments the overall look of the phone? No seriously lol however the 6 and 6s my gosh the camera bump looks totally horrendous.. techfreak23 Definitely looks a little better than the 6/s. More tolerable. NekoMichi The ones complaining about Apple pushing audio to become wireless are most likely also using technologies like Wi-Fi, IR TV remotes, and Bluetooth game controllers, yet none have complained about those. Imagine having to use a tethered remote control on your TV. Zach Champion Sure it may not be a huge inconvenience for everybody, but what does it add? Storm More room inside the iPhone 7 for other stuff? dedegarrido I think they should also remove the lightining port… but sure, they wont. (And add super fast wireless charging, and water proofing to the iphone, just like the apple watch). It would make things simpler… Ninja Ass They have great chance to remove lightening port by replacing like Apple Watch ..size of port will be same as lightning port but it will not have a pin just a glass with light transfer and in iPhone also there will a glass so there will Be no hole.. now cable n iPhone connect with magnet n send data n charge with light like optic fiber … so there will no chance of getting water in iPhone and it will be fast charge n data transfer … sorry English hope you understand what I m trying to say this my idea .. maybe I m wrong smtp25 Problem for me is, I lose, break, leave at home my headphones all the time. So being able to buy cheap replacements from anywhere is great. Now I can’t its either the $50 Apple headphones or having a ton of adapters spare. I’m postive the aftermarket will catch up and have lightning enabled headphones for relatively cheap Storm Have you tried not losing, breaking or leaving your headphones behind? Could work out cheaper… ravinigga Already moved to Bluetooth headphones and I got 6s plus. Much better then annoying cables, but I bought beoplay h8 for 430€ is expensive but worth any penny also plus side I can remove the battery and earpieces if I wanna replaces it.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Wallpapers of the week: golden fields Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… Recap: the top stories of the week on iDB Rushline, Feelca B&W, Delphi, and other apps to check out this weekend AT&T to throttle streaming video next year with new ‘Stream Saver’ feature   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to PasswordRecovery stores passwords and recovers them when you forget them NCTextColor lets you add vibrancy to Notification Center iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

Home Markets World markets Twitter shares plunge 19 per cent on report that Google, Disney won’t make bid Twitter shares plunge 19 per cent on report that Google, Disney won’t make bid Twitter shares plunged on Thursday, a day after technology website Recode reported that Alphabet's Google and Disney would not bid for the social network and Apple was unlikely to be a suitor. By: Reuters | New York | Updated: October 6, 2016 8:34 PM Twitter’s shares fell as much as 19.2 percent to .10, valuing the company at about .2 billion. They were last down 17.2 percent at .60. (Reuters) Twitter shares plunged on Thursday, a day after technology website Recode reported that Alphabet’s Google and Disney would not bid for the social network and Apple was unlikely to be a suitor. The company has requested binding acquisition bids within the next two weeks, Reuters reported on Wednesday, and hopes to wrap up sale negotiations before the end of the month. Google was a likely contender for the microblogging service, Recode reported, but those familiar with the deal said the company was not moving forward with an effort to buy Twitter at this time. Twitter’s shares fell as much as 19.2 percent to $20.10, valuing the company at about $14.2 billion. They were last down 17.2 percent at $20.60. Salesforce.com Inc is now left as the only potential buyer, Recode said, although the cloud-software maker has not confirmed publicly that it wants to make a bid. Salesforce Chief Executive Marc Benioff told CNBC on Wednesday that Twitter was “an exciting product, but obviously the business has a lot of challenges.” The rationale for Salesforce bidding on Twitter is not clear, said Jefferies analyst John DiFucci in a note to clients. Buying Twitter would reduce the value of Salesforce shares by about $11 through dilution, while increased debt could cut another $9.50 from the stock. Salesforce’s shares were up 3.6 percent at $70.90 on Thursday. Other potential bidders beyond Salesforce are taking a look at Twitter, CNBC said, citing sources. And Google might not be out of the running entirely, said Patrick Moorhead, analyst from Moor Insights & Strategy. “I think Google needs Twitter and Twitter needs Google. Google has failed multiple times to create a compelling social media platform and they need a company like Twitter,” Moorhead said. “I do not think this is the end of it. This is more likely Google trying to send a message to Twitter that ‘your terms are too rich.'” Twitter has told potential acquirers it wants to conclude negotiations about selling itself by the time it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 27. The timeline is ambitious in the context of most mergers and acquisitions, given that Twitter began mulling a sale only last month. The company, run by Jack Dorsey, has struggled to generate revenue growth and profit despite having about 313 million average monthly active users. Twitter missed Wall Street sales expectations in the first and second quarters of 2016 and has yet to produce a net profit in 11 quarters as a public company. Up to Wednesday’s close, Twitter’s stock had fallen nearly 12 percent in the last 12 months, but had risen by about a third since reports emerged in September that the company was in talks with Salesforce.

 Apple actually has an internal project codenamed 'Pie' Kif Leswing Oct. 6, 2016, 10:35 AM 6,610 facebook linkedin twitter email print Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images Next year, Apple will move its executives and at least 13,000 employees into a new campus in Cupertino, California that's been called a "spaceship" and the "death star." Now we know at least one thing that Apple will use its old headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop for: consolidating its teams that work on cloud and online services.  Apple plans to unify its cloud computing employees, including Siri, Maps, iCloud, and other services, at its old headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports.  Apple's cloud infrastructure teams have been divided physically and have had varying management to this point, which has contributed to the services' unreliability, and may be hampering the company's data-oriented car efforts, too. Most of Apple iTunes services ultimately report to Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of online services.  Unifying the teams will help Apple transition onto a new Apple-developed infastrucure system codenamed "Pie." Siri, iTunes, and Apple News already run partially on Pie, with Maps transitioning in the next few years.  Bloomberg also says that recent hire Peter Stern will lead cloud services.  Open office plan  Getty More interesting than Apple's slow-moving cloud reorganization are the details Gurman gives on the political jockeying that is going on inside of Apple as it prepares to move to its new campus, Apple Campus 2, early next year.  A committee of Apple managers is currently working on the transition, but it's facing a number of challenges. Apple may have already outgrown its new $5 billion campus. It expected 13,000 employees, but thousands more could eventually move. Apple grows like a weed around Cupertino and Sunnyvale, California with various offices sporting Apple signs out front.  The new office features an open floor plan, which may be bothering employees used to a more compartmentalized and quiet environment.  Only vice presidents and above will get formal offices — senior directors, who manage huge teams and get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, will not be offered offices, as had been planned.  NOW WATCH: How the ‘perfect body’ for men has changed over the last 150 years Loading video...

Kansas City, MO (PRWEB) October 06, 2016 Infegy, a leading social media intelligence technology provider, partnered with leading global brand consultancy Interbrand to analyze social media data provided by Twitter for its 2016 Best Global Brands Report, naming Apple, Google, and Coca-Cola the three most valuable brands. Now in its 17th edition, the Interbrand report reveals the Anatomy of Growth, and features an insider’s view of how great brands grow great businesses. “Accurate analysis of social media data represents an important opportunity for brands to connect with consumer opinion in a way that makes sure they’re really hearing what people have to offer in the conversation,” said Justin Graves, Infegy Founder and Chief Executive Officer. “By working directly with social media data from Twitter, we were able to provide insights into what these consumers think and how they feel, which is a crucial dimension of growth for any business.” Infegy’s Thematic and Emotional Analysis Infegy Atlas leverages advanced linguistic analysis algorithms to deliver comprehensive brand and consumer insights using social data, with instant results. Brands and market researchers can use the platform to understand consumers opinion on any given topic using publicly-available posts from across the internet. Brands can evaluate the elements of a conversation situated around Purchase Intent or Confidence to understand what portion of their query data represents consumers communicating those ideas, in addition to a comprehensive sentiment analysis of each of its conversational themes. Interbrand’s methodology recognizes that any comprehensive forecast of consumer opinion or market trends need a more developed understanding of the drivers behind purchasing behaviors. “Strong brands influence customer choice and create loyalty; attract, retain, and motivate talent; and lower the cost of financing. Our brand valuation methodology has been specifically designed to take all of these factors into account.” Speaking about the report results, Interbrand Global CEO Jez Frampton commented that “[i]t’s clear the best global brands are not just weathering change, but driving it. They understand their Anatomy of Growth is complex, unique and personal; they look inward and outward, expand into new markets, and create better experiences to grow their brands and businesses.” The 2016 Interbrand Report For the fourth consecutive year, Apple and Google topped the list of Best Global Brands. Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Toyota, IBM, Samsung, Amazon, Mercedes-Benz, and GE comprise the rest of brands included in Interbrand’s Top 10 list. The world’s top growing brands include Facebook (48% growth), Amazon (33% growth), LEGO (25% growth), Nissan (22% growth), and Adobe (21% growth). Automotive and technology brands dominate the composition of this year’s report with a combined 29 positions. Retail is the top growing sector at 19% growth, followed by both sporting and luxury at 10% each. Cumulatively, Interbrand estimates the top 100 brands with a total value of USD $1,796,384m, up nearly five percent over last year.

With Google unveiling new Pixel phones equipped with the Google Assistant and Apple updating iOS 10 to add to Siri's powers, Samsung is now stepping up its assistant game by snapping up an up-and-coming artificial intelligence platform. And it's one developed by the original creators of Siri. Credit: VivSamsung said today (Oct. 5) that it's buying Viv, an AI platform that the electronics giant intends to use as the basis for an AI-based open ecosystem across its devices and services. In a press release announcing the purchase, Samsung said Viv would continue to operate independently under the team that also created Siri, which is now integrated into Apple's iOS and macOS operating systems. Credit: VivMore MORE: 12 Best Android Apps You're Not Using Viv started getting buzz earlier this year as a would-be Siri competitor not only because of its founders' resumés, but also because it promises to be a more open platform for connecting with outside apps and services. Viv's other major selling point is its ease of use. Viv's creators are designing the AI agent to be more conversational, giving it the ability to handle multiple requests at once. Viv Demo Samsung currently has a voice-powered assistant of sorts on some of its devices. S Voice lets you operate phones like the Galaxy S7 or Note 7 with just your voice, dialing contacts and dictating text messages. But its powers are far short of what you can do with assistants like the ones from Google, Apple and Microsoft. It sounds Viv is going to give Samsung the opportunity to change that. In announcing the purchase, Samsung says Viv will help it simplify user interfaces and offer up appropriate suggestions and recommendations based on context — which sounds an awful lot like what Apple and Google are doing with their assistants on mobile devices. Samsung also talked about Viv's potential to integrate with its other products, including wearables and home appliances. We've got a ways to go before we see how Viv stacks up against other voice-driven assistants, since the platform is still in development. But it's clear Samsung has big plans. In an interview with Recode, Injong Rhee, Samsung's chief technology officer, promised that Samsung's investments in AI would be evident in next year's flagship Galaxy phones. Recode also reports that Samsung hopes to add the technology into television and other connected devices.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Samsung buys Viv Labs in pursuit of its own AI assistant The startup founders also created Siri before Apple was even in the picture. by Valentina Palladino - Oct 6, 2016 2:46 pm UTC Login to bookmark 53 Neilson Barnard / Getty Images Samsung is turning its attention to personal assistants—the company has acquired Viv Labs, a startup founded by Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer, and Chris Brigham, all of whom were part of the original Siri team that Apple bought in 2010. The three departed Apple shortly after the acquisition to start Viv Labs, which recently showed off its AI personal assistant at Disrupt NY. While pricing has not been disclosed, the deal has been confirmed by Kittlaus in a post on Medium. Viv Labs will continue to operate independently from Samsung, but it will share intelligence with the hardware manufacturer with the intent of integrating Viv into products. "Samsung will drastically accelerate our vision," Kittlaus writes. "For us, the glaringly obvious advantage Samsung brings to our vision is scale." The post mentions Samsung's smartphones, TVs, and smart home products like SmartThings, but Kittlaus writes that the end goal is to bring Viv to products outside the Samsung family as well. "In order for Viv to utilize the incredible scale Samsung offers, and in order to achieve our ultimate goal of redefining the way people interact with the digital landscape, it would be essential for Viv to be available across more than just Samsung devices. Our vision requires that Viv be everywhere. Samsung is with us. We share a mutual vision to leapfrog the current state-of-the-art in AI, ushering in a new era." According to reports, Viv's assistant is akin to Amazon's Alexa in the sense that it integrates third-party programs and vendors so it can complete tasks associated with entities outside itself. It's also apparent from Kittlaus' post that they hope Viv eventually becomes hardware- and platform-agnostic, allowing you to use the assistant no matter where you are, what device you're using, and which OS it's running. If Samsung incorporates Viv into its smartphones, it would have yet another service that competes with those baked into Android by Google. Currently Samsung Pay is available on most Samsung handsets and challenges Android Pay, and with Viv, Samsung would be directly competing with Google's revamped assistant that it debuted recently. It's important to keep in mind that Viv's AI assistant hasn't officially launched yet—it has only been demoed. That was apparently enough for Samsung to want to invest in the company, and it's clear that Samsung understands how important AI will be going forward. At this week's Google event, the company heavily pushed the features of its assistant, emphasizing the conversational interactions users can have with it via their smartphones. Apple has been pushing Siri into anything and everything it can, including the Apple Watch and its new AirPods. All of those examples show how companies are trying to push voice interfaces that transcend any particular type of hardware. Amazon's Alexa is arguably the best current example of this since numerous third-party companies are building Alexa integration into their products. You still need an Amazon product that comes with Alexa, like the Echo, to act as a "home" for the assistant. But once you have that, a bunch of products like smart home lights, cameras, and other devices can be controlled using voice. Instead of focusing on a direct competitor to Google Assistant or Siri, Samsung could go this route in an effort to spread Viv's AI assistant across as many devices and systems as possible.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit Yahoogate Tech Giants Deny Building Spying Tools Like Yahoo Reportedly Did Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Yahoogate Tech Giants Deny Building Spying Tools Like Yahoo Reportedly Did Apple, Google, Twitter, and Facebook have all issued denials. by Maya KosoffOctober 6, 2016 10:16 am Email Facebook Twitter By Mario Tama/Getty Images. In the wake of a bombshell Reuters report alleging that Yahoo complied with a classified U.S. government request last year to monitor customer e-mails, other tech companies are denying they cooperated in any similar surveillance efforts. According to Reuters, Yahoo created its own software that government officials used to search through user e-mails for specific information. As the report notes, this may be the first instance in which a U.S. tech company complied with a government agency’s request to search a wide swath of incoming e-mail messages, rather than scanning old stored messages or a small sampling of messages in real time. Yahoo has called the report “misleading,” though not outright false. “We narrowly interpret every government request for user data to minimize disclosure. The mail scanning described in the article does not exist on our systems,” a Yahoo spokesperson said. The New York Times later reported that Yahoo’s government-ordered surveillance, which has since ceased according to the Times’s sources, required the tech company to search user e-mails for a particular “digital signature” used by a terrorist organization. But the surveillance program may have been limited to Yahoo. Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Apple all denied that they’ve cooperated with the government with such a request, adding that if they were asked, they would have challenged it. “We have never received a request of this type. If we were to receive one, we would oppose it in court,” an Apple spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. There’s some precedent for Apple: earlier this year, the company declined to use its technology to help the F.B.I. unlock an iPhone belonging to one of the suspects involved in last year’s San Bernardino shooting (the F.B.I. eventually relied on a third party to hack into the smartphone). Twitter also told BuzzFeed that the company has “never received a request like this, and were we to receive it we’d challenge it in a court.” So did Google: “We’ve never received such a request, but if we did, our response would be simple: no way.” Facebook flatly denied receiving such a request. “Facebook has never received a request like the one described in these news reports from any government, and if we did we would fight it,” the company told Vocativ. The only major tech company whose response sounds potentially like less of a denial is Microsoft. In a statement to Vocativ, the company said, “We have never engaged in the secret scanning of email traffic like what has been reported today about Yahoo.” It’s still possible, then, that Microsoft had been approached by the government, but hadn’t complied, or was asked to comply with a surveillance request of a different nature. Civil-liberties groups are also speaking out against Yahoo’s reported partnership with the U.S. government, which, according to two former Yahoo employees who spoke to Reuters, led to the 2015 resignation of Yahoo’s chief information security officer, Alex Stamos, in protest. (Stamos now works in a similar role at Facebook.) “It is deeply disappointing that Yahoo declined to challenge this sweeping surveillance order, because customers are counting on technology companies to stand up to novel spying demands in court,” A.C.L.U. attorney Patrick Toomey told Vanity Fair in a statement. “If this surveillance was conducted under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, this story reinforces the urgent need for Congress to reform the law to prevent dragnet surveillance and require increased transparency.” The Electronic Frontier Foundation was also unequivocal in denouncing Yahoo’s alleged initiative. “While illegal mass surveillance is sadly familiar, the Yahoo surveillance program represents some deeply troubling new twists,” the nonprofit digital-rights group said in a statement. “We hope this story sparks further questions. For starters: is Yahoo the only company to be compelled to engage in this sort of mass surveillance? What legal authority does the government think can possibly justify such an invasion of privacy? The government needs to give us those answers.” Share Email Facebook Twitter Maya KosoffMaya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com, with a focus on start-ups and venture capital.

As of this week, commuters can use Apple Pay to purchase one way, round trip, ten trip, weekly, and CityTickets tickets — as well as monthly passes — through the MTA eTix app, which can be used at all LIRR and Metro-North stations. Image Credit: Lionel via The New York Times "The New York commute just got that much easier thanks to Apple Pay in the MTA eTix app," said Apple Pay vice president Jennifer Bailey. "Now you can skip the line entirely to buy train tickets right on your iPhone." MTA's Long Island Railroad, operating between Manhattan and the eastern tip of Suffolk County on Long Island, is the busiest commuter train in North America, with an average weekday ridership of over 300,000 passengers. MTA's Metro-North Railroad, operating between Manhattan and upstate New York, plus parts of southwestern Connecticut, is the second busiest commuter train in North America, with an average weekday ridership of over 285,000 passengers. MTA eTix, free on the App Store [Direct Link], eliminates the need to stand in line to purchase tickets from a vending machine. Instead, your iPhone serves as your electronic ticket, which you activate before boarding a train.

It saves your credit card info when you actually buy a ticket. You can't save a card without purchasing first. The ticket, once activated, is only valid for 2 hours. So don't "Activate" it until you actually are on board or until the conductor gets to you. For security and anti-fraud purposes there's a QR Code and other marquee-like moving images on the screen as a way to validate the ticket. They don't scan your phone though, they just look at it and keep walking. It just sucks because I can't put my WageWorks Commuter Card into Wallet because WageWorks doesn't support it yet. Rating: 1 Votes truthertech 5 weeks ago No, I'm not being a theif if the conductor refuses to come around or collect tickets on my trip. Maybe one of the reasons this happens is cause I'm a student and I'm only taking the train from Mineola to Cold Spring Harbor. That's not stealing, stealing would be one of those ass holes who runs around the train and hides when they actually are collecting tickets... To be clear, I am not the one at fault, it's the conductor, therefore I'm not responsible for not paying. Ahh, now I understand. The real criminal is the conductor who is preventing you from following the honor system and paying your fare. Shame on him.

Zach Epstein BGR NewsOctober 6, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Put plainly, the smartphone market exists as it does today because of Apple's App Store. Period. Smartphones had existed for more than a decade before the iPhone was released in 2007. Apps existed for more than a decade before the App Store rolled out a year later. But the iPhone changed the way people used their smartphones and the App Store made expanding their capabilities far simpler than it had been in the past. But Apple's on-device app portal has had a big problem since the early days that Apple hasn't been able to find a solution for. The company has finally rolled out a big change that we've all been expected, but it's not yet clear whether Apple helped matters or hurt them. DON'T MISS: Under no circumstances should you buy a Galaxy Note 7 Finding good apps in the App Store is not easy. In fact, depending on what type of app you're looking for, it can be next to impossible. The popularity of third-party apps created an entirely new industry and developers swarmed to it. Of course, not all of those developers are interested in or even capable of making high-quality apps. As a result, Apple's App Store quickly became flooded with content that made finding all of the high-quality apps in the store extremely difficult. Things have improved recently, but there is no perfect solution. To this day you can often search the exact name of an app you're looking for and still not find it without having to scroll past a dozen or more other apps. Just now, a search for "Twitter" yielded two apps in the first 15 results that haven't even been updated for the new user interface Apple introduced in 2013 with iOS 7. While Apple continues its work to fix the issue, the company also continues to work on better monetizing the App Store. And so this week, as VentureBeat notes, the company began rolling out its new search ads product. Developers are now able to purchase ads that will display at the top of results when users search for specific terms. Although people's knee-jerk reaction is to resist anything that involves advertising, this actually could end up being a good thing. App Store ads thus far in these early days have been mixed as a flock of developers rushes to try them out. In the long term though, Apple's new ad platform could theoretically end up being a good thing if it's utilized by top developers who build high-quality apps and can afford to spend more on advertising.

Home Fe columnist Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone: It begins with the battle for the smartphone Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone: It begins with the battle for the smartphone Almost close to a decade ago, at the Macworld Conference and Expo in San Francisco, Steve Jobs took the mobile handset device world by storm with the launch of the iPhone, a device that combined three products... By: Anup Jayaram | Published: October 6, 2016 7:22 PM Google has managed to achieve something that only Apple has till now done – integrating devices and software to build a powerful ecosystem. Almost close to a decade ago, at the Macworld Conference and Expo in San Francisco, Steve Jobs took the mobile handset device world by storm with the launch of the iPhone, a device that combined three products – a mobile phone, a widescreen iPod with touch controls and an internet communications device. That after various iterations is now the iPhone7 that was launched early this September. But, despite accounting for almost 16% – 225 million of the 1.4 billion smartphones shipped globally – of the worldwide smartphone sales in 2015, tricky times could be ahead for Apple. It has seen sales of the iPhone falling from 183.16 million devices in the first three quarters of 2015 to166.38 million in 2016. Revenues from iPhone sales too fell from $122.8 billion in 2015 to $ 108.5 in 2016 over the same period. While that is an internal issue, things could get tricky for Apple with the launch of the Google Pixel. The reasons are not hard to find. For starters, the $ 75 billion Google has managed to achieve something that only Apple has till now done – integrating devices and software to build a powerful ecosystem. Samsung which developed the OS Tizen has not been able to ensure that it is an integral part of devices. The commonalities with Apple are just too many. While the Apple OS – iOS – is a walled garden, the Google OS – Android is open source. Among the biggest users of the Android OS is Samsung, the world’s single largest smartphone vendor. Apple also changed the smartphone paradigm by introducing apps through its App Store. Google has the Play Store which has Android versions of all apps. Also, since the Android user base is much higher, no app developer can ignore it. While having many apps is good, it ended up eating real estate on the mobile device. Apple solved that to a large extent by allowing users to tap into the iCloud. Google has done just that. It is offering Pixel users unlimited cloud storage for full-resolution photos and video. With the world going in for artificial intelligence (AI), iPhone has the voice-activated Siri, while Google has the Assistant. Very soon, Indian users will be able to use the Hindi version of the Assistant. While the commonalities end here, the advantage that Google has is that it can tap into its parent Alphabet that has multiple projects going. This includes connected cars, connected homes and Nest. What that means is that over the next 10 years, the car that drives you – as opposed to you driving the car – will be powered by software, and be powered by renewable energy. The stakes are quite high for both. But, it’s a battle that could lead to making life a lot more easier for a lot of people. Please Wait while comments are loading...

New iPhone 7s already linked to strangers' Apple IDs A peculiar Apple ID issue seems to be ruining the iPhone 7 unboxing experience for some new owners. By Liam Tung | October 6, 2016 -- 12:57 GMT (05:57 PDT) | Topic: Security Some people are reporting receiving brand-new iPhone 7 devices with Activation Lock already activated. Image: Apple A weird glitch is apparently triggering an Activation Lock on newly-unboxed iPhone 7 devices, with buyers finding their new smartphone already linked to another person's Apple ID email address. Activation Lock is a security feature of Find My iPhone that can be used to prevent others from using an iOS device if it is lost or stolen. However, some people are receiving brand-new iPhone 7 devices from Apple with Activation Lock already activated and the smartphone's Apple ID linked to another person's email address. MacRumors reports that an increasing number of iPhone owners are reporting the problem, which prevents the user from completing the setup and using their brand-new device. read this iPhone 7: Why I'm finally going big with this year's model Despite a strong dislike of the overall size of the iPhone 7 Plus, it's time I go big. Read More The issue affects some newly-purchased iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus devices. Owners of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are also reporting Activation Lock occurring after restoring to default settings as part of their process of setting up a new iPhone 7. One Apple fan who managed to buy a 256GB variant of the supply-constrained Jet Black iPhone 7 wrote that,"It appears someone has already used it as the iPhone is asking for the account used to activate it -- o.....@icloud.com. Apple say it needs replacing [...] Now got to wait for an expedited replacement iPhone once I've returned this one." Another MacRumors reader said Activation Lock with an unknown account occurred on an unlocked iPhone 6s after activating an iPhone 7 Plus on Verizon. "I recently purchased an iPhone 7 Plus and after that phone was activated on Verizon's network, the iPhone 6s now indicates that it has an Activation Lock. It is also linked to some unknown iCloud account (not the account I activated it with or have been using it with for close to a full year)." It's not clear what's causing the mixup with Apple IDs. Apple has not commented on the issue. ZDNet has reached out to Apple's PR team and will provide an update if we receive a response. According to MacRumors, some affected users have been able to resolve the issue by visiting an Apple store and showing their receipt. The lock can be removed at the Genius Bar or by Apple's phone support. Whatever the cause, having to head back to Apple for a fix after waiting several weeks for delivery hardly lives up to the experience the company is famed for.

A release date for the new MacBook Pro is likely to be unveiled at the Apple event on 27 October later this month. Some of the latest spec rumors include the OLED touch bar, keyboard, and design. The core design of the MacBook Pro is not expected to be much different. There may be a gold edition for the 12-inch model, and it is going to be thinner and lighter. There are rumors of a new hinge design, according to Tech Rader: “Metal injection-molded hinges inspired by Microsoft’s Surface Pro line purportedly began shipment back in June for the 13-inch MacBook Pro. Meanwhile, the 15-inch model’s hinges were set to arrive in the third quarter of the year, making the late October release window argument even more convincing.” Will The 2016 MacBook Pro 15 Eclipse The Dell XPS 15?https://t.co/VVUG2hWiNC — Gabor Toth (@gabordrot) September 30, 2016 The touch bar feature will have an OLED display, which is a form of LED display that may highlight certain functions or apps in the MacBook Pro. It is expected to appear above the keyboard. Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint system is expected to mirror those found on other Apple products such as the iPhone. It is unclear where the fingerprint scanner will appear on the MacBook Pro. Some rumors suggest that the MacBook Pro will feature a fingerprint power button, while others anticipate a new magic trackpad update. We can expect to see sixth-generation Skylake processors powering the MacBook Pro and powerful graphics cards. The last Macbook had fifth-generation Broadwell chips, so Apple is going to set high goals for the latest MacBook installment. A better processor will improve the speed and battery life of the new Macbook Pro. Tech Radar reports on some of the benefits and drawbacks of the rumored processor: “Skylake has some tricks up its silicon sleeve that Broadwell lacks, including support for WiGig and WiDi short-range, high speed data transfer as well as wireless charging. We may not see that flip of the switch in this year’s notebooks, but it’s possible nonetheless for Apple to tap into this functionality later on.” It is also possible that Apple moves up to Intel Kaby Lake processors. However, a sixth-generation processor is more likely due to the timing of the MacBook Pro release. The publication reports on a 5K external device: “However, one thing Skylake can’t do is output 5K resolutions over a single cable stream. That’s why, in June, sources told Buzzfeed reporter John Paczkowski that Apple is working on a 5K external display complete with its own integrated graphics chip based on AMD’s Polaris architecture.” The new MacBook Pro is rumored to feature a butterfly key mechanism. With the iPhone 7 coming with no headphone jack, Apple may dedicate the rest of its 2016 releases to this risky leap. MacBook Pro 2016 release date, specifications, rumors: Apple's next-gen MacBook coming in October https://t.co/gyWav33FOk pic.twitter.com/u5rWWybdP8 — PC-Tablet (@pctabletin) September 27, 2016 The lightning headphone may be Apple thinking ahead. Either way, don’t be surprised if the new MacBook Pro does not future a headphone jack. The new Macbook Pro is likely going to come in a 13-inch model and a 15-inch model. The price range will likely remain the same as expected with Apple products. The current MacBook Pro range starts at $1,099 for the 13-inch model, rising to $1,119 for the cheapest 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro, and it cost $2,099 for the 2.5GHz 15-inch Retina version. While many tech analysts thought that the tablet would overtake the laptop, the MacBook Pro is still in high demand and is not out of style. AMD and nVidia are expected to launch new GPUs in 2016, and some reports speculated whether one of these new products will launch with the new MacBook Pro.

Users will now see sponsored apps at the top of their search results. The decision to switch to a more Google-esque model wasn’t received well by people back when it was first announced. At the time, Apple tried to reassure consumers by stating that the promoted apps wouldn’t have access to or be able to track their data. Moreover, they’ll be able to clearly distinguish a paid placement from a regular one. The former is clearly labeled as an ad and presented with a light blue background. Thankfully, these Search Ads will be limited to just one per search result, so individuals won’t have to deal with a deluge of them. Still, indie developers who can’t afford to pay for placement may suffer in the new model. Also Read: Apple to ban top paid iMessage prank sticker app Phoneys Apple’s got an answer for this as well, stating that it will place more importance on relevance than ad spends, so cash-rich companies can’t splurge more to get a guaranteed spot at the top. The company began trying to encourage firms to opt for ads last week by giving away $100 in credit to eligible developers in order to cover the cost of their first campaign. As pointed out in a screenshot by Venture Beat, searching for the word pokemon throws up an unofficial Pokemon Go app called Catch em instead of the real deal which sits below. For someone unfamiliar with the application, this could lead to them accidentally downloading the wrong app, a serious concern.

Eddy Cue, Apple’s boss of Internet Software and Services, will oversee the effort to move cloud service engineering teams to a single campus as Apple continues shifting its cloud to its own infrastructure. Siri servers, machines handling Apple Music downloads and Apple’s other cloud services will be moved onto an Apple-made platform, code-named “Pie”, which was designed to improve reliability, improve response times and give Apple more control over its cloud destiny. Apple has already begun moving over parts of Siri, the iTunes Store and Apple News to the new infrastructure, while services like Maps and more will be moved over to the new system over the next few years. “Apple has also developed an internal photo storage system dubbed McQueen to gradually end its reliance on Google and Amazon servers,” the sources said. As for the internal reorganization, the sources said: Apple cloud services teams run by executive Eddy Cue, including Siri, Maps, iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple News and parts of iTunes and Apple Music, will move together into the company’s existing Infinite Loop campus in Cupertino, California, the people said. Currently, most Apple services are developed separately from each other in office parks rented out in other parts of Cupertino and Sunnyvale, California. The current structure is said to “contribute to software bugs and slow product development” so Apple is bringing these teams together. Apple’s Services revenue grew almost 20 percent in the last quarter so it makes sense for Apple’s leadership to double down on iCloud and other cloud-related services. The report adds that many Apple executives want to move these cloud teams from the current headquarters to Apple Campus 2, a massive ring-shaped building that’s currently being built and scheduled to open in early 2017, but Cue apparently thinks that the old campus “is a suitable way to improve his organization.” “A committee of Apple managers is working on the plan to reorganize Apple across its current and future locations,” reads the report. Apple Campus 2, which is less than a five minute drive from the current headquarters, was originally expected to become home to about 13,000 Apple employees, but now that number will “increase by thousands and Apple is adjusting internal office space accordingly.” Only managers who are at a Vice President level or above will see their offices move over to Apple Campus 2 versus previous plans that included office space for Senior Directors, who report to Vice Presidents.

Hongkiat.com Main Menu Design / Dev Technology Inspiration Social Commerce All Deals Search Hongkiat for: Reveal Search Form Reveal Off-canvas Navigation Google Releases Pixel Like It’s Apple – And Innovation is Dead Published by Singyin Lee,in Gadgets Google Pixel, Google’s first phone inside and out (but built by HTC), has landed. This marks Google’s late entry into the foray of premium smartphones currently dominated by explosive names like Apple and Samsung. As the keynote and promo video for Google Pixel makes its rounds… you know what? Let’s address the elephant in the room. If you have watched the keynote and the video that introduces the Google Pixel phone, it almost seems like Google is content to just unveil their first ever #madebygoogle phone, exactly like how Apple has been announcing all of their phones. First, the Keynote was very Apple-y For starters, it was much more toned down, and it happened on a much smaller stage with very white backgrounds, as opposed to how Apple releases their "best iPhone ever", every single time. Pin it Pin it To be fair, it’s not like Google can’t splurge on the presentation. Here’s what Google’s I/O Conference in 2015 looked like. Pin it IMAGE: Softpedia But I digress. If you have watched Apple’s Keynotes, you might find a few quirks that almost always turn up in such an event: from the multiple use of the -illion numbers, excessive use of adjectives, the summary of features fitting for 5 year olds (the Internet standard), down to that dreary monologue of how developers create seamless, smart technology to work in the shadows so you, the user, can live life to the fullest (yadda, yadda, you enslaved us already, get on with it). Oh yes, let’s not forget the intimate look at a flying, spinning phone. Pin it Then, the dissing began As it’s customary in every new smartphone reveal, the "dissing of the competition" is a tradition that cannot be skipped – if only to elicit the "oooooooo"’s and "shots fired" responses from both sides of the fence. Pin it There was the mention of a "doesn’t have a version number new", the "no unslightly camera bump" jab, and of course, the "satisfyingly not new" headphone jack burn. But the icing on top came when they announced the phone colors: Quite Black, Really Blue, Very Silver. Pin it One can argue that it doesn’t look like they give AF. One could also argue that are mocking the way smartphone manufacturers claim colors that they are pulling out of the sky as their own invention. Pin it Or one could also argue that Google understand how the Internet works – remember, they do know what you search for. Personally, I think they know what they are doing (if you didn’t click that last link, it just says that the limited-edition (so Apple) Really Blue Google Pixel and Pixel XL are sold out. Really.) These two phones, they really look alike I have no arguments against this; there is only a limited number of ways a smartphone can look these days. Unlike how it was back when Nokia was the brand to beat. Pin it Sigh. Good times. That said, you can argue that many phones out there look like an iPhone these days, like this HTC One A9 (pictured) and the Sisley s90 (pictured) , the Dakele 3, ZTE Blade Z6 etc. And for what it’s worth, Pixel has the fingerprint sensor at the back, and still comes with a headphone jack. Pin it IMAGE: slashgear Pin it IMAGE: wheelsandchips And Pixel’s starting price isn’t any cheaper than an iPhone Pricing starts at $649 for the smaller phone with 32 GB storage, while the larger phone sells for $769. For 128 GB, the smaller phone goes for $749 and $869 for the plus size version. Which phone am I talking about? Why, the Google Pixel/Pixel XL AND the iPhone 7/7 Plus. Note that Google Pixel is available as an unlocked phone or direct from Verizon, plus a few more places. Pin it There are plenty of parallels too Device Protection for Pixel is AppleCare for iPhone Google Store is Apple Store Google Assistant is Apple Siri Duo is FaceTime (Is Allo = Messages?) Just to name a few. Apple fanboys, it’s time for revenge? If you follow the reactions of Pixel’s announcement on social network, you might see a role reversal in progress. Android fans used to mock Apple fans for buying overpriced phones with innovations that Android or Motorola (or some other non-Apple brand) did first. This time around, it’s the opposite. Just read any comment section under a Google Pixel news story. In all fairness, Pixel still has its perks The quick charging time is effing awesome: 7 hours in 15 mins. I just hope it won’t explode. I’m serious. Unlimited storage for your photos and files. "Storage almost full" not found. Customized Live Cases, designed with Google Earth and Google Trends, featuring work by "artists" like Chris Hadfield, who is simply out of this world. Pixel works with the Daydream VR Headset. VR has now leveled up from Cardboard to fabric. [Update 07/10/2016] Based on the reactions to this post, I’ve added a necessary update. 1. I’m an Android user. Never owned an iPhone. 2. Not that it mattered, because declaring whichever phone you own on the Internet opens you up to abuse from the other team anyways. 3. That said, we don’t earn points for defending brands we buy. Technology will be replaced in a timely fashion, no matter how good or bad they are. 4. There are plenty more issues in the world that require equal, if not more, attention – a worrying presidential race that will affect the fate of more than one country, a crazy clown epidemic that is the stuff of nightmares, the global problems on Gates’ and Zuckerberg’s to-do list, Zika, wars, more hurricanes and disastrous climate changes etc. Maybe it’s time for a priority check.

New iPhone 7s already linked to strangers' Apple IDs A peculiar Apple ID issue seems to be ruining the iPhone 7 unboxing experience for some new owners. By Liam Tung | October 6, 2016 -- 12:57 GMT (05:57 PDT) | Topic: Security Some people are reporting receiving brand-new iPhone 7 devices with Activation Lock already activated. Image: Apple A weird glitch is apparently triggering an Activation Lock on newly-unboxed iPhone 7 devices, with buyers finding their new smartphone already linked to another person's Apple ID email address. Activation Lock is a security feature of Find My iPhone that can be used to prevent others from using an iOS device if it is lost or stolen. However, some people are receiving brand-new iPhone 7 devices from Apple with Activation Lock already activated and the smartphone's Apple ID linked to another person's email address. MacRumors reports that an increasing number of iPhone owners are reporting the problem, which prevents the user from completing the setup and using their brand-new device. read this iPhone 7: Why I'm finally going big with this year's model Despite a strong dislike of the overall size of the iPhone 7 Plus, it's time I go big. Read More The issue affects some newly-purchased iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus devices. Owners of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are also reporting Activation Lock occurring after restoring to default settings as part of their process of setting up a new iPhone 7. One Apple fan who managed to buy a 256GB variant of the supply-constrained Jet Black iPhone 7 wrote that,"It appears someone has already used it as the iPhone is asking for the account used to activate it -- o.....@icloud.com. Apple say it needs replacing [...] Now got to wait for an expedited replacement iPhone once I've returned this one." Another MacRumors reader said Activation Lock with an unknown account occurred on an unlocked iPhone 6s after activating an iPhone 7 Plus on Verizon. "I recently purchased an iPhone 7 Plus and after that phone was activated on Verizon's network, the iPhone 6s now indicates that it has an Activation Lock. It is also linked to some unknown iCloud account (not the account I activated it with or have been using it with for close to a full year)." It's not clear what's causing the mixup with Apple IDs. Apple has not commented on the issue. ZDNet has reached out to Apple's PR team and will provide an update if we receive a response. According to MacRumors, some affected users have been able to resolve the issue by visiting an Apple store and showing their receipt. The lock can be removed at the Genius Bar or by Apple's phone support. Whatever the cause, having to head back to Apple for a fix after waiting several weeks for delivery hardly lives up to the experience the company is famed for.

Credit Cole Wilson for The New York Times A system intended to scan emails for child pornography and spam helped Yahoo satisfy a secret court order requiring it to search for messages containing a computer “signature” tied to the communications of a state-sponsored terrorist organization, several people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Two government officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the Justice Department obtained an individualized order from a judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court last year. Yahoo was barred from disclosing the matter. To comply, Yahoo customized an existing scanning system for all incoming email traffic, which also looks for malware, according to one of the officials and to a third person familiar with Yahoo’s response, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. With some modifications, the system stored and made available to the Federal Bureau of Investigation a copy of any messages it found that contained the digital signature. The collection is no longer taking place, those two people said. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story The order was unusual because it involved the systematic scanning of all Yahoo users’ emails rather than individual accounts; several other tech companies said they had not encountered such a demand. Advertisement Continue reading the main story News of the order has opened a new chapter in a public debate over the trade-offs between security needs and privacy rights that has cast a spotlight on the sometimes cooperative, sometimes antagonistic relationship between Silicon Valley companies and the United States government. It comes six months after a standoff between the F.B.I. and Apple, in which the government obtained a federal magistrate's order to force the company to help it unlock an encrypted iPhone from one of the attackers in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. The F.B.I. gave up the fight with Apple after it found a way into the iPhone without the company’s help. By contrast, Yahoo cooperated with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court order, although the technical burden on the company appears to have been significantly lighter than the one the F.B.I. placed on Apple. Details of Yahoo’s cooperation with the court order come two weeks after the company reported that hackers had broken into its computer network, stealing the credentials of 500 million users. Yahoo engineers discovered the breach this summer, two years after it had occurred, and just weeks after Verizon Communications announced plans to buy the troubled internet company for $4.8 billion. The two government officials familiar with the matter said the digital signature Yahoo was ordered to look for last year was individually approved in an order issued by a judge, who was persuaded that there was probable cause to believe that it was uniquely used by a foreign power. Investigators had learned that agents of the foreign terrorist organization were communicating using Yahoo’s email service and with a method that involved a “highly unique” identifier or signature, but the investigators did not know which specific email accounts those agents were using, the officials said. The officials’ description of the unusual surveillance operation carried out at Yahoo shed new light on a report by Reuters that has attracted widespread attention and provoked outrage among privacy and technology specialists. The Reuters article reported that in response to a “broad demand” from the government, Yahoo had “secretly built a custom software program to search all of its customers’ incoming emails for specific information provided by U.S. intelligence officials.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story According to the government officials, Yahoo was served with an individualized court order to look only for code uniquely used by the foreign terrorist organization. Two sources, including one of the officials, portrayed it as adapting the scanning systems that it already had in place to comply with that order rather than building a brand-new capability. The other official did not comment on the technology. The officials did not name the terrorist organization. Asked on Wednesday about the information obtained by The New York Times, Suzanne Philion, a Yahoo spokeswoman, said the company had nothing further to say. Earlier in the day, the company said in a statement that the Reuters article was “misleading.” “We narrowly interpret every government request for user data to minimize disclosure,” the Yahoo statement said. “The mail scanning described in the article does not exist on our systems.” Richard Kolko, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, declined in a statement to discuss specific foreign intelligence collection techniques, but referred to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. “Under FISA, activity is narrowly focused on specific foreign intelligence targets and does not involve bulk collection or use generic key words or phrases,” he said. “The United States only uses signals intelligence for national security purposes, and not for the purpose of indiscriminately reviewing the emails or phone calls of ordinary people.” Technology companies like Yahoo, Google and Microsoft scan for child pornography and are required to report any discoveries to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. They similarly search traffic for malware and spam, which companies disclose in their terms of service. There is no engineering limitation preventing technology companies from using their spam and child pornography filtering systems to search email traffic for other sorts of digital signatures, said Hany Farid, chairman of the computer science department at Dartmouth, who helped develop the child pornography scanning system with Microsoft. But the use of that technology to carry out an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to search for a digital signature used by a foreign power is rare, and one of the officials portrayed it as innovative. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “This is another example of how the government is pushing secretly novel or innovative interpretations of surveillance law” to conduct wiretapping in broader ways than the public realizes, said Jennifer Granick, the director of civil liberties at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society. The government has not released any intelligence court opinion explaining how the judge interpreted FISA to authorize such surveillance. Although Congress in June 2015 enacted a law that required the government to make public novel and significant rulings by the court, the order to Yahoo appears to have predated that legislation, the USA Freedom Act, by several months. Yahoo has an inconsistent record with meeting government data demands. In 2007, the company settled a lawsuit related to allegations that it helped the Chinese government crack down on journalists by passing along their Yahoo emails. But that year, the firm fought a legal battle, then secret, before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, challenging a mandate that it turn over, without a warrant, emails from user accounts the F.B.I. and the National Security Agency said belonged to noncitizens abroad who had been targeted for surveillance. That litigation became an important test of whether Congress could legalize the Bush administration’s warrantless surveillance program through the Protect America Act and, later, the FISA Amendments Act. Ultimately, the intelligence court ruled against Yahoo, and after being threatened with a huge fine, the company cooperated. Yahoo was not able to clarify details of the Reuters article on Tuesday because orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court are secret by law, and an increasing number of other government requests come with gag orders that prohibit tech companies from even acknowledging they exist. Tech companies complain that such gag orders make it impossible for them to explain to customers what sort of data they do and do not turn over. Twitter and Microsoft have separately sued the Justice Department over the gag order practice, and both cases are pending. Dozens of other companies have filed briefs in support of Microsoft. In its brief, Apple said it had received about 590 gag orders, of unlimited or indefinite durations, in the first eight months of 2016. Vindu Goel contributed reporting.

SUBSCRIBE Buying Viv, Samsung makes its “me too” virtual assistant play Like Siri, Viv sells itself before its ambitious product vision is realized. Greg Sterling on October 6, 2016 at 7:18 am More Feeling intensifying pressure from Google, Apple and Amazon, Samsung has acquired virtual assistant Viv. CEO Dag Kittlaus, who ran Siri before Apple bought it, will continue to operate Viv “independently” but still work closely with Samsung. Not content to rely on the Google Assistant, Samsung undoubtedly felt that it needed its own virtual assistant capability (It already has voice search). But like so many Samsung “me too” products and experiences (e.g., S Voice, Samsung Pay), it’s likely to fall short on the smartphone. Where Viv may shine and add real value for Samsung is on other products and smart home appliances. Samsung understands correctly that virtual assistants will figure more and more prominently, not only in the mobile (search) experience but as a UI/UX across platforms and devices and especially in the smart home. (Viv can also be deployed behind chat/messaging.) Siri was sold before it was able to fully realize the founding vision, which was to disintermediate Google and layer an intelligent assistant on top of third-party mobile content and transactional capabilities. Kittlaus and his team founded Viv to pick up where Siri left off. Siri is now starting to integrate third-party content and capabilities. Ironically, Viv has followed the same path as Siri by allowing itself to be acquired before maturing as a product and user experience. Kittlaus and his team must have felt they needed a deep pocket to fully bring Viv’s ambitious vision — which is to “radically simplif[y] the world by providing an intelligent interface to everything” — to fruition and compete with larger companies. If Samsung provides Kittlaus and Viv with resources but truly allows the company to operate independently, it has a fighting chance. However, the more directly involved Samsung becomes in the product vision, direction and management, the more likely it is to become an also-ran product.

Staying In Tech and Gaming Battery power players: These brands are leading the charge to find long-lasting battery life As Google launches a phone that boasts longer-lasting battery life, here is a guide to those leading the charge Phoebe Luckhurst Thursday 6 October 2016 12:39 BST Feeling charged: A guide on how to keep your devices alive for longer It’s Friday evening, and you’ve turned the contrast on your screen down so low that you can’t actually see anything. Nonetheless, you’re still tracing a finger over its screen compulsively, messaging and liking and watching, and inevitably the screen goes black. Your evening has taken a perilous turn: you are uncontactable and cannot Citymapper your route anywhere. You’d be furious, except that you’re used to it, because your battery routinely foils your social life.  It’s a frustrating modern paradox: your phone is a technical polymath that can track sleep, send emails and share locations (voluntarily or otherwise) — among many thousands of other things — but it can’t last a whole day on a single charge. Indeed, manufacturers’ refusal to improve phone battery life is starting to look infuriatingly contrary. However, focusing on this gap in the market, this week Google released its first own-brand smartphone, promising that it offers seven hours of battery power after a 15-minute charge. Read more A guide to the future of live streaming It’s fighting talk, if it’s true: alternatively, you could avoid the power struggle and boost your existing options.  Cut the cord  Nixing the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 has been controversial but we’re ready to say goodbye to other cords, namely chargers. The wireless charger is a purposeful innovation: compact, portable and unfussy.  Leaders include QiStone+, which  is a small, cuboid stone that is compatible with iPhone, Samsung and Android models, and has a spare USB port so that you can charge one device remotely and another via a cable, like a dinosaur would. It’s mighty: one charge will juice your phone all day (£62, fonesalesman.com).  “Everything is better wireless because it is simply more convenient,” observes Sarah Fronckevic, senior marketing executive at Fonesalesman, which designed the QiStone+. “Charging is the next big thing to be revolutionised.” Ikea is leading the way on this, becoming totally indispensable: it now has a selection of wireless chargers. Nordmarke is a disc-shaped pad on which you can rest a phone to return it to full health (£30, ikea.com). There is also a triple pad for those who are device-rich and  power-poor. Samsung’s fast-charge pad looks like a futuristic flying saucer, which claims it charges 14 times faster than its competitors’ version.  “Through our intensive home visits we know people hate cable mess,” says John Keeler, lighting sales leader at Ikea UK & Ireland. “Introducing smart ways to minimise cable clutter and the number of charging devices is a natural step to make everyday life much easier.” Apple Watch accessories - in pictures 5 show all Apple Watch accessories - in pictures 1/5 Apple Milanese strap £129, apple.com 2/5 X-Doria Defense Edge £20, amazon.co.uk 3/5 Sennheiser Momentum £379.95, johnlewis.com 4/5 Membrane ScreenGuard 99p, amazon.co.uk 5/5 Twelve South HiRise £49.95, amazon.co.uk Go all night Apple’s deficiency in this area is assumed — if you worship at Cupertino’s altar, it is advisable to carry your own power. Other manufacturers are prioritising battery life, though. Last week, industry blog CNET recommended the Motorola Moto Z Play, which sounds like they’re reminiscing about the early Noughties, but in fact is a new Motorola handset that CNET says has “the longest battery life of all the handsets we reviewed this year by far”. The Samsung Galaxy series — including the S7, S7 Edge and S7 Active — followed, reportedly lasting 16, 19 and 21 hours respectively on a single charge.  Obviously, though, we hope that the Google device will set the new standard for battery.  Outsource it Most people have a kitsch portable charger stuffed into a tote somewhere: you took it to Glastonbury, where it provided a dribble of charge that didn’t even  get you through the first drunk Facebook live-stream from the Pyramid Stage. Spend more and you get a powerful return on your investment, though: Mophie’s collection on juice packs are convenient snap-on cases that charge your phone. The Juice Pack Air for iPhone 6/6S is lightweight but contains enough charge to return your phone to full health more than once before it will need its own charge (from £49.95, Apple and Samsung devices, uk.mophie.com).  Read more A guide to cloud storage from Amazon Drive to iCloud and Google Drive Google Pixel: Tech giant unveils new smartphone to rival Apple's iPhone 7 Apple to create stunning new London HQ at Battersea Power Station The Flux is a slim charger that resembles a credit card holder, though its sylph proportions belie its potential: it has two micro USB ports and a five-voltage output, which equates to more than two full charges (£23, fluxchargers.com). PC Advisor recommends the Anker PowerCore 20000: it’s small, light and can do five charges of a Samsung Galaxy, and up to seven for an iPhone 6 (£34.99, anker.com). Plug in Of course you could do as pragmatic Londoners do and carry a charger, in order to plunder the power of various establishments in the capital. Be that person who barrels into a bar, wild-eyed, in order to ask the waiter if you can plug your phone in. Most places have plug sockets, and this month TfL announced it will install USB ports on the buses that run the 507 and 521, so those travelling from Victoria to Waterloo, or London Bridge to Waterloo, can charge up.  Some places provide the kit for you: 10 Starbucks branches in central London (including Pentonville Road and Fleet Street) have wireless Powermat banks on tables. And the John Lewis on Oxford Street has a Charge Box: a metal chest of drawers with space for 12 phones to charge. That’s more power to you.  Follow @phoebeluckhurst More about: Apple Samsung IKEA Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: All Topics All Authors Archive Terms of use Contact Us Privacy policy Cookie policy Code of Conduct & Complaints Advertisers Promotion rules Contributors Syndication Business Connections Homes & Property Jobs London Live The Independent This is London Magazine indy100 Install our apps Close We have noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

Apple Discontinues Third-Generation Apple TV International Business Times 10/6/2016 Ken Manbert Salcedo © Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images Apple CEO Tim Cook announcing the third-generation Apple TV back in 2012. Apple has discontinued the third-generation Apple TV set-top box, with the tech giant quietly removing the device from its online store. The company confirmed the discontinuation of the device to its employees and education partners in an email. “Effective immediately, Apple TV (3rd generation), MD/199LL/A, has reached end of life and is now discontinued,” the email obtained by 9To5Mac said. “The Apple Supply team is going to fulfill all shippable backlog."

The set-top box was first released back in 2012, and it received a hardware upgrade a year later. The company is still selling refurbished units of the third-gen device for $59, but supplies are very limited. Apple has not made a public announcement of the discontinuation of the third-generation Apple TV, and it remains unclear whether its users will receive any additional software updates. The last software update for the device was released back in February, but it was only for various security fixes. The third-generation Apple TV is severely out of date and is currently running an optimized version of iOS 8.4. It no longer has support for HomeKit and Apple’s two-setp verification, nor is it able to access Apple Music or iCloud, as pointed out by ArsTechnica. The company already has the current fourth-gen Apple TV which was released back in September 2015. The fourth-gen device runs the new tvOS operating system which supports Siri and playing games. It seems that the tech giant will be solely focusing on further developing the current model and possibly working on its successor. The fourth-gen Apple TV is available from Apple’s online store and retail stores for $149 for the 32GB model and $199 for the 64GB model.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Some iPhone users encountering Activation Lock error upon entering wrong Apple ID email address Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Thursday, October 6th, 2016, 05:36 Category: iOS, iPhone, News, security, Software Tweet It appears that inputting the wrong Apple ID email address could lead to an Activation Lock with the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and some iPhone 6s and 6s Plus models. A number of users have stated that, after entering the wrong Apple ID email address, they cannot sign in and are therefore unable to proceed with setting up the iPhone. The issue has primarily affected new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models upon being turned on for the first time, and iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models upon being restored to default settings, although older models appear to be affected to a lesser extent. One users, identified as “The Kricket”, offered the following testimonial: I purchased an iPhone 6s full-price and outright directly from an Apple Store in September 2015. The phone was unlocked (I switched from T-Mobile to Verizon after I purchased it without issue). I recently purchased an iPhone 7 Plus and after that phone was activated on Verizon’s network, the iPhone 6s now indicates that it has an “Activation Lock.” It is also linked to some unknown iCloud account (not the account I activated it with or have been using it with for close to a full year). Other users have shared similar complaints and a number of affected users said Apple was able to remove the Activation Lock on their iPhones upon providing the company with proof of purchase. This process can seemingly be completed at an Apple retail store by scheduling a Genius Bar appointment, or remotely by calling Apple’s support team at 1-800-MY-APPLE. On rare occasions, the Activation Lock screen linked to a wrong Apple ID email address has resurfaced. In these cases, a number of users have reported that Apple offered replacement iPhone units. It’s presently unknown as to exactly what’s causing the Activation Lock issue and Apple has yet to publicly comment on the issue. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

It’s my default way to interact with my iPhone: from checking the weather forecast through opening apps to dictating text messages. It was the sole reason I upgraded from the iPhone 4 to the 4S back in the day. At the same time, I’ve also long wanted Siri to do more. Last month, Apple finally granted the request I made last year: to give her access to third-party apps. But I was also hoping then for more – much more – while Apple seems to be content to expand Siri’s capabilities at a relatively leisurely pace. Many of Siri’s original developers, it turned out, had also grown frustrated at Apple’s apparent lack of ambition for the intelligent assistant. They wanted to proceed at a much faster pace, and finally parted company with Apple to develop a next-generation assistant, Viv. The demonstration they gave back in May seriously impressed me, and I said then than Viv was what Siri should always have become … I was hoping that Apple would eventually buy the new company just as it did the old. Those hopes have now been dashed: Viv has instead been bought by smartphone rival Samsung. It’s not clear at this point why the Viv team agreed to be acquired. Both Google and Facebook made approaches to the company earlier this year, but those discussions came to nothing. It appeared at that point that the development team might be wary of their previous experience of having their ambitions constrained by a large company, and wanted to continue doing their own thing. Both Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey had invested in the company, so it likely wasn’t short of funds. But for whatever reason, the deal has been done and Apple has lost its chance to bring back the team responsible for Siri, and the team that could have been responsible for a very much more intelligent next-generation Siri. I do think that’s bad news for Apple. Viv appears to already have capabilities that I’d love to see in Siri, and an acquisition would have been a fast way to integrate those abilities into the product. But I don’t think it’s disastrous news. While a third of the original Siri team left the company to work on Viv, two-thirds of it may still be in place. And there are of course many other people within the company hard at work on further developing Siri’s capabilities. The AI talent pool is now a large and growing one, and Apple has long been making hires and acquiring companies in the field. Apple is on record as saying that Siri is already being transformed by machine learning, with ‘a deep neural network‘ replacing its original call-and-response approach. So I’m confident that Siri will, in time, be able to do the kind of cool things Viv can do today. It’s just a shame that we’re probably going to have to wait a little longer than might otherwise have been the case.

The company will be launching the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus at 7 pm on Friday October 7.Gadgets Now | Updated: Oct 6, 2016, 06.00 PM IST NEW DELHI: Apple fans in India will have to wait a bit longer to get their hands on the latest iPhones. The company will be launching the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus at 7 pm on Friday October 7. This is in break with the tradition that the company has been following since past many years when the latest iPhones went on sale at the stroke of midnight (sharp 12 am) in India. Globally, Apple follows the same schedule. In India too, several Apple dealers with whom Gadgets Now spoke few weeks ago said that they will start the delivery of the new iPhones at 12 am on October 7. However, it seems new orders came later from the Cupertino giant as all Apple retailers in the country will now start the sales at 7 pm. Some of these retailers also told Gadgets Now that the warranty of the devices that are activated before 7 pm on October 7 will become void. Seems, this has been done to ensure that eager iPhone buyers don't pester the dealers to give the smartphones before 7 pm. In fact, many stores in the country are not even likely to get the inventory of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus before afternoon tomorrow. Apple iPhone 8 reportedly being worked upon in Israel Although no further details have been mentioned, it was reported that the next iPhone will be ‘different’ from the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 7, both of which feature almost a similar design profile. In India, Apple doesn't sell its products directly. The company instead depends on third-party retailers and distributors to sell its devices in the coutry. Apple recently tied up with country's biggest e-tailer Flipkart to sell the new smartphones. The 32GB, 128GB and 256GB variants of the iPhone 7 are priced at Rs 60,000, Rs 70,000 and Rs 80,000 respectively in India. The bigger-screen iPhone 7 Plus models are priced at Rs 72,000 for 32GB, Rs 82,000 for 128GB and Rs 92,000 for 256GB. The iPhone 7 features a 4.7-inch Retina HD display while the iPhone 7 Plus comes with a 5.5-inch Retina HD display. There's 12MP rear camera with f/1.8 aperture, 6 Element lens, 4 flash LEDs, flicker sensor and more. The smartphone's camera also uses an Image signal processor to apply machine learning to distinguish between a human and an object in the image and adjust its brightness, noise accordingly. PayTM starts pre-booking for Apple iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, offers cashback Apple iPhone 7 buyers will also be offered Rs 7,000 cashback by merchants registered on PayTM marketplace. Also, while iPhone 7 features a single 12MP rear camera, the iPhone 7 Plus comes with dual 12MP rear camera with 2x optical zooming capability up to 56mm. Both sport a 7MP FaceTime camera for selfies and video chats. Talking about the performance, the two iPhone 7 handsets are powered by the new quad-core Apple A10 Fusion processor. The processor has two high performance cores and two high efficiency cores for a longer battery life. It also has a new 6-core GPU which is claimed to be 50% faster than A9 processor, which powers iPhone 6S and iPhone 6s Plus. Apple also introduced 32GB and 128GB storage version of the older iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s Plus device. The iPhone 6s Plus 32GB version costs Rs 60,000 and the iPhone 6s 32GB storage variant costs Rs 50,000. The iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s Plus 128GB variants are priced at Rs 60,000 and Rs 70,000 respectively.

October 6, 2016 WSP If you think the first gen iPad Pro’s claim of being a laptop replacement seems like a stretch, then brace yourself for the upcoming Pro 2. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been busy working on a new superchip, one that has enough processing power to outperform a traditional desktop. The A10X, which is the beefed up version of the A10 that powers the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, boasts a faster, more robust processing power. The new chip will be seen in action on the upcoming iPad Pro. And if rumors are true, the iPad Pro may finally be the desktop killer that Apple claims it to be! It was last year when the Cupertino tech titan launched the first gen iPad Pro alongside the iPhone 6S. And while the 6S became a hit, the iPad Pro got a lukewarm reception. Long before the unveiling, Apple has been marketing the Pro as a super powered laptop replacement but the idea didn’t really fly with users. Despite having a beefed up A9X chip on the inside and outselling Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Surface tablet, the iPad Pro was considered as one of Apple’s greatest failures. It’ll be interesting to see if Tim Cook can compel more people to get rid of their laptops in place of these super powered slates. Fueling the rumor of a super chip is a report by Dutch tech blog Techtastic, which featured the A10X’s Geekbench test results. To illustrate its multitasking power, Apple’s superchip was given a multiprocessor score of 6,588, which is a huge jump from A9X’s 4,990. This means A10X’s processing speed is about 28% better than its older sibling, making the first gen iPad Pro appear sluggish to say the least. In addition, the newest chip’s scored a rating of 4236 for its single core performance. To compare, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus’ A10 chipset has a single core rating of 3500 and 5600 for multi-core performance. On the other hand, the single core rating of the A9X is around 3000. It’s worth noting that benchmark tests have been used to determine the performance of all iOS products, including the iPhone 7. According to reports, the A10X benchmarks tests were conducted in August. Apart from a super chip that’s likely to blow rivals out of the water, long-time Apple analyst Ming Chi-Kuo predicted that the company will come out with 3 new iPads, including a iPad Mini Pro. The refreshed iPad Pro 2 (12.9 inch) will be launched together with a rumored 10.5 iPad Pro and a cheaper 9.7″ iPad. The premium iPad Pro slates will come with a True Tone screen, featuring advanced ambient light sensor to adjust the illumination and color intensity of the screen according to the environment. The top tier iPad Pro will also come with 12 million-pixel iSight camera and True Tone flash. As usual, Apple went radio silent on the details (and rumors) surrounding the new iPad Pro. However, the newest iPads are likely to be launched in the spring of 2017.

According to TechCrunch, the South Korean conglomerate purchased Viv, a next-generation artificial intelligence created by three of Siri’s creators. Viv is an exciting technology, an AI designed to be extensible. Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer and Chris Brigham—all Siri veterans, left Apple within a few years of Siri’s purchase. Viv was announced in 2014 and unveiled in May of 2016. Terms of Samsung’s purchase haven’t been released. Here’s the original Viv demonstration, which was given on a MacBook Pro running Yosemite. Viv Ubiquity It seemed fairly obvious that Viv would be purchased by a larger company at some point. Serial entrepreneurs follow a certain pattern, and products like Viv or Siri are best used when leveraged across a big platform. Of course, Samsung doesn’t have a platform. Instead, Samsung has delusions of software relevance in the smartphone space. At its heart, Samsung’s smartphone business is merely an Android OEM, with redundant and often tacky software services plastered on top of Android. It’s the largest Android OEM, but that doesn’t make it a platform. But, Dag Kittlaus thinks differently. And to be fair, Mr. Kittlaus is fabulously more successful than me and probably knows what he’s talking about and doing. He told TechCrunch that Samsung would be a good corporate parent because his goal with Viv is to achieve ubiquity. From TechCrunch: They ship 500 million devices a year. You asked me onstage about what our real goal is, and I said ubiquity. If you take a look around what’s going on in the market these days, and our readiness to really expand on our distribution, it made perfect sense when we discovered that our visions are so completely aligned, and our assets using the core technology in this huge distribution, the opportunity that now is the right time, and Samsung’s the right partner. Rock on. For Now Dollars to donuts says the Viv team is gone in three years to start up Fran or maybe Betty. I don’t mean that in a snarky way. Visionaries want to revolutionize, not iterate. When technologies like Siri or Viv get acquired, the acquirer usually needs it to be iteratively improved. In the tech world, in particular, that usually means the visionary founders leave once their contractual vesting period is over. Seems likely to happen again, and I can’t wait to see what they come up with next. Samsung The idea behind the acquisition is that Viv will continue to operate as a standalone company, and provide services to Samsung’s 500 million devices per year. Never mind that most of those devices are little better than feature phones. And never mind that Google is getting serious about being a whole widget provider. I’m torn on this acquisition, to be honest. Viv is very promising. Mr. Kittlaus and his team are the bee’s knees. But I am entirely dismissive about Samsung’s me-too services. Viv is hardly me-too in and of itself, but it seems it would have the most value to an operating system maker, not a hardware OEM. I could be wrong. Maybe Vivsung will be the thing to turn Smasung’s delusions of software relevance into something real. Maybe. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: Samsung, SIri, Viv One Comment Add a comment conceptvbs October 8, 2016 Dag Kittlaus never thought of selling the company. He said in a recent interview that after learning more about Samsung’s goal as a company (turning their entire product portfolio into IoT enabled devices in two years) they saw a potential to truly affect the world: ubiquity. The one thing lacking for Viv was scale. And no one could do it better than Samsung when it comes to scale and the breath of products out (not Apple, not Sony, not Philips, not Panasonic, no one). So he thought this would be a game changer for the future. The company will be operating independently that of Samsung. In fact, the VIV platform will be available outside of Samsung: yes even iOS That was the terms that Dag had when he agreed to be bought by Samsung. The beauty of this is that it is operating system agnostic, platform agnostic and server agnostic. The future of the mobile marketplace will be in the AI space. The devices and the platform that runs them will not not matter at all. Bryan, you are thinking too narrowly on this subject. Think big. In the future, you wont be talking about platforms but instead more talk will be about the behind the scenes work of the mega AI computers and neural networks. Samsung even has neural network enabled chips in development as we speak. October 8, 2016 at 9:28 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Both operating systems offer advantages and disadvantages. While the recently-released iPhone 7 Plus is pick of the bunch for iOS, Google's Android has a few more options to choose from.

Read More Google Pixel smartphone accidentally leaked by UK retailer the day before official announcement Both the iPhone 7 Plus and Google Pixel XL have 5.5-inch screens, but the resolution on the latter is 1440p whilst the former only manages 1080p. The same is true of random access memory - useful for multitasking - as the iPhone boasts 3GB whilst Pixel offers 4GB. @evleaks/Venturebeat Both phones have fingerprint scanners - although while the iPhone puts it on the front, Google's Pixel has it round the back. Apple The new iPhone 7 Plus lineup showing off the new selection of Colours Google doesn't pull ahead in every aspect though - as the iPhone 7 Plus boasts Apple's first ever dual-lens camera. The company made a big deal about its optical zoom and high dynamic range at the iPhone launch event. We've yet to see Google's Pixel camera in action but if you use your phone to take a lot of pictures, Apple could be the way to go. Usability and features Thanks to the speed of software development, many aspects of actually using the phones are very similar. Read More iPhone 7 case brings back the missing headphone jack - and doesn't need an adapter For example, you can swipe up or down from the home screen to quickly access shortcuts. Both have voice-enabled assistants - Google Now and Siri. And both let you use fingerprint scanners to pay for items like coffee or groceries. Even the apps are similar - Google Duo is very similar to FaceTime whilst big hitters like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Snapchat are available on both platforms. The iPhone 7 Plus' big feature is the aforementioned dual lens camera while the Pixel XL trumpets Google's advancements in artificial intelligence with the Google Allo messaging app. Oh, and the Pixel XL has a 3.5mm headphone jack - unlike the iPhone 7 Plus. Read More iPhone 7 HissGate: Apple customers report hearing hissing sounds coming from their new iPhones Price Google's Pixel XL surprised a few people with its high price.

Best UK deals and where to find them Apple's iPhone 7 Plus also starts at £719 for the 32GB model. Apple The iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 5Se running iOS 10 Battery What's more, we can't know for sure how long the 3,450mAh battery on the Pixel XL lasts compared to the iPhone 7 Plus' 2,900mAh. Apple has made it clear that iOS 10 is more efficient and that its phones now last longer. But critics have still complained about both the battery life and the slow charging time of the iPhones. Who wins? If you're looking for a simple-to-use phone that takes good pictures, then Apple's iPhone 7 Plus is certainly the one to go for. You'll be paying more for the privilege - but it will update faster and, generally, hold on to its value if you want to upgrade again in a year's time. However, if you need more power and want to tinker with settings and appearances, Google's Pixel XL is probably more your cup of tea. It'll be cheaper too, and the battery will probably last longer.

The iPhone is no stranger to post-launch problems. They can be temporary, like battery life or wireless connectivity issues, or more permanent — think Bendgate or storage issues. The iPhone 7 doesn’t suffer from any “gate” scandal, but there is one issue that will make it impossible to use the phone. What’s worse is that the problem also seems to affect iPhone 6s units. DON’T MISS: After buying 9 Android smartphones in a row, this Android fan switched to the iPhone 7 According to MacRumors, some iPhone 7 and iPhone 6s experienced Activation Lock issues that make it impossible to use the device. The phone is locked to a different Apple ID email address than the owner’s, which means the phone can’t set up the iPhone, and therefore they can’t use it. “Just received my brand new 256GB Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus,” a MacRumors reader wrote. “Looks immaculate, screen is perfect, machining all fine… Only problem is, it appears someone has already used it as the iPhone is asking for the account used to activate it — o…..@icloud.com. Apple say it needs replacing […] Now got to wait for an expedited replacement iPhone once I’ve returned this one.” What’s puzzling is that the Activation Lock issue doesn’t only affect the brand new iPhone 7. It would appear that Apple’s security is acting up, and would show a similar Apple ID error on an old iPhone 6s. “I purchased an iPhone 6s full-price and outright directly from an Apple Store in September 2015,” a different reader said. “The phone was unlocked (I switched from T-Mobile to Verizon after I purchased it without issue). I recently purchased an iPhone 7 Plus, and after that phone was activated on Verizon’s network, the iPhone 6s now indicates that it has an ‘Activation Lock.’ It is also linked to some unknown iCloud account (not the account I activated it with or have been using it with for close to a full year).” Activation Lock is a security feature meant to prevent unwanted access to a lost or stolen iPhone, but it’s not clear why it’s malfunctioning on other devices. The problem isn’t widespread, and it went largely unnoticed so far. But affected users started complaining about it on social media soon after the iPhone 7’s launch. Apple is yet to address the problem officially, but the company is aware of the issue, and there are two ways to fix it. You can either have the phone replaced in a store, or have Apple remove the Activation Lock in the phones by confirming that you are the owner of the handset. The process can be completed at a Genius Bar or by calling Apple’s support team at 1-800-MY-APPLE.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Rumor: Apple may have changed the date for its FY16 fourth quarter earnings announcement to simultaneously announce next-gen MacBook Pro Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Thursday, October 6th, 2016, 05:19 Category: Hardware, MacBook Pro, Rumor, Touch ID Tweet This is an interesting rumor. Apple may have rescheduled is FY16 fourth quarter earnings to Tuesday, October 25th to accommodate the announcement of a new MacBook Pro. Moving the earnings call to earlier in the week also gives Apple a chance to quickly move past a potentially-disappointing quarterly earnings. Otherwise, the company would risk overshadowing a flashy new product announcement with news of less-than-stellar iPhone 7 sales. This wouldn’t be the first time that Apple changed the date of its earnings call. Earlier this year the date was changed so Apple executives could attend the memorial service of board member Bill Campbell. This time, however, Apple has not disclosed why it switched the date, suggesting that it might have to do with yet-to-be-announced products. The rumored next-gen MacBook Pro is thought to feature impressive new hardware upgrades such as an integrated Touch ID system and OLED touchscreen bar at the top of the keyboard. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Image: Bennian/Shutterstock In the run-up to Budget 2017, the majority of Irish business leaders are in favour of appealing EU’s Apple tax ruling – almost 50pc see Brexit as a threat. The Irish Government’s decision to appeal the Apple tax ruling by the European Commission has received the overwhelming support (86pc) of Irish business leaders, according to a pre-Budget 2017 survey by PwC. But while they believe good progress has been made on reforming the tax agenda, less than half (47pc) believe Ireland has consistently been at the forefront of tax transparency. ‘Ireland needs to continue to demonstrate internationally that we have an open and transparent corporate tax regime that is competitive and fair’ – JOE TYNAN Worryingly, nearly half (45pc) say that Brexit is more of a threat than an opportunity for Irish businesses, with only 25pc viewing Brexit as an opportunity. Nine out of 10 Irish business leaders believe Ireland needs to enhance its R&D offering. “Ireland’s economy continues to perform well above the average eurozone GDP growth rate,” said Joe Tynan, PwC Ireland’s head of tax. “The country is attracting significant foreign direct investment, despite the uncertainties posed by Brexit and global tax reform. We have a great opportunity in Budget 2017 to ensure that Ireland remains competitive, while at the same time laying the foundations for further growth. “We need to continue proactive collaboration with our OECD colleagues to ensure that we are recognised as having a corporate tax system that is fit for purpose and at the forefront of global standards. “Ireland needs to continue to demonstrate internationally that we have an open and transparent corporate tax regime that is competitive and fair,” Tynan warned. Call for better supports for entrepreneurs Business leaders in Ireland believe that Finance Minister Michael Noonan, TD, needs to improve measures to encourage investment by entrepreneurs. Almost three-quarters (74pc) are calling on Noonan to increase the ceiling on gains qualifying for the 20pc corporate tax rate. ”This is an important measure that would bring us more in line with the equivalent UK regime and help incentivise entrepreneurship and create jobs,” said Doone O’Doherty, tax director with PwC. A similar proportion of respondents (77pc) indicated a preference for the Minister to improve employee share ownership by reducing the Capital Gains Tax rate for all employees, regardless of shareholding, rather than targeting key employees. O’Doherty added: “Such a measure would be of interest to all businesses, but particularly SMEs and start-ups, who use share-based remuneration as a cost-effective means to reward employees, particularly when cash resources are limited.” More R&D support urged for Budget 2017 90pc of Irish business leaders agree that Ireland needs to enhance its R&D offering to remain an attractive location for investment. “Enhancing and maintaining Ireland’s status as an attractive location for R&D is important for increasing FDI investment,” explained Stephen Merriman, PwC Ireland research leader. “In light of strong global competition for R&D mandates, Ireland needs to do everything in its power to enhance its R&D offering. “Having an innovation ecosystem that attracts entrepreneurs, investors and key talent, while allowing new enterprises to flourish, and encouraging other companies and academia to be involved, is important,” Merriman said.

The global brand consultancy firm Interbrand has released its Best Global Brands 2016 report. Now in its 17th year, the report titled 'Anatomy of Growth' reveals and features an insider's view of how great brands grow great businesses. The report lists out the following as growth hallmarks of the Best Global Brands - a clear strategy for growth, the blurring of traditional sectors, continue to borrow from the best, and cohesiveness for customer centricity. The report also identifies the 100 most valuable global brands. Apple and Google have been named the No.1 and No.2 brands in the world, respectively, for the fourth time in a row. While Apple's brand value grew by 5 per cent to USD 178,119 million, Google's brand value rose 11 per cent to USD 133,252 million. Commenting on the report, Jez Frampton, Interbrand's global chief executive officer, says, "It's clear the best global brands are not just weathering change, but driving it. They understand their 'Anatomy of Growth' is complex, unique, and personal; they look inward and outward, expand into new markets, and create better experiences to grow their brands and businesses." The third position has been bagged by Coca-Cola while Microsoft, Toyota, IBM, Samsung, Amazon, Mercedes-Benz, and General Electric (GE) have been placed between the fourth and tenth position, respectively. The ranking is based on the three key components that contribute to a brand's cumulative value - the financial performance of the branded products and services, the role the brand plays in influencing customer choice, and the strength the brand has to command a premium price or secure earnings for the company. Ashish Mishra, managing director, Interbrand India, says, "There is an increasing shift from businesses leading brands to brands leading businesses. This opens clear avenues of growth. Brands grow businesses by building a strong culture, optimising structures and governance inside the organisations, while anchoring differentiated experiences on the outside." Interestingly, automotive and technology brands dominate the ranking in this year's report. The automotive brand Tesla has made it to the Top 100 list of the Best Global Brands as has the luxury brand Dior. The world's five Top Growing Brands include Facebook (48 per cent), Amazon (33 per cent), LEGO (25 per cent), Nissan (22 per cent), and Adobe (21 per cent). According to the report, retail is the Top Growing Sector, having witnessed an increase of 19 per cent, followed by the sporting and luxury sectors, each of which experienced a 10 per cent increase. With a network of 29 offices in 22 countries, Interbrand, which is part of the Omnicom Group Inc. network of agencies, is a global brand agency that publishes the annual Best Global Brands and Breakthrough Brands reports.

That’s why it has acquired Viv Labs, an expert in artificial intelligence, with the plan of bringing its talents to Galaxy phones and other appliances in the future. You may recognise Viv Labs’s name, and that’s because it was co-founded by Dag Kittlaus and Adam Cheyner, who also happen to have developed Siri, Apple’s AI assistant. While it’s Samsung Electronics that made the acquisition, Viv Labs will be working with closest with Samsung Mobile, and the plan is to integrate its smarts with Galaxy phones, wearables, and even home appliances. Related: With Assistant, Pixel, and Home, Google’s about to take control of its destiny However, while Samsung is the company’s new owner, Viv Labs will operate independently, a clause of the agreement that fits with Viv Labs vision of a ubiquitous, trusted virtual assistant, “that’s a regular part of our everyday lives.” It doesn’t want Viv — the name of its assistant — to be another Siri, locked into a single ecosystem. The intention is to have Viv integrated with everything, and for that to happen, it needs autonomy to act outside of Samsung’s world. Samsung may end up benefiting greatly from Viv Labs world dominating ambitions. The platform, rarely demonstrated but seen at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference earlier this year, is designed to interact with apps, devices, and other services far more deeply that we’re used to with Siri. The developer friendly stance should lead to Viv being more helpful, knowledgeable, and able to do more for us. Interaction is more conversational, and the demo showed Viv can understand very complex requests. Even more impressively, Viv can apparently adapt to previously unknown requests, and effectively write its own code to help solve a problem. Viv Labs work on Viv began four years ago, around two years after Apple acquired Siri, and has apparently since entertained bids from both Google and Facebook. Choosing Samsung, says Viv Labs in a statement, means it can tap into the millions of devices, from TVs to phones, it sells annually. It’s also attracted to Samsung’s continuing interest in software, the Internet of Things, and mobile payments. The announcement comes rapidly after Google made its big push into artificial intelligence with Assistant, which is about to debut on the new Pixel smartphones and Google Home. It joins Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, and Microsoft’s Cortana in the exciting world of artificially intelligent virtual helpers installed on our phones, and other devices. At the moment, Samsung has a degree of voice control on its Galaxy devices using S Voice (or Google’s own Android voice control), but it’s not comparable in terms of functionality to other virtual assistants. Neither Samsung nor Viv Labs talk about when we’ll see Viv integrated into Samsung devices. The next major smartphone release from the company is expected to be the Galaxy S8, but we’re also keeping a watch on the so-called Galaxy X, its innovative folding smartphone rumoured for some time. Will either of these be our first chance to chat to Viv? We don’t know yet, but we can’t wait to find out.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Updates their Futuristic Home Automation System that Replaces Physical Room Controls | Main | Apple's Latest Methodology for Producing a Mirror-Like Finish on the iPhone Revealed » October 06, 2016 Apple Advances the Heart Rate Monitor for Apple Watch   Back in June 2015, Patently Apple discovered an Apple patent filing covering a 'Wearable Multi-Modal Physiological Sensing System." Today, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office finally published Apple's U.S. version of the patent filing with a few tweaks. The patent generally covers advancing the Apple Watch Heart Rate Monitor so that it will compensate for motion like jogging that could naturally throw off a proper reading of a user's heart rate as the watch continually moves on the user's wrist.   Getting to the heart of the invention, we're able to see in Apple's patent FIG. 1 noted below an electronic device (Apple Watch) having light sensors for determining a heart rate signal. A first light sensor #110 may be co-located with a contacting light guide #102 and a first light emitter. The contacting light guide may be configured so as to be in contact with tissue #114 of a user, such as skin.   For example, the contacting light guide may be curved such that the surface is configured to the contact tissue of the user. In some examples, the contacting light guide may jut out from the body of the electronic device (Apple Watch) such that it is configured to contact the tissue of the user.     A second light sensor #112 may be co-located with a non-contacting light guide #104 and a second light emitter #108. The non-contacting light guide may be configured so as to not be in contact with the tissue of the user. In some examples, the non-contacting light guide may be recessed with respect to the body of the electronic device such that it is configured not to contact the tissue of the user.   The electronic device (Apple Watch) may be situated such that the sensors #110 and #112, the emitters #106 and #108, and the light guides and are proximate the tissue of the user, so that light from a light emitter may be directed through a light guide and be incident on the tissue. For example, the electronic device 100 may be held in a user's hand or strapped to a user's wrist, among other possibilities.   A portion of the light from a light emitter may be absorbed by the skin, vasculature, and/or blood, among other possibilities, and a portion may be reflected back to a light sensor co-located with the light emitter. In some examples, light guides may direct light to tissue and/or back to a light sensor, and some emitters and sensors may direct light to and from tissue without a light guide.   You could review our original report for finer details and background of Apple's invention here.   In today's U.S. filing, Apple is shown to have tweaked their original patent claims; claims which legally define an invention. You could review and compare the specific patent claims to see the changes. The initial patent claims could be found here while the current patent claims could be found here.   For instance, Apple adds this new method in patent claim #5: "The method of claim 1, wherein computing the heart rate signal based on the first and second light information includes performing cross-correlation on the first and second light information." Another change duly noted is that Apple has killed the original patent claims 9 through 16.     Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Now, searching for popular terms like "taxi", "calendar", or "to do list" returns a banner ad for promoted apps above the search results. Apple announced plans for the ads back in June and developers have participated in a beta testing program since that time. The App Store Search Ads system finally went live on September 28, inviting developers to purchase ad spots through the program. Those ads are now viewable by the public as of this morning. With Search Ads, developers are able to bid to have their app listed as the top result when certain keywords are used, in order to improve app discoverability. Ads are available through an auction system, with one ad displayed to customers per search result page. Ads are clearly marked as such and the content they show is the same as that on the App Store app description pages, since they use App Store metadata and imagery. According to Apple's Phil Schiller, Apple "thought about how to carefully" do search ads in a way that "customers will be happy with." Apple also believes the ad auction system is fair to developers, including indie developers.

Instead of making search algorithms better, why bother? Just put ads in, that will do the trick. And improve apple wallet. Nice one Tim, nice one... Rating: 9 Votes jclardy 6 weeks ago This feels wrong. I pay the Apple tax so that I DON'T have to see ads everywhere. The problem here is that now they are now double dipping with developers. Pay apple to get your app on the store ($99/year), give apple 30% of your revenue, and pay apple to bump your listing up and to make sure your competitors don't steal your top search result position. Rating: 6 Votes 69Mustang 6 weeks ago This is very wrong and depressing. I don't want Google the App the Store giving me adverts first. Mabye, in the end, Google like advertising on search results and end user data harvesting is where Apple is going to go anyways - cause its profitable (and people get promoted and bonuses for that). Look at all the people complaining about having to pay for iCloud storage instead of free like data harvesting providers Google / Microsoft etc.. Why is it depressing? Apple has always harvested data. Copious amounts of data. They even told us what types of data they harvest ('http://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/'). Apple's issue was they failed at monetizing the data because the vastly over estimated the price advertisers were willing to pay (iAds). They lowered and lowered and lowered the price but by that time no one was interested. This latest effort is embarrassing. If they're going to do it, they need to do it better. If I search for Pokemon Go, the first ad I see shouldn't be a fake version of Pokemon Go. https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/06/ios-app-store-search-ads/ I think where people get confused is when Apple says "we don't sell your personal data". No they don't. Neither does anyone else. But the implication is others do and based on some of the quotes on MR, the implication is believed by a lot of people. We should never confuse we don't sell with we don't collect.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Samsung Draws a Line in the Sand with Google by Acquiring Viv | Main | Apple Advances the Heart Rate Monitor for Apple Watch » October 06, 2016 Apple Updates their Futuristic Home Automation System that Replaces Physical Room Controls   Patently Apple was first to discover an Apple patent filing in Europe back in 2015 regarding a futuristic home automation system and more specifically a system that could control lighting, climate-control thermostats, window blind controls, entertainment system controls and more. Apple's invention is technically for a control apparatus, including an optical subsystem, a depth map scanner and a projection system. The application is simple. When a user walks into their family room, for example, the wall would be void of switches. When setting up the 'room control unit' as illustrated below, the projector will be set to project room controls to a set position of a wall. When the user touches a certain vicinity of the wall it acts as a virtual control pad and sets off the projector. The projector will then beam temporary virtual controls onto the wall to control devices in the room from lights, to air conditioning and entertainment systems. When the user is finished with the controls, a wave of the user's hand would close the projector, leaving the wall without any sign of switches or controls.    Patently Apple posted a report on this patent filing back in October 2015. Apple was granted a U.S. patent for this invention back on August 30, 2016. The invention was inherited by Apple when they acquired the Israeli firm PrimeSense. Apple could have just kept the invention on file if they had no interest in pursuing that technology. The good news is that the PrimeSense team now working in an Apple facility in Israel is continuing to work on this system.   The foundation of the granted patent remains the same. The changes in the system are restricted to the all-important patent claims section of the new patent filing which defines the technology that a company/Apple wishes to protect. The difference between the two sets of claims is that Apple has extended the claims from 12 claims to 18. Secondly, Apple emphasizes the use of an optical scanner and infrared which is not presented in the original claims.   For instance claim one now states that "Control apparatus, comprising: a first light source, which is configured to emit a first beam of infrared light; a second light source, which is configured to emit a second beam of visible light; an optical scanner, which is configured to scan both the first and second beams over a scene that includes a hand of a user in proximity to a wall of a room; a detector, which is configured to receive the infrared light that is reflected from the scene; and a processor, which is configured to control the second light source so as to project an image of a control device onto the wall, and to generate, responsively to the infrared light received by the detector, a depth map of the scene, to process the depth map so as to detect a proximity of the hand to the wall in a location of the projected image, and to control electrical equipment in the room responsively to the proximity.   In claim six, Apple references infrared again by stating that "The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the first light source is configured to emit the infrared light as a train of pulses, and the detector is configured to detect a time of flight of the pulses that are reflected from the scene, and wherein the processor is configured to generate the depth map based on time-of-flight data received from the optical subsystem." Apple continues to add 'infrared' references to claims 9, 10, 15, 16 and 18.   The good news is that Apple filed their new patent claims this past June proving that the home automation project is still alive and well under Apple. Whether Apple will license this technology or will work directly with companies specializing in selling sophisticated home automation systems to home builders is unknown at this time.   Apple patent application 20160291801 titled "Flexible Room Controls" was filed on June 14, 2016. You could review the new patent claims in full here.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Now you can get a CANDLE that smells like a freshly unboxed Mac (and it sells out in one day) The unusual product is the work of Apple accessory firm Twelve South The 'New Mac' fragrance features mint, peach, basil, lavender and sage 'Smell test' gave the candle  9 out of 10 for accurately recreating the scent of a newly opened Apple device By Libby Plummer For Mailonline Published: 07:08 EST, 6 October 2016 | Updated: 07:23 EST, 6 October 2016 e-mail 1k shares 155 View comments Apple fans can now get the smell of a freshly unboxed Mac without having to shell out huge amounts of cash. For just $24 (£19), aficionados of the Cupertino tech brand's products can get a candle made to smell like a 'New Mac'. The bizarre product, which is available globally, is being sold by Apple accessory maker Twelve South. Scroll down for video  For just $24 (£19), aficionados of the Cupertino tech brand's products can get a candle made to smell like a 'New Mac'. MACBOOK PRO PERFUME In 2012, perfumiers from Air Aroma created a perfume called 'Eau de MacBook Pro'. Speaking at the time, Alex Cosic of Air Aroma said: 'The scent requested by our client was quite unusual so we contacted our fragrance suppliers in the South of France to send over samples of fragrances with the aroma of glue, plastic, rubber and paper.' To ensure the precise matches were found, a brand new unopened Apple device was sent to the team of perfume makers in France. The candles are 'hand poured' in the company's hometown of Charleston in South Carolina and are scented with 'mint, peach, basil, lavender, mandarin and sage', according to the firm's website.  The Apple-themed candles are made from 100 per cent soy wax and have a claimed burn time of 45-55 hours.  The company doesn't say exactly how it selected the exact scents to include in its candle. While Apple fans may wonder exactly how accurate the 'New Mac' fragrance is,  Mac expert site MacStadium was impressed. 'On a scale of 1 to 10, I’d give it an accuracy score of 9', said reviewer Brian Stucki. Unfortunately for candle-loving Apple fans, the unusual home accessory is currently listed as out of stock after selling out in just one day.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next The real life Inception: £245 headband claims to control...

Comments By Jason Cipriani Follow Greenbot | Oct 6, 2016 4:00 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Android Google Pixel Comments Google’s Pixel namesake has long been associated with premium devices sold at higher price points; its existence was primarily to inspire its Chromebook partners. Now that the Pixel line has expanded to smartphones, Google’s positioning of the Pixel line has shifted. The Pixel is a direct competitor to Apple’s iPhone, and thus by extension, it has to compete with Google’s Android partners, such as Samsung, LG, Huawei, Motorola, Sony, and HTC. In an interview with Bloomberg, Rick Osterloh, head of the newly formed hardware division within Google, made it abundantly clear the company’s Pixel and Pixel XL phones were designed and built by Google, for Google. Technically, the Pixels are built by HTC, who is acting as a contract manufacturer, much in the same way Foxconn builds Apple’s iPhone. The real question is, what kind of impact will the Pixel have on Google’s longstanding partnerships? Nexus is dead. Long live Nexus. Google is done with the Nexus line, forgoing any future partnerships to “showcase the best of Android” (as Nexus devices were often framed). Nexus was known for affordability, developer friendliness, and guaranteed updates directly from Google. Looking at the Android market, it’s clear the Nexus program worked. OnePlus and ZTE are just two examples of device manufacturers who adopted the Nexus-approach, producing high-quality devices at a low price, with a nearly “stock” Android experience. Google had previously flirted with the idea of competing on the high-end of the smartphone market. Two years ago, the Nexus 6 was priced to compete with the iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy line, but failed to make a dent on the smartphone market. It was far too big, and had a mediocre camera, for starters. With the Pixel line, Google is adding features exclusive to their own smartphones—such as Google Assistant right in the launcher, unlimited Google Photos storage, and built-in customer support—with devices unapologetically priced at the high end. Retail availability hurts In the U.S., you can purchase the Pixel through three different channels: Verizon Wireless, Best Buy, or the Google Store. Not to take anything away from Verizon’s influence on the wireless industry, but the lack of wide carrier availability is going to hurt the Pixel’s adoption. “The introduction of the Pixel phones will not significantly affect Google’s Android partners, such as Samsung,” Gartner analyst Mark Hung told Greenbot in an email. “Given that the only carrier partner is Verizon, the phones are going to see limited channel coverage,” Hung continued. Why? The majority of consumers purchase a smartphone in a carrier store. Lacking shelf space and marketing dollars from three out of the four major U.S. carriers, the Pixel is at a disadvantage compared to any smartphone available in all four carrier stores. (READ: Samsung and Apple.) Granted, Google and Verizon will likely put a lot of money behind marketing the Pixels (Google already is) , but upgrade purchases inside a carrier store just won’t be possible for those not on Verizon. It’s not hard to imagine a customer deciding between the Galaxy S7 Edge and the Pixel XL, seeing a demo of Google Assistant, and being swayed to the Pixel. Not having shelf space in AT&T, Sprint, or T-Mobile stores is only going to hurt the Pixels. Educating consumers about Google Assistant isn’t only going to sell more phones, but it’s going to push artificial intelligence even further into the mainstream—if Assistant lives up to Google’s promises, that is. Microsoft is doing the same thing… kind of Google’s approach of designing high end devices, and in turn competing with its partners, isn’t new. Microsoft is already doing it with its Surface lineup, framing its Surface line as something Windows’ partners should strive to replicate, not as a direct competitor to its partners. Hung agrees, telling Greenbot: “The Pixels represent more of a reference design for Google’s partners to emulate, similar to Microsoft with its Surface Pros in the tablet market.” Although, Microsoft isn’t keeping a headlining feature to itself, in the way Google is currently limiting Assistant to the Pixels. Android partners will gain access to Assistant at some point in 2017, but until then the Pixel exclusive is a distinct advantage for Google partners. At the end of the day, Google is putting pressure on the entire Android ecosystem, forcing its partners to innovate beyond refreshing hardware designs and throwing in a couple custom apps for good measure. Arguably, it’s the best thing Google could be doing for Android at the moment. Ideally, the ability to buy a premium Android phone at retail or carriers with no bloatware and timely updates would force other makers to deal with these two common frustrations. However, Until Google pushes its Pixel lineup into all major carrier stores, in front of more consumers on a daily basis, its partners don’t have too much to worry about.

Independent security experts have downplayed concerns about a reported flaw in iOS 10 private browsing. Stacey Jury, a digital forensic analyst at IntaForensics, found that the private browsing mode in Apple iOS 10 is not foolproof, since it does not delete your data correctly, leaving it open to recovery. “Apple have made the private browsing feature in Safari less ‘private’ in IOS 10… suspend state is now stored in a database which means recovering deleted records is now possible,” Jury explains. Using a iPhone 5S running IOS 10.0.1, Jury says she was able to recover web pages opened in Safari’s private mode from a database using XRY, a computer forensics tool, detailed in a blog post by IntaForensics here. Apple routinely ignores request for security comment from El Reg, so we’re not sure whether or not a fix for the reported flaw is in the works. Russian computer forensics software firm Elcomsoft, which we approached for comment on IntaForensics research, said it hasn’t come across any major issues in “private mode” browsing with the latest version of Apple’s smartphone and tablet software. “We looked at iOS private browsing mode a little bit, but have not found any issues - implementation seems to be good enough; all temp files seem to be properly deleted, visited links are not being saved in history etc,” Vladimir Katalov of ElcomSoft told El Reg. Other independent third parties also played down the significance of the vulnerability reported by IntaForensics. Lee Munson, security researcher for Comparitech.com, commented: “The flaw only relates to iPhone and iPad backups saved directly through iTunes on a Mac or PC, rather than via iCloud - which is the method adopted (knowingly or otherwise) by the majority of Apple’s customers.” He added: “That small subset of fruity fans that do manually back up are hardly at risk either – as long as their Mac or PC is itself secured via a strong password (a long mixture of letters, numbers and symbols), they have very little to worry about.” ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 4 Comments More from The Register Apple, Mozilla kill API to deplete W3C battery-snitching standard Idea for low-powered HTML adjustments abandoned after security implications explored 20 Comments Apple fans using Chrome on alert for Mac malware Google AdWords has been spewing software nasties 20 Comments Mozilla wants woeful WoSign certs off the list Backdating SHA-1 certs is just not on 23 Comments Mozilla emits JavaScript debugger for Firefox and Chrome When it's easier to rewrite than refactor 7 Comments Brave idea: Ex Mozilla man punts Bitcoin adblocking browser Pay direct, avoid the advertising 33 Comments Mozilla plots TLS 1.3 future for Firefox Quicker handshake starts encrypting data sooner 7 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

By JOHN GORALSKI EDITOR Anthony Angelillo Jr., or “A.J.” as he’s known in the family, almost knocked his grandmother to the ground as she walked in the front door last Wednesday. As soon as he saw, the elementary school student burst across the room and leapt into her arms. Just moments before, Angelillo learned that Helen Swanson was this year’s “Granny Apple” winner as a result of his essay to the Apple Harvest committee. “He asked me if he could write a letter for me, and I told him that it was up to his mom and dad,” Swanson said before taking the stage. “He asked his mom and dad, and he went right at it, right away.” On Friday, Oct. 7, the pair was brought onto the stage on the town green during opening ceremonies for the 48th annual Apple Harvest Festival, and Angelillo read his award-winning essay to the crowd. “My granny is a good apple because she always helps us with our homework. She makes us good food. She helps us get ready for school. She lets us have sleepovers at her house. She takes us to Dairy Queen for ice cream. She takes us to the park,” he said. “I hope you like what I wrote about my granny.” The annual contest has become a big part of the opening ceremonies. In the weeks leading up to the festival, committee members reach out to local elementary school students, and the nominations come pouring in. “We ask who has the best granny apple?” said Town Councilor and AHF co-chair Cheryl Lounsbury. “This year, we received many, many, many applications.” Swanson said that the honor was particularly special for her because the Apple Harvest has become such a big tradition in her family. She remembers attending the first festival and has been coming ever since, later with her kids, and now with her grandchildren. “This has been so much fun,” she said. “I’m really looking forward to the parade.” Two days later, the pair smiled at the crowds atop a convertible. Swanson sat on the back seat, displaying her sash proudly. A.J. was dancing alongside her, beaming, and waving to the grandstand. “There she is,” said parade emcee Ed Dressel. “It’s this year’s Granny Apple. The best grandma in town.” To comment on this story or to contact Observer editor John Goralski, email him at JGoralski@SouthingtonObserver.com.

Tags: Apple-Apple+ Wearables-Wearables+ Pages 1 Introduction, Design and Display 2 Interface, Functionality, Performance and Connectivity 3 Camera, Multimedia, Call quality, Battery life and Conclusion Photos Comments Intro Apple has a well-deserved reputation for helping to define our expectations for what are still, to many shoppers, new product types. The iPhone showed both consumers and other handset manufacturers alike how much untapped potential there was in the burgeoning smartphone market, and the iPad helped tablets move away from their characterization as either under-equipped laptops or blown-up phones to a novel, useful form factor in its own right. After those milestones, it was only understandable that all eyes were on Apple as the smartwatch movement began to take shape. Companies like Pebble started getting that ball rolling, and by early 2014, smartwatches felt like they were on the brink of going mainstream, with Android Wear about to make its debut – so where was Apple's eagerly awaited effort? We had to be patient, and confirmation of the Apple Watch didn't land until the waning days of summer 2014. Even then, it was still a bit of a tease – Apple may have announced its inaugural wearable product, but it wouldn't be until the spring of 2015 that users could actually pick up an Apple Watch for themselves. But when that day finally arrived, Apple quickly picked up a sizable chunk of the smartwatch market with an attractive, well-executed series of models offering a variety of material types, sizes, and style options. But for all the Apple Watch did well, ever since its debut we've been wondering, “what's next?” After all, that odd pre-announcement strategy sure felt like Apple was rushing to get its wearable to market, and maybe we'd see a very different Watch once Apple had some time to sit back and see how consumers responded, experiment some more with design and construction techniques, and reflect upon what it learned from this first-gen launch. It took well over another year, but last month we finally saw the fruits of those efforts, with the release of the new Apple Watch Series 2. It's far from a back-to-the-drawing-board upgrade, and if this were an iPhone, we'd be calling it the Apple Watch S, but with a smattering of new features, some upgraded watch software, and a fresh new iPhone to pair it with, is this the Apple Watch sequel we've been waiting for, or a case of too little, too late? Let's take a look at the new Apple Watch Series 2. In the box: Apple Watch Series 2 (for this review, the 38mm Silver Aluminum Case with White Sport Band) Pair of Sport Bands (S/M and M/L) Magnetic wireless charger AC adapter How-to-guide Safety/warranty slip Design Upgrades await within, but that's one familiar-looking body In the months leading up to the launch of Apple's second-get Watch, rumors furiously speculated about what sort of look we might get. Would Apple add new hardware like a camera to its wearable? What about changing up the design with something like a curved display, or adding new controls to the existing button and crown? Well, after all that noise, we're coming away with an Apple Watch Series 2 that's a near spitting image of the original; unless you plan on flipping one over and checking the text surrounding the Watch's optical heart-rate sensors, you'd be hard-pressed to tell this one apart from the first model. That may upset Apple fans who were looking to see the company take more risks with its wearable's design, but really it speaks to Apple's confidence that it was headed down the right path the first time around; sometimes you need to take a few stabs before you find a look that really resonates (look no further than Samsung's early Galaxy Gear watches), but if you do manage to come up with a hit right out of the gate, maybe there's something to be said for staying the course. None of this is to say that Apple's new smartwatch is a pure rehash of the first-gen model, but the manufacturer has been positively conservative in the upgrades it's decided to employ. And while there are some surprises lurking within, there's little in the new Apple Watch's design that betrays its upgraded internals. Maybe the clearest indication that you're dealing with a new Apple Watch comes in the form of some new Series 2-only variants. For instance, there's the new Apple Watch Nike+ with its perforated strap and multi-tone styling. And the high-end Apple Watch Edition graduates from a conspicuously showy gold body to one crafted from extra-strong ceramic. There's even the Apple Watch Hermès, with its designer straps and buckles. But for all these variants, the basic look of the Apple Watch remains more or less unchanged. What changes to that basic look that can be discerned are almost too small to spot, which is good because they may just be steps in the wrong direction: while the face of the new Apple Watch retains the same dimensions as the first-gen model, the watch body itself grows just under a millimeter in thickness – from 10.5 to 11.4mm. And correspondingly, weight takes a step up, too, as the 38mm Watch grows from 25 to 28.2 grams, and the 42mm model from 30 to 34.2 grams. Those figures are for aluminum bodies, and will vary for steel and ceramic. Oddly, the 38mm ceramic Apple Watch is thicker than every other model, at 11.8mm. Thankfully, the new Apple Watch doesn't really feel that bulky, despite its growth spurt. With the 38mm model we looked at, the watch's curves help it appear slim even with its objectively thicker build, and the extra weight doesn't make the smartwatch feel overly burdensome to wear. With wearables, thin is great, but if you can (smartly) do slightly thicker without ruining things in the process – well, we suppose that works, too. Finally, we've got a functional change, that we might as well talk about in the same breath as these other external hardware updates: Apple's super-charged the Watch's water resistance, moving from protection against sweat, rain, and a quick hand-washing (though with Apple advising against full-on submersion) to rated for submersion in depths up to 50 meters. There are still all sorts of asterisks attached to that classification, though – Apple warns against the combination of water and high speeds, like you'd experience while waterskiing. But even with those concerns in mind, this is still a big upgrade to the smartwatch's durability.   Popular galleries Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7 Google Pixel Review Google Pixel XL Review LG V20 Review Apple iPhone 7 Plus Review Apple iPhone 7 Review Moto G4 Play Review Meizu MX6 Review Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Asus ZenPad Z8 Review FIT 100%-+ ‹ PREV 1 of 9 NEXT › image image image image image image image image image ‹ Prev Next View As One Page » View As Slideshow » 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. Display Apple heard your demands for a brighter screen and delivers Arguably even more so than with a smartphone, we expect a lot from a smartwatch's display. It needs to be easily readable in all manner of environmental conditions, as usable up close as at arm's length, and convey all its information to the user without sucking dry the watch's battery in mere hours. The OLED panel of the first-gen Apple Watch was already quite attractive, offering a screen that blended seamlessly in to the watch's glossy black face, while also proving the bold colors and sharp contrast that OLED screens are known for. With its second-gen hardware, Apple – much like with the wearable's overall design – didn't decide to move in a drastically different direction. We've got the same resolutions as before: 272 by 340 pixels for 38mm models, and 312 by 390 pixels for 42mm variants. And just like before, the most affordable aluminum options protect their screens with Ion-X strengthened glass, while steel and fancier options – now ceramic instead of gold – get synthetic sapphire crystals. All of this sounds like business as usual, but there is one key upgrade hitting the Watch's display: with Series 2, the screen is now noticeably brighter; Apple claims twice as bright as the original, hitting an output of 1,000 nits. That sound likes a big deal, and truthfully it goes a long way towards helping out with daytime visibility. But it would still be nice to see more fine-grained brightness controls in Apple's software. Right now, watchOS offers only a three-way toggle between brightness levels, and there doesn't appear to be a huge difference between the middle and top spots. While that makes it harder than it should be to appreciate all this extra brightness, we didn't really have any problems with visibility during our tests.

Apples watch face is off for most of its life. That is a joke when it comes to a watch. Pebble, Android Wear, and Tizen devices have their watch faces on all the time.

TechieXP1969 (Posts: 10429; Member since: 25 Sep 2013) There is not a wearable I have tried that get 18 hours if you actually use them. Especially if they have GPS and you install and app that uses it. In order to get 18 hours, you would need to only use it to tell time. The Gear S2 last 2.5 days on a single charge in my experience, when I do nothing but read notifications and count steps and check the time. If you actually try to use an app for an extended period of time, it dies. I used S-Health to track a day at Six Flags. It was using GPS. I pulled it off the charger at 10AM and it was dead by 6PM. Playing music wireless to my headphones, I got roughly close to 6 hours of usage. These things suck when you actually try to use them. The batteries are just too small. For what all of them cost, especially since the apps are all but useless since they just repeat with limited functions what a phone does already, they should have much better battery-life. They need to last a week on a single charge and at least a full 24 hour day with heavier usage. posted on 05 Oct 2016, 11:40 3 Reply 13.

Searching for popular terms like "taxi," "calendar," or "to-do list" delivers a banner advert for promoted apps above the search results. The company announced plans for this earlier this year, and a small number of iPhone and iPad users signed up to the iOS 10 beta have already been shown the ads. From this week onwards, though, they're rolling out to regular users, too. Another paid ad under a search for "calendar." (The Verge) The addition of paid ads are part of Apple's plan to shake up its revenue model for apps. In an interview with The Verge earlier this year, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller, said the company wants to be "fair to developers, and fair for indie developers, too." As the App Store becomes ever more crowded, it's become harder for apps to stand out. Paid ads can combat this, and Apple is also helping by purging the App Store of abandoned apps. Will the paid ads work, though, or will they be gamed in a way that harms users? For example, a screenshot posted by VentureBeat of a search for "pokémon" in the App Store shows an ad for what looks to be a Pokémon knock-off named Catch ém. It's also sitting right above the most likely desired search result, Pokémon Go, suggesting that spammers might just use paid ads to hijack popular search results. Nevertheless, Apple is keen for developers to get involved in this experiment, and is offering $100 in credit to app makers who sign up now.

Britta O'Boyle20 October 2016Phone Google / Apple Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Google's Pixel and Pixel XL replace the Nexus line-up with a couple of premium and desirable devices running pure Android. The Pixel is the smaller of the two smartphones and its price tag puts it in iPhone territory. The question is, how does it compare to Apple's latest model? Read on for the differences and similarities between the Google Pixel and Apple's iPhone 7. Google Pixel review Apple iPhone 7 review Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7: Design Both premium designs with fingerprint sensors iPhone 7 smaller, slimmer, lighter and waterproof  Pixel has headphone jack and USB Type-C The Google Pixel and Apple iPhone 7 look different as you would expect, but both offer stunning, premium, well-built designs. The Pixel opts for a combination of aluminium and glass, with a fingerprint sensor on the rear, while the iPhone 7 is all about aluminium and places its fingerprint sensor within the Home button on the front. The iPhone 7 is water and dust resistant to IP67, while the Pixel is only IP53, meaning it cannot be submerged. The headphone jack is removed on the iPhone 7 in favour of the Lightning only and stereo speakers, while the Pixel has down-firing speakers either side of the USB Type-C port, but it keeps the headphone jack intact at the top. There are no physical buttons on the front of Pixel. The Pixel measures 143.8 x 69.5 x 8.6mm and weighs 143g, while the iPhone 7 is smaller, lighter and slimmer, measuring 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm and weighing 138g. Google's phone comes in Very Silver, Quite Black and Really Blue, though the latter is not coming to the UK. Apple's phone comes in Rose Gold, Gold, Silver, Black and Jet Black. Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7: Display Pixel has larger, crisper display iPhone 7 has 3D Touch for more functionality Pixel uses AMOLED, iPhone 7 uses LCD The Google Pixel has a 5-inch display with a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution for a pixel density of 441ppi. It is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and it uses AMOLED technology, which means it delivers rich and vibrant colours. Viewing angles are great and the screen is sharp and bright. The Apple iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch LCD display with a 1334 x 750 resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 326ppi. Based on the numbers, the Pixel offers sharper and crisper images, but the iPhone 7's display is still excellent, even if the resolution is slightly lower than its competition. The iPhone 7 also has 3D Touch, which is Apple's version of a pressure sensitive display. Users will get access to different features and functions based on the force with which they press. Google Pixel XL vs Apple iPhone 7 Plus vs Samsung Galaxy Note 7: What's the difference? Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7: Camera Both have 12MP rear sensors, but iPhone has wider aperture Pixel has higher resolution front camera, but iPhone again has wider aperture iPhone 7 has optical image stabilisation The Google Pixel has a 12.3-megapixel rear camera offering an aperture of f/2.0 and 1.55µm pixels. There is video stabilisation, phase detection autofocus and laser detection autofocus all on board, along with a dual-LED flash. The Apple iPhone 7 also has a 12-megapixel rear camera with a slightly wider aperture of f/1.8. It has optical image stabilisation and phase detection autofocus, as well as a quad-LED flash. In terms of the front-facing snappers, the Pixel has an 8-megapixel f/2.4 sensor with 1.4µm pixels, while the iPhone 7 has a 7-megapixel f/2.2 sensor with a Retina Flash. Both the Pixel and iPhone 7 deliver excellent, consistent results so you shouldn't be disappointed with either. Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7: Hardware Both quad-core processors, but Pixel has more RAM support Both available in 32GB and 128GB models, but iPhone also comes in 256GB Pixel has bigger battery capacity The Google Pixel and the Apple iPhone 7 both feature a quad-core processor under their hoods. The Pixel opts for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 with 4GB of RAM support, while the iPhone 7 features Apple's A10 Fusion chip and embedded M10 motion coprocessor and there is 3GB of RAM support. The Pixel is available in 32GB and 128GB storage options and the iPhone 7 is available in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB options. Neither device offers microSD storage expansion. In terms of battery, the Pixel has a 2770mAh capacity, while the iPhone 7 is thought to be significantly smaller at 1960mAh. In real world use, the iPhone 7's battery life isn't amazing, but the Pixel does perform well, delivering at least a day of use.  Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7: Software Pixel runs vanilla Android iPhone 7 runs iOS Both have personal assistants The Google Pixel runs on Android 7.1 Nougat and it features Google Assistant built-in, accessed via a long press of the home button in the new launcher. It's a pure Android experience so it doesn't feature software bloatware like a Samsung or Sony for example. It brings with it all the latest features Google has to offer through Android and for those of you who are Google users and have Google accounts, you'll get a seamless experience. The Apple iPhone 7 runs on iOS 10, which brings with it all the latest features Apple has to offer. In terms of personal assistant, you get Siri, who is accessed via a long press of the physical Home button on the front of the device. For those of you who have Macs or use other Apple devices, the iPhone 7 will deliver a seamless experience across all your devices. Google Pixel exclusive features explored: A cut above the rest of Android? Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7: Price Both start at £599 Both the Google Pixel and Apple iPhone 7 start at £599 for the 32GB model. Add another £100 and you'll be able to get your hands on a 128GB model of either.  The iPhone 7 is also then offered in a 256GB model, as we mentioned, which costs a further £100 for a price of £799. Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7: Conclusion The Google Pixel and Apple iPhone 7 are very closely matched in terms of specs and price. The Pixel trumps the iPhone in terms of display size and resolution, RAM, battery capacity and front-facing camera resolution. The iPhone trumps the Pixel in terms of physical size, waterproofing, display functionality and storage options. Ultimately, the decision between these two devices will come down to which design you prefer and which platform you prefer. Both are solid in their builds, seamless in their performance and they both have brilliant cameras.

 Steve Wozniak says he's stopped backing crowdfunding projects because 'you never get to see their accounting' Sam Shead Oct. 6, 2016, 5:45 AM 4,439 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak.Business Insider/Sam Shead Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak, or "Woz" as he's commonly known, designed some of Apple's first products back in the 70s and 80s, including the Apple I and the Apple II, which revolutionised the personal computing industry. As a result, he's somewhat of an icon in Silicon Valley.  Today he's still technically an Apple employee but he found time this week to come to London and speak at the Festival of Marketing conference on Wednesday. We caught up with Woz on a tour bus outside the conference ahead of his keynote. Here's what he had to say during our five-minute chat. Which areas of technology do you think will have the biggest impact on humanity in the next couple of decades? I think a lot of the areas that artificial intelligence gets into. Of course, I’m leaving out biotech because I’m not close enough to biotech. I’m [also] leaving out quantum computers because I’m not into quantum computers. But I think artificial intelligence, machines that interact with us, will be more helpful than we ever imagined. That’s number one. Virtual reality is such an incredible experience. Our entire trend from the earliest computers to personal computers has been to make the resolution seem more realistic like I’m in a real world and not a little fake cartoon 8-bit world. I’m not in that 8-bit world anymore and virtual reality takes huge bandwidth. We’re going to have to conquer some challenges of bandwidth on DSL, copper lines to your home, and on wireless to even be able to send really high quality virtual reality but it puts you in an entirely different space that is so incredible. Do you have any concerns about AI in the future? At one point I had concerns about AI because if you replace brains and then all of a sudden companies with people lose money and the machines do everything for us and we have no jobs left, I thought that way and then I totally reversed myself for a lot of reasons. One being that Moore’s law isn’t going to make those machines smart enough to think really the way a human does. Another is when machines can out think humans they can’t be as intuitive and say what will I do next and what is an approach that might get me there. They can’t figure out those sorts of things. We aren’t talking about artificial intelligence actually getting to that point. It’s sort of like it magically might arise on its own. These machines might become independent thinkers. But if they do, they’re going to be partners of humans over all other species just forever. Where would you like to see Apple go next? Well, Apple is such a huge company. I think that smartphones are going to be handheld devices for ages and ages, just like cars are kind of the same as they were 100 years ago: shape, size, looks and what they do for you. I would like Apple to be the leader [with] the top smartphones in all categories. It’s very difficult for large companies to move fast into new technology areas and try to explore whether this might be the future. We’ll find out whether this goes or it doesn’t go? Apple, though, has to consider staying huge in size. Once a company is huge they have to stay huge. They’ll probably go after something very big that we’ll spend lots of our money on. Things like housing, energy, and automobiles. Steve Wozniak playing segway polo.Hermann J. Knippertz / AP Images What’s the worst thing that you’ve backed on Kickstarter? Turns out that I can’t remember what I’ve backed on Kickstarter. I think I backed/started the chip computer and Raspberry Pi maybe and they turned out great in my life, you know, great hobbies of mine. But the worst thing is I can’t remember, I’ve got so many, by the time they arrive they either didn’t work or didn’t do things as well as other options I have, or were kind of duds in my mind, or I didn’t have time for them. I’ve actually turned away from self-funding for now. Kickstarter and Indiegogo and those sort of things. Why? You never get to see their accounting. You never get to see how they used your money. It’s not like a real open company. Interesting. Are you still riding your segway or have you moved onto hover boards now? *Small chuckle* I actually ordered a couple of hover boards and never got them. I probably got ripped off. I ride my segway as much as ever. I ride it out of my house and into town in 10 minutes. I do shopping, entertainment, dining. I carry it in my car so when I’m in a different city I can pull it out of my Tesla and slide around electrically and learn a city well. And I play segway polo still. Awesome. You made some slightly controversial comments about Apple removing the headphone jack. What do you make of the AirPods? As far as the AirPods and Apple removing the standard headphone jack, I had some kind of mild comments that got way taken out of proportion. Apple's new AirPods.Apple For example, in the same sentence that I say it’s going to bother a lot of people, I would say I actually approve of when Apple gets rid of these things. Because you know what, I have this tiny little low cost adapter that makes all my normal headphones work if I want them to. I’ve never plugged any headphones into my iPhone so why do I really care personally? However, I worry about EarPods that are Bluetooth because I have tested my music, which is very important to me in my life, and I’ve tested it in my cars and on my Jambox [speaker] and the Ultimate Ears device I have. I’ve tested them on Bluetooth and it doesn’t sound like music. It loses that sparkle at the high end. So maybe it’s good enough for voice or listening to news shows or something. I’ll tell you one thing, I do like the little lightweight headphones. The ones that had a special charger from Apple in the old 30 pin connector days for iPod. These little headphones were the lightest, most comfortable, they stuck in all day long. I actually love that style.

ADVERTISEMENT Viv labs has developed a unique, open AI platform that gives third-party developers the power to use and build conversational assistants and integrate a natural language-based interface into renowned applications and services. Samsung wants to use Viv in its phones, TVs and other devices. “The deal showcases Samsung’s commitment to virtual personal assistants and is part of the company’s broader vision to deliver an AI-based open ecosystem across all of its devices and services,” the company said in a statement. Read more Finish him! AI can now play Mortal Kombat better than you Finish him! AI can now play Mortal Kombat better than you By Matt Burgess Viv’s chief executive officer, Dag Kittlaus, was part of the team that developed Siri, the digital assistant Apple bought in 2010. Kittalus worked at Apple for three years after the acquisition before leaving to create Viv in 2012. In the public demo of Viv earlier this year, Kittlaus said he wanted the system to be “the intelligence interface for everything.” Viv says it is building the “simplest way for anyone to talk to devices and services everywhere”. “We see a future that is decidedly beyond apps – where you can get what you need quickly and easily no matter where you are,” added Kittlaus. ADVERTISEMENT Read more Apps are dying. Long live the subservient bots ready to fulfil your every desire Apps are dying. Long live the subservient bots ready to fulfil your every desire By James Temperton The AI platform is supposed to be more interconnected than other agents, like Siri. It can interact with multiple silos of information across apps and services to start talking to one another and become links in a user’s command chain. The programmatic nature of its back-end systems means that Viv’s AI is capable of writing its own code to accomplish new tasks. Viv calls this “dynamic program generation”. Earlier this week, Google launched its new AI personal assistant, which will be incorporated into its new Pixel smartphones and Home speaker. ADVERTISEMENT It will use Google’s search technology to find answers from the internet before they are read out to the user. Google's Assistant is also able to tap into its other services. Once permission is granted, the AI can scan emails, calendars, files, and personal photos held in other Google products. Amazon has also ventured into the AI market with its personal voice assistant Alexa, recently launched in the UK. Alexa is part of its Amazon Echo range, voice-activated home audio speaker systems with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. It is always learning to adapt to speech patterns, vocabulary, and personal preferences.

The newer Apple's maybe lighter and have other perks but they do not have a DVD slot. Granted most people these days stream their videos or use Netflix, but living in a country setting and relying on limited WiFi the DVD feature satisfies our needs. Couldn't be more pleased! Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: pumpkincq10 (1) (0) by allenlouis Apr 14, 2016 Apple I have a Macbook Air, 2014, SSD, clearly a fine laptop. The 2012 Macbook Pro was added to my Apple products. I like the system, although it doesn't have the SSD, so speed is not up to par (SATA). Also one of my complaints is the sound volume is very low, the volume control is maxed out, apparently this is a problem with this release year. It is heavy and the battery life does not compare with the Air. I do like the fact that it has a DVD drive. I have gained memory and after researching, have found that I can increase the memory to 16mb, this is one reason I settled on a used Macbook Pro, also i can install an SSD drive. For me this was my purchasing criteria. I like the Apple line and it is hard to find fault, although clearly there are areas that need to be improved upon. I would recommend this laptop. Once you get past the cost, it's all good.

I sometimes have clients that want instant gratification. So I sometimes have to build them a deliverable on CD or DVD. the built in Drive comes in very handy) I haven't downloaded all of my software just yet, but I'm getting to it and all have to is go to the app store where all thus stuff is paid for and I can download and install it.

UNIX based OS. Like my favourite Debian, but with lots of animations. 5). Design. Yeah, it's amazing! Cons: 1). Price. Yep, 600$ for used laptop is not very nice. 2). Screen resolution. When I'm working a long time for a laptop, my eyes tired. Wants Retina. 3). No HDMI port, only MiniDP and useless FireWire. Well, laptop is great, but in 2016 Macbook Pro with Retina is more preferred.

International / 6 October 2016, 11:09am Mark Bergen and Mark Gurman San Francisco - Google unveiled new hardware from smartphones and smart speakers to wireless routers on Tuesday. It was a year-long odyssey that involved design, supply chain negotiations and the search for a manufacturing partner. Now the Alphabet unit must grapple with the equally daunting challenge of getting the gadgets to consumers. It has a history of retail strategies that either struggled or never got off the ground, according to people familiar with the company’s retail efforts. What’s more, it’s inexperienced dealing with returns and recycling. And unlike rival Apple, the company lacks its own stores where it can showcase hardware as it pleases and instead relies on other companies’ in-store displays. The Google Pixel smartphone, Google Home and Google Daydream View on display at the launch event. Picture: John G. Mabanglo. Credit: EPA This time, the stakes are higher because the latest gadgets are vehicles for Google’s digital assistant, a key product that is chasing Amazon.com’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri. “We view go-to-market as a clear hurdle to wide acceptance, which will require investments in brand, marketing and distribution to overcome,” UBS analyst Eric Sheridan wrote in a note to investors. Google is selling the new Pixel phones at Verizon Communications and Best Buy stores in the US, via its own online store, a temporary physical store in New York City and through its wireless service Project Fi. It’s working with a small number of other wireless carriers and retailers in countries including Germany and India. Google Home, the new speaker, is available at Best Buy, Wal-Mart Stores and Target stores, in addition to Google’s online store. Customer service Cutting distribution deals with a handful of carriers and retailers isn’t enough, according to Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson. “Google will have to up its customer-service game and do many more distribution partnerships,” he said. Many of Google’s past efforts at selling hardware have fizzled. When the company started its Nexus brand in 2010 it planned to market the phones online only, but sales never took off. About 200 000 of the first Nexus model sold, short of Google’s target of several million units, according to a person who worked on the device. Before that Nexus launch, Google planned unique software features for the device, such as voice-to-text services and maps navigation, but Verizon, the exclusive carrier partner, balked at the idea, this person said. Verizon spokeswoman Kelly Crummey declined to comment on the 2010 partnership. For the Pixel, the wireless carrier “worked with Google on what this phone would look like and the customer experience because it is available through us”, she said. Then there was Android Silver. Kicked off some time in 2014, the internal project was designed to sell high-end Android handsets with partners to compete with Apple. Google set up a retail lab for the effort, claiming an entire building near its Mountain View, California headquarters, according to former employees. But it never got off the ground. Nikesh Arora, Google’s sales chief at the time, drove the initiative. When he left in July 2014, Android Silver was shelved. One former Google executive called it a boondoggle. The former Googlers didn’t want to be identified discussing private information. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. Apple envy Such experiments are a contrast to Apple stores that are the envy of the retail industry. Apple considers the iPhone in terms of the product’s complete life cycle, from leaving the factory to when customers stop using the device. Apple offers a recycling programme through physical and online stores. Google’s new smartphone unit approached potential wireless carrier partners early this year, according to a person familiar with the situation. Some carriers peppered Google executives with questions about handling phone returns and technical support, the person said. At the time, Google did not appear ready to take on these aspects of the phone hardware business, according to this person. Google executives on the hardware team say the company is on a “journey,” gaining experience and capabilities with each smartphone generation. And Apple only began touting the iPhone’s full life cycle after a few generations. Responsible returns On Tuesday, as a Google event began in San Francisco, new hardware chief Rick Osterloh reassured the audience that the company was serious about the move. “We’re in it for the long run,” he said. About nine months after initial talks with carriers, Google rolled out its flavour of technical support: Pixels have built-in chat support where customer-service reps can take over smartphone screens to identify problems. Google will be responsible for returns and recycling and is building a supply chain that can re-absorb faulty and rejected devices, Osterloh said in a recent interview. Osterloh will be partly judged by how many devices Google sells, a contrast to the Nexus program which showcased Android features for other handset makers to adopt. But the executive was still cagey about the company’s sales aspirations. “In markets where we do business, we’re definitely going to want meaningful share,” he said. “But it’s highly unlikely that the primary driver will be to be in every market with as high as possible volume.” Google still sees software as its edge, rather than retail distribution and customer service. The company spent more time on Tuesday talking about the digital assistant baked into its new gadgets, and how they work together. If Google can get millions of people relying on its assistant, the company may be able to compete with Apple’s devices, according to Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner. “The AI assistant will give them something that Apple has enjoyed for many years: Lock-in to the system,” he said. * With assistance from Scott Moritz Bloomberg Like us on Facebook Connect with us on LinkedIn Follow us on TwitterSHOW ALL International Vodacom’s first half profit flat Eskom leadership: Koko tipped to succeed Molefe SA farmers pushed to the brink Capital outflows hit the rand Lonmin to buy out Amplats at Pandora Most Read 'Molefe's exit a blow to SA's nuclear plan' Eskom leadership: Koko tipped to succeed Molefe Lovers don’t buy diamonds the way they once did The secret behind Tyler Perry’s $500m Madea empire Soccer legends shoot for business glory Advertisement MORE business internationalMenu News| Personal Finance| Budget| Companies| Startups| Markets| Indicators| International| Opinion| Leadership| Financial tools| Savings| WEF| business internationalMenu News| Personal Finance| Budget| Companies| Startups| Markets| Indicators| International| Opinion| Leadership| Financial tools| Savings| WEF| INFO About IOL Front page Market indicators Movie guide Newspapers TV guide Weather SITES BabyNet.co.za Glamour.co.za GQ.co.za Ilisolezwe Isolezwe IOL Jobs IOL Property IOL Sportzone Loot.co.za Classifieds WomanOnline SECTIONS News Business Sport Motoring Tonight Lifestyle Travel Scitech About IOL Front page Market indicators Movie guide Newspapers TV guide Weather

October 6 2016 at 11:09am By Mark Bergen and Mark Gurman EPA The Google Pixel smartphone, Google Home and Google Daydream View on display at the launch event. Picture: John G. Mabanglo San Francisco - Google unveiled new hardware from smartphones and smart speakers to wireless routers on Tuesday. It was a year-long odyssey that involved design, supply chain negotiations and the search for a manufacturing partner. Now the Alphabet unit must grapple with the equally daunting challenge of getting the gadgets to consumers. It has a history of retail strategies that either struggled or never got off the ground, according to people familiar with the company’s retail efforts. What’s more, it’s inexperienced dealing with returns and recycling. And unlike rival Apple, the company lacks its own stores where it can showcase hardware as it pleases and instead relies on other companies’ in-store displays. This time, the stakes are higher because the latest gadgets are vehicles for Google’s digital assistant, a key product that is chasing Amazon.com’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri. “We view go-to-market as a clear hurdle to wide acceptance, which will require investments in brand, marketing and distribution to overcome,” UBS analyst Eric Sheridan wrote in a note to investors. Google is selling the new Pixel phones at Verizon Communications and Best Buy stores in the US, via its own online store, a temporary physical store in New York City and through its wireless service Project Fi. It’s working with a small number of other wireless carriers and retailers in countries including Germany and India. Google Home, the new speaker, is available at Best Buy, Wal-Mart Stores and Target stores, in addition to Google’s online store. Customer service Cutting distribution deals with a handful of carriers and retailers isn’t enough, according to Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson. “Google will have to up its customer-service game and do many more distribution partnerships,” he said. Many of Google’s past efforts at selling hardware have fizzled. When the company started its Nexus brand in 2010 it planned to market the phones online only, but sales never took off. About 200 000 of the first Nexus model sold, short of Google’s target of several million units, according to a person who worked on the device. Before that Nexus launch, Google planned unique software features for the device, such as voice-to-text services and maps navigation, but Verizon, the exclusive carrier partner, balked at the idea, this person said. Verizon spokeswoman Kelly Crummey declined to comment on the 2010 partnership. For the Pixel, the wireless carrier “worked with Google on what this phone would look like and the customer experience because it is available through us”, she said. Then there was Android Silver. Kicked off some time in 2014, the internal project was designed to sell high-end Android handsets with partners to compete with Apple. Google set up a retail lab for the effort, claiming an entire building near its Mountain View, California headquarters, according to former employees. But it never got off the ground. Nikesh Arora, Google’s sales chief at the time, drove the initiative. When he left in July 2014, Android Silver was shelved. One former Google executive called it a boondoggle. The former Googlers didn’t want to be identified discussing private information. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. Apple envy Such experiments are a contrast to Apple stores that are the envy of the retail industry. Apple considers the iPhone in terms of the product’s complete life cycle, from leaving the factory to when customers stop using the device. Apple offers a recycling programme through physical and online stores. Google’s new smartphone unit approached potential wireless carrier partners early this year, according to a person familiar with the situation. Some carriers peppered Google executives with questions about handling phone returns and technical support, the person said. At the time, Google did not appear ready to take on these aspects of the phone hardware business, according to this person. Google executives on the hardware team say the company is on a “journey,” gaining experience and capabilities with each smartphone generation. And Apple only began touting the iPhone’s full life cycle after a few generations. Responsible returns On Tuesday, as a Google event began in San Francisco, new hardware chief Rick Osterloh reassured the audience that the company was serious about the move. “We’re in it for the long run,” he said. About nine months after initial talks with carriers, Google rolled out its flavour of technical support: Pixels have built-in chat support where customer-service reps can take over smartphone screens to identify problems. Google will be responsible for returns and recycling and is building a supply chain that can re-absorb faulty and rejected devices, Osterloh said in a recent interview. Osterloh will be partly judged by how many devices Google sells, a contrast to the Nexus program which showcased Android features for other handset makers to adopt. But the executive was still cagey about the company’s sales aspirations. “In markets where we do business, we’re definitely going to want meaningful share,” he said. “But it’s highly unlikely that the primary driver will be to be in every market with as high as possible volume.” Google still sees software as its edge, rather than retail distribution and customer service. The company spent more time on Tuesday talking about the digital assistant baked into its new gadgets, and how they work together. If Google can get millions of people relying on its assistant, the company may be able to compete with Apple’s devices, according to Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner. “The AI assistant will give them something that Apple has enjoyed for many years: Lock-in to the system,” he said. * With assistance from Scott Moritz BLOOMBERG Like us on Facebook Connect with us on LinkedIn Hungry for more business news?

Some even claim that the A10 is so good that it is actually performing Apple’s MacBook Airs, imagine that! However how does the A10 Fusion fare against the Snapdragon 821 chipsets in the new Pixel phones? Turns out that it doesn’t even break a sweat. According to the numbers on Geekbench 4 (via AppleInsider), it seems that Apple’s A10 Fusion chipset is outperforming the Snapdragon 821 chipsets on the Pixel phones. According to the benchmark,the phones scored a 4100 for multiple core performance, and 1580 for single core. As for the iPhone 7, it scored 5600 for multiple core, and 3430 for single core, so as you can see, it is clearly head and shoulders above the competition. Now before some of you Android fans get upset, we should point out that benchmarks don’t always tell the entire story. For example it’s important how the phone feels when you use it. If you think it’s fast enough, then it probably doesn’t matter how it compares against other phones. There are also other factors and features that are taken into consideration, such as iOS vs Android, the camera, pricing, and etc., so yes, while the iPhone 7 might beat the Pixel phones in processor benchmarks, it doesn’t automatically make the Pixel handsets a “bad” device.
