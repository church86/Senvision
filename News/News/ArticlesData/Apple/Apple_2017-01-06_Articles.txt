Close share panel Image caption LeEco sounds French to some - but the firm is a home-grown Chinese venture China's disregard for intellectual property, and a turn-a-blind-eye culture when it comes to blatant counterfeiting, is notorious - the butt of many jokes. And it’s been fair. In China they don't just counterfeit devices, they counterfeit entire shops - a knock-off Apple store was closed down in 2015. Instances like this play into the West’s view of China as the world’s shameless imitator. A place where great ideas from the US and Europe go off to be assembled as cheaply as possible. It's time to update that view. At CES, the US's biggest trade show, Chinese companies could be found competing not only on price, but on fantastic ideas and design. As China's consumers have matured - and by that I mean, got a lot richer - so too has its technology industry. Like many a British popstar, China is intent on breaking America. But the question is whether Chinese firms can earn greater trust from Western consumers. 'Sounds French' Occupying a sizable booth in CES's North Hall is LeEco. It's pronounced "Luh" and "eco" as in ecosystem. On display here is a concept Tesla-like sportscar, some Smart bikes with Google's Android software built in, and a 12in (30cm) TV. The point: they do a lot. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chinese billionaire Jia Yueting, chief executive of LeEco, has been at CES this year LeEco was for a while known as the Netflix of China, a company that streamed content and eventually started making its own original material. Now it's branching out quickly into hardware - and started selling devices in the US at the tail end of last year. "People assume LeEco… they think it sounds French,” says Kenny Mathers, from LeEco's marketing team. " 'Le' in mandarin means 'joyful'," he added. "Our name means joyful ecosystem. When consumers get to pick up our products they’re delighted with build quality and design." Sounding French is a good thing for a Chinese company, Mathers acknowledged, as it removes a trust barrier for people used to words like Apple rather than, say, Xiaomi. That said, I’ve heard at least five different pronunciations of LeEco this week. Looking around the booth I spotted what looked very much like a GoPro camera, and I put it to Mathers that even here we're still seeing a disregard for Western intellectual property. "I wouldn’t say that," he said. "I would say that there’s a lot of innovation in our products. We've had a huge number of innovations in our phone line - we were the first company to remove the audio jack." Image caption LeEco showed off an Android-powered road bike He is of course referencing Apple’s controversial decision to remove the headphone socket from its latest iPhone - though I’m not sure that’s been a particularly popular move by either company. LeEco won't be drawn on reports of its money woes - back in China it’s reported that Haosheng Electronics, one of LeEco’s suppliers, is taking legal action over unpaid bills. LeEco has denied reports it has failed to meet its financial obligations. 'Poor country' According to the latest figures from research firm Gartner, sitting third in the global smartphone sales race - behind Samsung and Apple - is Huawei. Already the biggest supplier of telecoms infrastructure in Europe, Huawei was one of the early entrants into Western markets - though in the US it was coy. The company made Google's Nexus 6P, released in 2015, but until now hadn't undertaken any serious attempts at pushing its own brand. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Huawei unveiled its Mate 9 phablet at the Las Vegas tech show The new Mate 9, a so-called phablet, is the company's first high-end device to be launched in the US. One stand-out feature is a built-in voice assistant. Curiously, while the company makes its own AI assistant, it has opted to integrate Amazon’s Alexa into this device instead. I wondered if it was because US users might not trust a Chinese firm with such broad data gathering. But Richard Yu, Huawei's chief executive (for the consumer side of things), gave a simpler explanation. "Amazon Alexa is the best in this country,” he told me. "We want to bring to the consumer the best services. In the China market we have our own - we have no intention to do this [in the US] in the short term." Momentum shift Last year, Huawei had an unexpected gift: Samsung’s devices kept on catching on fire. "Their problem has given Huawei more opportunity to be in the market," Mr Yu said, though he felt the Mate 9 would have given Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 a run for its money even without the problems. He said China deserved its reputation as an imitator in years past, but was quickly shaking off that image. "Chinese vendors are getting stronger and stronger on innovation. "It's not like 10, 20 years ago where many in China would learn [from the West]. There is more original innovation from China now. Image copyright AFP Image caption One Chinese telecoms firm, ZTE, impressed CES crowds with a spot of American basketball - on stilts "Thirty years ago China was a very poor country. Like North Korea. Very poor. Nothing. "Within 30 years everywhere in China is changing, growing. In Huawei we have huge investment in innovation." This year he said he expected the company to spend $10bn (£8.1bn) on research and development - roughly in line with Apple. But spend isn't everything. No amount of money can buy a Steve Jobs or a Jony Ive. And the cultural boundaries are proving both frustrating and fascinating - what is a massive hit in China can fall desperately flat elsewhere. But while American firms have struggled to make headway in China, Chinese firms are accelerating into the West. With high specifications and low prices, you shouldn't bet against them.

That is, if you’re looking to connect via LinkedIn. On Friday, the New York Times reported that Russian demands to remove the popular professional networking app from both the Apple Store and Google Play Store had apparently been met. It is no longer possible for Russian smartphone users to download the LinkedIn app for either Android or Apple. The LinkedIn website itself was blocked in Russia a few weeks ago, as officials penalized the site for failing to store data on citizens within the nation’s borders. Once this happened, both the Android and iOS versions of the app stopped working properly, so while the official removal of the app from respective stores didn’t do much functionally, it does send a rather alarming symbolic message. Even though both tech giants have insisted they are proponents of free speech, it seems they can do little in the face of such stringent censorship. More: Is that Russian hacking? Or just a screenshot from ‘Fallout 4’? This is not the first time an app or site has been blocked in Russia and other countries. China and Turkey have also made headlines in recent months over their decisions to disallow various online service. But this case is different in its involvement of Apple and Google — previous blockages have normally been done through state-run internet service providers, not foreign companies. “Apps are the new choke point of free expression,” Rebecca MacKinnon, who leads a project on open internet tracking at New America, told the Times. Apple has admitted that it was asked to remove the LinkedIn app in Russia a month ago, and Google noted that it abides by local laws in countries of operation. As for LinkedIn, the company has expressed malcontent over the latest move in Russia. “It denies access to our members in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses,” said Nicole Leverich, a company spokeswoman. But like it or not, it doesn’t look as though anything is going to change anytime soon. Also watch: Share

Armed with an OLED screen and edgeless display, the iPhone 8 will succeed the iPhone 7.  ( Sean Gallup | Getty Images ) Advertisement Rumors about Apple's upcoming iPhone 8 - codenamed - Ferrari - are swirling online as consumers gear up for the next-gen handset to launch in September. Analysts are predicting that the arrival of the iPhone 8 could turn around Apple's fortunes drastically. Experts believe that the iPhone 8 will propel the company's revenue and help Apple smartphones notch up record sales of 86 million units in Q4 2017. iPhone 8 Forecasts In a note to investors, Jeffrey Kvaal and Gregory McNaff, analysts with Nomura Securities, shared that the next-gen iPhone from Apple i.e. the iPhone 8 would be instrumental in help Apple rake in bigger profits. The analysts are of the belief that in Q4 2017, a "supercycle" will be created which will act as a catalyst for making the iPhone 8 a bigger and more successful product than the iPhone 6. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus received incredible response from consumers as they were the first Apple smartphones to sport the bigger 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens. The analysts also forecast that the increase in the number of iOS subscriber base - the number of users deploying iDevices - will further fuel the sales of the iPhone 8. "Consensus calls for 80 million iPhones in F1Q18 (Dec '17) ... only modestly above the iPhone 6 supercycle (75 million). However, we estimate the iPhone 8 will launch into an iOS subscriber base 45-50% larger than the iPhone 6 did and model 86 million iPhones in F1Q18 (from 83 million)," noted the analysts. The increase in the iOS subscriber base since 2014 can largely be attributed to the iPhone 6 per the experts who assert that the smartphone was responsible for driving up the user base by 35 percent. The ensuing devices contributed to a 5 percent to 10 percent increase in the iOS user base. With features like an edgeless display, glass body, elegant design an no physical home button, the iPhone 8 could be a major upgrade in terms of functionality and design. Analysts at Nomura expect that an iPhone 6 buyer is a potential buyer for the iPhone 8, which will likely be released in fall 2017. iPhone 8 Rumors According to reports, the iPhone 8 will feature a new design and novel features. The handset could have a curved screen like that of rival Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge. The successor of the iPhone 7 is also expected to offer wireless battery charging support. Rumors are rife that Apple is possibly revamping its current iPhone design. Amid speculations about the device's hardware being prepared in Israel, rumors suggest that for the first time in the history of Apple, the camera and Touch ID will be incorporated in the device's display.  According to a previous Tech Times report, Apple could launch three models of the next-gen iPhone: two 4.7-inch models with TFT-LCD screens and a 5.5-inch iPhone with an OLED screen. The bigger model may also feature a dual-camera setup and Apple could release this variant of the handset with a curved OLED screen. The launch of three iPhones in 2017 will undoubtedly aid Apple in grabbing a substantial chunk of the smartphone market. While Apple is staying mum on its future plans, consumers and tech gurus alike are looking forward to the surprises the company has in store as it will celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the iPhone this year.  TAG Apple, iPhone 8, Smartphone, iPhone 7 © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) (Reuters) - The Dow came within one point of 20,000 for the first time on Friday and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 reached record highs, boosted by Apple, extending a two-month rally fueled by optimism about President-elect Donald Trump. Apple climbed 1.1 percent after Canada’s Competition Bureau did not find sufficient evidence the iPhone maker had engaged in anti-competitive conduct, closing a two-year investigation into the company. Wall Street has been on a tear since Trump won the election, with the Dow up 9 percent as investors bet he will stimulate the economy with lower taxes and infrastructure spending. While Friday’s gains suggested the rally was not yet over, some investors have grown cautious. “The market’s advance is understandable because of the economic stimulus optimism associated with a new Trump presidency,” said CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall. “But parabolic market advances traditionally experience digestion of these gains, and I don’t think this time will be any different.” The record trading session followed a Labor Department report that showed the economy added fewer than expected jobs last month but wages increased, suggesting resilience in the labor market. Stocks did not react significantly to a report that five people were dead in a shooting at Florida’s Fort Lauderdale airport. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 64.51 points, or 0.32 percent, to end at 19,963.8 points. The index rose as high as 19,999.63 but lost ground. Goldman Sachs rose 1.48 percent, helping the Dow more than any other stock. The S&P 500 gained 7.98 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,276.98, its highest close ever. The Nasdaq Composite added 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,521.06, also a record. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, led by the technology sector’s 0.96 percent gain. For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent while the S&P gained 1.7 percent and the Nasdaq jumped 2.6 percent. The strength of fourth-quarter earnings reports from U.S. companies over the next few weeks will be closely watched by investors eyeing high stock valuations. Following its recent gains, the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, pricey compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Analysts on average expect fourth-quarter earnings to rise 6.1 percent compared to a year before, when slumping oil prices crippled energy companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.11-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 24 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 76 new highs and 15 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, a bit under the 6.7 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Image credit: Hero Images | Getty Images Parth Misra Contributor Marketing Consultant, Writer at Quill Canvas ---Shares January 7, 2017 Anyone who's been writing for any length of time knows the feeling -- that goose bump-filled rush of epiphany as you realize the idea you just had is just out of this world. "No way has anyone else thought of this!" you say to yourself. You rush to the computer to find out more, only to discover the topic has already been discussed at length, in a depressingly different number of ways. Why creating original content is so elusive. Everything that could have been said has already been spoken in hundreds or even thousands of different iterations, so why should anyone listen to you? After all, chances are everyone has already heard it before, right? There's a lot of advice on writing original content, ranging from the generic "be helpful, solve a problem" to the well-known "good artists copy, great artists steal." But such instruction often inspires half-baked, repetitive content, and even worse, misses the point entirely. Related: The Tragedy of Selling Yourself Short Originality can only become a problem if we are trying to be someone we are not. Fortunately, there's a simple way around this -- tell your story instead. Think back to your company's beginnings. Most entrepreneurs have a really good reason behind why they started a company. A deep-seated sense of purpose drives them. They are either confronted with a problem that has no immediate or effective solution or are simply unable to accept the status quo and want change. The majority will also have a past checkered with years of trials, disappointments, drama and passion -- with small measures of success here and there that ultimately adds up to something substantial. Stories such as these are intensely exciting and relatable -- which is also why they make such great movies. Take for instance, the tale of how Apple got its name. Some believed the name was given in honor of Apple Records, The Beatle's music label, while others thought it represented the forbidden apple of knowledge bitten by Eve. But Steve Job's biography states he named the company Apple after coming back from an apple orchard (while on a fruitarian diet) because he thought it will be "fun, spirited and not intimidating." Quite anticlimactic, I know, but this is a perfect example of how great stories turn into folklore and legend. A company doesn't have to be an Apple, Facebook or Google to have an awesome story though. People with humble backgrounds going on to do amazing things makes for a very compelling read any day. Since every company's history is obviously unique, it makes the perfect starting point for a marketing strategy. Related: The World-Changing Power of Sharing Your Story Turning brand story into brand message. By focusing on your past experiences, you are in effect trying to circle back to the why behind your company's existence. Drawing on your professional and personal experiences is the best and shortest way of creating unique content that is relatable, memorable and relevant. Here are some questions to consider asking yourself: Why does your company exist, or what is its purpose? What prompted you to start a business? What do you think is wrong with your industry and/or the world in general? What were your challenges, and how did you overcome them? Any unique, creative takes on problems that you are proud to talk about? What were some of your major triumphs and failures? These and other similar questions can help shape your brand's marketing strategy into more well-defined subjects and themes that can be used to create content such as blog posts, website pages, articles, newsletters and videos. Of course, don't just rely on your insights. Your team members will have similar experiences, so give them a chance to contribute as well. People are tired of companies constantly trying to pitch their latest products to them. Stories on the other hand, fire up people's imaginations, and give them hope and a cause to strive towards. So, telling what you've been through can help people relate with your mission. A listener may, in fact, feel lost in the story if he/she finds it interesting. The narrative transportation theory, as it's called, states that people may feel like they have been teleported to the world of their character in a story they can identify with. They may zone out, lose track of time and experience strong emotions as a result. Research by Paul Zak found that character driven storytelling led to the production of a hormone called oxytocin in test subjects. Also known as the "cuddle hormone," oxytocin promotes empathy, motivates prosocial behavior and helps people bond together. Related: No One Cares What You Do But Your Story Could Make Them Cry Closing thoughts. Entrepreneurs and explorers have a lot in common. Both have a risk-taking attitude, like to look for new ways to do things rather than settle for what's already available, and both have an amazing story to tell. Revealing your knowledge and insights in the context of your journey and experience makes the learning process far more enjoyable and relatable. Finally, any story is also a perpetual work in progress. While what's behind you will no doubt make for a good narrative, remember a new page is being added to it daily. Everyday experiences can be turned into engaging content and shared with an audience too. You should try it out.

Delivering popular Apple-related news, advice and entertainment since 1999. Opinion What Samsung expects from iPhone 8 Samsung works pretty hard to make sure its products offer more or less the same features as Apple's iPhone, so the rumors speak volumes here.

Credit: Samsung More like this Foxconn testing wireless charging for iPhone 8 Samsung Galaxy S8 to include A.I. assistant named Bixby Samsung's bezel-free Galaxy S8: Rumor roundup and release date Video Mingis on Tech: The iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 -- and the gadget guy! The explosive Apple/Samsung relationship lacks romance but has launched over a billion smartphones all the same. One way Samsung tries to compete is to match the iPhone rumors with the features of its own flagship phones, which it rushes to market to remain competitive. In my opinion this means that when we look at what Samsung is expected to ship we are also looking at what Samsung thinks Apple may be working on. Given both firms have connections across each other’s supply chains, I think it’s a supportable theory. What are Samsung’s plans? The Samsung v. Apple struggle is good for consumers (other than when devices are rushed to market in order to explode), but it also means that when you look at the rumors you’re also getting a good insight into what Samsung thinks the next iPhone will look like. So, what are people predicting? A quick scout around the Web gave me: Ultra HD display (2K in S8 series smartphones) Faster processor VR capabilities, and a new Samsung Gear VR wearable. Note S Stylus support in Galaxy S8 Curved edge AMOLED display Dual lens camera for high end device (Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus?) IP86 certified, dust proof and water resistant No headphone jack Wireless charging Available in gold, silver, black, and blue. Samsung will also introduce its recently acquired Bixby virtual assistant in its high end Note and S8 phones. Bixby was created by Siri developers, Viv Labs, and is just part of the company’s focus on Artificial Intelligence. "Samsung is setting its sights on becoming a major player in software and services, and specifically AI, Viv Labs CEO Dag Kittlaus told the Express. "You will soon come to see the utter seriousness of Samsung’s intentions. And like us, they aim to win." What are Apple’s plans? Samsung may well be playing to “win”, but so is Apple. It is doubtful both firms share the same vision of victory. Samsung focuses on selling vast quantities of product at low profit margins, while Apple’s business plan is to sell vast quantities of product at more sustainable profit margins*. (*Apple’s plan appears to be changing – in future it hopes to build business value through attachment of services, which is something its biggest competitor cannot match). This will be the tenth anniversary iPhone, though it isn’t known if Apple will mark it. MacRumors tells us to expect: OLED display, potentially curved Faster processor (Apple’s A-series chips are the fastest in the industry) No Home button Wireless charging with partner, Energous All glass body Waterproof No headphone jack (“Courage”) Apple Pencil support in larger model More sophisticated biometric sensors, potentially including non-invasive diabetes blood tests? Also available in white. We also expect Apple to reveal some of what it has been developing for VR/AR this year, potentially including VR glasses it has been working on for years. In other words, Samsung appears to think the iPhone will match the rumors, given the similarity of the speculations being made for future devices from both firms. One more thing Apple finds it much harder to keep secrets than it once did. Its success means it endures constant scrutiny from media, government and everybody else. It may also feel that the legal system has proved itself unable to effectively protect iPhone design patents. In order to maintain a unique market position, Apple will need to rely heavily on proprietary technologies, software, processors, component, and unique material and manufacturing processes within the tenth anniversary iPhone. It needs to weave these deep inside its new product, in order to create something that isn’t only protected by patent law, but by utility patents that protect unique and proprietary manufacturing processes. You may be able to match the design, but can you imitate the components? How else will it slow its fast follower down? Google+?

That's exactly what happened here in 2016. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Jan 7, 2017 at 3:00PM Image source: Getty Images. What happened Shares of Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) doubled in 2016, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Investors in the audio-processor specialist enjoyed a 96.4% return in 52 weeks. So what You can't own Cirrus Logic without keeping a close eye on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Cirrus' largest customer accounted for 66% of the company's total sales in fiscal year 2016. That's down from 72% in 2015 and 80% in 2014, but Apple remains the core of Cirrus' business. So when Apple adds more Cirrus chips to its most popular product, the chip supplier's top and bottom lines are sure to turn upward in a hurry. That's exactly what happened in calendar year 2016, as the iPhone 7 shipped with Cirrus-powered wireless headphones instead of the traditional 3.5-millimeter headphone jack. Thanks to Apple's expanding order volume, Cirrus demolished sales and earnings targets in the back half of the year. Share prices followed suit in a hurry: CRUS data by YCharts. Now what Here we stand at the start of a new year, with fresh holiday-quarter reports from both Apple and Cirrus due in a couple of weeks. Independent reports claim that the Cupertino company recently slashed its iPhone 7 production volumes in response to soft demand for the flagship smartphone. Cirrus fell hard on that rumor, but also bounced back quickly as investors forgot about the reported production cuts. Honestly, owning Cirrus or Apple shares right now would keep me up at night. Those earnings reports will settle a lot of questions about the iPhone's trend line, and therefore about Cirrus' financial future. The company is diversifying to the best of its ability, but the Apple connection is still tight enough to add an uncomfortable amount of downside risk. When Apple stumbles, Cirrus falls -- and it's a long way down from here. Investors would be wise to hold off on buying Cirrus shares until we have the holiday numbers in hand.

Cook's annual cash bonus is tied to the tech giant meeting financial goals. Flagging sales of its signature iPhone, especially in China, were to blame for the less-than-expected sales numbers for the fiscal year, The Wall Street Journal reported. In all, the company said annual sales were $215.6 billion, 3.7 percent below its target. Its operating income was $60 billion, 0.5 percent off the company's target, Apple said in regulatory filings for the fiscal year that ended in September. It was the company's first decrease in annual revenue in 15 years. Apple overestimated global appetite for its iPhone 6S, released in early 2016. Domestic sales for iPhones dipped for the first time since Apple introduced the world's most popular smartphone. In particular, Chinese iPhone sales decreased amid increased competition from lower-cost Chinese smartphone companies that saw sales jump by 87 percent in 2016. Apple was also plagued by problems rolling out its wireless headphones, which got to market two months later than expected. Priced at $159, the headphones were crucial to the rollout of the iPhone 7, the design of which eliminated a headphone port, making Bluetooth headphones the only option for personal listening using the device. Still, demand for the iPhone 7 and the larger iPhone 7 Plus exceeded supply, delaying purchases. Some of those sales will be reflected in the company's Fiscal 2017 sales numbers. While sales of the Apple Watch were strong and revenue from its streaming services iTunes and Apple TV were not enough to offset the lagging iPhone sales, which comprised 63 percent of the company's total sales revenue. Still, Apple remains by far the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalization of $600 billion. It also benefitted from the disastrous rollout of chief competitor Samsung's signature Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, which has faced global recalls after batteries began exploding or starting on fire. Cook's salary for 2016 was $8.75 million, down from $10.3 million in 2015.

The new tablet won’t release until November, but here are some exciting new accessories that you’ll be able to buy for the iPad Pro once the tablet is officially released. Advertisement The iPad Pro is Apple’s latest addition to the iPad lineup, but it’s not just any ordinary iPad. It’s not just an update to the iPad Air or the iPad mini, but rather a full-blown all-new tablet that Apple has come up with. While the iPad Pro largely keeps the same design and shape as the iPad Air and iPad mini series, the new tablet has a larger 12.9-inch display, which is the main feature that gives the new slate its name. Read: 11 Exciting iPad Pro Features Advertisement The iPad Pro also comes with Apple’s fastest processor yet, equipped with the A9X and having 4GB of memory to tackle any job that’s thrown the tablet’s way. It’s a tablet aimed at professionals that work out in the field and need a portable machine to do their work. A laptop might do, but the iPad Pro aims to be the ultimate portable workhorse. Advertisement Other than its larger size and faster performance, the iPad Pro is actually a rather normal tablet. However, accessories are great products to turn something normal into a powerhouse of a device. Here are eight exciting iPad Pro accessories that you’ll be able to buy soon. Apple Smart Cover   1 / 8 Just like with all of the other iPads, the iPad Pro will have its own Smart Cover made by Apple. The Smart Cover is a detachable cover that you can get for the iPad Pro that attaches using magnets and covers your iPad's screen when you're not using it. When you do want to use it, simply fold back the Smart Cover and it will automatically turn the screen on. The Smart Cover can also double as an iPad stand at two different angles, although we wish there were more angles that you can adjust it to, since the two different angles aren't ideal for every situation.   1 / 8 2 Responses 09/20/2015 Cliffacampbell Reply 0=8my buddy’s aunt makes $82 /hour on the internet .

Unlike small patches, the OS X 10.11 update is a big jump that includes new features and system-wide changes. Advertisement There are many reasons to install OS X El Capitan, there are also some reasons to skip the OS X 10.11 update — and stay on OS X Yosemite. The advice rings true almost a year after the OS X El Capitan release date as Apple prepares a new macOS Sierra update. In September Apple offers up another important reason to install OS X 10.11.6 and to install a security update that just arrived. This update doesn’t change the version number, but it is an important one to install. If you are still on OS X Yosemite there is a security update for that as well. Apple fixed a MacBook Pro freezing problem with the last update, and focuses on performance and security fixes. Users who are still on OS X Yosemite may want to hold off until the macOS Sierra release date this fall if they don’t want to upgrade twice in the span of a few months. This advice works for upgrading from OS X Yosemite to OS X El Capitan as well as for installing new OS X El Capitan updates that bring fixes like OS X 10.11.6. Advertisement Reasons to install OS X El Capitan and reasons not to install. We’ve heard from users who bought new Macs in 2016 and found them running OS X Yosemite, which brought them to this decision. Apple’s OS X El Capitan release arrived in Fall 2015 with a new look thanks to a new font, increased multitasking capabilities with options to snap windows to the sides of the screen and it may solve your OS X Yosemite WiFi problems — but it could also add new WiFi problems. The OS X 10.11.2 release delivered fixes for WiFi problems, fixes for Handoff and Airdrop reliability, Bluetooth connectivity fixes and more. Apple released OS X 10.11.3 in January with enterprise fixes and fixes for users that use 4K monitors. The company just recently delivered the OS X 10.11.4 update with many changes. The OS X 10.11.3 update includes a number of fixes, but no new features. The OS X 10.11.4 update changes include; Advertisement Adds the ability to passcode-protect notes containing personal data in Notes Adds the ability to sort notes alphabetically, by date created, or date modified in Notes Adds the ability to import Evernote files into Notes Adds support for sharing Live Photos between iOS and OS X via AirDrop and Messages Addresses an issue that may cause RAW images to open slowly in Photos Adds the ability for iBooks to store PDFs in iCloud, making them available across all your devices Fixes an issue that prevented loading Twitter t.co links in Safari Prevents JavaScript dialogs from blocking access to other webpages in Safari Fixes an issue that prevented the VIPs mailbox from working with Gmail accounts Fixes an issue that caused USB audio devices to disconnect Improves the compatibility and reliability of Apple USB-C Multiport Adapters The Notes upgrade ties into the iOS 9.3 feature, which means you will want to update if you plan to lock notes on your iPhone with iOS 9.3. The OS X 10.11.5 update with security and bug fixes, including a major fix for the MacBook Pro freezing. In the latest OS X 10.11.6 update there are no new features listed, but it does include security updates and bug fixes. You can sign up to test the next OS X beta using this program if you want to try the update early. The OS X El Capitan update release arrived to a rush of users looking to upgrade, but you don’t need to install an update on day one to get the benefits. There are some great reasons to upgrade, but there are also important reasons to wait. According to GoSquared, 56% of Mac users are on OS X El Capitan at the start of June 2016. The number is down slightly in July, likely due to some users trying the macOS Sierra beta. If you haven’t made up your mind yet, here is a look at the reasons to install OS X El Capitan with the OS X 10.11.6 update and the few reasons you shouldn’t upgrade just yet. After you educate yourself about the benefits and risks you can decide for yourself when you want to update. You Have Mac WiFi Problems   1 / 12 If you have WiFi problems on your Mac with OS X Yosemite you should consider being one of the first to upgrade to OS X El Capitan.  Apple put a lot of effort into fixing these problems and continues to address Mac WiFi problems with the OS X 10.11.2 update. These appear to be stable in the OS X 10.11.4 update. Apple switches back to the old tool it used for network connectivity on your Mac. With the return of mDNSResponder, your OS X Yosemite WiFi problems should be a thing of the past.  Users who are already on OS X El Capitan should consider instaling the OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 update as it includes a previously released fix for WiFI reliability.  If you still have WiFi problems, check out our guide to fix common OS X El Capitan problems.    1 / 12 122 Responses 10/01/2015 Georgiaarapier Reply 0=102my classmate’s mother makes $78 every hour on the internet .

Macs are the slow retarded cousin to Windows computers. 12/19/2015 Gaart Skarsgard Reply You’re the retard….MS never made a Windows version 9!!!! 01/02/2016 luaemu Reply That’s because most games have a scrip which if the version name of the OS has a 9 (specifically, Windows 9) it will register as Windows 95 or 98. So, if they made Windows 9, the gamers would never switch to it, and be outraged. 01/18/2016 sean Iuaemu, you win the award for most retarded comment. 01/02/2016 Jane Reply Yes Zach, Apple has peaked and is on the slow decline. This once great company is headed by the Steve Ballmer of Microsoft….his name is Tim Cook. Microsoft stock has good activity whereas Apple stock….is stale. Windows 10 is great. Mac’s El Capitan is fraught with problems. Good for Microsoft, too bad for Apple.

I have installed in my max, and i lost a lot of valuable informationm, e mails ect…. Luckly I had backed up my information a few day before, but still I do not recommended until offers safe instalation. So I have my other 2 Macs in standby until is safe to do it… 01/02/2016 Jane Reply Jose, Apple doesn’t acknowledge any mistakes. Their updates just compound the existing problems. 11/10/2015 Joerg B. von Veltar Dr. Reply Your notes are useless, sound very like being paid by Apple and try to make the even worst issues are the users fault. I am an Apple fan and user since 1983 and have gone through 33 major OS update. Some has some light issues and they where fixed in time. This El Capitan is the worst OS update ever and shows total disrespect to Apple users. Cook and Schiller last total touch to the people who make them billionaire. Its disgracing. It seems to be the beginning of the downfall, slowly but steady. 11/19/2015 Frank Valencia Reply thanks for your advice, so in your opinion which was the best OS in Apple history ? 01/02/2016 Jane Reply Yes Joerg! I agree completely. 11/13/2015 jpl Reply OS X el captain is not usefull. It does not launch on a 2014 mac.

I’ve leave message to EPSON customer support but not reply yet. 11/19/2015 jess84 Reply I think I will wait to upgrade to El Capitan….. I have been reading the reviews on the Mac app store and alot of them are not positive reviews…. Many people have had issues with the new operating system crashing and programs not responding….. Think I will wait a couple weeks or more before I upgrade. 11/21/2015 SeanB Reply I have been primarily using Mac’s for years along with various Windows and Linux OS’s for work and home. DO NOT upgrade to El Capitan yet – too many bugs. I just spent the last couple of days recovering from the upgrade I did last week. Chrome/Word/email/firefox all froze up horribly and eventually I got to a point where we were just looking at the spinning rainbow. A restart caused crashes, and it could not even get into safe mode. I thought I had hard drive or other hardware problem until I booted into Windows 8.1 and Helix 3 and everything worked fine. I am a big fan of Mac, but it is not my religion. I am running MS Office for Mac 2011 and a few forensic programs, but not MS Office 2016 which seems to be the problem with so many others. Disk utility first aid failed also. I finally booted into Recovery mode – erased the Mac partition and used a Yosemite back up I had on my time machine. I cannot see any reason to upgrade (not the right word) – update to El Capitan and wanted to save someone a few days of aggravation or worse. I have the computer forensic equipment and tools to recover from a failure but most people do not. If the beta had bugs it would seem prudent to fix them all before releasing the update. Apple – Fail 11/21/2015 Will Saverty Reply Why the hell is this a “slideshow”? Were you determined to present the information in the least user-friendly way possible? If so, congrats. 11/30/2015 Katie Elliott Reply I DLed capitan and now it says my printer is not compatible with my computer. How is this possible when it worked just fine before the download. Anyone have any ideas on how to make it work again. My printer is a Dell. 12/01/2015 Ed Reply Sooooooo….let me see if I have this correct: Upgrade to El Capitan if you have problems with Yosemite….even though the problems may persist….or worsen….or you are just trading old problems for new ones. Don’t upgrade to El Capitan if you’re happy with Yosemite……or if you need your computer for more than just wanking around…..Got it! Actually, on second thought….I think I’ll just slap in Parallels and install Windows 10, and then buy a real PC when the time comes. Signed, A very happy new Android user 01/02/2016 Jane Reply Yes Ed, I am a new Android user too. Apple has failed me as well. 12/09/2015 axejunkie Reply Thank your for this piece of shit article. You have provided ZERO insight. 12/12/2015 Stefan Reply DO NOT INSTAL THIS CRAP!!! I am so angry that Apple put out this software and I installed it. Ever since I have installed it my computer is slower then ever. The rainbow wheel is part of my mouse now, my computer shuts down inexplicably and my computer has never been slower. I have been a loyal Apple user for 10 years and I am so mad that I am consider going back to Windows. 12/15/2015 Web Slinger Reply I just installed El Capitan and my trackpad just goes haywire and unable to click on buttons, can’t even shut down computer. Can’t click on links or anything. Man this El Capitan is an El Piece of [email protected] I have to hold down the Power button till the computer shuts down then turn it back on and then log back in. This is becoming unbearable ! 12/15/2015 A frustrated macbook air user Reply I would not install EL Capitan. My battery life was cut in half and my Microsoft products do not work. I can no longer use outlook as it continues to crash. Unfortunately, i did not use time capsule to backup my computer as all my files are backup up on dropbox. I have told everyone to not install this until these issues are resolved.

Keep it simple with less whining. 12/27/2015 jehzlau Reply Installed it successfully. No problems at all on a mid 2014 macbook pro 15″ retina. Not too old, not too new. And oh, I installed it while travelling. :D 12/27/2015 Fernando Reply I have a mid 2014 Macbook pro 15″ and i had an fresh installation. The installation was well but graphic issues are present like in OS X yosemite using safari and youtube. My computer freezes 5 times per day in safari and youtube, only mouse works but nothing happens. I take my computer to apple SAT and they told me that the hardware is OK; therefore i think is a software problem. What do you think??? 01/02/2016 Jane Reply Oh Fernando, Apple has immense software problems…..and they just ignore them. Pay them cash and they ignore their customer base. Shame on Apple. 02/18/2016 Robbie Reply I’ve seen every comment you make be against Apple…. El Capitan has served me well on my 2010 MacBook, and my Apple devices outperform AND have outlived any Android or Windows device I’ve owned. And don’t get me started on how much better the battery life of my MacBook is compared to any of my Windows laptops, and How my iPod Touch battery is compared to my droid phone… I also use Windows, but I LOVE my Mac. I have to use droid for some things, and Android 5 is an improvement, but still bloated and buggy! Also, Apple does admit to their issues, you just don’t care to read about it. It’s Microsoft that doesn’t admit to it, and Microsoft tech support is guaranteed…to piss you off! Apple tech support has been fast and friendly to me! I’ve had FAR less issues with this 5-year-old MacBook than I’ve had with ANY of my Windows or droids in less than a year….at least My iPod lasts over a year, compared to my droids…Google still has some work to do before I take Android as primary, and So does MS, until then, I’m staying loyal to Apple. At least I can get through a Mac without seeing 20 years worth of Blue Screen Of Death, or hard drive corruption, or forced updates, etc. Windows and Android have their crap as well, but I am sticking to my Unix OS known as MacOS X and iOS. Oh, and, you come off as annoying when you keep copying and pasting the same reply to several different comments… 02/18/2016 Jane Reply Robbie, thank you for your opinion. may i ask how you stand on Apple security VS terrorism? 12/27/2015 funksoul6 Reply Larrykmelo: yes, but hooker income, like what your mother earned, doesn’t really count. 12/31/2015 Frank Reply Nightmare! Apple continues to fail, fail, fail…….its just not the same company! 12/31/2015 mike Reply I thought about installing it. I guess i will stick with whats working. Sounds like crap to me. Thanks for the information. Good luck to all who tried to install it. 01/02/2016 W. Peters Reply Thanks for the warnings. I too am a long time Apple user, 25 years. I find that that lately the upgrades are downgrades and I only upgraded to Mavericks because WOW stopped working. I was thinking about upgrading to Elcapitan for airdrop between OSX and IOS but I guess that I will stick with the old FTP file transfer method instead. At least I know that it works. I agree that Apple has forgotten who made them successful and who stuck with them back when they were not doing so well. 01/05/2016 Bill Reply Nearly $1000 of my MIDI outboard gear was ruined by the forced upgrades (my tax software wouldn’t even install last year unless the OS was Yosemite! It certainly wouldn’t install under 10.6.8). Apple just doesn’t seem to care anymore. Except about phones. Money wins out everytime and these are corporations. Corporations are people, right?! Money always has won and it always will. That’s Wall Street for ya’ I’m going back to Microsoft stuff because they seem to be paying a bit more attention to things rather than just the bottom line like Apple so obviously is. And Google (android) is really getting good. Those guys and gals are getting it and growing and solidifying their OS over time. It keeps getting better. Who really cares if it was invented in a garage by two guys in San Jose? 04/09/2016 Dan Reply One point not brought up in this discussion is security and the responsibility that software manufactures have to it’s users. Every company Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc. can be liable for security vulnerabilities. They are all trying to stay one step ahead of the people that want to break into your computer and steal your financial and other info. They invest millions of dollars developing new OS to also add new features in an effort to keep you loyal to their brand. Apple and Microsoft are even giving away the latest OS in hopes that you will upgrade. Yes it is a cost cutting maneuver, good for the company, but also good for the consumer. You get new features and their goal isn’t to make things worse. Yes sometimes the new upgrade sucks. That is not the intension of these companies to put out bad software and not care. They are all publicly traded companies and stock performance suffers if people stop buying the products. More users is more profit. All of these companies make very good products and they all are tying hard for your loyalty. 01/18/2016 Saifi Reply After downloading o’s X el captain my lapi is not starting… Wot to do now?

I have never seen the spinning wheel so much in my life. After having so many problems I was ready to throw the iMac out the window, I went through the (not easy anymore) work of doing a clean install wiping my hard drive. Still runs like an old PC. Great job Apple developers, all the bells and whistles on a now unproductive computer is just GREAT. 01/22/2016 John F. Stoner Reply El Crapitan – biggest POS from Cupertino ever! Nothing works after upgrading – total bs. Avoid at all costs. 01/24/2016 Sam Smith Reply Oh my…you can’t even keep with the proper latest upgrade version number. Your comments are out of sync with 2016 somewhere in the middle. Apple does it right. Do they sometimes take a step backward; of course. This is a huge improvement over Yosemite…PERIOD. wannabes who only know how to gripe. Very sad. 02/18/2016 Robbie Reply Agreed. Apple may slip up every now and then, but Android and Microsoft do it a LOT more. (For example, Vista, 8, and Android 3 and 4…) 01/25/2016 wizbang_fl Reply Um if your booting into safe mode so you installed some software that causes your mail issues.

Nothing is perfect. Give it time to mature. 02/18/2016 Robbie Reply I’m loving El Capitan! I’m part of the public beta program….I am a true Apple fan, as my MacBook and iPod Touch has outperformed and outlived any droid or Windows PC I’ve owned. Not to mention how much longer my MacBook battery lasts compared to my Windows laptops… I use Windows, OS X, Android, and iOS, but Apple’s better tech support, reliability, etc. has made me very loyal to their products. Plus, 2 things that pushed me even further to a Mac….Windows Vista, and Windows 8/8.1…Windows 10 is along now, and although it is very much an improvement from 8, it gives WAY too much information to Microsoft, and if there’s an update that may be a bad update, or you just don’t want to apply the update in Windows 10 yet, well, TOO BAD! It installs it on the next reboot anyway! At least on my Mac, if I don’t tell it to update automatically, it won’t update unless I tell it to. Sorry, Microsoft, Sorry, Google, but it’s too late! I got a Mac! 02/29/2016 John Doe Reply Seriously, what are the reasons not to install? Are you a fanboy and can’t see the real downsides of the thing?

I also did not like some of the announced changes to the OS. This March, so many things and apps stopped working properly, so I moved from Snow Leopard to El Capitan on my old Macbook Pro (with 1 1GB drive and 8 GB memory). Also bought a new Mac Mini with El Capitan. Apple got me my Apps package back (the App store forgot me). Some of my old apps I still have to upgrade to use. Otherwise, it was about as painless as possible, and I now like the new system. My Macbook runs like new, and for some reason, even runs cooler. So it wasn’t much worse to upgrade than to start anew on the new Mac Mini. Plan on taking a few days for this. 03/30/2016 Belal Chowdhury Reply SOLVED!!!

Maybe it’s just more the OS has become far more complex and trying to mate many devices together that creates issues. No doubt IOS has had it’s share of problems too. I personally don’t find El Capitan really bad, but it’s certainly has not improved much on my Macbook Air from Mavericks or Yosemite. Snow Leopard was probably the most efficient OS X version. From then on, Apple began a more robust development adding Mobile Me then iCloud to better sync IOS devices and OS X devices. This is when things became more problematic. I do agree that Tim Cook is not the obsessive perfectionist that Steve Jobs was, and has certainly delegated too much oversight of Apple product development to lower management without much oversight or final approval. Steve Jobs I think was much more willing to tell his people to get it right or it won’t go out. I could be wrong, but it appears Cook is more about managing Apple in general than obsessing about new product release quality. Today, it’s about getting it out the door and fixing the bugs on the fly. 04/11/2016 Jeff Calhoun Reply Safari still broken, but better.

Get a good screwdriver set and get that 5400rpm hd out and upgrade memory to 6 or 8 ram. Don’t buy apple specific expensive ram, as long you respect DDR2 or 3 it’s ok. Frequency doesn’t matter so much, most SODIMM are adaptive (got 1600mhz in both devices) just put the new ram in the above slot and the existing beneath, it works ;) Btw, ram limitations posted by apple are incorrect. Get rid of that horrible 5400rpm drive and change it with an ssd, it will speed up everything. So both of my old Macbook and mini are running smoothly like any other pc/os. (except games) Anyway if you wan’t to upgrade your Mac there is plenty documentation on youtube, but please don’t buy a new Mac because it’s Apple marketing strategy. Hope this post is useful and hopefully happy upgrading ;) 05/28/2016 electricnerve Reply Is “Fall 2015” meant to represent an actual date, or is it merely a reference to American cultural isolationism? 06/12/2016 Stevo Reply All I know is that I spent many hours trying to work out a way to get an iphone 6s to work with snow leoplard, when in 5 minutes I downloaded the latest itunes for my vista machine and it worked immediately, I was able to use my ip6s with Vista no problems. I did not want to upgrade to the newest mac osx because when I began the install process I was warned that most of my software ( Photoshop etc ) would not run with the new OSX….. I hesitated for a few minutes and thought about how nice it is to have software which actually runs on my machine, then cancelled the install….. why can Microsoft manage to make Vista compatible with the new iphone but Apple can not? why can’t Apple just release a new OSX without making people pull their hair out trying to get everything they used to have work again? 07/09/2016 Mark Reply Since I have installed El Capitan on my iMac 27″ from 2012, coming from Yosemite, it is significantly slower. Much more often the ‘circle of death’, even when simply opening WORD or EXCEL documents. Spotlight appears to have more difficulty finding docs that it would previously indicate in no time. Annoying also is the longer waiting time at logon: the entry field is there, but there is no immediate response to keyboard entries, which used to be the case. Also I’ve had more reboot-required crashes. One or two in a few weeks while this was very rare previously. No other major difficulties, but all in all definitely slower, which is opposite effect from the advertisements that accompanied the release. 07/09/2016 Jane Reply I’m switching to Android everything because Apple is so corrupt. Tim Cook is slowly destroying the greatest and genius of Apple Corporation 07/09/2016 Bryan McKenzie Reply Install El Capitan and you will loose functions with many of your favorite programs. This so-called “update” is nothing more than fairly worthless cosmetic changes and little more than justifying the jobs of Apple’s army of coders. There is no benefit to El Capitan while delivering a huge loss of your happy Mac functions. Avoid this “upgrade” unless you wish to spend months trying to recover from the fairly pointless pretty changes. 07/22/2016 Neil Reply Apple should reissue OS 8. I could run Photoshop, Illustrator and Pagemaker and other cool software on a system total of 2 Gig with plenty of room left for all the graphics, docs files etc. The system allowed for viewing and hot-rodding all the extensions. What the hell went wrong between then and now? 07/23/2016 Jane Reply CNET acknowledged Apple’s poor software and saturation of the iPhone 08/02/2016 jade Reply The El Capitan 10.11.6 update totally put my internet connectivity out of use… both wifi and via Ethernet cable. I went back to Mountain Lion and am extremely happy because I can use my computer again. And my computer has 24gigs of ram and a lot of extra hard drive space so it wasn’t an issue with my computer. 08/06/2016 Jane Reply Apple is on a slow decline. CNET acknowledged Apple is weak in the software aspect. The whole thing makes me sad. Why is the current CEO still in place? 08/12/2016 Ann Reply Has anyone else been having a LOT of problems on the Adobe Creative Suite since the El Capitan upgrade? I’ve talked to more than 5 other designers and they are all having a lot of issues (particularly InDesign, smart objects in PhotoShop, disappearing menus in Illustrator to name a few.) Then there’s Microsoft Office Suite, which has it’s own special problems (mainly emails won’t send and need the software closed out and re-opened, opening Excel makes smart objects not work again in PhotoShop once you finally have it working…) Then there’s Safari. Many times it freezes or doesn’t load, or partially loads. Open up FireFox… works. Though sometimes FireFox now crashes or freezes as well. We’re talking Mac Pro’s (the tower kind) with fully upgraded RAM and hard drives. Had ZERO issues and ran very speedy right up until the second we upgraded to El Capitan. 08/12/2016 Jeffry Calhoun Reply I feel your pain. Adobe and Apple seem sworn enemies. Come on, people. Adobe useless since el Capitan. Epson and Apple not cooperating either. I’m having zero machine issues, but 7 months later still working thru EVERY software I had since before the upgrade. Most of the time I’ve had to open a ticket with Apple to make any progress, and the answer is NOT published anywhere. Seems like this was a huge os departure. MS office and Safari ok now. Mostly. 08/12/2016 Jeffry Calhoun Reply I saw no difference between 5 yr. MacBook Pro and new MacIntosh updates to el Capitan. Had to drag both to genius counter to get some issues resolved. 08/12/2016 Ann Reply *Adding that I still prefer Apple, just not upgrading my laptop until I hear these issues are fixed because this is the industry standard for my career and I need this stuff to function. Work computer already buggy and losing valuable productivity time, afraid to do the same to my Macbook Pro because those things are already notoriously hot and it’s 5 years old now. Came here Googling hoping to hear that there was some fixes :( but glad to see a new OS is coming…. For anyone still reading, I did see that for some reason the beta testing period was a lot shorter on El Capitan than any previous OS so who knows why that happened, but hopefully this new one will have been tested longer. 09/30/2016 chhavi Reply Hello sir….. i was using os x 7(mountain lion) version and downloaded the os x 11(El Capitan) its wants my system to restart for updating the version. but now its not updating… its updated only 10 % approx … and from the last 3 days its stucked there… 10/17/2016 Ronald Richison Reply Mac OS X El Captain uses a default IP address that can be easily guessed. After your computer is attacked by malware over wifi your machine is irreparable. The classic 🍏v.s.🍎V.s.YOU; Because both apples hate you. 01/07/2017 Bru-Hed Reply Great article title, but where are the reasons? A numbered list would really help.

Happy new year! We hit the ground running this week at the CES tech industry expo, where there were some truly exciting announcements… and one or two unexpected curiosities. If you’ve struggled to keep up with it all, fear not, for 7 Days is back after a short festive break, and here to guide you through the top stories from CES, and across the wider tech world. Let’s waste no more time – there’s a lot to get through! Our journey begins this week in the world of healthcare, as researchers have developed a new computer algorithm that can help to diagnose conditions such as ADHD and autism. Meanwhile, over in the UK, the National Health Service is testing an app powered by artificial intelligence that can offer medical advice to patients based on the symptoms they describe. Almost four months after its release, Apple revealed that iOS 10 is now installed on 76% of active iOS devices. The first iOS 10.3 beta is expected to arrive next week, with a mysterious new ‘Theatre Mode’. A video published on Friday gave us our first look at an early prototype of an iPod-based operating system developed by Apple for its original iPhone, including a virtual touchscreen scroll wheel. Frankly, it looks pretty awful, so it’s a huge relief that they ended up chucking it in the bin. Intel formally launched its new 7th-generation Core vPro processors, which it says will offer greatly improved security features and… “50% increased productivity over a 5-year-old PC”. Wow? The company also touted the prowess of its consumer-class 7th-gen (Kaby Lake) Core processors, and outlined its hopes for the virtual reality market, saying that it expects 2017 to be a big year for VR. Qualcomm announced its Snapdragon 835 chipset, which features new optimizations for virtual and augmented reality scenarios. The powerful new SoC will launch on flagship-class devices in the next few months, promising 25% less power consumption, Quick Charge 4 support, and more. Nvidia officially announced its anticipated GTX 1050 and 1050Ti graphics cards for laptops, promising powerful performance for budget-conscious buyers. Nvidia also revealed a new Shield TV streaming device with 4K and HDR support. The device includes voice control features and support for Google Assistant. Google revealed that it’s bringing its digital Assistant to Android TV devices running both 6.0 Marshmallow and 7.0 Nougat. Google said it received a massive one billion takedown requests for its search engine in 2016 – twice the amount it got the year before. It looks like Google may finally be preparing to bring its YouTube Red subscription service to European markets this year. And at long last, it seems Google is getting ready to roll out Android 7.1.1 Nougat to the Nexus 6, over a month after its release for other devices. The company also released its January security updates for Android this week. Samsung began rolling out Android 7.0 to a very limited number of its Galaxy S7 handsets on Wednesday. And with just a few hours of 2016 remaining, OnePlus made good on its promise to release its Android 7.0 upgrade to its 3 and 3T flagships before the end of the year. OnePlus delivering an update on time… is that a first? Following the recent collapse of Cyanogen, British device manufacturer Wileyfox said that it will replace Cyanogen OS on its handsets with a ‘pure’ Android experience. A photo showing a slide presented at a Nokia event revealed the company’s plans to launch as many as seven Android smartphones by the end of 2017. The slide proudly declared “The Empire Strikes Back”... consequently reminding everyone that Nokia’s empire, and its share price, have crumbled over the last decade. On Saturday, a leaked image purportedly revealed key specs of the 'Nokia 6', one of the first Android smartphones on the way. BlackBerry is another fallen mobile empire that’s trying to rise again by licensing its brand to another company to build Android devices. This week, TCL showed off its new BlackBerry phone with a QWERTY keyboard – and then said it wouldn’t talk about it until February, by which time everyone will have completely lost interest. Great strategy. LG revealed a change of strategy for its new G6 flagship phone, confirming that it’s ditching the modular design of its current G5, which has been a sales flop. Xiaomi unveiled a white version of its Mi MIX ‘concept’ device… …while Huawei’s Honor brand showed off its new Magic concept device in the flesh – and we managed to get our hands on it. Honor also announced the launch of its ‘mid-range flagship’, the 6X, in the US and Europe. Huawei brought its Mate 9 flagship to the US too, priced at $599, and revealed that it will add support for Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant later this year. ZTE revealed its new upper-mid-range handset, the Blade V8 Pro, with a Snapdragon 625 processor, 3GB RAM, 32GB storage, 13MP camera, USB Type-C port, and more. Check out our hands-on first impressions of the device here. Samsung unveiled its new Galaxy A series handsets – and as rumored, they all include IP68 dust- and water-resistance. That’s a very nice addition to the mid-range devices. After the disastrous launch, and subsequent global recall, of its Galaxy Note7 flagship, Samsung said that it will reveal the findings of its investigation into the battery fires that plagued the device “later this month”. Image: All About Windows Phone But it looks like Samsung’s next flagship, the Galaxy S8, will include a rather intriguing feature. An image revealed the company’s plans to introduce a “desktop experience” to the new Android device with support for an external monitor, mouse and keyboard – which sounds rather a lot like the Continuum mode in Microsoft’s Windows 10 Mobile. Microsoft was planning to release a new Fast ring preview of its Windows 10 Creators Update this week, but those plans were postponed while the company addresses some issues with the update process. However, Windows 10 Enterprise build 15002 – believed to be the same build that was due for release – leaked onto the web late on Friday night. However, Microsoft did officially roll out Windows 10 build 14393.594 (Anniversary Update) to PCs and phones in the Release Preview ring. Microsoft hasn’t officially provided a firm launch date for the Creators Update, saying only that it will be released in “early 2017”. But Dell let the cat out of the bag this week, confirming that the Creators Update is due to roll out in April. The Creators Update will include support for 802.11ad Wi-Fi, and wireless docking support for that protocol will be added in a future update. Image: MSPoweruser After the Creators Update, the Redstone 3 update is expected to arrive towards the end of the year. That update will include changes to the user interface, developed under the codename ‘Project Neon’ – and the first screenshots previewing Windows 10’s design refresh leaked on Thursday, showing a cleaner, less cluttered look with new blurring and transparency effects. Microsoft promised more transparency and new insights into its Windows 10 development process this year, as it launched a new blog focused on the Windows Insider community. Elsewhere, Microsoft hit back at inaccurate media reports (not from Neowin!), which claimed that it’s killing off its Command Prompt in the Windows 10 Creators Update. In fact, it’s prioritizing its more versatile PowerShell command line experience over the antiquated Command Prompt, but the latter will still remain in the OS. Data from NetMarketShare revealed that Windows 10 is now installed on almost a quarter of PCs, with Windows 7 approaching 50%, and macOS X 10.11 on 4.38%. On the Steam gaming platform, Windows 10 is now in use by more than half of all gamers, 17 months after its launch. Meanwhile, Microsoft appears to be working on a new cross-platform media-sharing service, currently known as ‘Belize’. Microsoft has been working with numerous automotive giants in recent months to establish its products at the heart of their connected car strategies. BMW, for example, unveiled its vision for self-driving cars with Cortana support, while Nissan is also among other major manufacturers to be working with Microsoft and its Connected Vehicle Platform. Audi has teamed up with Nvidia on its self-driving car program, in an effort to infuse more of its vehicles with autonomous control technologies powered by artificial intelligence. Mmm buzzwords. Casio was among the many companies attending CES this week, revealing a new $500 Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch. Take a look at our hands-on impressions of the rugged wearable device. But it was the giants of the tech industry that made some of the biggest announcements in the greatest numbers. Dell was among them, unveiling a series of new devices, including the Inspiron 7000 gaming laptops with Nvidia's latest GTX 1050 GPUs… …and the Latitude 5285 and Latitude 7285 – two new business-class Windows 10 2-in-1s, promising exceptional security and versatility. The latter device also offers wireless charging support. Dell also unveiled a new XPS 13 2-in-1, and the 27 Ultrathin Monitor… …as well as the stunning UltraSharp 8K Monitor – the first commercially available monitor with 8K resolution, and an unsurprisingly high price tag. But most excitingly, Dell also revealed the XPS 27 all-in-one PC, and the Canvas – an intriguing new competitor to Microsoft’s new Surface Studio. Stardock announced that it has been working with Dell on an exclusive version of its desktop organization suite, Fences, for the new Canvas PC. Don’t miss our hands-on first impressions of Dell’s new devices here! HP unveiled the second generation of its unusual Sprout Pro Windows 10 PC, which has an integrated projector and touch-mat, along with 2D and 3D scanning capabilities. Of course, we went hands-on to see what all the fuss was about – you can see it in action in our videos here. HP’s new ENVY Curve AIO 34 all-in-one PC also made its debut at CES, along with the OMEN X 35 curved monitor. And the 15.6-inch HP Spectre x360 and EliteBook x360 also made their first appearance at the show, both with 4K displays. We went hands-on with both devices here, so make sure you check that out! Lenovo also had plenty of announcements at CES, including that of its new Smart Assistant, an Amazon Echo-style speaker... powered by Amazon’s Alexa assistant. Lenovo unveiled three new ThinkPad X1 devices, and the Miix 720 – a high-end Surface Pro-style tablet, including an integrated rear kickstand. Check out our hands-on videos and photos of those new devices here, along with our impressions of the Smart Assistant. Two Lenovo gaming laptops were announced too, kicking off the company’s new line of Legion gaming PCs. Lenovo launched its new 500 Multimedia Controller, a $55 wireless keyboard for media PCs, on which the keys also double up as a capacitive touchpad with support for Windows 10 gestures. Last month, Microsoft revealed new information on its plans with hardware partners to launch more affordable virtual reality headsets powered by its Windows Holographic shell on Windows 10. Lenovo showed off its VR headset at CES, and said it will launch later this year for under $400. We also got a look at new Windows Holographic VR headsets from HP, Dell and others. CES played host to the rise of the machines, as many companies showed off home robots at the event. The cute new Kuri robotic companion is now available to pre-order for $699. LG also displayed a range of new robots, destined for both home and commercial use. LG announced its new family of thin and light Windows 10 notebooks, claiming that they offer up to 24 hours of battery life… but we’ll have to put that claim to the test in the real world before we can believe it. The LG Stylo 3 and 3 Plus made an appearance too. The two lower-mid-range handsets each have an integrated stylus and come with Android 7.0. Lots of manufacturers revealed new TVs at CES, and LG was no exception. Its range of 4K TVs come with ‘Nano Cell’ technology, said to offer superior color and clarity from any viewing angle. And like so many other devices at CES, LG’s new smart refrigerator includes Amazon Alexa voice support, along with a 29-inch touchscreen and internal camera. Samsung also introduced a new range of smart fridges, including models with a 21.5-inch touchscreen, and its new Family Hub 2.0 software. The Samsung Notebook Odyssey was revealed as the company’s first gaming laptop, featuring some rather meaty specs… and a rather ugly trackpad design. Bleugh. Pre-orders also opened for Samsung’s new Notebook 9, which it calls “the lightest notebook on the market”. Samsung believes its new ‘QLED TVs’ have what it takes to crush all of their rivals, thanks to their use of Quantum Dot technology. Image: Bloomberg Sony made quite an impression with its new ultra-thin BRAVIA OLED TV range, available in three sizes up to 77 inches. They won’t come cheap, so you’d better start saving and/or selling some body organs if you’re thinking of buying one. Xiaomi’s new TVs are also incredibly thin – but they’re rather interesting for another reason too. They have a modular design, which will allow owners to upgrade them in the future by adding new components. Asus revealed new displays designed for computing. It introduced a pro-grade 32-inch 4K monitor with HDR support, along with an enormous 37.5-inch curved ultra-wide monitor, featuring ‘frameless bezels’, and integrated Qi wireless charging plate. Asus also unveiled the ZenFone AR, the first phone in the world to support both Google’s Tango augmented reality suite, and the Daydream virtual reality platform. There’s no doubting the fact that it’s got some pretty decent specs – but it’s not exactly attractive. Miraxess is preparing to launch a new laptop-style phone dock for Android and Windows 10 Mobile devices, similar to the $599 HP Lap Dock for its flagship-class Elite x3 handset. However, the Mirabook will cost half that amount. Meanwhile, Brydge revealed its new laptop-style aluminum keyboard for Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 tablet. There seemed to be no end of PCs on display at CES this year, so it was certainly appropriate that Endless attended the event to unveil its simple, affordable mini-PCs, priced from $129. And after announcing the Sirius A in October, Ockel showed up at CES ready to show off the curious mini-PC in the flesh. The device has a 6-inch touchscreen, but runs the full version of Windows 10 Home, and has an integrated DisplayPort, full-size HDMI, two USB 3.0 Type-A ports, one USB 3.0 Type C port and a full-size Ethernet port too. More photos and details of the Sirius A and Ockel’s other mini-PCs can be found here. Toshiba turned up with a far more conventional Windows 10 device. Its new Portégé X20W notebook is a 2-in-1 that promises up to 16 hours of battery life. Acer showed off a range of new notebooks and desktops too – but the star of its show stand was the mighty Predator 21 X gaming notebook that it announced in August. The monstrous machine – which has a curved 21-inch display – finally got a price tag… and it’s enormous. Not to be outdone, Razer turned up to CES with an even crazier device. Project Valerie is a gloriously insane notebook with three (!!!) built-in displays, each with 4K resolution, powered by a desktop-class Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card. Mad. Quite mad. Razer also took things to a whole new level with the unveiling of its Project Ariana concept, a room-scale projector that aims to turn gaming into a truly immersive experience. Back on Planet Earth, Sony revealed that it has now sold an impressive 53.4 million PlayStation 4 consoles since its launch in 2013, including 6.2 million in just six weeks over the holiday season. Despite being outsold by the PS4, Microsoft nonetheless celebrated its Xbox achievements in 2016, and promised an even more exciting year ahead for its gaming platform. But this week’s odyssey around the tech world ends, appropriately, at CES, where the L’Oreal/Withings smart hairbrush won an innovation award. All hope is lost. Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a few extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. I looked back on a remarkable year for Microsoft, in which it became one of the world's most exciting tech companies. I also took a look ahead to what's in store for Microsoft in 2017 - from gaming and new devices, to productivity and mixed reality, it's set to be a year of work, play, and creativity unleashed for the company. Vlad Dudau shared a mini-review of the MGCool Band 2, an ultra-affordable fitness tracker with some very nice features... but there's certainly room for improvement. And Christopher White published his detailed review of the Thecus W2810PRO, a NAS (network attached storage) device running Windows Storage Server 2012 R2 Essentials. Who comes up with these names? Anyway, the W2810PRO earned itself a very good score in the review, but there are still a few downsides to be aware of. Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology. For now, though, there’s lots more to read across the site – including all sorts of interesting discussions over on our forums. From all of us on the Neowin team, have a great weekend and a very happy new year!

In the ad, entitled "Take Mine", a young lady arrives at a Greek village to visit her grandmother. After greeting each other with open arms, the two women are seen sitting in a café, where the granddaughter uses a Rose Gold iPhone 7 Plus to take a picture of the elderly woman using the Depth Effect. After previewing the shot, her grandma stands up in awe, taken aback by its quality. This catches the attention of others in the café, and a woman asks if she can get a picture, too. The young lady happily obliges. Thus begins a spree of depth-of-field photography as locals in the village queue up to have their pictures taken, including fishermen, a musician, children, a barber, and even a local shepherd, all framed in sharp focus with the familiar blurred background effect. The ad ends with the tagline, "Portrait mode on iPhone 7 Plus – practically magic". Today's iPhone 7 Plus ad is the latest in a series that have showcased the features of Apple's latest handsets, like waterproofing, improved battery life, the camera, and the iOS 10 operating system. Apple has also previously shared tips to "Shoot like a Pro" with the depth-of-field effect in the iPhone 7 Plus, highlighting a range of suggestions collected from professional photographers on its news site.

It's always about us being lazy scums, not paying our debts and trying to get away with everything... Thank you Apple for showing the world that our country is of exceptional beauty, our people are compassionate and loving and that it's not always about money, it's also about the little things in life! You are the best!!! Rating: 68 Votes aroom 1 week ago if only Apple could stop fragmenting the iPhone and give to both models the same camera options. I don't want to have a bigger phone and yes I do want to have this feature. awesome feature. so lame IMO Rating: 29 Votes Jim Lahey 1 week ago Great camera, cool commercial. Shame the phone is the size of a chopping board. I'm looking forward to this feature being added to the real iPhone. I still think 'portrait mode' is a poorly chosen name though. Rating: 20 Votes JoEw 1 week ago Actually a great ad. Rating: 19 Votes Yellowbean12 1 week ago As a photographer, I really appreciate this advert. Background defocus and bokeh are often really important aspects of all photography, especially portraits. I just wonder if the average viewer of this advert will even understand what's going on. Maybe I worry too much. Maybe this is a good example of Apple not treating its customers as idiots, and treating them instead as people who love photography and understand many aspects of it. Rating: 19 Votes CrashX 1 week ago I'm gonna miss the old man diving off the platform. It showcased everything about the phone - the incredible stereo speakers, the splash-proof design, and how you can use your iPhone to pick up young hotties laying out by the pool. This one just showcases some defective second camera thing that makes everything blurry :( I was hoping for a follow-up ad with the old man and his new girl, showcasing the Hermes watchband or something that he bought her after catching her attention with his beautiful splash-proof phone with the awesome speakers. We know she was totally into him after that sweet dive, but then what? She looked like she'd probably go out for drinks with him if he bought her a Hermes band with the square digital watch thing. Just the two of them staring at each other across the table, tapping their watches to exchange their heartbeats.

Rating: 7 Votes MH01 1 week ago It's a nice feature. Rating: 6 Votes Abazigal 1 week ago In 2017, the goal is for Apple to show us some of that roadmap so that the amount of trolling reduces. There are many ways to skin a cat... There will always be trolls regardless of what Apple does. Apple had its share of critics when they announced the iPhone, the iPod, the iPad, the MacBook Air; pretty much everything Apple did was mired in controversy. What we need is more informed, in-depth and well-reasoned arguments. No more of this knee-jerk "Fire Tim Cook" or smart-ass quips which contribute absolutely nothing to the main discussion at hand. People need to stop and think through what they want to say first before saying it. There is no prize for being first where this sort of thing is concerned. That will instantly shave off the majority of the useless posts in these threads, make them more readable and help promote more meaningful discussion. I'd have to disagree that they are people striving for attention, trollers yes, but there seems to be a new type of commentor, that used to love Apple but does not like the direction they are taking. They may appear to be a little trollish but are really just mighty pissed at Apple. You can be unhappy with the direction Apple has take and still be respectful and civil about it. Simply put - I don't really care what these people feel about Apple. They are free to hold their own opinions and think whatever they want about Apple. But when they start crapping all over this forum and start making the atmosphere of this place so much more hostile and toxic, that's when I feel compelled to step in. I like this place. It has been a steady source of information and productive discussion ever since I fled Cnet and Engadget and the last thing I want to see happen is for Macrumours to devolve into another seething morass of toxicity and hostility. And so I do the only thing I know - I push back against the hatred. Maybe I am making the problem worse, but I know I can't just sit back and do nothing while I watch this whole place go to crap. I won't. Perhaps 2017 can be the year that anyone who is drinking the koolaid can see things from other peoples point of view too. These people are just as bad and write 'trolling' like defence of Apple. I'll put bets on whether this post or yours gets more likes... Cause and effect. We need doctors because people get ill. We need police because there is crime. I go where I am needed, and post when I am needed. One cannot exist without the other. When the acerbic trolling stops, I too will stop. That is my promise to you and this forum. Rating: 6 Votes [ Read All Comments ] Upcoming iMac Early 2017 Updated models with AMD graphics options expected in early 2017. iPad Pro Early 2017?

The ad focuses on the device’s dual-camera design and the Portrait Mode feature that comes along with it.. The ad starts with one person having their photo taken with Portrait Mode, causing a domino effect of everyone realizing how professional the image looks and asking for their own picture to be taken. The portraits are shown full-screen in the ad once they are taken, though it’s unclear if there was any post-processing done to the images on Apple’s part. Apple describes Portrait Mode in the video’s description: Portrait mode on the iPhone 7 Plus helps you take great portraits by creating a depth-of-field effect that blurs backgrounds and brings faces into beautifully sharp focus. So now, taking a professional-looking portrait is as easy as snapping a photo. Today’s new ad is called “iPhone 7 Plus – Take Mine” and comes in at 1 minute long. It ends with the tagline “practically magic,” which Apple has used in the past for iPhone 7 ads. Last month, Apple shared an ad for the iPhone 7 Plus that focused on the device’s optical zoom support, so today’s video is a continuation of Apple’s focus on the iPhone 7 Plus camera.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple Apple’s pre-iOS click wheel iPhone surfaces in video Apple Apple’s pre-iOS click wheel iPhone surfaces in video By Bindu Nair - Jan 7, 2017 Apple’s iOS software has come a long way since the original iPhone was unveiled in 2007 revolutionizing smartphones forever. A new report now sheds some light on how vastly different the handset could have been if the company had decided to go down a more iPod-esque route. Apple’s hyper-secretive nature has meant that very little was known about the brand’s pre-iOS efforts. This isn’t the case anymore since serial leakster Sonny Dickson has gotten his hands on videos and images of prototype software internally called Acorn OS, so named because of the acorn that showed up when booting the handset. Acorn OS is basically a virtual version of Apple’s iPods, complete with a digital click wheel occupying the bottom half of the screen. The top portion was solely occupied by an interface that strongly resembled the device’s UI. As can be seen in the video below, users would have had to scroll through options such as SMS, Music, Contacts, and Dial via the circle. Also Read: iOS 10.3 to introduce popcorn-themed Theatre Mode Entering numbers via a wheel would have been a nightmare if implemented in modern-day iOS. Moreover, the bare-bones Acorn OS doesn’t feature a browser at all, stripping down the iPhone to act as just an upgraded iPod which can make calls. Dickson believes very few of these Acorn OS devices are around nowadays since Apple has a tendency to destroy prototypes. He also points towards an old 2006 patent which describes such an iPod-like click wheel-carrying gadget as proof that the OS really did exist.

Unlike small patches, the OS X 10.11 update is a big jump that includes new features and system-wide changes. Advertisement There are many reasons to install OS X El Capitan, there are also some reasons to skip the OS X 10.11 update — and stay on OS X Yosemite. The advice rings true almost a year after the OS X El Capitan release date as Apple prepares a new macOS Sierra update. In September Apple offers up another important reason to install OS X 10.11.6 and to install a security update that just arrived. This update doesn’t change the version number, but it is an important one to install. If you are still on OS X Yosemite there is a security update for that as well. Apple fixed a MacBook Pro freezing problem with the last update, and focuses on performance and security fixes. Users who are still on OS X Yosemite may want to hold off until the macOS Sierra release date this fall if they don’t want to upgrade twice in the span of a few months. This advice works for upgrading from OS X Yosemite to OS X El Capitan as well as for installing new OS X El Capitan updates that bring fixes like OS X 10.11.6. Advertisement Reasons to install OS X El Capitan and reasons not to install. We’ve heard from users who bought new Macs in 2016 and found them running OS X Yosemite, which brought them to this decision. Apple’s OS X El Capitan release arrived in Fall 2015 with a new look thanks to a new font, increased multitasking capabilities with options to snap windows to the sides of the screen and it may solve your OS X Yosemite WiFi problems — but it could also add new WiFi problems. The OS X 10.11.2 release delivered fixes for WiFi problems, fixes for Handoff and Airdrop reliability, Bluetooth connectivity fixes and more. Apple released OS X 10.11.3 in January with enterprise fixes and fixes for users that use 4K monitors. The company just recently delivered the OS X 10.11.4 update with many changes. The OS X 10.11.3 update includes a number of fixes, but no new features. The OS X 10.11.4 update changes include; Advertisement Adds the ability to passcode-protect notes containing personal data in Notes Adds the ability to sort notes alphabetically, by date created, or date modified in Notes Adds the ability to import Evernote files into Notes Adds support for sharing Live Photos between iOS and OS X via AirDrop and Messages Addresses an issue that may cause RAW images to open slowly in Photos Adds the ability for iBooks to store PDFs in iCloud, making them available across all your devices Fixes an issue that prevented loading Twitter t.co links in Safari Prevents JavaScript dialogs from blocking access to other webpages in Safari Fixes an issue that prevented the VIPs mailbox from working with Gmail accounts Fixes an issue that caused USB audio devices to disconnect Improves the compatibility and reliability of Apple USB-C Multiport Adapters The Notes upgrade ties into the iOS 9.3 feature, which means you will want to update if you plan to lock notes on your iPhone with iOS 9.3. The OS X 10.11.5 update with security and bug fixes, including a major fix for the MacBook Pro freezing. In the latest OS X 10.11.6 update there are no new features listed, but it does include security updates and bug fixes. You can sign up to test the next OS X beta using this program if you want to try the update early. The OS X El Capitan update release arrived to a rush of users looking to upgrade, but you don’t need to install an update on day one to get the benefits. There are some great reasons to upgrade, but there are also important reasons to wait. According to GoSquared, 56% of Mac users are on OS X El Capitan at the start of June 2016. The number is down slightly in July, likely due to some users trying the macOS Sierra beta. If you haven’t made up your mind yet, here is a look at the reasons to install OS X El Capitan with the OS X 10.11.6 update and the few reasons you shouldn’t upgrade just yet. After you educate yourself about the benefits and risks you can decide for yourself when you want to update. You Have Mac WiFi Problems   1 / 12 If you have WiFi problems on your Mac with OS X Yosemite you should consider being one of the first to upgrade to OS X El Capitan.  Apple put a lot of effort into fixing these problems and continues to address Mac WiFi problems with the OS X 10.11.2 update. These appear to be stable in the OS X 10.11.4 update. Apple switches back to the old tool it used for network connectivity on your Mac. With the return of mDNSResponder, your OS X Yosemite WiFi problems should be a thing of the past.  Users who are already on OS X El Capitan should consider instaling the OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 update as it includes a previously released fix for WiFI reliability.  If you still have WiFi problems, check out our guide to fix common OS X El Capitan problems.    1 / 12 122 Responses 10/01/2015 Georgiaarapier Reply 0=102my classmate’s mother makes $78 every hour on the internet .

I am an Apple fan and user since 1983 and have gone through 33 major OS update. Some has some light issues and they where fixed in time. This El Capitan is the worst OS update ever and shows total disrespect to Apple users. Cook and Schiller last total touch to the people who make them billionaire. Its disgracing. It seems to be the beginning of the downfall, slowly but steady. 11/19/2015 Frank Valencia Reply thanks for your advice, so in your opinion which was the best OS in Apple history ? 01/02/2016 Jane Reply Yes Joerg! I agree completely. 11/13/2015 jpl Reply OS X el captain is not usefull. It does not launch on a 2014 mac.

I’ve leave message to EPSON customer support but not reply yet. 11/19/2015 jess84 Reply I think I will wait to upgrade to El Capitan….. I have been reading the reviews on the Mac app store and alot of them are not positive reviews…. Many people have had issues with the new operating system crashing and programs not responding….. Think I will wait a couple weeks or more before I upgrade. 11/21/2015 SeanB Reply I have been primarily using Mac’s for years along with various Windows and Linux OS’s for work and home. DO NOT upgrade to El Capitan yet – too many bugs. I just spent the last couple of days recovering from the upgrade I did last week. Chrome/Word/email/firefox all froze up horribly and eventually I got to a point where we were just looking at the spinning rainbow. A restart caused crashes, and it could not even get into safe mode. I thought I had hard drive or other hardware problem until I booted into Windows 8.1 and Helix 3 and everything worked fine. I am a big fan of Mac, but it is not my religion. I am running MS Office for Mac 2011 and a few forensic programs, but not MS Office 2016 which seems to be the problem with so many others. Disk utility first aid failed also. I finally booted into Recovery mode – erased the Mac partition and used a Yosemite back up I had on my time machine. I cannot see any reason to upgrade (not the right word) – update to El Capitan and wanted to save someone a few days of aggravation or worse. I have the computer forensic equipment and tools to recover from a failure but most people do not. If the beta had bugs it would seem prudent to fix them all before releasing the update.

Anyone have any ideas on how to make it work again. My printer is a Dell. 12/01/2015 Ed Reply Sooooooo….let me see if I have this correct: Upgrade to El Capitan if you have problems with Yosemite….even though the problems may persist….or worsen….or you are just trading old problems for new ones. Don’t upgrade to El Capitan if you’re happy with Yosemite……or if you need your computer for more than just wanking around…..Got it! Actually, on second thought….I think I’ll just slap in Parallels and install Windows 10, and then buy a real PC when the time comes.

Ever since I have installed it my computer is slower then ever. The rainbow wheel is part of my mouse now, my computer shuts down inexplicably and my computer has never been slower. I have been a loyal Apple user for 10 years and I am so mad that I am consider going back to Windows. 12/15/2015 Web Slinger Reply I just installed El Capitan and my trackpad just goes haywire and unable to click on buttons, can’t even shut down computer.

I can no longer use outlook as it continues to crash. Unfortunately, i did not use time capsule to backup my computer as all my files are backup up on dropbox.

The installation was well but graphic issues are present like in OS X yosemite using safari and youtube. My computer freezes 5 times per day in safari and youtube, only mouse works but nothing happens. I take my computer to apple SAT and they told me that the hardware is OK; therefore i think is a software problem. What do you think??? 01/02/2016 Jane Reply Oh Fernando, Apple has immense software problems…..and they just ignore them. Pay them cash and they ignore their customer base. Shame on Apple. 02/18/2016 Robbie Reply I’ve seen every comment you make be against Apple…. El Capitan has served me well on my 2010 MacBook, and my Apple devices outperform AND have outlived any Android or Windows device I’ve owned. And don’t get me started on how much better the battery life of my MacBook is compared to any of my Windows laptops, and How my iPod Touch battery is compared to my droid phone… I also use Windows, but I LOVE my Mac. I have to use droid for some things, and Android 5 is an improvement, but still bloated and buggy! Also, Apple does admit to their issues, you just don’t care to read about it. It’s Microsoft that doesn’t admit to it, and Microsoft tech support is guaranteed…to piss you off! Apple tech support has been fast and friendly to me! I’ve had FAR less issues with this 5-year-old MacBook than I’ve had with ANY of my Windows or droids in less than a year….at least My iPod lasts over a year, compared to my droids…Google still has some work to do before I take Android as primary, and So does MS, until then, I’m staying loyal to Apple. At least I can get through a Mac without seeing 20 years worth of Blue Screen Of Death, or hard drive corruption, or forced updates, etc. Windows and Android have their crap as well, but I am sticking to my Unix OS known as MacOS X and iOS. Oh, and, you come off as annoying when you keep copying and pasting the same reply to several different comments… 02/18/2016 Jane Reply Robbie, thank you for your opinion. may i ask how you stand on Apple security VS terrorism? 12/27/2015 funksoul6 Reply Larrykmelo: yes, but hooker income, like what your mother earned, doesn’t really count. 12/31/2015 Frank Reply Nightmare! Apple continues to fail, fail, fail…….its just not the same company! 12/31/2015 mike Reply I thought about installing it. I guess i will stick with whats working. Sounds like crap to me. Thanks for the information. Good luck to all who tried to install it. 01/02/2016 W. Peters Reply Thanks for the warnings. I too am a long time Apple user, 25 years. I find that that lately the upgrades are downgrades and I only upgraded to Mavericks because WOW stopped working. I was thinking about upgrading to Elcapitan for airdrop between OSX and IOS but I guess that I will stick with the old FTP file transfer method instead. At least I know that it works. I agree that Apple has forgotten who made them successful and who stuck with them back when they were not doing so well. 01/05/2016 Bill Reply Nearly $1000 of my MIDI outboard gear was ruined by the forced upgrades (my tax software wouldn’t even install last year unless the OS was Yosemite! It certainly wouldn’t install under 10.6.8). Apple just doesn’t seem to care anymore. Except about phones. Money wins out everytime and these are corporations. Corporations are people, right?! Money always has won and it always will. That’s Wall Street for ya’ I’m going back to Microsoft stuff because they seem to be paying a bit more attention to things rather than just the bottom line like Apple so obviously is. And Google (android) is really getting good. Those guys and gals are getting it and growing and solidifying their OS over time. It keeps getting better. Who really cares if it was invented in a garage by two guys in San Jose? 04/09/2016 Dan Reply One point not brought up in this discussion is security and the responsibility that software manufactures have to it’s users. Every company Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc. can be liable for security vulnerabilities. They are all trying to stay one step ahead of the people that want to break into your computer and steal your financial and other info. They invest millions of dollars developing new OS to also add new features in an effort to keep you loyal to their brand. Apple and Microsoft are even giving away the latest OS in hopes that you will upgrade. Yes it is a cost cutting maneuver, good for the company, but also good for the consumer. You get new features and their goal isn’t to make things worse. Yes sometimes the new upgrade sucks. That is not the intension of these companies to put out bad software and not care. They are all publicly traded companies and stock performance suffers if people stop buying the products. More users is more profit. All of these companies make very good products and they all are tying hard for your loyalty. 01/18/2016 Saifi Reply After downloading o’s X el captain my lapi is not starting… Wot to do now?

This is a huge improvement over Yosemite…PERIOD. wannabes who only know how to gripe. Very sad. 02/18/2016 Robbie Reply Agreed.

Not to mention how much longer my MacBook battery lasts compared to my Windows laptops… I use Windows, OS X, Android, and iOS, but Apple’s better tech support, reliability, etc. has made me very loyal to their products. Plus, 2 things that pushed me even further to a Mac….Windows Vista, and Windows 8/8.1…Windows 10 is along now, and although it is very much an improvement from 8, it gives WAY too much information to Microsoft, and if there’s an update that may be a bad update, or you just don’t want to apply the update in Windows 10 yet, well, TOO BAD! It installs it on the next reboot anyway! At least on my Mac, if I don’t tell it to update automatically, it won’t update unless I tell it to. Sorry, Microsoft, Sorry, Google, but it’s too late!

I also did not like some of the announced changes to the OS. This March, so many things and apps stopped working properly, so I moved from Snow Leopard to El Capitan on my old Macbook Pro (with 1 1GB drive and 8 GB memory). Also bought a new Mac Mini with El Capitan. Apple got me my Apps package back (the App store forgot me). Some of my old apps I still have to upgrade to use. Otherwise, it was about as painless as possible, and I now like the new system. My Macbook runs like new, and for some reason, even runs cooler. So it wasn’t much worse to upgrade than to start anew on the new Mac Mini. Plan on taking a few days for this. 03/30/2016 Belal Chowdhury Reply SOLVED!!!

Maybe it’s just more the OS has become far more complex and trying to mate many devices together that creates issues. No doubt IOS has had it’s share of problems too. I personally don’t find El Capitan really bad, but it’s certainly has not improved much on my Macbook Air from Mavericks or Yosemite. Snow Leopard was probably the most efficient OS X version. From then on, Apple began a more robust development adding Mobile Me then iCloud to better sync IOS devices and OS X devices. This is when things became more problematic. I do agree that Tim Cook is not the obsessive perfectionist that Steve Jobs was, and has certainly delegated too much oversight of Apple product development to lower management without much oversight or final approval. Steve Jobs I think was much more willing to tell his people to get it right or it won’t go out. I could be wrong, but it appears Cook is more about managing Apple in general than obsessing about new product release quality. Today, it’s about getting it out the door and fixing the bugs on the fly. 04/11/2016 Jeff Calhoun Reply Safari still broken, but better.

Get a good screwdriver set and get that 5400rpm hd out and upgrade memory to 6 or 8 ram. Don’t buy apple specific expensive ram, as long you respect DDR2 or 3 it’s ok. Frequency doesn’t matter so much, most SODIMM are adaptive (got 1600mhz in both devices) just put the new ram in the above slot and the existing beneath, it works ;) Btw, ram limitations posted by apple are incorrect. Get rid of that horrible 5400rpm drive and change it with an ssd, it will speed up everything. So both of my old Macbook and mini are running smoothly like any other pc/os. (except games) Anyway if you wan’t to upgrade your Mac there is plenty documentation on youtube, but please don’t buy a new Mac because it’s Apple marketing strategy.

I did not want to upgrade to the newest mac osx because when I began the install process I was warned that most of my software ( Photoshop etc ) would not run with the new OSX….. I hesitated for a few minutes and thought about how nice it is to have software which actually runs on my machine, then cancelled the install….. why can Microsoft manage to make Vista compatible with the new iphone but Apple can not? why can’t Apple just release a new OSX without making people pull their hair out trying to get everything they used to have work again? 07/09/2016 Mark Reply Since I have installed El Capitan on my iMac 27″ from 2012, coming from Yosemite, it is significantly slower. Much more often the ‘circle of death’, even when simply opening WORD or EXCEL documents. Spotlight appears to have more difficulty finding docs that it would previously indicate in no time. Annoying also is the longer waiting time at logon: the entry field is there, but there is no immediate response to keyboard entries, which used to be the case. Also I’ve had more reboot-required crashes. One or two in a few weeks while this was very rare previously. No other major difficulties, but all in all definitely slower, which is opposite effect from the advertisements that accompanied the release. 07/09/2016 Jane Reply I’m switching to Android everything because Apple is so corrupt.

This so-called “update” is nothing more than fairly worthless cosmetic changes and little more than justifying the jobs of Apple’s army of coders. There is no benefit to El Capitan while delivering a huge loss of your happy Mac functions. Avoid this “upgrade” unless you wish to spend months trying to recover from the fairly pointless pretty changes. 07/22/2016 Neil Reply Apple should reissue OS 8.

I’ve talked to more than 5 other designers and they are all having a lot of issues (particularly InDesign, smart objects in PhotoShop, disappearing menus in Illustrator to name a few.) Then there’s Microsoft Office Suite, which has it’s own special problems (mainly emails won’t send and need the software closed out and re-opened, opening Excel makes smart objects not work again in PhotoShop once you finally have it working…) Then there’s Safari. Many times it freezes or doesn’t load, or partially loads. Open up FireFox… works. Though sometimes FireFox now crashes or freezes as well. We’re talking Mac Pro’s (the tower kind) with fully upgraded RAM and hard drives. Had ZERO issues and ran very speedy right up until the second we upgraded to El Capitan. 08/12/2016 Jeffry Calhoun Reply I feel your pain. Adobe and Apple seem sworn enemies. Come on, people. Adobe useless since el Capitan. Epson and Apple not cooperating either. I’m having zero machine issues, but 7 months later still working thru EVERY software I had since before the upgrade. Most of the time I’ve had to open a ticket with Apple to make any progress, and the answer is NOT published anywhere. Seems like this was a huge os departure. MS office and Safari ok now.

For anyone still reading, I did see that for some reason the beta testing period was a lot shorter on El Capitan than any previous OS so who knows why that happened, but hopefully this new one will have been tested longer. 09/30/2016 chhavi Reply Hello sir….. i was using os x 7(mountain lion) version and downloaded the os x 11(El Capitan) its wants my system to restart for updating the version. but now its not updating… its updated only 10 % approx … and from the last 3 days its stucked there… 10/17/2016 Ronald Richison Reply Mac OS X El Captain uses a default IP address that can be easily guessed.

The action follows removal of The New York Times' app from Apple's App Store in China after a government request this week. The Russian authorities are backed by a court ruling that decided LinkedIn wasn't fulfilling local laws. Under a 2014 law, all internet companies are required to physically store all data pertaining to Russian citizens inside the country. Non-complying companies would face a complete ban from the country, as we see happening now. Nicole Leverich, a spokesperson for LinkedIn, said to The New York Times: “It [the decision] denies access to our members in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses.” Although both Apple and Google are strong advocates of an open internet, we're now seeing increasing pressure for US tech companies to comply with local laws in the countries in which their services are made available. Apple has already acknowledged the request by the Russian government, but Google has declined to comment, although it has affirmed its compliance with the local laws in the countries in which it operates. It's also a setback for Microsoft, LinkedIn's new owner. Last year, Microsoft was accused of spying on its users in Russia, and was also dumped by the Russian government in favor of homegrown alternatives.

BUSINESS CEO Tim Cook gets his pay cut as Apple's revenue declines for first time since 2001 Tim Cook Richard Drew / AP Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, had his pay cut by 15% after the tech company experienced its first decline in revenue since 2001. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, had his pay cut by 15% after the tech company experienced its first decline in revenue since 2001. (Richard Drew / AP) Associated Press Apple penalized Chief Executive Tim Cook for the iPhone maker's first sales slump in 15 years with a 15% pay cut.  Cook still did extremely well, with a compensation package valued at $8.7 million for Apple's fiscal year that ended Sept. 24, according to a regulatory filing made Friday. But the amount was down from nearly $10.3 million in the prior year.  The Cupertino, Calif., company cited a downturn in Apple's revenue and operating profit as the main reason it cut the pay of Cook and its other top executives.  Apple's revenue dropped 8% to $216 billion, while its operating profit declined 16% to $60 billion. That was mainly because it sold fewer iPhones for the first time since the device came out in 2007.  It also marked the first time that Apple's annual revenue decreased since 2001, which was just before the company's late co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the iPod. That digital music player set the stage for the iPhone and iPad.  The iPhone triggered a revolution in mobile computing and became Apple's biggest moneymaker, even as a wide range of device makers released competing products primarily running on Google's free Android software. Most of the world's smartphones are powered by Android, but the iPhone remains a popular high-priced status symbol.  Even so, consumers are holding on to their existing iPhones for longer periods instead of upgrading to a newer model every year or two. That has raised investor concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone, a nagging worry that has been aggravated by the company's inability to introduce another breakthrough product since Jobs' death in 2011.  Cook, Jobs' anointed successor, had hoped Apple would have another huge hit with a smartwatch unveiled in 2014, but that device has had only moderate success.  Apple's regulatory filing revealed that the company was bracing for a sales drop last year, although not quite as steep as what occurred. The compensation committee for Apple's board of directors had established a revenue goal of $224 billion for last year, which would have been a 4% decline from the previous year.  The company expected sales to rebound during the holiday shopping season on hopes that consumers would be snapping up its latest iPhones, the 7 and 7 Plus. Apple will release its quarterly results that include the holidays later this month.    Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss What values does Hollywood promote? A storm that hit Northern California toppled the Pioneer Cabin Tree. Who should discipline police officers? Michelle King has made no big waves in her first year running Los Angeles Unified. A state watchdog agency is investigating political donations connected to real estate developer Samuel Leung.

David Gardner (TMFSpiffyPop) Jan 7, 2017 at 11:11AM Rule Breaker Investing wrapped up its Entrepreneur series last month with an interview with Guy Kawasaki, the Silicon Valley-based author, speaker, and chief evangelist at Canva.  For decades, Guy has led a distinguished career in the technology world, and in this episode, he shares his personal Ten Commandments for entrepreneurs. Find out why "jumping curves" and "rolling the DICEE" can be the key to a successful, innovative company. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Dec. 3, 2016. David Gardner: Welcome back to Rule Breaker Investing. Well, it is a special treat. This is, after all, the time of abundance. The time of Thanksgiving. The holiday time. So we've got something extra for you, once again, this month in Motley Fool Rule Breakers, and that is an interview with one of my favorite entrepreneur coaches (an entrepreneur, himself) [and] business minds, today, and that's Guy Kawasaki, a longtime friend of The Motley Fool and somebody I'm so delighted to share with you, today. You may or may not know Guy's stuff. If you do, you're going to hear more great Guy Kawasaki advice. He's going to be reunderlining a few things that you'd heard once and perhaps forgotten. If you've never heard from Guy Kawasaki before, you're in for a treat. And so this will officially and formally close out Entrepreneur Month, which is what November was for Rule Breaker Investing. Well, let me get right to Guy. __ Gardner: Guy Kawasaki is the chief evangelist of Canva, an online graphic design tool with tens of millions of users, at this point. He's on the board of trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation, a brand ambassador for Mercedes-Benz USA, an executive fellow of the Haas School of Business (UC Berkeley). We both have had at least one son be there or graduate from there. He was also, of course, the chief evangelist of Apple. He's also the author of The Art of Start 2.0, The Art of Social Media, Enchantment -- I hate brushing through these [as] these are some very fine books -- Rules for Revolutionaries [and] eight other books. There's just so much to say about Guy. Guy, you got a BA from Stanford University. I didn't remember you got an MBA from UCLA. Looking backward, was that the right thing to do? An MBA? Did you even need an MBA? Guy Kawasaki: Looking backward? Well, it's easy to look backward. At the time (this is the late '70s), the MBA degree was a fence that you jumped over to get career advancement. I don't think that's true in technology, today. So is it necessary to get an MBA to start a company? Not at all. Is it necessary to get an MBA to work for Goldman Sachs, or for Accenture, or for McKinsey? Probably. So it depends on your career path. You know, when people say, "Well, I'm thinking of starting a company. I want to go get an MBA," I tell them, "You know, I don't think so." And in Silicon Valley, believe it or not, for a tech company an MBA is not necessarily a positive. Gardner: Yeah, I can see that, so it's somewhat ironic to note that Guy Kawasaki has an MBA, but really place and time it makes sense to me. It makes sense to me. And Guy, you know, I first came across you... This is really random. I was sitting in Alexandria, Virginia in my house (this is in the mid-1990s), and on local cable access there was just some interview with you. You were sitting there, and you were taking down conventional wisdoms right in front of your host, talking about starting a business. You probably were shooting down an MBA at that point. This is two decades after you got one. But you spoke to me -- you didn't know you were speaking to me -- but I don't think The Motley Fool started there. I was just sitting there, watching, and I was thinking I really like this guy (pun not intended) because he looks at things differently. And the Fool in me, which would later kind of break out and become a real thing, appreciated you going after conventional wisdom. That's what I wanted to do featuring you this week on Rule Breaker Investing, Guy. I wanted to spot you up with some of your great what I think of as "Kawasaki-isms." Just to give the background, here, this is from a speech you gave in 2009, in fact, at Wharton. I'm just going to spot you up with your "Ten Commandments" and ask you just to give us a minute or two on each one. I'm not expecting you memorized these. Were these chiseled in stone? Do you remember these ten commandments, Guy? Kawasaki: Uh, barely. Gardner: Did you come down from a mountain, somewhere? Kawasaki: Well, I've misplaced my tablet, so you're going to have to refresh my mind. Gardner: No problem. These are all great, and I'm really looking forward to it. Let's get started with number one. Number one -- make meaning, not money. Kawasaki: By this I mean, and it's really an observation, that if you look at the truly great companies, they make meaning. They make people's lives better. So Apple has made computing available to many people. Google has democratized information. Canva, the company that I work for now, is trying to democratize design. And my theory is that if you make meaning, you'll probably also make money. But if you start off trying to slowly make money, you'll just attract a bunch of people who are trying to get a quick clip. Gardner: And Guy, when you become chief evangelist at Apple or Canva, is this something that you're bringing about a viewpoint to those companies or do those companies already get it? Kawasaki: That depends on how retroactive you want your thinking to be. If you go to work and the company succeeds and it changes people's lives, then after the fact you say, "Of course I knew that, and I really joined that company in order to make the world a better place." But truly at the time you join a company, I would make the case that you're so frickin' happy to get job, anywhere, that you'd probably still go to work anywhere, maybe short of a cigarette company or something. So that's where the theory and the practice diverge, shall I say. Gardner: Out of curiosity, Guy, what was your first job after your MBA? Kawasaki: My first job coming out of my MBA was, believe it or not, working for a small family held jewelry company. It was a jewelry manufacturer. No test at all. And it was one of the best experiences, ever, because it enabled me to learn how to truly sell. Gardner: All right, number two. Number two -- make a mantra, not a mission statement. Kawasaki: Yes. So I'm anti-mission statement. I think mission statements are 25 to 50 words long. They're meaningless. They try to address too many constituencies. The typical mission statement is, "We endeavor to create world-class products that exceed the desires of our customers while enabling our employees to self-actualize their life goals while providing shareholders with a meaningful capital return while killing as few dolphins and whales as possible." And that's a little difficult to stomach. And so I think you should create a mantra which is two or three words long and very easy to remember. For example, the mantra of Canva is "to democratize design." And I don't know if it's a mantra -- if they use it in this sense -- but from the outside looking in, I would say that Google democratizes information. So that's two words that explain what you do, and I think that's a much more powerful way to explain to the world, including your employees, why you exist. Gardner: Beautiful. Number three. This is your own phrase, I think. Jump curves. Kawasaki: Yes. So by jumping curves, I mean that true innovation occurs not on the same curve. Not that you made a better typewriter, or a better computer, or a better laser printer. True innovation occurs when you get to the next curve. So you go from harvesting ice, to ice factories, to refrigerator. You go from daisy-wheel printer, to laser printer, to 3D printer. You go from telegraph, to telephone, to mobile phone. That's where the big jumps occur, not because you made a slightly better copper-based telephone system. Gardner: And playing it forward, you did such a glib and wonderful job just taking us through three quick generations of a few different technologies. Can you select a technology that we all think of as a new, cool thing today and can you jump a curve, or two, and look 25 to 50 years ahead? Kawasaki: Oh, wow. Gardner: You said it's easy to look back, earlier, which is true. This is an unfair question. But since we have entrepreneurs listening, somebody's probably wondering what curve he or she should jump. Kawasaki: Well, let me give you an algorithm instead of an answer, because I don't have an answer. I think the algorithm is that it's probably a guy and a gal, two gals, or a two guys in a garage or a spare dorm room that are unencumbered by the current state of the art. So that's why it's so difficult for existing companies to jump curves. Now if you define yourself as "we harvest ice," then do you embrace the ice factory? If you own a bunch of ice factories, do you jump the curve to the refrigerator? So if you're Western Union and you own telegraphs, do you jump to the telephone, and do you jump from telephone to internet, and from internet to mobile? And that's the difficulty. I'm 62 years old. I think it's very difficult for a 62-year-old to tell you how to jump a curb, because we're so stuck on our current curb. So, I think that's why, by definition, it's usually a young person who jumps the curb because they don't know any better. Gardner: Well put. Number four, Guy. You're throwing an acronym at us with this one. In product design, you said, "roll the DICEE," but dice has an extra "e" on the end and they're all capitals. That's an acronym. What is it? Kawasaki: OK. A "DICEE" is the five essential qualities of innovation. So the "D" stands for depth. Great products are deep. You don't run out of power as you come up the curve, the learning curve. The "I" stands for intelligent. When you look at it, you say, "Huh! This company understood my pain. This company understood my problem." The "C" stands for complete, so it's not just deep. It's also wide. A great example of that is Amazon. It's not just buying books, anymore. It's basically buying anything you want. The first "E" stands for elegance in the user interface and the industrial design. And the last "E" stands for empowering. That it makes you more creative or productive. So the way I apply this is when you try to jump curves, ask yourself, "Are we creating something that's deep, intelligent, complete, empowering, and elegant?" Gardner: Boy. Each one of these I want to go further down, but if I did we would have way too long an interview. But that's wonderful guiding words from a guy who clearly knows. Number five -- this is a classic Guy Kawasaki phrase. Number five -- don't worry, be "crappy." Kawasaki: Yeah. So don't worry, be crappy means that when you have jumped curbs, don't worry if your curb isn't perfect. For example, if you had the first refrigerator, it was already better to the best ice factory, so ship. When you had the first laser printer, it was already better than the best dot matrix printer, so ship. If I had been smarter, I would have called this the "minimum viable product,"... Gardner: Aha! Kawasaki: ...and I would be Eric Ries instead of Guy Kawasaki. But, you know, I actually think that don't worry, be "crappy" is clever. Gardner: It's definitely a mantra, and mantras matter. I like it. And you were certainly saying it before the MBP crowd showed up, so I think that they've learned something from you. Kawasaki: I know! I know! Really! Gardner: Now, let me ask. Since we just covered a point where you used the word "elegance," some people might think there's a little bit of a conflict between the concept of design something that has elegance; but just being crappy and shipping. How do you reconcile those? Kawasaki: Well, as long as you understand that I am not suggesting that you ship crap. I'm suggesting that you ship a curve jump and it can have elements of crappiness to it. There's a difference. Gardner: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Kawasaki: So the first Macintosh was elegant, but it had elements of crappiness to it. Gardner: And let me ask, because I can't not think of Clayton Christensen and his studies and work on disruptive innovation, where often it is the new player who comes in and democratizes something. It's never going to be an elite quality product. It's just going to be something for the common man and something that people start to use. It's not as good as the Mercedes-Benz, but over time, these disruptive companies can end up growing into those markets. Guy, have you read some Clayton Christensen? Do you see some consonance? Kawasaki: Oh, yeah, absolutely. I'm a big Clayton Christensen fan. I think there's two key lessons, [here]. The first is that it's very difficult to remain innovative. That's his whole point, that it is a dilemma for innovative companies to remain innovative. So that's number one. Number two -- I think a very important message from Clayton is that the market leaders are typically attacked from below, not above. To take a case that I'm very familiar with because I'm in the design business -- let's say you're trying to attack Adobe Photoshop. One method would be to create a better Photoshop (more features, more power, higher end). I don't think you succeed that way. I think you attack Photoshop from the bottom, which means less features, easier to use, cheaper, online, and all that other stuff and then you go upmarket. But you don't start by saying "we're more powerful than Photoshop." You start off by saying, "we're less powerful than Photoshop. More elegant. Cheaper. More approachable. Easier to learn." That's the way you attack a leader. So when Sun attacked, let's say, DEC or Digital, they didn't attack it from above. They didn't say "we have a more powerful computer." They attacked it from the bottom -- not the bottom, maybe, but lower -- saying that "we have a cheaper, easier, faster, you know whatever computer." Gardner: So counterintuitive. So true. Such an important point. Kawasaki: Can I draw a parallel? Gardner: Please. Kawasaki: When you started your company, you didn't try to outdo the Wall Street Journal, right? You attack the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times and any other financial institution or institutions that cover finance... Gardner: Thank you. Kawasaki: You didn't attack it from above. You attacked it from below. Gardner: We were Fools. It turns out 20 years later we still are Fools. But thank you, Guy, I appreciate that. Kawasaki: You have outlasted Lehman Brothers. Gardner: [Laughs] I don't know that I should laugh at that, but it's true. It's true. Thank you very much. So we are at the halfway point. This is halftime. Those are five of Guy's 10 commandments. I'm taking a deep breath, here, because I'm already processing a lot that you just shared with us. Do you want to do a quick halftime show? Do you have something to sing, maybe? Is Janet Jackson around? Or should we just go right into the second half? Kawasaki: I think we should just plunge ahead. Gardner: All right, good. So I'll kick off to you, here, to start the second half. Number six -- polarize people. Kawasaki: Yes. Polarize people means that great innovation will make some people very happy; it will make some people very pissed off; and that's OK. The goal is not to make everybody happy, because if you try to do that, you'll end up with mediocrity. So the key -- the key -- is that you create something that excites people and the consequence of that is that yes, you may piss off a few people, but so be it. That's better than not being on the radar. Gardner: You know, I think of somebody else that I really have enjoyed his work over the course of time, Seth Godin, and he talks about the word "remarkable," which means simply that you're causing people to remark about what you're doing. It might be good [and] it might be bad, but you're causing them to remark. It sounds like this kind of polarization. Kawasaki: It's the "purple" Kawasaki. Gardner: There we go. Purple Kawasaki. I like it. Of course, punning on Seth's Purple Cow for those keeping score at home. Outstanding. Number seven, Guy. Let 100 flowers blossom. What do you mean by that? Kawasaki: Yes. Let 100 flowers blossom means that at the start of great innovation, you may think you have figured out exactly who should use your product, how, and why; and you may encounter a very interesting situation where unintended customers use your product in unintended ways. And lots of companies freak out when this happens. My God. The wrong people are buying our products in large quantities. And when that happens, you should just declare victory and take the money. Gardner: And that's because at the end of the day, we're all trying to improve the world. Change people's lives. Sometimes we do it in ways we, ourselves, didn't even foresee or intend. Kawasaki: And don't be proud. Take the money. Gardner: Number eight -- churn, baby, churn. Kawasaki: Yes. Churn, baby, churn is a play on "burn, baby, burn" and the Black Panthers. By churn, baby, churn I mean that one of the hardest things for a revolutionary to do is to shift a curve jump and to continue to enhance the curve jump. To churn it. To go from 10, to 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. And that's a huge challenge, but so necessary. A Macintosh 128, to Macintosh 512, to Macintosh Plus, to Macintosh II, etc., etc. Gardner: And guy, do you still see Apple doing that today? Is that your view of Apple in 2016? Churn, baby, churn? Kawasaki: Well, I have to say that they continue to churn their phone. I don't think they churn it fast (or fast enough). I have an iPhone 7, and to my amazement you still can't do wireless charging. It's little things like that. On the one hand, they're telling the world that we all have to go to USB-C, but this has a lightning connector, so explain to me why you're telling us to go to USB-C on computers, but you're still lightning? I don't get that. I can't tell you that I'm blown away by the pace of their churn. Oh, another case in point is I have a Macbook Pro, and this Macbook Pro is from 2013. It's now 2017. I have a new Macbook Pro on order, but I used to change Macbooks every year. When the hard disk started getting filled up, right there it was God telling me to buy a new Macbook Pro. But I've had this thing for three years. How is it possible that I've had a Macbook Pro for three years? Gardner: But isn't that kind of a good thing? I think a lot of people don't want to have to constantly buy a new computer every year. Kawasaki: Yeah. I mean, certainly I understand that, but I want to buy a new computer every year. Not because I want to spend the money, but because I want to be blown away. Oh, it got twice as fast, or twice as cool. I'm OK with that. In a sense, people have to understand for me (and maybe not a lot of people) but for me, my computer is the core of my productivity. It's not like a car. For a car for me, I can spend years in a car because it's not core to my existence. But a computer is core to my existence, and I want it to be improved all the time. Gardner: Number nine. Niche yourself. Kawasaki: Yes. So niche yourself is a recommendation that you need to be very important so you're valuable, and you need to be unique; that is, only you make this product or service. Because when you're valuable and unique, that's when you can make history and make money. So you can be valuable but not unique (and I would say that Dell is in that corner). You can make a lot of money, there, but it's always about price, because you're not unique. You can be unique but not valuable, and in that corner you're just stupid, because you own a market that doesn't exist. You could be unique and not valuable. That's many Silicon Valley companies, where it's a dumb idea, but people like me are funding multiple versions of the dumb idea. So the corner you need to be in is where you're the only game in town and it's very valuable. I would say, for example, when the iPhone first came out, it was valuable, because it had a good user interface. And it was unique because it was the only way you could easily, and cheaply, and legally buy music. So that was unique and valuable, and hence the success. You could make the case that all of innovation is about being unique and valuable. Gardner: You know, Guy, I think a lot of people who are entrepreneurs... One of the most popular start-ups that's not a Silicon Valley start-up (I'm thinking small business across America and the world) is a restaurant. A lot of people start restaurants. Have you ever opened up restaurant? Kawasaki: No. I'm not that much of a masochist. Gardner: It's a tough business, no question. But I think about what makes unique in a restaurant. I feel like that's a creative problem that you or I could solve. I think that there are ways. We had Danny Meyer on of Union Square fame and Shake Shack fame a couple of weeks ago on this podcast, and I think his decision to take tipping out of the equation, altogether, at his restaurants is an example. Kawasaki: Yes. That is definitely an interesting thing. I think his point is that it makes a better relationship between customer and... Do they call it front? The front office? What do they call it? It's back versus front, right? Now, if you're a diner, you're not thinking about, "Well, how much do I tip this guy or gal," and if you're a waiter, you're not thinking, "Well, how much is this *!@#* going to tip me?" But I think almost more important, [which] is part of his concept, is he increases the base-level pay of everybody. I think he makes a good point. So a waiter or a waitress has a low base, but can make a lot of money because of tips. But the cook, who's making the essential product... Gardner: That's right. Kawasaki: ...is on a flat rate. There's no profit sharing. There's no tipping of the cook. Gardner: That's right. Kawasaki: So it's kind of ass-backwards, right? So what's more important? The food or the serving of the food? At least they're equally important. In his NPR thing, they interviewed some cooks and they were making $25,000 to $35,000 a year after spending four years in culinary school. That boggles my mind. Gardner: Thinking of another business that's taken tipping out and has gotten pretty popular these days is Uber. What do you make of Uber? Kawasaki: Well, Uber hasn't taken tipping out. It's just tipping is automated, right? Gardner: Yeah, but taking the decision [away from] the consumer. It just feels easier to me, anyway. Kawasaki: Yes. Oh, yes, it's much easier. I admit the concept of taking tipping out -- there are times where you might not want the Uber driver to get any tip and it's kind of automatic. And there are also times where you want to give an exemplary case to an Uber driver and you want to pay them even more. And I know you can do that, but who the hell ever remembers to do that? But I don't think the essence of Uber is taking tipping out. I think the essence of Uber is that you go to your app, you say you're here, you see how many cars are around. It's not like calling a cab company. You call a cab company and you have no idea if they're coming all the way across town to pick you up... Gardner: Yeah ... Kawasaki: ... and it's going to be half an hour or five minutes. And then the whole experience of getting out. So you get out of the cab. You hope they take a credit card. You hope they're not capturing your number. I mean, there's a lot of like iffy stuff. Whereas Uber, you just get the hell out of there... Gardner: Yeah... Kawasaki: ...and boom. And then I think the probability of getting reimbursed by your company for an Uber fare is much higher than a taxi fare because to get out of a taxi and you paid, you have to remember to get a receipt. You have to remember to put in the number, the date, and the amount, and then you have to remember to keep that piece of paper, and you have to remember to turn that piece of paper in, which means you never get reimbursed for a cab. But Uber is always there, so you could make the case that Uber has cost companies money because it's much more likely for an employee to get an Uber reimbursement than a cash cab reimbursement, so maybe it's a negative for companies. Gardner: Well, it sounds like a better world to me, although in the end we have the choice of either one, and that's the world I like. Guy, you've been so gracious with nine points. I've got your 10th one for you. Whether or not you remember it, this all, again, comes from a speech you gave at Wharton seven years ago, and it closed out with number 10, follow the 10-20-30 rule. What's that? Kawasaki: Yes, the 10-20-30 rule is a rule for pitching. So my recommendation is that you use 10 slides, you be able to give those 10 slides in 20 minutes, and that your font is no smaller than 30 points. And if you were to follow this rule, your pitch would be better than 95% of the pitches in the world. Just those three rules. Gardner: And you said 30 point or bigger, right? You didn't say 30 point or smaller. You're talking about big words, a few slides. A short presentation. Kawasaki: Minimum. Minimum 30 points, yes. Not maximum. Gardner: Now, I'm picturing you as the chief evangelist at Canva. I know you're very busy. Do you watch pitches these days? Is that part of the Guy Kawasaki life in 2016? Kawasaki: Nope. Never. Never. Gardner: Do you miss it? Kawasaki: Not at all. You know, the nature of pitches is that you look at a thousand and you accept one... Gardner: That's inefficient. Kawasaki: Yeah. Gardner: That's a lot of work. Kawasaki: And also, by definition you're almost always going to say no. That's number one. Number two [is] it's hard, because on the one hand, you want to help the entrepreneur improve his or her pitch. On the other hand, helping the entrepreneur improve his or her pitch takes enormous intellectual involvement. And so, I think that's why venture capitalists never really give you feedback. They kind of say, "Yes, very interesting. Looks promising. We'll get back to you," because that's easy to say. Whereas if you really wanted to improve the pitch, you'd say, "OK, so you suck here, you suck here, you suck here, and this is how to change it." But then when you start telling people where they suck, then they argue back that, "no, we don't suck." And then it becomes a time suck. So in a sense, it's like when you're hiring an employee. You interview a thousand people and you hire one. You don't give 999 employees feedback. Oh, this is why we didn't hire you. It's because you're a brute, and you're wearing a polyester pantsuit, and you have bad breath, and you have a really poor résumé. And you have lousy references. We'll tell you who the lousy references came from. Now, some of these actually step over the line of legality, but when you get rejected by a company, you always get a letter that says "despite your high qualifications, we are unable to offer you a position." They don't tell you why you sucked. So "don't cry for me Argentina," but that's why it's really hard to listen to a lot of pitches if you want to help the entrepreneur, because it takes enormous energy and enormous intellectual involvement to truly help someone you're rejecting. Gardner: Well through your books and through your own work. Through speeches that you give. Through your very presence in the world at large, Guy, you have helped innumerable entrepreneurs, this one included, and I'm really grateful to have this chance to connect with you this week. Let me close out by asking you two quick questions. One is I would love to know a hero of yours, living or dead. I think heroes matter so much to all of us, and I'm always curious. You're one of my heroes, but who's one of your heroes? And the second question -- you can take them in either order -- is can you give the classic Kawasaki line about don't let the bozos get you down and explain it. Kawasaki: As for heroes, right now I'm into surfing, so I guess my hero would be Kelly Slater. That's number one. I suppose you wanted a more intellectual kind of answer... Gardner: No, no. That works. Kawasaki: So that's one. Another is to reiterate a name that you mentioned. I think that Clayton Christensen is doing great work about innovation. A third would be, of course, Steve Jobs. There are aspects of how he did things that I don't exactly admire, but there are aspects that he was just beyond anybody else's capabilities, so he would be a hero. So those are some heroes for you. Gardner: Let me pin down, really quick, on Steve Jobs. Can you give a quick anecdote? Some time that you brushed Jobs wrongly? Throw us a bone, here, Kawasaki Jobs. Kawasaki: OK. So first of all, when the Macintosh division decided to hire me, the person who hired me was my college classmate, so it was purely nepotism. When he went to Steve to say, "OK, can I hire Guy?" Steve's ringing endorsement of me was, "He's OK, but I'm not sure, and if you hire him and he doesn't work, I'm going to fire you, too." So that's how I got my job at Apple. But it all worked out. Gardner: It sure did. Kawasaki: That's my Steve Jobs story for you. Gardner: Great. All right, and "don't let the bozos get you down." What do you mean? Kawasaki: Well, don't let the bozos get you down means that there are going to be people in the world who tell you it can't be done, and it shouldn't be done, it isn't necessary, and you have to learn to ignore those people. Now, there are fundamentally two kinds of bozos. One bozo is obviously a loser. Body odor. Pocket protector. Japanese watch. Rusty car. So this bozo is not dangerous because an obvious loser should not endanger your existence because only losers listen to losers. So if you're a loser, you might listen to a loser. Your listeners are not losers, so this bozo isn't dangerous. The dangerous bozo is the rich, famous, powerful bozo, because many people parse rich and famous to smart. But I would make the case that rich and famous usually (or not usually) but at least 50% of the time parses to lucky. So it's very difficult to separate luck from competence. And this is why it's dangerous, because if a dangerous bozo tells you you it can't be done and shouldn't be done and it isn't necessary, and you actually listen, you might not try, and that's the worst outcome of all. So I want to caution people from listening to people just because they're rich and famous. By that tip you shouldn't listen to, I don't know, Kim Kardashian about how to raise a family. I would suggest that that might not be optimal. But that's the danger. Now, that is kind of an extreme example, but let's suppose you're in the personal computer business, and you go to someone who's been very successful in the mini computer business for advice. And the person in the mini computer business might tell you, "Well, no one wants a personal computer, and so you should learn cobalt and come work for my mini computer company." And if you listened to that person, you would never start Apple. That's why if you went to the person who owned 50 successful ice factories and said to that person, "Well, we have this new thing called a refrigerator. You don't have to have an ice factory to deliver ice to you anymore. Now you can have your own personal ice factory," I highly doubt that the ice factory owner would say, "You're right. You should do this company." Gardner: Outstanding. Guy Kawasaki, what a pleasure it is to reconnect after some years and I continue to wish you the very best. Good luck with Canva and all of your other endeavors. Kawasaki: Thank you very much, David. It's a pleasure. Gardner: Fool on! __ Gardner: Well, I hope those 30 minutes, or so roughly, spoke for themselves.

Cook still did extremely well, with a compensation package valued at $8.7 million for Apple's fiscal year that ended Sept. 24, according to a regulatory filing made Friday. But the amount was down from nearly $10.3 million in the prior year. The Cupertino, California, company cited a downturn in Apple's revenue and operating profit as the main reason it cut the pay of Cook and its other top executives. Apple's revenue dropped 8 percent to $216 billion, while its operating profit declined 16 percent to $60 billion. That was mainly because it sold fewer iPhones for the first time since the device came out in 2007. It also marked the first time that Apple's annual revenue decreased since 2001, which was just before the company's late co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the iPod. That digital music player set the stage for the iPhone and iPad. The iPhone triggered a revolution in mobile computing and became Apple's biggest moneymaker, even as a wide range of device makers released competing products primarily running on Google's free Android software. Most of the world's smartphones are powered by Android, but the iPhone remains a popular high-priced status symbol. Even so, consumers are holding on to their existing iPhones for longer periods instead of upgrading to a newer model every year or two. That has raised investor concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone, a nagging worry that has been aggravated by the company's inability to introduce another breakthrough product since Jobs' death in 2011. Cook, Jobs' anointed successor, had hoped Apple would have another huge hit with a smartwatch unveiled in 2014, but that device has only had moderate success. Apple's regulatory filing revealed that the company was bracing for a sales drop last year, although not quite as steep as what occurred. The compensation committee for Apple's board of directors had established a revenue goal of $224 billion for last year, which would have been a 4 percent decline from the previous year. The company expected sales to rebound during the holiday shopping season on hopes that consumers would be snapping up its latest iPhones, the 7 and 7 Plus. Apple will release its quarterly results that include the holidays later this month. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

And one of them is going to be long-distance wireless charging. Apple’s rumored partner Energous has confirmed that its wireless transmitters will start shipping by the end of this year. In an interview with The Verge, Energous CEO Steve Rizzone said the company’s transmitters would be used in devices from “one of the largest consumer electronics companies in the world.” Image Credit: Energous Corporation / YouTube video (screenshot) Energous technology designed for iPhone 8 Rizzone declined to name the company, but he can “virtually guarantee” that you have this company’s products “on your person, sitting on your desk, or at home.” Energous is the company behind WattUp, a truly wireless charging technology. Most existing wireless charging technologies require users to place the device on a charging pad. But WattUp uses radio frequencies to charge electronic devices from a distance of up to 15 feet. Back in 2015, Energous had promised to start shipping its transmitters that same year. But the company changed its plans after signing a “key strategic partnership.” Under the terms of the deal, Energous had to miniaturize the technology before shipping. Also, the unnamed strategic partner has the right to be the first to ship Energous’ charging technology in its smartphones, tablets, and other devices. Why Apple is the mysterious Energous partner There are several reasons to believe that the unnamed partner is none other than Apple. For instance, last month Energous signed an agreement with Dialog Semiconductor to develop and market hardware components. Dialog is a long-time Apple partner. Under the agreement, Dialog would invest $10 million in Energous to become its exclusive component supplier. In a recent conference call, Energous said “most, if not all” of its early adopters are “existing Dialog customers.” To put things in perspective, Apple alone accounts for more than 70% of Dialog Semiconductor’s revenues. Also, Energous’ SEC filing in March 2014 had disclosed that its products were expected to undergo “Apple compliance testing.” Foxconn testing wireless charging modules for iPhone 8 In late October, supply chain sources told the Nikkei Asian Review that Apple’s largest manufacturing partner Foxconn was testing wireless charging modules for the iPhone 8. It’s worth pointing out that Foxconn and Energous had signed a deal in January 2015 to evaluate the latter’s wireless charging technology. If a smartphone has a built-in WattUp receiver, it would automatically start charging when coming within 15 feet of a WattUp transmitter. Apple ditched the 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7, forcing users to rely on the Lightning connector for both connecting wired headphones and charging. A truly wireless charging technology would be an appropriate way to let users connect wired headphones while charging their devices. The iPhone 8 is rumored to have an all-glass design to facilitate wireless charging. Apple is also expected to launch two other phones, iPhone 7S and 7S Plus, alongside the iPhone 8 this year.

The iPhone maker has confirmed that it will be opening its first retail store in South Korea, with the location even said to be near Samsung’s headquarters in the city of Seoul. “We’re excited about opening our first Apple Store in Korea, one of the world’s economic centers and a leader in telecommunication and technology, with a vibrant K-culture,” the company said in a statement. The exact location of the store and its scheduled opening weren’t revealed, however Apple is already hiring with job listings on their website including Genius bar and store leader positions. So if you’ve ever wanted to sell iPhones and MacBooks in South Korea, now’s your chance! With one of the largest economies in Asia, it’s hard to believe Apple doesn’t already have a retail presence in South Korea, but it’s also a sign of just how well Samsung has dominated its home turf. Before this, Apple users in the country have had to get by with just two certified resellers. Or, you know, just buy online. According to Korea’s own Yonhap News Agency, construction for the store has already begun in the up-scale Gangnam district of Seoul. The 6,000-square-foot location is said to be made up of three floors, with two below ground level, and should be completed by the end of November.

obsessions our picks latest popular like us on facebook follow us on twitter quartz index about us register log in log out Events Atlas quartz quartz India quartz Africa Change your edition back to menu FINAL TALLY The product that stole the show at CES 2017 didn’t even have a booth Written by Dave Gershgorn & Mike Murphy January 07, 2017 Your Quartz guide to the winners of CES. (AP Photo/John Locher) Share Written by Dave Gershgorn & Mike Murphy January 07, 2017 As Quartz’s time at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas comes to a close, we have rounded up CES’s best phones, TVs, concept cars, and miscellany. Rather than being focused on breakout gadgets, this year was especially homogenous, dominated by similar products competing in a few categories: We saw droves of autonomous, electric concept cars, variations on the smart speaker, and half-baked home robots. The best gadgets, listed below, were chosen because they actually managed to differentiate themselves from the herd, or seemed like real, viable products amidst a field of prototypes. Grand winner: Amazon Alexa #Ford and @Amazon are working together to connect #AmazonEcho with your car. Find out what you can do. #Alexa https://t.co/eS4jTF7fMH — Ford Motor Company (@Ford) January 5, 2017 Even though Amazon wasn’t showing off Alexa at its own booth, the digital personal assistant stole the show as the most widely integrated technology: It was hooked up with smart speakers, refrigerators, lamps, robots, cars, and the list goes on. There’s no reason for Amazon to be mad at other companies tapping into Alexa’s virtual brain. More people using the service means more data for Amazon, and as one of Alexa’s chief skills is ordering items from the commerce site, it probably means more sales, too. (These integrations also garner valuable press for Alexa, such as this article.) At the end of the day, the more people who see the worth of employing its services as a virtual assistant, the more robust the service becomes for users. It’s also worth noting the only company that had dominated CES to this extent without actually attending has traditionally been Apple. In previous years, phones were measured against the iPhone’s often-imitated design, apps and peripherals were judged based on their compatibility with the App Store, and any device that was accepted for sale at Apple’s gleaming aluminum temples proudly displayed their status as an Apple Store product. This year, the Alexa logo was displayed with that same pride. Phone: ZTE Axon 7 Max Dave and I left these 3D pics on the @ZTE_USA Axon 7 Max phones at their booth… sorry about that #CES2017 #QZatCES pic.twitter.com/RRpeG1GKt6 — Mike Murphy (@mcwm) January 7, 2017 In 2017, it’s really, really difficult to innovate in smartphones. Regardless of the manufacturer, they’re all pocket supercomputers with amazing cameras and features. That’s why the ZTE Axon 7 Max was so interesting. It has something few other smartphones have—two rear-facing stereoscopic cameras—and something no others have: the ability to take 3D photos. Tap into the camera, click on the 3D-photo function, and you can create something that looks akin to a hologram, with actual depth and definition between objects in the images. As fun as ZTE’s 3D photos are though, until there’s a critical mass of people with access to the technology, it may well remain a niche gimmick. (It’s also worth noting that most major manufacturers are saving their best phones for later in 2017.) Honorable mention: The Kodak Ektra. This is not a digital camera, it's an Android smartphone from @kodak ! (and also a digital camera obv)#CES2017 #QZatCES pic.twitter.com/Y14JOBnQDl — Mike Murphy (@mcwm) January 6, 2017 Kodak’s latest device looks and feels more like a vintage camera than a smartphone. In addition to the normal features found on modern smartphones, the Ektra has a massive 21-megapixel camera strapped to the back and comes with a carry case that harkens back to old-school camera cases. Hipsters will love it. Robot: Mayfield Robotics’ Kuri The Kuri from @MayfieldRobot might be the most adorable robot that you’d actually want at home#CES2017 #QZatCEShttps://t.co/K2TImTlk0U pic.twitter.com/VxEuXfvRyn — Mike Murphy (@mcwm) January 4, 2017 CES was teeming with robots of all shapes and sizes this year, though few of them seemed particularly useful, and many of them just didn’t seem to work. But one robot stood out to us: Kuri, from startup Mayfield Robotics. The company is backed by Bosch, one of the largest technology conglomerates in the world (and renowned roboticists in their own right). Mayfield aims to be the first company to build a robot that people welcome into their homes as they would a pet. Kuri can do some of the things that smart-home hubs like the Amazon Echo or Google Home are equipped for, like play music and audiobooks from a built-in speaker, but it can also be used to patrol your home and use computer vision to check up on pets, see when the kids arrive home from school, or determine if unwanted guests have dropped in. Kuri’s animations and personality were designed by a former Pixar animator, and the robots really feel as if they have agency and presence: They look around, get antsy, are inquisitive, are happy to see people, and respond to your stimuli. Although Kuri will only cost $700 when it’s released in December, it’s not entirely clear if we need to invite these sorts of bots into our homes when Alexa and Siri are already doing these serviceable jobs. But compared with all the other offerings at CES, Kuri actually seemed to be happy to work for us humans. Television: Samsung Lifestyle TV . @samsung are the talk of CES 2017 with their "Lifestyle TV" #innovation https://t.co/iXpJMXUkxf pic.twitter.com/te88H9byZy — Undercurrent UK (@UNDERCURRENTuk) January 5, 2017 The best tech disappears into the user’s life, summoned only when needed. Samsung took that design philosophy to heart with the Lifestyle TV, a picture-frame-shaped television that never turns off. Instead, when it’s not being used for its primary purpose, the monitor displays images, such as digital recreations of paintings, family photos, or professional photography. Plus, maybe a TV that masquerades as art when it’s not in use might help with that New Year’s resolution to watch less tube. Concept Car: Toyota Concept-i Watch Toyota's electric concept car spin and unfold at #CES2017 #QZatCES pic.twitter.com/VT97VYnL4O — Dave Gershgorn (@davegershgorn) January 7, 2017 Looking rather like a Prius from 20 years in the future, the Concept-i is an extremely stylish sedan with gullwing doors and glass paneling in very strange places. But the real craziness in this car is on the inside: It comes equipped with an AI driver called Yui that learns your moods and responds accordingly, and is represented as a pulsing beam of light that appears all over the car. According to Popular Mechanics, Yui can also talk to drivers to help them stay attentive while driving manually. The car is just a concept, meaning we’re not likely to see any production vehicle on the road any time soon, but it’s a pretty radical representation of where one of the largest automakers in the world sees the design and use of cars heading toward. Honorable mention: Mercedes Vision Van The future of mailmen is drones being shot off with your packages from @MercedesBenz vans #CES2017 #QZatCEShttps://t.co/mugJYa2inE pic.twitter.com/Wh5QosBULL — Mike Murphy (@mcwm) January 6, 2017 This bizarre concept van combines a delivery truck, a robot-sorting device, and drones to become the future of short-range delivery. And, for some reason, you use a joystick to drive it. Laptop: HP Spectre x360 (2017) Indulge in hours of your favorite entertainment, elegantly. Meet the all-new Spectre x360: https://t.co/TbFMgSS4LP pic.twitter.com/TRR6sD4EXp — HP (@HP) January 3, 2017 It’s not a new design, but HP’s new Spectre is a win purely on principle: It’s not a sin to make a device thicker for better functionality. HP says the sub-millimeter addition to the laptop’s height allowed a 23% larger battery. Most “CES” product: Graalphone Introducing the Graalphone, a 4-1 monstrosity: Windows phone, Android tablet, Android phone, digital camera. #CES2017 #QZatCES pic.twitter.com/9WGNNiprL8 — Dave Gershgorn (@davegershgorn) January 7, 2017 Is it a mobile Windows PC? Is it an Android tablet? Is it an Android smartphone? No, it’s Graalphone! Okay, actually, it’s none of those things yet—because Graalphone is only a non-working mock-up. The 4-in-1 PC/tablet/phone/digital camera is highly unlikely to become a real product, despite the confidence of boothside PR reps. Why would it have two operating systems? Why does a phone slide out the middle? Why have such a weird optical zoom? Why doesn’t the screen stay up in desktop mode? Who wants to type on a 5-inch physical keyboard? So many questions that will never be answered. Long live the Graalphone—at least its spirit.

Windows 10 is installed on 24.5% of devices -- but that's only half the story. "Apple's Mac share of personal computers worldwide fell to a five-year low in December," reports Computerworld, adding that Linux and Windows "both benefited, with increases of around a half percentage point during 2016." An anonymous reader quotes their report: According to web analytics vendor Net Applications, Apple's desktop and notebook operating system -- formerly OS X, now macOS -- powered just 6.1% of all personal computers last month, down from 7% a year ago and a peak of 9.6% as recently as April 2016... The Mac's 6.1% user share in December was the lowest mark recorded by Net Applications since August 2011, more than five years ago... In October, the company reported sales of 4.9 million Macs for the September quarter, a 14% year-over-year decline and the fourth straight quarterly downturn. Apple's sales slide during the past 12 months has been steeper than for the personal computer industry as a whole, according to industry researchers from IDC and Gartner, a 180-degree shift from the prior 30 or so quarters, when the Mac's growth rate repeatedly beat the business average. Apple's success through 2016 was "fueled by Microsoft's stumbles with Windows 8 and a race-to-the-bottom mentality among rival OEMs," according to the article, which also notes that the user share for Linux exceeded 2% in June, and reached 2.3% by November. apple mac business ← Related Links → Hackers Unlock NES Classic, Upload New Games Via USB Cable Windows 10 Gains 14% Desktop Market Share in 2016, Edge Continues to Struggle Silicon Valley Veteran On Apple: Company Has Become Sloppy, Missed Updates, Delayed Refreshes Apple App Store Developers Earned $20 Billion in 2016, Up 40 Percent Year Over Year Apple Cuts Tim Cook's Pay After 2016 Performance Falls Short Linux.com Announces The Best Linux Distros for 2017 Apple's Share of PC Users Drops To A Five-Year Low More | Reply Login Apple's Share of PC Users Drops To A Five-Year Low Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

Yes, Apple does update the firmware every so often, but fundamentally, the device hasn't seen any fundamental improvements. Even an el cheapo 1 drive NAS like a Synology DS115 gets significant new stuff every so often. The "old" Apple would have had a Time Capsule automatically copy data to a cloud provider (be it iCloud or another), and if a Mac needed a restore, it would first try to hit the TC, then would redirect to where the cloud data is stored. Apple could make some money in selling multi-drive Time Capsules with built in RAID and the ability to back themselves up to the cloud (client-side encrypted, with a Secure Enclave built into the NAS) for peace of mind. People would pay a premium for a dual-drive TC with RAID 1, a good filesystem, encryption, backups to iCloud, and the ability to install a new Mac from the LAN. However, Apple seems uninterested in this market segment. The MBP? A Dell XPS 13 is a better MBP than a 2016 13" MBP on the hardware front. The software front, it is obvious that macOS has the hind teat when it comes to improvements. Windows is winding up ahead of macOS just because Apple hasn't done anything to keep it going. While Apple might offer one or two new doodads, Microsoft adds functionality almost anywhere. The WSL is a nice thing, for example. Plus, Microsoft keeps upping its game on security. The Edge browser is supposedly going to be placed in its own Hyper-V VM, completely separating it from the OS. On the virtualization front, W10 comes with Hyper-V, while Apple has absolutely nada for this. The most significant thing in macOS is APFS... but that is mainly so iOS has better encryption, as opposed to be something designed for Macs only. I would hate to have a desktop Mac. The Mac Mini hasn't been touched in years, and the last refresh was a four core to two core downgrade. The Mac Pro, Apple's flagship machine? Will it be five years before it sees a refresh? For a flagship machine, Apple should rebrand the canister Mac Pro as a high end desktop box, and make a true E-7 Xeon Mac Pro in the traditional tower case with closed loop water cooling. The iPod Touch gets some items, every so often. Because of that, it does work well as an emergency authentication device, because apps work on it, although the platform is definitely not as popular as it used to be. However, with some work, it isn't dead yet. Apple could pitch it as a method of recovering access to websites and such should one lose their phone, especially with 2FA protected by a Secure Enclave chip. The iPhone and the iPad are the only two items that are "blessed" by Apple, and it is pretty obvious that they have this status.

They quickly fell in love with the intuitive interface (beats me how this is intuitive, but they thought so) and how "naturally" everything felt (personally, I felt it was all wrong). But it wasn't for me, it was for them, and for them, it worked perfectly. There also was never an issue with odd drivers or having to upgrade them, Apple did that for you. There was also never an issue with having to buy some additional reader for whatever esoteric memory medium your digital cam used, your Apple could read it. Out of the box. Without you having to install anything. Even the most cryptic format nobody heard about, your Apple would read it and seamlessly let you work with it, it organizes your files for you, it was the perfect computer for people who just wanted to do stuff without having to learn how to do it. Quite frankly, Apple's engineers apparently spent a lot of time employing people like my dad telling them what they want to do and they designed the software to "think" for the user. That was the key asset for Apple. And they threw that away. No, not with the software. That probably still works the way it did. But with the hardware. Again, one of the key selling points for Apple was that their machines could read anything you could possibly throw at them. And that is simply no longer the case. They can't even read USB out of the box anymore. Instead you are supposed to buy a lot of additional crap, various cables for various reasons that confuse and overwhelm people. Which one do I need? And I don't want to buy the wrong one, they're all quite expensive. Apple replaced total compatibility with absolute incompatibility.

It was all about that "halo effect", where the Mac was the control center for everything else, and everything had a symbiotic relationship with everything else Apple sold. (EG. You could be a Windows user and buy an iPod as your music player, and use it just fine. BUT, you'd eventually say, "Hey... Apple's iTunes software that manages this thing really runs better on the Mac than it does in Windows. Maybe I'll just go with a Mac in the future and use it with this?" Or you might be a Windows or even Linux user who bought an Apple Airport Extreme as your wi-fi router because it got high reviews. You *could* manage it with the Windows version of the management software, but you'd find it's easier to just set one up from an iPhone, where support is built right in.) Back then, it was commonplace for Jobs to remind people that low overall percentages of Mac sales compared to Windows didn't concern him. It was about selling gourmet food vs. McDonalds. If you have a premium product, you concentrate on catering to those who appreciate that ... not worrying about maximizing sales numbers. Today, it's very different. Apple under Tim Cook seems to believe iOS devices are the "future" as the traditional computer dies out, and MANY of the complaints Mac users have are direct results of this change in course. There are problems right now with PDFKit in OS X, where Apple suddenly rewrote the thing from the ground up in OS X Sierra without so much as informing developers. The reason? They wanted one with feature parity with the iOS version. This made Apple's own Preview software unsafe to use to edit PDF documents, because it causes embedded OCR layers to be stripped from them when you save them. Other applications like Mariner Paperless, which use Preview to display scanned documents in their database, crash as soon as you try to view a file in your collection. It's basically a trainwreck right now. I hear Apple is scrambling to fix a lot of this in the latest OS X beta, but this fiasco already caused many realtors to switch back to Windows because they rely so heavily on PDF as part of their daily workflow, If rumors I've heard can be believed, Apple doesn't even have much of a Mac OS X development team left anymore. The updates to it are supposedly being done by a team that's expected to spend part of their time doing iOS related work. I've been a big Mac proponent since the 2001 time-frame, but I'm finally reaching the point where my next computer won't be a Mac, unless there's a major change of course in the near future. As others have said, Apple has nothing for sale that I'd really want to buy. The new Macbook Pro 15" looks desirable at first glance. The touch-bar is a nice addition and it looks attractive in space gray color and all that. But in reality, it's the most expensive laptop Apple has ever sold (in a high spec configuration at least), while demanding more compromises to use it than have ever been expected of "Pro" users before. The lack of all ports except USB-C would be more acceptable if the USB-C standard was more prevalent. But putting it there today is doing it just to prove you're "cutting edge", while hampering real-world usage. And at that price? Why isn't a set of the dongle adapters included with it?? The Mag-Safe charging was a mistake to eliminate too. That's been a signature feature that made Mac laptops a step ahead of everyone else. Couldn't they at least do a USB-C variant of Mag-Safe?

This year we’re highlighting our favorite new products with the first-ever 9to5Mac Best of CES Awards. And the winners are… …harder to pick than you might imagine! Loads of new product announcements were made at CES 2017 including the first HomeKit security cameras and garage door openers, cameras with USB-C, and plenty of new aftermarket CarPlay receivers. Four days and 28+ miles walked later, we’ve narrowed it down to four new and upcoming products announced at CES 2017 that deserve your attention and 9to5Mac‘s first-ever Best of CES Award. Best CarPlay receiver: Alpine iLX-107 Alpine was one of the first companies to bring Apple’s CarPlay infotainment system to aftermarket head units, and now they’re promising the very first aftermarket CarPlay receiver with wireless CarPlay. Aftermarket head units are appealing because you can install them in the car you already own, and wireless CarPlay has been an iOS feature for well over a year but has only appeared in a very expensive BMW sedan. Alpine’s upcoming iLX-107 brings wireless CarPlay to the masses with an aftermarket head unit priced at $699 with availability as soon as February. As a driver who has used CarPlay since October 2014, I’m personally ecstatic over Alpine making wireless CarPlay accessible in a solution that costs under $1000. iLX-107 is also a decent display with a 7-inch capacitive touch screen. 9to5Mac got a quick hands-on with Alpine’s iLX-107 receiver with wireless CarPlay totally working, and we think this head unit will be extremely popular in 2017. Stay tuned for a hands-on video and a full review when iLX-107 hits the market next month. Best Mac accessory: Kanex GoPower USB-C battery for MacBook Most new peripherals for MacBooks at CES 2017 have been about retrofitting modern notebooks with legacy I/O, but Kanex’s GoPower USB-C Portable Battery for USB-C MacBook fully embraces the USB-C future that we now live in. GoPower USB-C packs in 15,000 mAh of battery which is rated to recharge the 12-inch MacBook up to two times on a single charge. GoPower USB-C features a USB-C port for recharging the battery itself, which is convenient since that’s the same port new MacBooks use, and a USB-C port offers power out to recharge MacBooks using the standard power cable. A single USB-A port is also included for juicing iPhones and iPads. Kanex even offers priority charging so you can charge your connected MacBook while connecting GoPower USB-C to a wall adapter. Apple’s 12-inch MacBook is ultra-portable which makes it the ultimate road warrior, and Kanex helps extend the road trip with GoPower USB-C for MacBooks. Best iPhone accessory: Flir One The ecosystem of iPhone accessories has expanded this week with cases that offer built-in headphone jacks and Lightning ports for iPhone 7 users, tiny MFi gaming controllers, and lots of connected gadgets. Our pick for the best iPhone accessory out of CES 2017 is the latest Flir One thermal imaging camera which is both better and cheaper than its predecessor. Flir’s third-generation Flir One has practical application in the real world like search and rescue efforts, spotting a bad A/C vent during a repair, and anything else where visualizing heat can be beneficial. Flir One packs this capability in a small iPhone attachment that can visualize temperatures ranging from -4°F to 248°F. Flir One is a unique iPhone solution that solves practical problems in the real world, plus it’s also a cool demo if you haven’t seen temperatures visualized. Best HomeKit accessory: CES 2017 has been a launching ground for a wide range of HomeKit accessories after a slow start initially. While we’re happy to see HomeKit become much more mainstream in new smart home devices, it’s Nanoleaf who has the most creative new HomeKit hardware unveiled at CES. Nanoleaf’s Music Visualization Module for Aurora Smart Light Panels is totally out-of-the-box for a HomeKit-connected accessory and we can’t wait for its launch this year. 9to5Mac recently went hands-on with Nanoleaf’s Aurora smart lighting system with HomeKit support, and Music Visualization Module will turn an already impressive product into a totally unique HomeKit lighting solution. Music Visualization Module will be an add-on accessory that you attach with a Linker just like additional Aurora light panels, and an embedded mic will enable Aurora smart lights to react to music as it’s played. Nanoleaf is also working with various music services and developers to add specific integrations. Special Music Visualization scenes will also be introduced that let you change how Aurora lights react to music as it’s played. Music Visualization Module is expected to be released in the third quarter of 2017 which should make Aurora a very compelling gift for the next holiday season. 9to5Mac will have an in-depth review of the new features as they become available.

By Maghan McDowell on January 7, 2017 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Kevin Plank, ceo, Under Armour. JOSHUA SCOTT LAS VEGAS — Under Armour is third in line to the athleticwear throne after Nike and Adidas, but in the race to be the leader, it’s competing with Apple and Samsung. “What if Apple or Samsung started making apparel and footwear? What would they do, and how do we beat them to it?” said company founder and chief executive officer Kevin Plank, who was making his case here in front of a room full of techies attending CES, the annual forward-looking conference that shows the next generation of gadgets. Plank shared highlights from the company’s history, starting with humble beginnings as a football player’s alternative to the classic cotton T-shirt. Plank said Under Armour belonged at the conference because “CES is about progress, about finding a better way, and that is the same philosophy we have been operating under for 20 years,” he said. “We have always been operating as a tech company.” Plank, who speaks in quick motivational sound bites that are reminiscent of Under Armour’s award-winning advertising campaigns, said his goal is to create products consumers didn’t know they needed, but that cause them to wonder how they ever lived without them. He made comparisons to the remote control and to smartphones, and introduced a number of new gadgets of his own. The first was the next generation of the company’s smart shoe, for which he brought out Michael Phelps to demonstrate its functionality. The sneaker gauges the wearer’s readiness to work out by measuring his or her performance after six jumps. The shoe signals with a green, yellow or red light, which allows the athlete to tailor a workout accordingly; after a night in Las Vegas, Phelps scored a yellow. Last year, Under Armour unveiled a running sneaker that automatically tracks and measures a workout — as Plank pointed out, a software-enabled shoe can be updated, just like a smartphone. He also introduced a line of sleepwear that aids in recovery and a corresponding sleep-tracking service called “Rest. Win. Repeat.” Under Armour created both with Tom Brady. Plank said he was as fired up about these new products as he was about the first T-shirt, in part because no one else was working in this space. Arianna Huffington joined him in introducing the products, calling sleep a non-negotiable performance enhancer. The sleep app is in addition to Under Armour’s family of apps, including workout tracker Map My Fitness and nutrition tracker My Fitness Pal, which help users quantify their life and provide the company with crucial data. Plank said that the company’s year-old Under Armour Record app had 194 million users, and that there were 2.6 billion workouts and activities logged in 2016. The My Fitness Pal and Map My Fitness acquisitions brought 300 engineers to Under Armour and Plank said the company is in the process of becoming digitized. Data is increasingly being seen as crucial for a company to react to a customer’s needs and Plank noted that 40 percent of Amazon’s sales are due to its recommendation engine. “Data is the new oil, and we are putting that concept at the center of the company.” He said he wanted Under Armour to do for fitness and wellness what Facebook has done for social media, what Amazon has done for Prime and what LinkedIn has done for business. “Consumer expectations for an athletic brand will change,” he said. “Under Armour is an athletic brand built on innovation.” You're missing something!

Recently, a Russian court blocked the Microsoft-owned LinkedIn service for breaching the country's data protection rules. According to The New York Times, Apple has confirmed that it was asked to remove its LinkedIn app in Russia about a month ago. "However, Google has not confirmed if it had removed LinkedIn in Russia but said that it adhered to Russian local laws," the report added. Meanwhile, LinkedIn responded that the company was "disappointed" with the decision by Russian regulators to block the service.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Pixel 2: What Google smartphones really need to mix it up with the competition Here are the top features Google Pixel 2 needs to succeed Sami Khan   January 7, 2017 19:57 IST Google PixelScreenshot from Google Play Store Google put an end to the Nexus-era last year by beginning the reign of its Pixel series. The Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones were lauded for their hardware, design and software, especially the deep AI integration. Read: Smartphones we simply cannot wait to see in 2017: iPhone 8, Samsung Galaxy X, OnePlus 4 Since Google has taken control of the manufacturing process of its Android smartphone line, there are a lot of expectations from the web giant. The new Pixel series did live up to the expectations of many, but the phones lacked some essentials to compete against the likes of Apple and Samsung. The year 2017 will be the year for many tech companies to launch their new flagships. Samsung, for instance, will begin the race with its Galaxy S8 around MWC 2017 next month, followed by several other OEMs such as LG, OnePlus and the rest. Apple will finally conclude the year on a high note with the most-anticipated launch of the iPhone 8 series. Amidst all this, Google will steal some limelight again this year with the successor of Pixel and Pixel XL, and there will be a lot of people waiting to see what Google brings to the table. First of all, Google will need to consider some serious upgrades to stay on par with its closest rivals in the premium smartphone race. Below are the upgrades worth considering for the Pixel 2.... Waterproofing is essential With Apple and Samsung offering water- and dust-proofing for their flagships, it is essential Google ups the ante this year with its Pixel 2 smartphones. The Pixel 2 is most likely to offer IPS67 certification, upgrading from IP58, which is only valid for splashes instead of a full dip. 2K display to match rivals Well, it was surprising to see Google offer a Full HD display on the Pixel while offering 2K resolution for its Pixel XL phone. We would like to see Google make 2K screens standard for the Pixel 2 regardless of the size as most companies are offering it in premium flagships, take Samsung Galaxy S7 series for example. Dual camera will iron out many pixels Samsung is still not offering a dual camera setup, but it is likely to bring its best game this year. Apple has already made an example of its iPhone 7 Plus. Now it is up to Google to match its rivals. We strongly hope the Pixel 2 will feature dual camera with advanced imaging capabilities like AR. VR gaming will be a thing in 2017 Thanks to Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, VR gaming on flagship phones will be a lot easier. Google has an advantage over its rivals with its Daydream View, which offers advanced VR capabilities. We hope to see a second-gen Daydream View headset launch alongside Pixel 2, along with some compatible games this year. Hardware bump To round it off, Google will need a stronger spec-sheet. Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 CPU, 6GB RAM (minimum) and a better optimised battery will certainly be a welcome move by Google.

Russia requires LinkedIn be removed from Google, Apple app stores - Irish Sun Issue 016/15 Irish Sun        http://www.irishsun.com   Ireland News Breaking International News Breaking Business News Europe Sports News Dublin News Economics News Belfast News Breaking Internet News Web Site Development News Healthcare News Ireland News Utilities News Russia requires LinkedIn be removed from Google, Apple app stores PanArmenian.Net Saturday 7th January, 2017 PanARMENIAN.Net - Smartphone users in Russia can no longer download the LinkedIn app on iPhone or Android devices, following a similar move in China to block The New York Times app on iPhones. The demand by Russian authorities to remove LinkedIn in Apple and Google app stores comes weeks after a court blocked the professional networking service for flouting local laws that require internet firms to store data on Russian citizens within the nation's borders, The New York Times reports. The action puts Apple and Google in a difficult position. The companies are strong proponents of open internet policies and free speech but are now being asked to be agents for governments that censor its citizens. When LinkedIn's website was blocked, the apps stopped functioning properly. Removing them from the Google Play store and Apple's App Store may not have cut off access to content, but it sent a signal that countries can push the tech giants to remove the apps. Direct blocking of websites has been done by China, Russia, Turkey and several other nations for years, usually through their state-run internet service providers. But civil rights groups say the pressure authoritarian governments are now placing on Apple and Google is a new wrinkle. "Apps are the new choke point of free expression," said Rebecca MacKinnon, who leads a project on open internet tracking at New America. Increasingly, United States tech companies are complying with those demands. In the early 2000s, American internet firms strongly pushed back on demands by China to comply with censorship rules within the country's internet controls, known as the Great Firewall. Recently, Facebook has been working on a censorship tool to be able to access China, where it is currently blocked along with Twitter and Google. LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, said it was "disappointed" with the decision by Russian regulators to block the service, which the company confirmed was extended to apps in Russian Apple and Google Play stores. "It denies access to our members in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses," said Nicole Leverich, a spokeswoman for LinkedIn. Apple confirmed it was asked to remove its LinkedIn app in Russia about a month ago. It has also confirmed it was asked by China to block The New York Times app, but declined to comment further on both events. Google would not confirm it has removed LinkedIn in Russia but said it adheres to local laws in the countries in which it operates. More nations have enforced their own internet laws in recent years. Turkey intermittently blocks social media, such as during the attempted government coup last summer. It has also forced YouTube to remove content it considers disparaging of its modern-day founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. European nations have also drawn up their own privacy laws and in 2014 a court declared its citizens could demand internet companies like Google unlink information about users upon request. Tech companies and civil rights advocates warn that the increasing push by nations to create their own internet rules will Balkanize the internet and potentially lead to privacy violations and the stifling of political dissent. Other countries, however, criticize Silicon Valley and the United States government for setting the norms and rules for the internet. "Internet free speech and internet freedom are increasingly under attack all over the globe, and not just from authoritarian regimes," said Robert M. McDowell, a former member of the Federal Communications Commission and partner at Cooley law firm. "It appears to be a one-way ratchet with speech control getting tighter." LinkedIn has several million users in Russia, it said. In November, a Russian court ruled that the professional networking site broke local laws that require foreign internet firms to keep their servers holding information on Russian accounts within the nation. Most American internet companies in Russia operate in violation of the law, but without explanation, Russian regulators at a body known as Roskomnadzor took the rare step of enforcing its rules. The Russian regulators could not be immediately reached for comment. The action came at a tense moment in Russian-United States relations related to cyber affairs. Russia has been accused of hacking into American accounts, including the Democratic National Committee, to try to influence the presidential election. American intelligence officials concluded in a declassified report released on Friday that the president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, ordered the campaign.

Featured Story U2 tickets selling for whopping 900 euros each DUBLIN, Ireland - With epic rock band, U2 set to perform at a concert in Croke Park in July this year - a flurry of activity has been witnessed around ticket sales already.  Tickets are set to go on sale officially from tomorrow - however, a day before the official sales begin, tickets to watch the band perform live are already being sold and for nothing less than a whopping 900 euros each.  According to reports, fans that subscribed to the band’s official website were granted access to a pre-sale ticket portal last week and industry sources revealed that diehard fans with access to these tickets have chosen to sell them for a profit.  A set of tickets are said to have become available on official and black market websites since last week.  Tickets available currently on websites like Seatwave and Viagogo are being sold at prices higher than face value.  Officially, tickets for the Lower Davin Stand and pitch area of Croke Park have been priced at 76 euros, along with an extra charge of 3.30 euros for agent fees. Meanwhile, those in other parts of the Cusack and Hogan stands carry a value between 110 euros to 186 euros. But on these websites, the prices have been jacked up.   As of Sunday night, Seatwave, that is run by Ticketmaster, had advertised for 650 tickets that were available for sale.  Reports pointed ut that a pair of tickets was sold at 2,070 euros over the weekend and was for the standing section. It included extra charges and was priced at 13 times above face value.  A spokesperson for Ticketmaster defended the sale in a statement that said that Seatwave prices were set by the person selling the tickets and not the company. The spokesperson said, “The thing about Seatwave is that it is a safe and secure market so tickets would be genuine. The ticket prices are set by the seller, which in this instance is not Ticketmaster, but that price may not necessarily be secured by the seller. Ticketmaster is just facilitating the sale."

James Martin/CNET Mobile by Shara Tibken January 7, 2017 5:00 AM PST @sharatibken Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS Apple unveiled the first iPhone on Jan. 9, 2007. Photo by James Martin/CNET Ten years ago, Nokia was the world's largest phone maker. Microsoft was gearing up to launch Windows Vista. And the best new products at CES included a wireless TV and an MP3 player that streamed internet radio. Then, on Jan. 9, 2007, Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveiled a device that went on to change the world -- a $499 iPhone that came with 4GB of storage. It was a mobile phone, a music player and an Internet device. "iPhone is a revolutionary and magical product that is literally five years ahead of any other mobile phone," Jobs said at the time. Since then, Apple has sold more than 1.2 billion iPhones and has become the most profitable public company in the world. Copycat phones from companies like Samsung, HTC, Motorola and Xiaomi proliferated across the globe, and now even people in places without steady electricity have smartphones. "It's difficult to understate [the iPhone's] impact," Reticle Research analyst Ross Rubin said. "The ripples it has created affect wide swaths of our lives." Here are some ways the iPhone has changed the way we live: 1. We're always on It used to be you'd fire up your computer, wait for your Wi-Fi to connect (or your dialup connection, if we're going wayyy back) and open Internet Explorer, Safari or some other web browser. Now you're connected to the internet all the time. If you're not on Wi-Fi, you're linked through your cellular network. It's not just inescapable connectivity that the iPhone helped bring about. It's also how we actually access the internet. The iPhone made mobile web browsing useful for the first time. Every other mobile web browser before that was painful, in the words of CNET's Kent German. Soon came a flood of apps, which removed the need to open a web browser at all. 2. Tablets, watches and headphones, oh my Multiple devices are either tied to the iPhone or exist because the phone was created. There's the iPad, essentially a larger iPhone you use at home. And there's the Apple Watch, which is tethered to the iPhone. 18 The iPhone and the gadgets it laid to rest Then there are all the accessories spurred by the popularity of the iPhone, like phone cases; Bluetooth speakers and headphones; and charging docks. ABI Research estimates that revenue in the global mobile accessories market will top $110 billion in 2021. "Given users' attachment to their smartphones and their wants and needs to personalize and protect them, the aftermarket mobile accessories market is showing no signs of slowing down," ABI analyst Marina Lu said. 3. The key to appiness You may not remember this now, but Apple's first iPhone didn't have such a thing as third-party apps or the App Store. That changed in July 2008, when Apple introduced the iPhone 3G and its iPhone 2.0 software. The App Store is what made the iPhone a must-have device. There are now more than 2 million apps in the App Store, with essentially every company making one or more apps. And the iPhone and App Store have spawned industries that couldn't exist without smartphones. There'd be no Uber or Lyft to shuttle us from place to place, for instance, or Instagram or Snapchat for sharing our photos. What it was like when the first iPhone launched Ten years ago, Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone at Macworld. What was it like to see the announcement live and to own an original iPhone? We take a walk down memory lane to 2007. 4:15 Close Drag 4. Everyone's a shutterbug Sure, we had cameras on our phones before the iPhone. But the Apple gadget's combination of easy internet access and apps like Instagram inspired people's inner photographer. As a result, lugging around an actual camera became redundant. "We as a species take more pictures than we ever had in the past by an order of magnitude," Current Analysis analyst Avi Greengart said. 5. Livin' live The phone's camera also means you have a portable camcorder (remember those?) at your fingertips. And on top of that, the phone's connection lets you broadcast video immediately. That could mean talking to your family members on the other side of the country or shooting a cat video for YouTube. Or, thanks to services like Facebook Live or Periscope, the technology can be used for filming police brutality or instantly reporting something you've seen. On the flip side, having these smart devices on us at all times lets law enforcement and corporations (like the makers of those apps on your phone) track us. Apple has taken a strong stance on privacy, but security remains a big concern for users. 6. Putting the digits in digital Touchscreens once were rare. Now babies are swiping at TVs and wondering why the screen doesn't change. Interactive screens are in virtually everything, even refrigerators. When Jobs introduced the iPhone, he said, "We are all born with the ultimate pointing device -- our fingers -- and iPhone uses them to create the most revolutionary user interface since the mouse." He was more right than he could imagine. The appeal of a touchscreen phone forced Microsoft to embrace touch in its software and get its hardware partners to make touchscreen phones, tablets and computers. It's almost surprising to see a device today without a touchscreen (though Apple maintains it won't be putting touchscreens in its Mac computers). 7. You are here The introduction of mapping on the iPhone meant you no longer had to feel like an embarrassed tourist in a new city, clutching a giant paper map on the street corner. Google Maps and Apple Maps are two of the most-used apps on the iPhone, and they've steadily added features over the years, like public transit directions. The first iPhone had only 4GB of storage. Photo by James Martin/CNET 8. Gaming goes to the next level The iPhone reinvented the idea of mobile gaming. Apps like Angry Birds, that anyone could play using their fingers on the touchscreen, became hugely popular, and payment models changed. Many games are now free to play -- instead of charging a sales price, developers came up with the idea of in-app purchases, which let you pay for new levels and features as you go. Seven of the top 10 grossing iPhone apps are games, like Pokemon Go, according to market tracker App Annie. 9. Cash ain't king Apple wasn't the first company to talk about mobile payments, but it did make even your grandma aware of the technology, which lets you use your phone to purchase things. Goodbye, cash. Hello, iPhone. The iPhone's Wallet app also can store retail coupons, reward cards, and passes for flights and movies, all in one place. Cash isn't dead yet -- there still are many places that don't take mobile payments -- but using your phone at the checkout stand is more common than ever. 10. But wait -- there's more There's no way to sum up all that the iPhone did in just 10 points. So here's a grab bag of additional stuff. Apple basically killed Adobe Flash on mobile devices and made endless scrolling a very good thing. You never have to carry a calculator or flashlight anymore, and visual voicemail lets you easily skip forward in a meandering message. Podcasts mean you don't have to listen to the radio in real time -- and they give you new options, such as the hit show "Serial." Social media has also shifted heavily to mobile devices from desktop computers, letting people feel connected to friends at all times. Facebook said that in its most recent quarter, roughly 84 percent of its $6.82 billion in ad revenue came from mobile ads. At the same time, the iPhone has been linked to the rise in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and short attention spans in kids. Governments use mobile devices to spy on their citizens, and consumers give up a lot of personal information in exchange for services like Uber rides. But even with the negatives, don't try to take someone's iPhone away. Please leave some of your thoughts in the comments section on how the iPhone has changed the way you live.

It’s not. It’s cool though, AirBar has you covered — at least if you’re a MacBook Air user. What is it? “The most awesome stage” Last year, Facebook's VP of Design thought the TNW Conference main stage was the best she'd ever been on. FIND OUT WHY AirBar is a tiny strip that plugs into the USB port on your PC (now including the MacBook Air) and turns non-touch displays into touch-friendly devices. To accomplish this, the plug-in device uses magnets to attach to the bottom of your screen and emit an invisible light field over the monitor. This light field measures finger position to act as a sort of hacked touchscreen and gesture control center for non-touch friendly devices. It feels natural, and there wasn’t any discernible lag in the demo model at CES. According to AirBar Senior Vice President Remo Behdasht: We believe the community of devoted MacBook Air users will welcome this new prod- uct, as AirBar for MacBook Air will surely enhance the user-experience of an already great product. Our goal for AirBar continues to be expanding its application to more devices, across even more markets. Why does it matter? These days, computing power isn’t progressing as fast as it used to, and users are holding on to older laptops longer than ever before. If moving to a touchscreen device is your only reason for upgrading, AirBar makes a lot more sense. When is it coming? It’s here. AirBar for Windows has been around since the beginning of last month, while the MacBook Air version was just announced prior to CES. Both are available to order on the Neonode website for $69. Just allow four to five weeks for shipping. For more CES 2017 news from TNW, check out our event page here, and follow us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat.

This year's CE has been about par for the course – dull keynotes, some interesting gadgets and a hell of a lot of dross. We've taken a look at some of these to save you traveling to the fetid hell that is Las Vegas. The good AirBar: One of the most consistent complaints Apple fans have had about the new MacBooks (besides the poor spec, high price, and lack of upgradability) is that they have no touchscreens. Now, however, Apple and PC owners can add touchscreen capabilities with AirBar, a nifty little device that sits under a laptop screen and scans upwards for finger gestures. It's a cheap and cheerful way of adding a function many people want. There is a hitch – it uses USB 2.0, so Apple fans will still have to get a converter to USB Type-C for the latest MacBook line. But it's a cunning invention that is unobtrusive and very useful. Samsung Chromebook Plus: With Chromebooks gaining ground slowly but steadily, Samsung has unveiled a couple of new models, but it's the Plus that really caught our eye. It's got a lot of power under the hood, a 12.3-inch touchscreen HD display, supports stylus use, and is double-jointed so that it can pass as a tablet. It can also run Android apps within the Chrome OS, albeit sometimes with limited functionality. But if you're a Chromebook fan it's well worth a look. Alexa on Smartphones: Amazon's personal assistant Alexa might only be sitting in the Echo at the moment, but that will change. Huawei was the first smartphone manufacturer to build Alexa into a smartphone with its Mate 9, but it won't be the last. The technology will be going up against Siri on iOS and Google's Assistant, and its success is by no means certain. But enough people seem to like Alexa and more competition in this sphere is always welcome. Alexa on mobile may be another Fire-like failure, but Amazon's making a serious play and may pull off popularity. Willow breast pump: At first sight this was heading for the bad category – tech bros telling women how to manage their feeding – but after having talked to some mothers, it looks like rather a good idea. Conventional breast pumps are clumsy and cumbersome devices. The Willow is quiet, can be worn while doing other things, and expresses a baby's nutrition without inconveniencing the mother. The firm will make a lot of money from the consumables (plastic milk bags and sterile tubes), but the idea is a good one and should prove valuable. The Bad Autonomous cars: Various motor manufacturers have been showing off their autonomous vehicles and the results have been very mixed. Faraday unveiled its electric supercar, and we're a tad cynical about the whole thing. It's likely to have the lifespan of a snowflake in a blast furnace. Other manufacturers will probably have longer lifespans, but it's still very early days for the self-driving car. Certain functions have been added but we're a long way from never having to drive the commute, and that's assuming legal and liability issues can be worked out. Acer Predator 21X: OK, we all know gamers pay over the odds for a good gaming laptop, but Acer is asking $9,000 for the 21X and that's more than a touch too much. Yes it has a curved screen, and plenty of grunt under the hood. But bring one of these to a gaming convention and everyone's going to be wondering who has more money than sense – and it won’t be hard to spot the suspects. Yes, gamers spend money. But come on Acer, don't take the piss. Artificial intelligence: It seems as though everyone has a product claiming to have AI built in – but that's not how it works. It's possible to get an intelligent system if you have the processing power and data-handling capabilities, but too many people at CES seem to think that putting a low level of predictive software in something makes it the equivalent of HAL. We've seen people claiming to have AI smartwatches, for goodness sake. If the IT industry wants to avoid AI becoming nothing more than a buzzword, it needs to pull itself together and stop over-egging the pudding. VR/AR: We had hoped to see some real advances on the virtual and augmented reality front, but there was precious little to be seen. Lenovo had a lowish-cost headset (pictured), but it's very much a me-too device along the lines of Oculus or HTC. There was little added in here to really excite users. There were plenty of startups showing off prototype VR/AR devices but it's unlikely that many of them will see the light of day in a commercial setting. It seems we'll have to wait a little longer for a bold, new, virtual future.

David Paul Morris/Bloomberg   Karen Turner The Washington Post     Apple rang in the New Year with some good news: the first day of 2017 marked the highest daily sales ever for App Stores. The company took in $240 million from app purchases on Jan. 1 through its app platform App Store, according to a news release published Thursday. That's after a year of record-breaking subscriptions and downloads, "generating over $20 billion for developers," the company said. Apple's App Store got about half of the downloads of its main competitor Google Play in 2016, yet it brought in twice the revenue in the third quarter, according to app analytics firm App Annie. The numbers were similar for the rest of 2016. Apple also saw an uptick in subscription billings, a 74 percent increase from last year that came in at $2.7 billion total. One reason might be the relative affluence of Apple iPhone owners compared to Android users given the higher price of their devices, which typically correlates with higher spending, said Danielle Levitas, senior vice president of research at App Annie. "I think the most surprising thing is just how strong Apple's revenue lead is and how it continues to beat the market's growth," Levitas said. She added that the kinds of apps published on the platform range from games to e-commerce, entertainment, and banking, meaning that a wide breadth of companies are gaining exposure. "It's not just about app store revenue but rather increased engagement with apps in terms of time spent." Sales in China, Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom brought in the most revenue for the App Store. Downloads from Chinese users in particular boomed, increasing by 90 percent from last year, according to Apple. That's despite slowing device sales, MarketWatch reported. Pokémon Go was the most downloaded app last year. Other popular downloads included Super Mario Run as well as subscription based apps such as Netflix and HBO Go. Last year's introduction of iMessage apps, directly integrated into iOS's messaging platform to allow users to send stickers and play games via chat, accounted for 21,000 new apps on App Store. "The fact that Apple continues to grow its installed base and gain dollars per user is very impressive," said Levitas.

However, the look of the iPhone could've been very different based on new mock-up images posted by Apple insider Sonny Dickson. They show an on-screen clickwheel taking up the lower half of the screen, with an 'Acorn OS' interface on top. Don't forget that the iPod was a revolutionary product long before the iPhone came along, and the audio player's success was largely down to that intuitive clickwheel that made browsing through thousands of songs a breeze. It would seem the same look was under serious consideration for Apple's first smartphone. It's not clear whether the iPhone clickwheel would've been a software one, as shown here - Apple may have been planning to use a physical wheel, as on the iPod, when it came to actually manufacturing units. "Not much else is known about the device, apart from the fact that it differs heavily from the iPhone we know today, and that very few units running 'Acorn OS' exist, with most of them likely being destroyed by Apple, a company in which there is a specific job role in relation to the destruction of prototypes," writes Dickson. He points to an old patent filed in 2006 as evidence of the prototype's authenticity. While most would say Apple made the right choice with the full-screen OS that it eventually went with, it's interesting to see the different ideas that were being explored at the time the very first iPhone went on sale. iPhone through the ages: just how much has it changed?

Steve Dent, @stevetdent 01.07.17 in AV Comments 482 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Gabe Ginsberg/Getty Images Remember in early 2013 when Apple hit 25 billion iTune song downloads? And Tim Cook said it took Sony 30 years to sell 220,000 Walkmans? Well, fast-forward just under four years, and Nielsen has revealed that Americans streamed 431 billion songs in 2016 alone, surpassing total digital sales of songs and albums for the first time in history. "The landscape is evolving even more quickly than we have seen with other format shifts," said Nielsen SVP David Bakula. In fact, folks in the US streamed more songs per day (1.2 billion) than the 734 million that were downloaded during the entire year, the ratings company said. As with similar increases in the UK, streaming increased 76 percent from last year, a figure that helped the music industry grow a solid three percent over 2015. Major streaming sites, especially Spotify and Apple Music, also saw dramatic subscriber boosts. The music industry continues to grow at a healthy rate, and 2016 showed us that the landscape is evolving even more quickly than we have seen with other format shifts. Six songs alone, including Desiigner's "Panda" and Rihanna's "Work," accounted for 500 million total on-demand streams. Drake led everyone by a long way, however, with 5.4 billion total streams, and also sold the most digital songs and albums. A big part of the increase is because of Hip-hop and R&B, genres that accounted for 22 percent of music consumption, but a disproportionate 28 percent of streams. Rounding out the good news, physical album sales also increased as a share of total album sales for the first time in a decade, and vinyl sales hit 13 million -- the most since 1991, the year Nirvana's Nevermind came out. The latter stats are the most surprising, as you'd expect physical album sales to be on a strong downward curve, and that's clearly not the case. Despite warnings from the RIAA, it seems that having a better alternative to piracy has not only increased industry profits, but passion for music overall.

Mr. Cook still did extremely well, with a compensation package valued at $8.7-M for Apple’s FY that ended on 24 September  according to a regulatory filing made Friday. But the amount was down from nearly $10.3-M in the prior FY. The Cupertino, California, company cited a downturn in Apple’s revenue and operating profit as the Key reason it cut the pay for Mr. Cook and its other top Apple executives. Apple’s revenue dropped 8% to $216-B, while its operating profit declined 16% to $60-B. That was because it sold fewer iPhones for the 1st time since the gadget came out in Y 2007. It also marked the 1st time that Apple’s annual revenue decreased since Y 2001, which was just before the company’s late co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the iPod, the gadget that set the stage for the iPhone and iPad. The iPhone set off a revolution in mobile computing and became Apple’s biggest moneymaker, even as a wide range of device makers released competing products primarily running on Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) free Android software. Most of the world’s smartphones are powered by Android, but the iPhone is still a popular high-priced status device. The world’s consumers are holding on to their existing iPhones for longer periods instead of upgrading to a newer model every year or 2 raising investor concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone, a relentless worry that has been aggravated by the company’s inability to introduce another breakthrough product since Jobs’ death in Y 2011. Mr. Cook, Jobs’ anointed successor, had hoped Apple would have another huge hit with his smartwatch unveiled in Y 2014, but that device has not caught on. The company’s ‘s regulatory filing revealed that the company was bracing for a sales drop last year, thought not as steep as what actually happened. The compensation committee for the firms Board of Directors had established a revenue goal of $224-B for last year, which would have been a 4% decline from the previous year. The company expected sales to rebound during the Holiday shopping season on hopes that consumers would be snapping up its latest iPhones, the 7 and 7 Plus. Apple will release its quarterly results that include the Christmas Holidays later this month. I am sticking with my call that Tim Cook will go soon.

Credit: Thinkstock More like this Both Apple and Microsoft take tumble in Gartner's latest device forecast PC shipments predicted to return to growth in 2018 after six-year skid Windows comes up third in OS clash two years early Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana Apple will steal a march on Microsoft this year when for the first time this century shipments of devices powered by its operating systems outnumber those running Windows, research firm Gartner said today. In 2017, Apple's combination of iOS and macOS -- the former on iPhones and iPads, the latter on Macs -- will take second place from Windows on the devices shipped during the year. The gap between the two will widen in 2018 and 2019, with Apple ahead of Microsoft both years. According to Gartner, which provided Computerworld with its latest device shipment forecast broken out by operating system, in 2016 Windows powered about 260 million devices of the 2.3 billion shipped during the year. Windows accounted for approximately 11.2% of the total devices, which overwhelmingly ran Google's Android. Meanwhile, iOS and macOS -- the latter was formerly dubbed OS X -- sank to 248 million devices in 2016, a 10% drop from the year prior. The cause: Slackened sales of the iPhone, Apple's dominant device and biggest money maker. Gartner predicted that iOS + macOS, unlike Windows, will recover in 2017. Apple's OSes will climb 8% to 268 million this year, add 3% in 2018 to reach 276 million, then increase another 3% in 2019, with that year's device shipment forecast at 285 million. Windows will dip this year, then stagnate for the following two years. Microsoft's operating system will power about 252 million devices shipped in 2017 -- the bulk of them personal computers -- for a year-over-year decline of 3%. Windows will account for 253 million devices in 2018 (for a near-zero growth rate) and 257 million devices in 2019 (an annual growth rate of 1.8%). The gap between Microsoft and Apple -- 12 million last year, with Microsoft atop -- will widen to 27 million by 2019, advantage Apple. Gartner's forecast was another gloomy report on almost every device category, with shipments flat this year compared to last and growth not projected until 2018. "The global devices market is stagnating," said Gartner analyst Ranjit Atwal in a statement Wednesday. Mobile phone shipments are growing only in emerging markets in the Asia and Pacific markets, Atwal added, and noted that, "The PC market is just reaching the bottom of its decline." The PC industry's troubles have affected Microsoft most of all; Windows is almost entirely dependent on PC shipments, which have been stuck in a protracted slump. Future shipments were further hit when Microsoft walked away from the smartphone business last year. Gartner pegged total shipments of PC-like devices at 268 million for 2016, a 7% contraction from the year before, and contrary to an October forecast, now says shipments would again decline in 2017, dropping 0.7% to 266 million. Circumstances will improve only marginally in the two years following, as shipments rise to 272 million in 2018 and 278 million in 2019. The new normal is a sub-300 million market. PCs will not disappear -- something some pundits fretted about as the sales and shipment downturn extended past earlier records -- but the business has been hard hit: In 2012, for instance, more than 350 million PC-like devices shipped globally. Gartner is still betting that a PC replacement cycle will boost shipments, even if only slightly. But this week's forecast -- unlike the one in October -- predicted a delayed growth. In October, Gartner had said the PC business would claw its way back into the black in 2017; this month's prognosis is that growth won't occur until 2018. Most analysts have essentially written off growth in the consumer portion of the PC market; instead, they expect that any gains will come from commercial customers, who still rely on personal computers, as they try to transition from Windows 7 to the newer Windows 10 before Microsoft retires the former in three years. Computerworld (Data: Gartner) Microsoft's decades-long operating system supremacy over Apple will end in 2017, according to Gartner Research, as iOS and macOS power more devices shipped than does Windows.

Society Economy Sport Arts & Showbiz Overview    News    Articles    Interviews  Calendar Invalid query Russia requires LinkedIn be removed from Google, Apple app stores January 7, 2017 - 15:04 AMT PanARMENIAN.Net - Smartphone users in Russia can no longer download the LinkedIn app on iPhone or Android devices, following a similar move in China to block The New York Times app on iPhones. The demand by Russian authorities to remove LinkedIn in Apple and Google app stores comes weeks after a court blocked the professional networking service for flouting local laws that require internet firms to store data on Russian citizens within the nation’s borders, The New York Times reports. The action puts Apple and Google in a difficult position. The companies are strong proponents of open internet policies and free speech but are now being asked to be agents for governments that censor its citizens. When LinkedIn’s website was blocked, the apps stopped functioning properly. Removing them from the Google Play store and Apple’s App Store may not have cut off access to content, but it sent a signal that countries can push the tech giants to remove the apps. Direct blocking of websites has been done by China, Russia, Turkey and several other nations for years, usually through their state-run internet service providers. But civil rights groups say the pressure authoritarian governments are now placing on Apple and Google is a new wrinkle. “Apps are the new choke point of free expression,” said Rebecca MacKinnon, who leads a project on open internet tracking at New America. Increasingly, United States tech companies are complying with those demands. In the early 2000s, American internet firms strongly pushed back on demands by China to comply with censorship rules within the country’s internet controls, known as the Great Firewall. Recently, Facebook has been working on a censorship tool to be able to access China, where it is currently blocked along with Twitter and Google. LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, said it was “disappointed” with the decision by Russian regulators to block the service, which the company confirmed was extended to apps in Russian Apple and Google Play stores. “It denies access to our members in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses,” said Nicole Leverich, a spokeswoman for LinkedIn. Apple confirmed it was asked to remove its LinkedIn app in Russia about a month ago. It has also confirmed it was asked by China to block The New York Times app, but declined to comment further on both events. Google would not confirm it has removed LinkedIn in Russia but said it adheres to local laws in the countries in which it operates. More nations have enforced their own internet laws in recent years. Turkey intermittently blocks social media, such as during the attempted government coup last summer. It has also forced YouTube to remove content it considers disparaging of its modern-day founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. European nations have also drawn up their own privacy laws and in 2014 a court declared its citizens could demand internet companies like Google unlink information about users upon request. Tech companies and civil rights advocates warn that the increasing push by nations to create their own internet rules will Balkanize the internet and potentially lead to privacy violations and the stifling of political dissent. Other countries, however, criticize Silicon Valley and the United States government for setting the norms and rules for the internet. “Internet free speech and internet freedom are increasingly under attack all over the globe, and not just from authoritarian regimes,” said Robert M. McDowell, a former member of the Federal Communications Commission and partner at Cooley law firm. “It appears to be a one-way ratchet with speech control getting tighter.” LinkedIn has several million users in Russia, it said. In November, a Russian court ruled that the professional networking site broke local laws that require foreign internet firms to keep their servers holding information on Russian accounts within the nation. Most American internet companies in Russia operate in violation of the law, but without explanation, Russian regulators at a body known as Roskomnadzor took the rare step of enforcing its rules. The Russian regulators could not be immediately reached for comment. The action came at a tense moment in Russian-United States relations related to cyber affairs. Russia has been accused of hacking into American accounts, including the Democratic National Committee, to try to influence the presidential election. American intelligence officials concluded in a declassified report released on Friday that the president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, ordered the campaign. Related links: The New York Times.

But with Elgato's amusing new W3 stand, instead of a tiny alarm clock, your Apple Watch becomes a miniature replica of the original Macintosh computer on your bedside table. Made of soft silicone so it won't scratch or mar either version of the Apple Watch, the W3 stand features a slot to hold the wearable on its side, and a cable pass-through for the induction charging dock, which you'll need to provide. For just $US14 ($19), available in black or white, it's a fun accessory, particularly for anyone who eats, sleeps and breathes everything Apple-related. But if Apple allowed for third-party watch faces on its wearable, this tiny Macintosh could even be made to look like it was running an equally tiny version of MacOS. If there was ever a good reason for Apple to implement that feature, this is it. [Elgato via Cult of Mac] We're on the ground at CES 2017 in Las Vegas!

A research firm has teased such possibility. The well-known research firm IHS has revealed that Apple will use amorphous silicon (a-Si) material for MacBook Pro display only till the end of first quarter. In the mid of 2017, Apple will start receiving IGZO panels from Samsung and Sharp. IGZO panels can add more value to MacBook Pro 2017. It has more electron mobility than the amorphous silicon (a-Si) material. IGZO will reduce the power consumption and increase the pixel density. IGZO will also support touch sensitivity. DisplayMate president Raymond Soneira has said that IGZO will help create higher brightness on display.  “Sometimes IGZO is simply referred to as Metal Oxide. The higher the PPI and the wider the Color Gamut (like DCI-P3 for the new MacBook Pro) the greater the benefits of IGZO over a-Si, particularly for LCDs,”  Soneira said. But IGZO material is very costly. So, it is not used for all products. LG’s OLED TVs are having  IGZO material, according to MacRumors. IGZO display was seen on Apple’s iPad Air Original. This display reduced the power consumption and also made iPad Air a thin device.   Also Read: Apple Macbook Pro 2016 Is First Macbook Not to Get Recommended by Consumer Reports Apple MacBook Pro 2017 Features Apple is not likely to consider all the hardware features of MacBook Pro 2016 for the upcoming MacBook Pro. According to Forbes, 2017 will be the year of Kaby Lake processors. Intel has launched its seventh-generation Kaby Lake  Core processors . In 2016, Apple’s MacBook series did not arrive with any major hardware update. All the laptops had  Intel’s sixth-generation Core processors. So, there is a big possibility of Apple also preferring Kaby Lake processors. Apple’s rival Microsoft is choosing Kaby Lake processors for its upcoming Microsoft Surface Pro 5. MacBook Pro 2017 Launch The latest offer on MacBook Pro existing model is also teasing the possibility of MacBook Pro 2017 launch. Apple authorized reseller Adorama is now selling  13-inch MacBook Pro model $1,399.00. It means a $200 price cut on the original price tag, according to AppleInsider.

Most wearables are worn on the wrist, but not so with the Bragi Dash. Touted as the world’s first hearable – it looks like a pair of wireless headphones – the Dash promises to track your activity just like a Fitbit or Jawbone. Of course, it works as a pair of headphones too, streaming music wirelessly from your phone via Bluetooth. And if you're not keen on carrying your phone with you while you work out, then the Dash offers 4GB of onboard storage – simply load it up with playlists and get moving. The device is also capable of providing audio feedback on your performance, with a slightly robotic female voice reading out your stats as you go. But should it be your next workout buddy? Let’s find out. Bragi Dash – Design and Setup First impressions are very good. The headphones come in a lush fold-out box; the kind of "everything fits" package that you'd expect from Apple rather than a start-up launching its second device. Considering they’re capable of fitness tracking, storing thousands of songs, and offer Bluetooth functionality, the Dash earbuds aren’t particularly bulky. They’re only a little bigger than a standard earbud, and don’t feature the unsightly "stalk" that make Apple’s AirPods look rather divisive in the looks department. They’re smaller than the Sony Smart B-Trainer, but the Dash offers one advantage – they’re truly wireless; the Sony pair have a cable connecting the headphones to each other. The Jabra Elite Sport are a more comparable truly wireless pair, and of a similar size. That means all communication between the headphones is wireless. As we’ll see, this is both the Dash’s biggest asset and its biggest weakness. They’re comfortable to wear, thanks to the three sets of "fit sleeves" of various sizes that come bundled with the hearables. These fit over the earpiece, for a snug fit into your ear cavity. Once in, they act as noise-isolating headphones, minimising background noise. You can also switch on the noise cancellation to further block out unwanted sounds. To control them, you tap or swipe the headphones; the left one controls the fitness tracking, while the right handles music playback. Press and hold the left one to enter the activity menu, then tap to select an activity. Then it’s a case of tapping to start said activity. With no screen to see, it can be a little confusing at first, but you'll soon get the hang of it. The earbuds make trilling noises to let you know your presses have registered. It’s a bold approach to a UI, with no physical buttons or screen. Sadly, however, the technology isn't quite there yet. Too often my presses didn’t register, and I was left repeatedly tapping the earpieces. Worse still, halfway through my testing, the right earpiece decided to stop playing music altogether. It didn’t fail completely – I could still adjust the volume of the audio feedback by swiping forward and back on it – but it wouldn’t register a single tap. Disappointing. Bragi Dash – Tracking and App The good news is that you don’t have to take your phone with you while you work out. Start an activity – running, swimming or cycling – and the Dash will monitor your performance. Every five minutes – or whenever you double-tap the left earpiece – it will provide an update on how you're doing. This comprises simple stats, such as how long you’ve been going, steps taken, heart rate, distance, calories burned, cadence and speed (for cycling), and number of lengths (for swimming). It’s a great way of staying informed about your progress, but it isn't without its problems. Related: Best Fitness Trackers The device doesn't store your workouts, so the minute you finish, the data is gone forever. This is quite an oversight. The only way to store the workout data is to sync the Dash to your phone beforehand, but that means taking your phone with you, which misses the point. You could sync and then leave your phone at home, but this too presented issues. A couple of times when I went running, the Dash wouldn’t connect back to the app to transfer my data. Even if it does so straight away, because it thinks your workout went on until you pressed stop – if you have to get out of a swimming pool, shower, and return to your locker before "ending" your workout – this will add minutes to your time. As a note, make sure you get the right size of fit sleeve when swimming. I didn’t the first time, and ended up having to retrieve the earbuds from the pool floor. The data is pretty accurate, though. When swimming, it was occasionally a length or two out, but we had the same degree of error with the Apple Watch Series 2, TomTom Spark 3 and the Speedo Shine 2. And it’s great getting that audio feedback, instead of stopping and checking the screen. I'm less keen on wearing the Dash while cycling, however. I like to be aware of my surroundings when on a bike, but the Dash blocked up my ears so, even without music playing, I felt less safe on the mean roads of London. The app is fine, although a little underwhelming; the tutorial videos don’t have sound, for instance. But apart from syncing your workouts – which, as I’ve mentioned, isn’t a painless process – you shouldn’t have to use the app much. The Bluetooth connection isn’t rock-solid, either. It often dropped out, especially while I was out and about. This is annoying for a product that sells itself on its wireless connectivity. Bragi Dash – Battery Life and Charging You charge the dash in a neat little case that plugs into your computer or a USB-compatible plug. The case itself charges up too, so you can use it to juice up the Dash when you’re away from a power source. The earphones slot into place using magnets. You know when they’re in because they’ll flash blue before pulsing as they charge. The colour of the light will depend on how much battery life remains: red is low; green for high; and blue indicates it's full. They pulse in sync with each other too, which is quite a cool effect. You'll get around three hours of use from the Dash before it needs a charge. That’s more than enough for workouts, but if you’re listening to music on the go too then you might need to take the charging case with you. The case will also help stop you losing your earbuds. Should I buy the Bragi Dash? I'd love to recommend the Dash – but, unfortunately, the device isn't as polished as it should be. Sound quality is good, and the fitness tracking is impressive; when it all works it’s a real glimpse of what will be possible. But there are too many niggles that require sorting for us to part with £250. Right now, Jabra's Elite Sport are a more complete package if you're not an avid swimmer and would get our recommendation for a fraction less money. Verdict We’ve no doubt hearables will soon be a big product category. It’s just a shame the Bragi Dash can’t capitalise on its potential.

New York, January 7 Hit by a slump in iPhone sales globally, which led to the company missing its revenue and profit goals for 2016, tech giant Apple has cut its CEO Tim Cook's pay for the year. (Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd) Cook received $8.75 million in total compensation for 2016 -- down from $10.28 million in 2015 -- which the company said declined for the first time since he assumed office in 2011. Cook's base salary, however, rose 50 per cent to $3 million. "According to a regulatory filing on Friday, Apple said its annual sales of $215.6 billion were 3.7 per cent below its target of $223.6 billion, and its operating income of $60 billion was 0.5 per cent short of the $60.3 billion target," The Wall Street Journal reported. Apple's five-most senior executives also saw their total compensation fall for fiscal 2016, each declining around nine per cent to about $22.8 million from $25 million in the prior year. Their 2016 compensation included $2.8 million in salary and $20 million in restricted stock, the report noted. Last year, announcing the results for the fourth quarter of 2016, Apple said it sold 45.5 million iPhones, 9.3 million iPads and 4.9 million Macs -- a year-over-year decline of 5.2 per cent for iPhones, six per cent for iPads and a massive 14 per cent for the Mac. Apple is now eyeing hopes on iPhone 7 which was launched in September and forthcoming versions, including an expected 10th-anniversary iPhone later this year, which may tilt the figures in favour of Apple in the near future. —IANS COMMENTS All readers are invited to post comments responsibly.

CBC Marketplace did a test to find out. (Carl Court/Getty Images) Matthew Braga Senior Technology Reporter Matthew Braga is the senior technology reporter for CBC News.

'We're paying with our data': Why privacy can be a problem with apps Canadians not terribly savvy about digital privacy, poll finds Smart homes, smart cars: What we're watching Could your thoughts replace your password? Why the Yahoo hacker might not be interested in short-term profit Even if you only downloaded a handful of apps last year, do you remember what permissions you granted to each?  CBC's Marketplace recently tested how much personal information we can unknowingly hand over to apps. The start of new year is a time to reset —  and the perfect time to unlearn all of the bad privacy habits you may have picked up. Here are a few tips to get you started. Review your privacy settings Both Android and iPhone have a settings page where you can see which apps have access to everything from your heart rate to your home's lighting system. It's here that you can review which apps have access to what, and disable permissions you don't remember granting. Watch the Marketplace investigation Are Your Apps Spying On You? CBC AT CES | For new smart-home gadgets, the spectre of insecurity looms Apple even offers an option to reset all of your phone's privacy and security settings at once, so that the next time you open an app that needs access to your microphone, camera, or other data, it will ask for your permission as if you were just using the app for the first time. In terms of what apps can do, there are some differences between Android phones and iPhones to keep in mind. Apple, for example, doesn't allow developers to access the camera unless an app is open and in use, nor access iMessages or SMS messages. Stick to app stores Apple and Google maintain app stores where most people buy their apps. It's a way for the two companies to control what people can do on their platforms — for better and for worse. One benefit is that, as part of the app store review process, Apple and Google vet apps for potential security or privacy issues — essentially, screening out apps that would otherwise be classified as malware, or try to access user data in a way that violates their terms of service. Find out more about the Marketplace investigation this weekend, when CBC's Diana Swain explores the ethics of the app experiment on The Investigators Saturday at 9:30 p.m. ET and Sunday at 5:30 p.m. ET on CBC News Network. While you can disable the security settings on Android and iPhone that prevent you from downloading apps from other sources, you probably shouldn't unless you really know what you're doing. There's no one watching to make sure that app you got from a friend is really doing what it says it does. Do Google and Apple know where you've been? Both Android and iPhone provide a number of ways for apps to access your location — which you can check in your phone's privacy settings. But both Apple and Google also have their own location-tracking settings that are separate from third-party apps. CBC AT CES | Why everyone's talking to Amazon's virtual assistant Alexa On iPhones running iOS 7 and higher, there are a number of location-based tracking options under the "System Services" section of your phone's location privacy settings (pay close attention to the "Frequent Locations" setting in particular). On Android version 2.3 and up, you'll find "Google Location History" under your phone's "Location" settings. Apple and Google use your phone's location so their apps better understand the places you frequently visit, and for advertising purposes, but you can turn this off. Get yourself a password manager Writing down your passwords on a scrap of paper that you keep in your sock drawer is never a good idea. But storing all your passwords in a password manager is smart. Think of it is a digital vault, secured with one really long passphrase, that holds all your other passwords inside. Instead of having to remember a bunch of short, insecure passwords, you only have to remember a really long one instead. A good password manager won't just store your passwords, but will help you generate stronger, more secure passwords, too. Protect yourself with 2-factor authentication The best thing you can do to stop attackers from getting into your accounts with Facebook, Google, Twitter, Dropbox, and other services is to setup two-factor authentication. Each time you attempt to log in to an account protected by two-factor authentication from a new phone or computer, you'll be asked for the password you know, but also an additional, temporary password that you don't (that's the second factor). Why passthoughts could make passwords a thing of the past The idea is that this temporary password is generated by an app on your phone, or sent via text message — meaning that even if someone learns your password, they'll still need access to your phone to get into your account. Want to know what data your apps have collected? Ask! In Canada, there's legislation called the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), which "gives people a general right to access their personal information held by businesses subject to this law." In other words, if you want a record of all the information that your favourite emoji keyboard, banking app, or social network has stored about you, can send the company a letter and ask. The process might take a while — and there's no guarantee you'll get a response back, even if it is Canadian law — but it's a great way to exercise your right to privacy and learn just how much of your personal data is under a company's control.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel | 1 Comments iPhone maker Apple has cut its CEO Tim Cook's salary by a whopping 15 percent for 2016 as annual sales declined for the year, missing targets that also led to the tech giant's first annual revenue decline in 15 years. The company gave the 56-year-old USD 8.75 million in total compensation last year, down from the USD 10.28 million he received in 2015, according to a Securities and Exchange (SEC) filing released yesterday. Cook's salary rose to USD 3 million from USD 2 million last year - a 50 percent increase, his cash bonus took a hit. Apple awarded Cook and other executives 89.5 percent of their target, instead of the maximum amount like in recent years. Hence, Cook's cash bonus fell to USD 5.4 million in 2016, down from USD 8 million the year before and declining for the first time since he assumed leadership of the company in 2011. Apple specifically cited the company's failure to meet its performance goals for both sales and profits. Sales volume of the iPhone fell in fiscal 2016 for the first time since the device was introduced in 2007, causing the tech icon to suffer its first annual revenue decline in 15 years. The company said its annual sales were down nearly 4 percent, or USD 215.6 billion, from its target of USD 223.6 billion, and its operating income was down 0.5 percent from its target at USD 60 billion, according to the filing. "Overall, our 2016 performance with respect to net sales and operating income was 7.7 percent and 15.7 percent below our record-breaking 2015 levels," Apple said in the filing. "However, the 2016 payouts to our named executive officers were significantly less than the annual cash incentive payouts for 2015, reflecting strong pay-for-performance alignment." Apple's rare sales slump is directly linked to the loss of momentum for the iPhone, which generates the majority of the company's sales. Sales of iPhones have declined in each of the past three quarters, slipping to 45.5 million in the September quarter, with reports saying Apple has faced steep competition from Samsung and other smartphone makes and the newest iPhones did not feature enough upgrades to attract customers. In October, Cook said that demand for the iPhone 7 and the bigger 7 Plus, which feature enhanced cameras and longer battery life, have outpaced supply though Apple would only report quarterly sales for those phones on January 31.

PC-Tablet Videos Tech Apps Telecom Science Business Social Auto Reviews How-To’s Featured iPhone 8 price in India might go down with Apple starting manufacturing facility in Bengaluru By Anand Narayanaswamy - 07/01/2017 With Apple gearing up to start iPhone manufacturing in Bengaluru towards early 2017, a panel comprising of senior officials could probably meet to discuss the possibilities of incentives. If Apple decides to manufacture iPhones in India, then the company would demand series of exemptions and incentives for the manufacturing plant. Based on the reports so far, Apple has almost decided to establish a plant in Peenya, Bengaluru. Expected to be manufactured in partnership with Taiwan-based Wistron, the Cupertino-based tech giant will be able to slash prices substantially because of the absence of additional import duty, which is currently pegged at 12.5%. If the reports are true, we may see comparitively lesser difference in iPhone 8 price in the US and India. Apple wants to know about incentives to start a manufacturing facility According to reports, Apple has sought a detailed clarification from the Government as to what kind of incentives they get if they start production in India since the company manufactures cutting-edge technology products. Apple also sought clarity about the various offers under the modified special incentive package scheme, which is created to boost electronic manufacturing in India. Meanwhile, Apple declined to comment when asked about their proposed plans to establish a facility in India. As per reports, Apple had already conveyed all the demands to the top officials inside the government. However, the requirements of Apple are forwarded to relevant departments for required approvals. Foxconn’s attempt to establish a facility in Maharashtra foiled Meanwhile, Foxconn also disclosed that they are willing to build a manufacturing plant for iPhones in Maharashtra. However, Apple doesn’t like the approach of Foxconn since the Taiwan-based OEM maker confirmed that they are also in talks with Xiaomi and OnePlus to assemble smartphones at the same facility. The main aim of Apple is to establish their own exclusive manufacturing plant. As of this writing, Apple sells iPhones through a nationwide network of distributors and retailers including a partnership with top e-commerce companies. Apple’s attempt to sell refurbished handsets halted by the Government Recently, Apple made an attempt to import and sell refurbished iPhones in India, which was halted by the Commerce Ministry. In 2015, the proposal to sell refurbished iPhones was rejected by the environment ministry. Moreover, both telecom and industry ministries objected to this move by Apple. In May 2016, Apple announced the opening of design and development accelerator in Bengaluru to boost the requirements of iOS developer community. Moreover, the center will also motivate and guide developers based in India to take advantage of Swift programming language. If Apple succeeds in its plan to establish a facility in the city, it will be the second significant investment in the city. Apple India sales figure touched Rs 9997 crore in 2016, which is a sharp increase when compared to Rs. 6472 crore in 2015. The net profit of the company rose to 21% and reached Rs. 294 crore. The main reason for the massive growth is attributed to the increased penetration in the retail segment and slashing of prices for old iPhone variants.

The news of Cook's pay cut comes from a report from the Wall Street Journal, which spotted the change in compensation in a regulatory filing from Apple.  Cook will lose out on about $1.5 million, dropping his annual salary from $10.28 million in 2015 to $8.75 million in 2016. The 15 percent cut was the steepest issued by Apple, Though other executives were also affected. On average, the higher ups at the company saw a 9.6 percent year-on-year reduction in compensation. In the regulatory filing filed on Friday, Apple revealed it missed its targeted goals for both its revenue and operating income in 2016. It also failed to reach its stretch goals, the first time the company has failed to surpass the goals since 2009. According to Apple, its annual sales of $215.6 billion fell 3.7 percent below its target of $223.6 billion. The company's operating income came out to $60 billion, falling 0.5 percent short of its targeted $60.3 billion. As a result of falling short, company executives got 89.5 percentage of their targeted annual cash incentives. Apple struggled to maintain the astronomical sales figures it had previously achieved, seeing movement of its iPhone slide in 2016. The decline from historic highs resulted in the company’s first annual revenue decline since 2001 when it reported earnings in October. Despite its struggles, Apple is expected to report impressive sales figures when it reports its first quarter earnings in 2017 thanks to its strong holiday sales and the popularity of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. For Cook, the loss of money likely won't mean much. Apple's CEO voluntarily chose to receive the majority of his compensation in stock, and he netted $100 million in stock bonuses for serving five years as the head of the company. He liquidated a large chunk of his shares in Apple stock in 2016, netting him approximately $65 million, and continues to hold more than a million shares of the company. Cook announced in 2015 that he plans to give away most of his wealth over the course of his lifetime.

Los Angeles, Jan 7:   iPhone maker Apple has cut its CEO Tim Cook’s salary by a whopping 15 per cent for 2016 as annual sales declined for the year, missing targets that also led to the tech giant’s first annual revenue decline in 15 years. The company gave the 56-year-old $8.75 million in total compensation last year, down from the $10.28 million he received in 2015, according to a Securities and Exchange (SEC) filing released yesterday. Cook’s salary rose to $3 million from $2 million last year — a 50 per cent increase, his cash bonus took a hit. Apple awarded Cook and other executives 89.5 per cent of their target, instead of the maximum amount like in recent years. Hence, Cook’s cash bonus fell to $5.4 million in 2016, down from $8 million the year before and declining for the first time since he assumed leadership of the company in 2011. Apple specifically cited the company’s failure to meet its performance goals for both sales and profits. Sales volume of the iPhone fell in fiscal 2016 for the first time since the device was introduced in 2007, causing the tech icon to suffer its first annual revenue decline in 15 years. The company said its annual sales were down nearly 4 per cent, or $215.6 billion, from its target of $223.6 billion, and its operating income was down 0.5 per cent from its target at $60 billion, according to the filing. “Overall, our 2016 performance with respect to net sales and operating income was 7.7 per cent and 15.7 per cent below our record-breaking 2015 levels,” Apple said in the filing. “However, the 2016 payouts to our named executive officers were significantly less than the annual cash incentive payouts for 2015, reflecting strong pay-for-performance alignment.” Apple’s rare sales slump is directly linked to the loss of momentum for the iPhone, which generates the majority of the company’s sales. Sales of iPhones have declined in each of the past three quarters, slipping to 45.5 million in the September quarter, with reports saying Apple has faced a steep competition from Samsung and other smartphone makes and the newest iPhones did not feature enough upgrades to attract customers. In October, Cook said that demand for the iPhone 7 and the bigger 7 Plus, which feature enhanced cameras and longer battery life, have outpaced supply though Apple would only report quarterly sales for those phones on January 31.

The records were provided Friday in response to a federal lawsuit filed against the FBI by The Associated Press, Vice Media and Gannett, the parent company of USA Today. The media organizations sued in September to learn how much the FBI paid and who it hired to break into the phone of Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 people at a holiday gathering of county workers in December 2015. The FBI for weeks had maintained that only Apple Inc. could access the information on its phone, which was protected by encryption, but ultimately broke or bypassed Apple's digital locks with the help of an unnamed third party. The FBI, in its records release Friday, censored critical details that would have shown how much the FBI paid, whom it hired and how it opened the phone. The files had been marked "secret" before they were turned over under the lawsuit. The files make clear that the FBI signed a nondisclosure agreement with the vendor. The records also show that the FBI received at least three inquiries from companies interested in developing a product to unlock the phone, but none had the ability to come up with a solution fast enough for the FBI. The FBI also said in contracting documents that it did not solicit competing bids or proposals because it thought widely disclosing the bureau's needs could harm national security. The lawsuit was filed months after the FBI's sudden announcement in March that it had purchased a tool from an unidentified third party to open Farook's phone. The disclosure aborted a court fight that began when a federal judge had directed Apple to help the FBI break into the phone. The suit by the media organizations argued there was no legal basis to withhold the information and challenged the adequacy of the FBI's search for relevant records. It also said the public had a right to know whether the vendor has adequate security measures, is a proper recipient of government funds and will act only in the public interest. In refusing to provide the records, the FBI said the records had been compiled for law enforcement purposes and might interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, even though at the time the shooters were both dead and there were no indications others were involved. It was the third lawsuit the AP has filed against the Obama administration under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act.

Las Vegas Sun January 15, 2017 Currently: 52° — Complete forecast Las Vegas Sun The Sunday News Vegas INC Opinion Sports Politics Entertainment Las Vegas Weekly Events Sports betting UNLV sports Gaming Education NHL in Las Vegas Smith's World HS Basketball Newsletter signup 0 Comments Apple CEO Tim Cook’s pay slumps along with iPhone sales Richard Drew / AP In this April 30, 2015, file photo, Apple CEO Tim Cook responds to a question during a news conference in New York. Associated Press Saturday, Jan. 7, 2017 | 12:02 a.m. SAN FRANCISCO — Apple penalized CEO Tim Cook for the iPhone maker's first sales slump in 15 years with a 15 percent pay cut. Cook still did extremely well, with a compensation package valued at $8.7 million for Apple's fiscal year that ended Sept. 24, according to a regulatory filing made Friday. But the amount was down from nearly $10.3 million in the prior year. The Cupertino, California, company cited a downturn in Apple's revenue and operating profit as the main reason it cut the pay of Cook and its other top executives. Apple's revenue dropped 8 percent to $216 billion, while its operating profit declined 16 percent to $60 billion. That was mainly because it sold fewer iPhones for the first time since the device came out in 2007. It also marked the first time that Apple's annual revenue decreased since 2001, which was just before the company's late co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the iPod. That digital music player set the stage for the iPhone and iPad. The iPhone triggered a revolution in mobile computing and became Apple's biggest moneymaker, even as a wide range of device makers released competing products primarily running on Google's free Android software. Most of the world's smartphones are powered by Android, but the iPhone remains a popular high-priced status symbol. Even so, consumers are holding on to their existing iPhones for longer periods instead of upgrading to a newer model every year or two. That has raised investor concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone, a nagging worry that has been aggravated by the company's inability to introduce another breakthrough product since Jobs' death in 2011. Cook, Jobs' anointed successor, had hoped Apple would have another huge hit with a smartwatch unveiled in 2014, but that device has only had moderate success. Apple's regulatory filing revealed that the company was bracing for a sales drop last year, although not quite as steep as what occurred. The compensation committee for Apple's board of directors had established a revenue goal of $224 billion for last year, which would have been a 4 percent decline from the previous year. The company expected sales to rebound during the holiday shopping season on hopes that consumers would be snapping up its latest iPhones, the 7 and 7 Plus. Apple will release its quarterly results that include the holidays later this month. 0 Comments Join the Discussion: Check this out for a full explanation of our conversion to the LiveFyre commenting system and instructions on how to sign up for an account.

Over a decade ago Alex Hern switched from PC to Mac and never looked back. But the new MacBook Pro’s very expensive so could he finally be tempted to switch again? Are Apple users better off switching from the MacBook Pro to Microsoft’s much less expensive Surface Book. Composite: Samuel Gibbs Alex Hern @alexhern Saturday 7 January 2017 03.00 EST Last modified on Saturday 7 January 2017 03.03 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close I’ve been an Apple user for over a decade, ever since I picked up a refurbished 17in PowerBook back in 2005 to replace my ailing Windows XP box. But last month, after Apple announced its most expensive new MacBook Pros in almost 15 years, I reconsidered my decision for the first time and, for the past few weeks, I’ve been back on a Windows PC. I wasn’t always a Mac user. My first three computers were PCs, although the house I grew up in had an ailing, hated Power Mac Performa. My reasons for switching in my teens were fairly simple: I’d been playing fewer and fewer PC games, and spending increasing amounts of time using my computer to manage the music library linked to my iPod. I was one of those switchers, surprised by the elegance of Apple’s music player and convinced to take the plunge into their full desktop operating system. The laptop wasn’t cheap, but it made shuttling between my separated parents’ houses much easier. And while I missed being able to play the full library of PC games I’d built up over the years, it was an exciting time to be moving to the Mac OS world. Plus, World of Warcraft was cross-platform, which was all the gaming I needed for a good while. Ten years on, I’m a fairly default Apple user. I’m on my sixth iPhone, second iPad and third Mac; I have an Apple TV at home, Apple branded keyboard on my desktop, and even an Apple AA battery charger, from the days when they made them. But the twin punches of a Brexit-led depreciation of the pound, and Apple releasing a new range of MacBook Pros with the least bang-for-your-buck in recent memory, made me think twice. The cheapest Mac that would be sufficient for my needs, a 13in MacBook Pro with 512GB of storage space and 16GB of ram, comes in at well over £2,000, yet is barely more powerful than the machine it’s replacing, a 15in retina MacBook Pro from four years ago that cost just over £1,500 at the time. So I switched back. For the past month, I’ve been using the Surface Book, the top-of-the-line laptop sold by, of all people, Microsoft. It’s been an experience. Great-ish expectations Facebook Twitter Pinterest Microsoft Surface Book Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian My expectations going in were uncertain. I know Windows has evolved radically since I last used it, back in the XP era, and has even changed since the last time I used it in anger, shortly after the launch of Windows 8.1. The current latest version of the operating system, Windows 10 (confusingly, only one version later than 8.1; the story goes that too many developers wrote code referring to Windows 95 and 98 as “9*”, meaning an actual Windows 9 would break compatibility), is generally considered a good thing. It meshes the new Windows experience of version 8 with an old-style desktop more elegantly than previous versions, while consigning ever more of the cruft deep into nested menus and offering a slick experience for first-time users. I was also given hope by the machine. After an awkward start with the first version of the Surface back in 2012, then pitched as an iPad competitor, Microsoft has become one of the best manufacturers of Windows PCs there is. The Surface Book is a delicious machine, masquerading as a MacBook Pro-class laptop but with a fully detachable touchscreen that opens it up to a whole new range of uses. The quality of the Surface machines has caused problems when it comes to Microsoft’s relationships with its hardware partners, who tended to expect Microsoft to be content raking in millions with the licensing fees for Windows, rather than competing with them directly for profit from hardware manufacturing. But for now, the company has been content to sit on the edge of the market, making niche devices for the power user. Despite all of that, I had a fair amount of trepidation. Memories of blue screens of death, of driver conflicts, of cleaning out my registry and restoring the system after a malware infection, are hard to shake, as is the general hangover from my youth of Microsoft as the Great Satan of the tech world. As Zuckerberg is to the 2010s, Gates was to the 1990s: ever-present, professionally amoral, and incredibly, unflappably, successful. But Gates is gone, as is Ballmer. This is Satya Nadella’s company now, and the Microsoft of this generation is everything the Microsoft of the 90s – or the Facebook of today – isn’t: humble, quiet, content with success where it can win and partnerships where it can’t, and as proud of working with competitors as Gates was of crushing them. In short, it’s a Microsoft that I could consider being friends with. It couldn’t be that bad. Switching pains The worst thing about switching, it turns out, is switching. I’m not trying to be tautological. But the bulk of the unpleasantness I’ve experienced actually making this change hasn’t been inherent to Windows, but has either come about because of the differences between the two operating systems, or even just the difficulties in actually getting up and running from day one. Some of the problems are as simple, but nonetheless infuriating, as different keyboard shortcuts. A lifetime of muscle memory has told me that Command-Space brings up Spotlight, which is the main way I opened programmes on my Mac. The same shortcut on Windows 10 is to simply hit the Windows key, which invokes Cortana, Microsoft’s AI assistant, and then typing in the name of the programme you want to open. Facebook Twitter Pinterest It’s just all so ... blue. Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/REUTERS Similar mismatches appear in areas like window management, alt-tab behaviour, and programme installation. It’s a push to say which is better (though I maintain that running an installer is less elegant than just dragging an app into the Apps folder), but whichever you’re used to, the other will be worse until you re-educate yourself. That’s not to say I didn’t have plenty to complain about, though. That Spotlight/Cortana mismatch, for instance? It wouldn’t have been so bad, except that Windows maps the alt key to the location of the command key on Macs, and alt-space is the Windows shortcut for switching languages, so every time I failed to invoke Spotlight, I would accidentally switch the language my computer was set up in, resetting my keyboard to a US English layout. That was an annoying problem. Worse was that I didn’t actually have two languages set up on the Surface Book in the first place. And yet, hovering in the bottom right, permanently, was a little box showing whether I was running in UK English or US English, with no option in sight to remove it. In the end, I had to turn to Twitter for troubleshooting advice. We determined that there was no option to remove the US English language because there was no US English language set up. So to remove it, all I had to do was go into a language menu, add English (United States) as an option, and then remove English (United States) as an option. I know. But it worked, so who am I to complain. I’m also firmly aware that a critical eye on Mac OS will reveal many similar bugs. Mac users, particularly long-term, slightly jaundiced, Mac users, have long become familiar with the hollow laugh and invocation of Apple’s erstwhile marketing slogan “It Just Works” as something emphatically continues to not Just Work. In fact, that phrase has been uttered in irony so many times that it’s easy to forget that it really does come from a place of competitive advantage for Apple. That advantage has largely been eroded over the years, as Microsoft has cottoned on to the joys of vertical integration, plug and play accessories, and standards-compliant behaviour. But not entirely. Plugging in an external mouse (an utterly standard Microsoft-made laser mouse), I was annoyed to find that I couldn’t reverse the scrolling behaviour on the scroll wheel to match that of the in-built trackpad. It’s one thing to have to relearn behaviours when you switch machines, it’s another to have to re-learn them every time you plug in a peripheral. About an hour of fruitless Googling later – including several suggestions to install obsolete utilities, hack the registry, or roll back to an earlier version of Windows – and I discovered the way to do what I wanted. I had to download drivers for my mouse. Facebook Twitter Pinterest It just works … Steve Jobs with the MacBook Pro in 2008. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images If you’re young, a Mac user, or not particularly technical, that might not mean much. Drivers are the small pieces of software that tell the operating system how to work with hardware, from complex components like graphics cards to simple accessories like this mouse. But the necessity, or not, of drivers for accessories was a big part of that competitive push by Apple, which made a point of ensuring out-of-the-box support for many of the most commonly used peripherals like printers, cameras and mice. When Steve Jobs said “it just works”, this is the sort of thing he was referring to: the ability to plug in a mouse and have it Just Work. Installing drivers for a mouse to enable a niche behaviour is no great hardship, but it still left me moderately concerned. Microsoft made both the mouse and the laptop, yet the two weren’t able to play nicely together without my intervention. This digging in the nuts and bolts of the machine was not something I had missed. Touching the void The Microsoft of 2016 has a split personality. In many ways, the split is the same that it’s had for the past 20 years, between its desire for continuity and its desire for reinvention and technological leadership. Where the company is successful today is where that latter desire is ascendant, and the Surface Book is the best example of a forward-looking Microsoft you can find. It’s a fantastic machine. Small and powerful, with a long battery life, it impresses as a laptop, but its real strengths are revealed when you undock the screen from its base. Being able to carry my laptop around the kitchen when doing the weekly shop, before docking it back and typing up some recipes, was genuinely cool. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Not being an illustrator, a graphic designer, or even a graphic thinker, the ability to pop out my laptop and write on it with a stylus was never that useful. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Unfortunately, cool is all it was for me. The ability to pop out my laptop and write on it with a (very accurate) stylus was never that useful. If anything, it served to underscore how efficient the keyboard-and-touchpad combo is for a lot of hefty tasks. I had a similar experience with the ability to use the touchscreen while the Surface Book was in laptop mode. I simply didn’t do it much, and most of the time when I did, it was just to see if I could. Occasionally, the touchscreen was actively bad. My first time opening Windows Mail, I was greeted with a helpful popover showing that I could swipe mails to the left to archive them. But I couldn’t work out how: click and drag? Two-fingered swipe on the touchpad? The answer, of course, is to reach up to the screen, and swipe that way. A shortcut it is not, particularly if the screen is up on a dock and you’re already using a keyboard and mouse. Incidentally, unlike many hybrid laptops, the base isn’t just a keyboard: it also contains a second battery, and a number of hardware components including a discrete GPU. (One downside of that setup: if you let the screen run out of battery while undocked, you can’t re-dock it until you’ve charged it separately, even if the base still has some power left). PCs are from Mars If this sounds like a long list of nitpicks, it’s because ... well, it is. For all the existential battles that have been fought over Windows versus Mac, there’s little to distinguish the two on any important level. The platforms have converged on everything but aesthetics and personal preferences. Both have a locked-down store which power users ignore; both are fighting for relevance in a world of web apps and mobile-first design; both feel the weight of versions past sitting on their shoulders. If you asked me to explain why, despite it all, I’ve put my money down for a MacBook Pro rather than buying the Surface Book from Microsoft (which loaned the device for this trial), I can give you some reasons that feel solid enough for me. I was shocked by the amount of advertising and cross-promotion riddled throughout the OS, from adverts for apps in the start menu, to a persistent pop-up offering a free trial of Office 365. I was surprised by the paucity of solid third-party apps in general, and particularly by the lack of any good consumer productivity suite. When the most common recommendation, for services from photo storage to calendaring, is “just use Google’s web apps”, there’s a hole waiting to be filled (though maybe that’s just my dislike of web apps in general). It feels like the Mac dev scene is full of teams making fully featured apps that compete with the big companies, while Windows devs are more content to make niche utilities which serve particular needs without needing to start a war. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The MacBook Pro is up to £1,000 more expensive than the Surface Book. Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA I disliked the lack of a smart sleep mode, meaning my computer would often be flat when I opened it up in the morning because some utility had been running in the background. I hated the difficulty in typing special characters, from foreign accents to ellipses and em-dashes. I hated the lack of a universal paste-as-plain-text shortcut, and I mourned the loss of iMessage access on the desktop for texting my girlfriend. Most of all, though, I couldn’t stand the small irritations, from the failure of Chrome windows to correctly adapt when dragged from a high-res screen to a low-res one, to the trackpad’s inability to accurately click when I used it with my thumb rather than my finger. I don’t pretend that those irritations are unique to Windows, or even that they aren’t things I couldn’t have fixed with time, effort or re-education. But the problem is, fixing them isn’t worth it: the difference just isn’t there. That’s true whichever way you’re thinking of switching. If you’re a Windows user nodding along with my problems, I can guarantee you that within a month of switching to Mac, you’ll have a list just as long. Maybe one day, one or other platform will have a commanding lead. For some use-cases, that’s already happened: gamers have Windows, while iOS developers have Mac, to state two obvious examples. But for now, for the vast majority, it’s hard to say there’s anything in it. Except, of course, for price. Because these problems are minor, and a price difference of up to £1,000 isn’t. The Surface Book is around the same price as the new MacBook Pro, but many other high-quality laptops aren’t: you’ll easily find models like Dell’s XPS range or Lenovo’s Thinkpads for hundreds of pounds less than a comparably-specced MacBook. For me, with four years of saving for a new Mac, good credit, and risk-aversion to digital irritation, it’s worth paying through the nose to stick with what I know. But it might not be the case for you. Switching isn’t a panacea, and there’s no silver bullet out there – no Windows computer that will be anything better than a bit annoying for former Mac users – but before you get too complacent, I have a feeling the same is true the other way round. Ultimately, the question comes down to how much you’re prepared to pay to keep things the same as they have been. For me, it turns out that figure’s quite high.

By Agamoni Ghosh January 7, 2017 06:46 GMT Apple CEO Tim Cook thinks augmented reality will be bigger than virtual realityAndrew Burton/Getty Images Apple CEO Tim Cook received a cut in his annual salary in 2016 along with other top executives as the iPhone maker failed to meet expected sales and profit targets the company has revealed. Cook received $8.7m (£7m) in total pay, compared to nearly $10.3m the previous year. Although his base salary increased from $2m to $3m, his bonus component dropped. "Apple was below its target performance goals for both net sales and operating income, resulting in a payout of each named executive officer's annual cash incentive at 89.5 percent of target," the company said in its filing. Although Apple posted better than expected profit margins in Q4 of 2016, its iPhone sales continued to decline for the third quarter in a row. In addition, Macs and Watch sales in China and the US particularly were down from the year before. Despite this slump the top six employees of Apple took home more than $100m in collective pay. This includes Cook, CFO Luca Maestri, retail chief Angela Ahrendts, iTunes and services head Eddy Cue, legal head Bruce Sewell and hardware engineering lead Dan Riccio. Apple, which is expected to report its first quarter results on 31 January, expects its revenue to shine on account of holiday sales of the iPhone 7 and the new Macbook range.

Apple CEO Tim Cook, for instance, took a $1.5 million blow.  ( Stephen Lam | Getty Images ) Advertisement Apple had a disappointing performance and missed its targets so top executives, including company CEO Tim Cook, made less money in 2016. More specifically, as the company missed both its revenue and profit goals for the first time since at least 2009, Cook received $1.5 million less compensation for the year. Since late CEO Steve Jobs left the company in Cook's hands, Apple has received a steady stream of criticism over not being innovative enough. Even so, Apple still managed to exceed its stretch goals year after year, up until now. Apple In 2016: Missed Goals And Weak Performance For the first time since Tim Cook took over as CEO, Apple's revenue and operating income missed both targeted and stretched goals for the year, the company reveals in a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Apple's iPhone was the most-wanted gift for the recently ended holiday season and Apple ranked top in holiday device activations, managing to surpass Samsung, but a good holiday season was not enough to turn things around and make up for the rest of the year. Apple Executives' Pay Shrinks With a weak overall performance and missed goals, Apple executives were not able to maximize the cash incentives included in their compensation packages. In past years when it reached its goals, Apple offered its executives the maximum total payout, maxing out the full potential cash incentives. For 2016, the compensation was substantially lower, but that doesn't mean the executives walked out empty-handed. Tim Cook got $8.75 million in total 2016 compensation, marking a $1.5 drop from the $10.3 million he received in 2015. Other executives were affected by the weak performance as well, receiving lower pay in 2016 than in 2015. "Apple delivered another year of strong financial results in 2016. However, the two financial measures used to evaluate executive performance under our annual cash incentive program, net sales and operating income, declined from our record-breaking 2015 levels," Apple explains in its filing. "These results were below the target performance goals set by the Compensation Committee. As a result, the annual cash incentive payouts to our named executive officers were below target." Downward Spiral Apple's disappointing performance is no longer a surprise anymore. The company has been facing declining sales for a few quarters in a row now as its iPhone, iPad, and Mac performance got weaker. The iPhone still accounted for 63 percent of Apple's total revenue for 2016, but the sales' slump and sluggish growth in the market took a heavy toll nonetheless. According to the filing, Cook's pay dropped 15 percent in 2016, as opposed to a 9.6 percent decline on average for the company's other top executives. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri, for instance, received $22.8 million for the year, of which $20 million were in stock awards, marking a 10 percent decline. Lastly, Apple revealed that it made $215.6 billion in sales for the year, 3.7 percent lower than its target of $223.6 billion. Its operating income, meanwhile, stood at $60 billion, 0.5 percent lower than the $60.3 billion target.

The Cupertino company could be ready to adopt indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) displays before the end of 2017. IGZO displays have been around for a few years now — Sharp was the first manufacturer to begin production of LCD panels using the technology back in 2012. Apple is thought to have used the material for the original iPad Air in November 2013. It’s long been speculated that the company would utilize IGZO in its laptops, but these rumors never came to fruition. However, there’s now word that both Sharp and Samsung could begin supplying IGZO displays to Apple as soon as the second quarter of 2017, according to a report from Mac Rumors. The company currently uses amorphous silicon panels for its MacBook Pro, but that’s apparently set to change. More: Your next laptop will have an awesome display. Here’s why IGZO is better at conducting electricity than previous technologies and is more transparent, meaning that the system’s backlight doesn’t have to work as hard to deliver a bright, clear image. As a result, IGZO panels require less power to display a picture that’s as good, if not better, than the competition. Given that Apple just committed to a major refresh of its MacBook Pro last year, it’s difficult to predict how the new IGZO display will be implemented. Its possible that the first revision of the laptop could simply feature an upgraded screen, without making any big changes to the overall design that debuted in 2016. That said, it could well be that Apple has bigger plans for the MacBook Pro this year. If the company plans to field a new version of the MacBook Pro rather than an incremental update, an IGZO display could be an attractive selling point. Also watch: Share

The records were provided Friday in response to a federal lawsuit filed against the FBI by The Associated Press, Vice Media and Gannett, the parent company of USA Today. The media organizations sued in September to learn how much the FBI paid and who it hired to break into the phone of Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 people at a holiday gathering of county workers in December 2015. The FBI for weeks had maintained that only Apple Inc. could access the information on its phone, which was protected by encryption, but ultimately broke or bypassed Apple’s digital locks with the help of an unnamed third party. Thrift Savings Plan: The problem with the I Fund The FBI, in its records release Friday, censored critical details that would have shown how much the FBI paid, whom it hired and how it opened the phone. The files had been marked “secret” before they were turned over under the lawsuit. Advertisement The files make clear that the FBI signed a nondisclosure agreement with the vendor. The records also show that the FBI received at least three inquiries from companies interested in developing a product to unlock the phone, but none had the ability to come up with a solution fast enough for the FBI. The FBI also said in contracting documents that it did not solicit competing bids or proposals because it thought widely disclosing the bureau’s needs could harm national security. The lawsuit was filed months after the FBI’s sudden announcement in March that it had purchased a tool from an unidentified third party to open Farook’s phone. The disclosure aborted a court fight that began when a federal judge had directed Apple to help the FBI break into the phone. The suit by the media organizations argued there was no legal basis to withhold the information and challenged the adequacy of the FBI’s search for relevant records. It also said the public had a right to know whether the vendor has adequate security measures, is a proper recipient of government funds and will act only in the public interest. In refusing to provide the records, the FBI said the records had been compiled for law enforcement purposes and might interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, even though at the time the shooters were both dead and there were no indications others were involved. It was the third lawsuit the AP has filed against the Obama administration under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act.

Jan 7 2017 at 11:18 AM Updated Jan 7 2017 at 11:18 AM Save article Print Ten years of the iPhone: How the Apple product changed our lives Share Share via Email Share on Google Plus Post on facebook wall Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit When Apple introduced the iPhone 10 years ago, skeptics pounced. But today, we couldn't imagine a world without them. CHINATOPIX When Apple introduced the iPhone 10 years ago, skeptics pounced. Sure, the iPhone was a bright, shiny object, another product crazed Apple lovers would line up to buy, as they always did. But the phone was a hodgepodge, a Swiss Army knife of functions trying to do too much, critics said. It had no stylus, no keyboard buttons, no secure email for business users. People would never type long emails on it. One analyst predicted "a backlash of sorts as people figure out how much this thing doesn't do." The iPhone's biggest booster, then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs, knew the device's potential as he took the stage in San Francisco on January 9, 2007. "Every once in awhile, a revolutionary product comes along that changes the world," he said. "Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone." Jobs turned out to be right. The iPhone was the device that "conditioned us to expect to be connected to the global network every moment of the day," said Paul Saffo, a longtime tech industry observer. And that conditioning changed everything. Apple CEO Steve Jobs holds up the iPhone in 2007. AP The following year, Apple created the iPhone App Store, a centralised market opening up the device to software developers. Meanwhile, other smartphone manufacturers like HTC and Samsung sold their own handsets with multitouch interfaces relying on Google's Android operating system. They, too, opened app stores.

With smartphone apps, people call an Uber, find a date through Tinder, look for jobs on LinkedIn, watch videos on YouTube, play Angry Birds, control their home thermostats and so on. Our smartphones have become so critical to our lives there's an app for finding a lost or stolen one. The iPhone (along with its smartphone competitors) has gone from being "a fetish to the tool for mediating modern life," said Mike McGuire, a vice president of research at Gartner. (In 2007 at the iPhone unveiling, he came close to conveying what would happen, telling me, "once you have the thing, you will want to carry it all the time.") To test how deeply embedded smartphones are, try to live without one. Turning it off while camping or out at sea doesn't count. When I recently destroyed my iPhone in the rain, I managed to stay calm with some deep breathing. It was a Saturday. I'd be fine turning to my laptop for email and doing internet searches. I have a house phone. "Look at me, I can function without a smartphone," I thought. "It's still possible." That was the first hour. Without Maps or Waze, Google's navigation app, I got lost picking up my daughter at a school across town. I couldn't look up the address or text anyone to help. I drove around in concentric circles hoping to stumble on where I needed to go. In the end, I had to wave down a mail deliverer. If anyone still knew their way without a smartphone, she would. Our phones have become an extension of our lives. iStock Yes, it's ridiculous how much many of us rely on this thing now but oh well. Still, there are downsides to this always-connected life. More than 70 per cent of smartphone owners sleep with them. France recently passed a law affirming the right of workers to disconnect, not answer emails, when they are on personal time. "That came as a result, I would argue, from smartphones," said McGuire. Texting while driving has become a serious public health issue. And, we are still trying to figure out etiquette rules for using smartphones. But 10 years later, after Apple has sold more than 1 billion iPhones, are there any skeptics left? The iPhone outstripped all expectations and became Apple's largest source of revenue. Yet its 10th anniversary comes at a time when the iPhone itself is no longer a status symbol. To the untrained eye, an iPhone, a Samsung Galaxy or another Android-based phone like the OnePlus look much the same, especially in protection cases. "Each device matters less and less," said Bob O'Donnell, president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research. "We've passed peak smartphone." To the untrained eye, an iPhone, a Samsung Galaxy or another Android-based phone like the OnePlus look much the same, especially in protection cases. Antonio Villas-Boas, Business Insider That has hit Apple. In 2016, iPhone sales slumped, leading the company to cut 15 per cent from the pay of Tim Cook, its CEO, for missing performance goals. The smartphone market may be saturated, with people holding on to their old ones longer. What matters more are the services. The devices themselves have become more like vessels than status symbols. Technological advancements, even from Apple, are incremental now, tweaks that fans cheer but aren't creating new markets. Is that a problem for Apple and the entire tech industry? Maybe. "We need new inflection points," said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, who told me in 2007 that with the iPhone Apple "may have created a new category." "An anniversary is a good time to introduce inflection points for the industry's growth," he said. Whatever comes next, we probably won't fully understand its impact at first. It seems to take us a decade to figure out how the next new thing will fit in our life. But when we do, we don't let go.

The records were provided in response to a federal lawsuit filed against the FBI by The Associated Press, Vice Media and Gannett, the parent company of USA Today. The media organizations sued in September to learn how much the FBI paid and who it hired to break into the phone of Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 people at a holiday gathering of county workers in December 2015. The FBI for weeks had maintained that only Apple Inc. could access the information on its phone, which was protected by encryption, but ultimately broke or bypassed Apple’s digital locks with the help of an unnamed third party. The FBI, in its records release Friday, censored critical details that would have shown how much the FBI paid, whom it hired and how it opened the phone. The files had been marked “secret” before they were turned over under the lawsuit. The files make clear that the FBI signed a nondisclosure agreement with the vendor. The records also show that the FBI received at least three inquiries from companies interested in developing a product to unlock the phone, but none had the ability to come up with a solution fast enough for the FBI. The FBI also said in contracting documents that it did not solicit competing bids or proposals because it thought widely disclosing the bureau’s needs could harm national security. The lawsuit was filed months after the FBI’s sudden announcement in March that it had purchased a tool from an unidentified third party to open Farook’s phone. The disclosure aborted a court fight that began when a federal judge had directed Apple to help the FBI break into the phone. The suit by the media organizations argued there was no legal basis to withhold the information and challenged the adequacy of the FBI’s search for relevant records. It also said the public had a right to know whether the vendor has adequate security measures, is a proper recipient of government funds and will act only in the public interest. In refusing to provide the records, the FBI said the records had been compiled for law enforcement purposes and might interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, even though at the time the shooters were both dead and there were no indications others were involved. It was the third lawsuit the AP has filed against the Obama administration under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Accessories-Accessories+ LG-LG+ Hands-on-Hands-on+ CES2017-CES2017+ Thanks to the actions of companies like Apple and Motorola, the 3.5-millimeter headphone jack is slowly becoming a thing of the past. This port has allowed us to listen to music on our smartphones pretty much since the dawn of time, but as phones become thinner and wireless audio solutions become better, OEMs are looking to phase out this port once and for all. Apple made this move with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and then also introduced the AirPods to be used in conjunction with them. The idea of having two individual and separate earbud units that aren't connected via a wire is still a relatively new concept, but just like Samsung and Apple, LG is looking to get in on the ground floor for this product category. LG's Tone Free wireless earbuds were first announced back in late December of last year, and we got a chance to look at them here at CES 2017. Unfortunately the Tone Free earbuds were tucked away behind a display case, but even with this being the case, it was still cool to actually see these things in person. Upon first glance, the design that LG is going with for the Tone Free looks just like any other pair of earbuds in the company's Tone lineup. However, unlike traditional Tone earbuds that are attached inside the casing via a wire, the tips of the Tone Free pop out of the frame and are then placed in your ears without any wires present whatsoever. The look of the earbuds themselves are more reminiscent to Samsung's Gear IconX than anything else, and when the earbuds are placed back into the body that you can easily wear around your neck when you aren't using them, they'll start charging up. LG is also selling an extra little charging bank that you'll be able to place the Tone Free earbuds into to get some extra juice, but no pricing info has been announced for this accessory. In fact, no sort of exact pricing or release information has been announced at all for the Tone Free. The LG representative we spoke to said that the company is planning to release them sometime around March of this year, but they weren't able to offer any details in regards to how much these things might cost when they are made available for purchase. Until then, feel free to check out the gallery below to get an idea for just how LG's wireless earbud solution will look once they're released.

I'm a fanatic actually. I was quite surprised at the sound quality. I expect head-shaking bass and these things deliver. One of the best sets I own in spite of them being Bluetooth. They work great at answering the phone and all that as well. And have quite a good range. Love them! They are my favorite ones now. posted on 08 Jan 2017, 17:32 0 Reply 13. cheetah2k (Posts: 1621; Member since: 16 Jan 2011) phoneyarena is just clickbait city with the titles of these articles...

Analysts Jeffrey Kvaal and Gregory McNiff say that iPhone 8 will be more successful than iPhone 6. “Consensus calls for 80 million iPhones in F1Q18 (Dec ’17) … only modestly above the iPhone 6 supercycle (75 million). However, we estimate the iPhone 8 will launch into an iOS subscriber base 45-50% larger than the iPhone 6 did and model 86 million iPhones in F1Q18 (from 83 million),” they revealed.  iPhone 6 users may buy a new iPhone in late 2017. Apple will use an A11 CPU for the upcoming iPhone. It is also planning to include a wireless charging feature while carrying a USB Type-C connector as well. The iPhone 8, is codenamed “Ferrari”. The device will carry an OLED  display. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has speculated that OLED display will bring more customers to Apple, according to Business Insider.

According to a post from Reuters the company is demanding special concession from the Indian government for its plans. However, the country is resisting the company’s demand for the tax incentives, as the trade minister said on Tuesday that India can’t offer special exceptions for the U.S. company. Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the country can’t give special and privileged terms and they are unable to offer extra concessions, however the decision isn’t final. Being diplomatic in the statement she said, “I am not saying that we have said yes, I am not saying that we have said no”. Currently, 42 foreign smartphone manufacturers are making their products in India, including Chinese firm Xiaomi and Huawei. And these firms are already getting benefits from the Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (MSIPS) to boost electronic manufacturing in the country. With MSIPS, the government provides financial incentives to offset disability and attract investments in the electronics hardware segment. It also gives a subsidy for investments in Special Economic Zones, among other benefits. Explaining the same, DIPP Secretary Ramesh Abhishek said that the government keeps getting requests from several firms for incentives and the Apple’s request is one of them. He further added”The government examines (all the requests) with appropriate departments. All such requests are examined in consultation with concerned departments and that process is on.” As a part of PM Narendra Modi’s bid to boost Make In India, Apple is looking forward to open its own stores in the country but has been demanded from the government to locally source at least some of the components. Last week, the company’s CEO Tim Cook had met with PM Modi for the plan in manufacturing and retail in India, as the Cupertino giant is looking to expand its presence in the second largest smartphone selling nation. Apple is pursuing a license to set up its own stores, which could start to open as early as next year. Not only Apple, India is also keen to get the firm to commence making its products in the country. As of now, government officials aren’t available to comment on the matter, while an Apple spokesperson didn’t respond to an email from Reuters seeking comment. If Apple starts local manufacturing in India, it would help the company to open retail stores in the country where its iPhones account for less than 2 percent of Indian smartphones sales. Also, it would lead to job opportunities for the Indian citizens. Currently, Apples products are manufactured in six countries, including South Korea, Japan and the US.

[Friday Night Fights] By Killian Bell • 2:00 pm, January 6, 2017 News Top stories Will you buy another Apple Watch that looks like this? Photo: Ste Smith/Cult of Mac The next-generation Apple Watch will be another incremental upgrade focused on performance and battery life improvements, according to recent rumors. But almost three years after the original model made its debut, should we be expecting more? Many Apple Watch fans have been hoping for a slimmer form factor, while earlier rumors promised features like cellular connectivity and even a FaceTime camera. Would you buy another Apple Watch that looks the same but lasts longer in between charges? Join us in this week’s Friday Night Fight as we discuss whether Apple Watch Series 3 needs a major overhaul. Luke Dormehl: We recently heard the rumors about a new Apple Watch, set to arrive in the fall of 2017 — and while I realize it’s never good to judge things solely based on a rumor, it does sound a bit disappointing. You and I have talked previously about the fact that Apple feels like it’s dropped behind in the innovation game in the last couple of years: favoring slow, iterative improvements on its products, rather than the kind of “tear it up and start again” mentality that made it such an exciting company in the late 1990s and 2000s. The Apple Watch Series 3 is supposed to feature better battery life and performance upgrades. That’s all well and good as an iterative upgrade, but I don’t think it’s something that’s going to get skeptics interested in the device if they aren’t already. I always kept an open mind about the Apple Watch: slightly doubtful about the smartwatch form factor, but hoping that Apple had cracked the formula and could show me something I’d not thought about previously. There are, of course, the usual caveats here: a disappointing seller for Apple is a great seller by any other company’s standards, maybe Apple doesn’t expect customers to upgrade every year, yada yada yada. But if we’re entering into the third generation of Apple Watch, I feel like there should be some unique vision for what this device does that’s different from Apple’s other products — and it sure doesn’t feel that way. At this rate, it’s basically settling into being an Apple TV level of device; essentially a “nice to have” that will appeal to a select few customers, but which isn’t a priority for Apple. Maybe that’s enough, but considering that a lot was riding on the Apple Watch (not least proving that it can still launch a new category of device people will get excited about) it doesn’t sound like the company is any closer to cracking the formula than it was when the first Apple Watch came out. Killian Bell: I certainly understand some of your concerns here. Apple made significant performance and battery life improvements with Apple Watch Series 2, and I think further improving upon these things for the third-generation model is kind of pointless. Granted, battery life improvements are always welcome, and the longer I can wear my Apple Watch before I have to charge it up again, the better. But how fast does Apple Watch really need to be? It works great now, but there’s only so much we’re going to want to do with apps built for a tiny device we wear on our wrists. I would certainly prefer it if Apple focused its efforts on integrating things like 4G connectivity, and making Apple Watch much slimmer. I’m not really interested in a FaceTime camera, but that’s another upgrade I know a lot of users are crying out for. But Apple has to find the right balance. Right now, Apple Watch is probably the best it can be with the technology Apple has at its disposal. If the company was to add additional features — like those mentioned above — it has to make room for more components, and that means making Apple Watch thicker (no one wants that). Alternatively, it has to reduce the size of other internals. Now, it’s probably safe to assume most of those internals are already as small as they can be for now. The only thing Apple could shrink with ease is Apple Watch’s battery (and no one wants that, either). So, it seems Apple is stuck between a rock and a hard place. There’s only so much it can do with Apple Watch right now, and while its existing design might be getting a little old, Apple isn’t going to change it just for the sake of change. Apple doesn’t overhaul its hardware unless there’s good reason for it. With the exception of the iPhone, which has traditionally received a new design every two years, Apple’s products typically carry the same look for several years. The iPad Air series (and now the 9.7-inch iPad Pro) has looked the same for over three years. The iMac hasn’t changed in over four. Apple doesn’t invest in new designs unless there’s good reason for it. Luke: But wait, aren’t you arguing that it wouldn’t be disappointing if this turns out to be the next Apple Watch? In terms of changing the Apple Watch by, say, making it round or thinner is a very subjective discussion, but features like making it iPhone independent — or having a proper use-case for it should be things we should have by the time a third-generation product ships. Personally, I think the Apple Watch was the wrong direction for Apple to go in altogether. For me, the best case scenario for it is that it winds up being what the Newton MessagePad was: an ahead-of-its-time product which paved the way for a genuinely great product Apple shipped 15 years later. It certainly doesn’t seem like Apple has a whole lot of vision for what this can be, besides a shrunk-down iPhone for your wrist. Judging by the bored reaction from watchOS developers, it certainly doesn’t seem like it’s struck much of a chord with them, either, as far as compelling use cases go. The Watch feels more and more like a market Apple felt it had to try and compete in, rather than one it wanted to compete in. Yes, I don’t doubt that Jony Ive likes the idea of entering the luxury goods watch market, but for your average customer, I don’t think this has been an exciting product. If the reports of shrinking customer interest in smartwatches are accurate, then I don’t think this rumored Apple Watch Series 3 is likely to change people’s minds. Do you? Killian: I’m not saying I won’t be a little disappointed, but I think it’s unrealistic to expect major changes just yet. Like I said, adding new components means making sacrifices — like cutting battery life — and we know Apple isn’t going to make them just to add a new feature to a product sheet. I don’t believe the features you’ve mentioned are things we should have by the time Apple Watch Series 3 arrives. We’re not entitled to anything, and no one is forcing us to upgrade to the next model. Like I said, there’s only so much Apple can do with the technology available. I don’t agree Apple Watch was the wrong direction to go in, either. I think Apple needed to have a presence in the smartwatch market. When Android Wear first debuted, consumers suddenly became excited about wearables, and I know several people who swapped their iPhone for an Android device just so that they could own a smartwatch. I certainly don’t think a large percentage of people were doing that, but still, Apple needed to compete. I do agree, however, that Apple probably doesn’t know what to do with Apple Watch just yet — and that’s because no one knows what to do with smartwatches right now. None of them have changed significantly in recent years, and they’re still devices that are nice to have, but aren’t necessary. Apple is doing more than most, though — especially when it comes to health and fitness. Maybe smartwatches will never become a necessity, but that doesn’t mean Apple should stop making them. Apple Watch seems to be selling very well — no other smartwatch comes close — and although you claim developers are bored, there’s an incredibly large catalog of excellent watchOS apps that’s growing every day. So they’re still supporting it. If Apple was to give up on Apple Watch just because it’s not quite sure what to do with it yet, surely it should also give up on iPad, iPod, Mac mini, and Apple TV? None of these things have changed significantly in recent years; they’re just getting incremental upgrades to keep sales ticking over while Apple thinks up something revolutionary. Luke: The trouble with what you’re saying is that the whole point of Apple being the size that it is is that it doesn’t, or shouldn’t, need to compete in a market just because other people are doing so. Others have been making VR headsets for a while now, and Apple’s yet to come out with its own version of Oculus Rift. Increasingly the watch feels, for Tim Cook, what the Newton was for John Sculley: a device to try and prove can follow what Steve Jobs did and prove that Apple’s still innovative. The difference is that the Newton turned out to be way ahead of what the competition was doing, while the Apple Watch is keeping pace with an ailing product category. I really want to like the Apple Watch. As smart homes mature, who knows, maybe this will become the perfect control mechanism by which we control our devices. Maybe Apple will eventually get it classified as a medical device and come up with smart sensors which could make this a useful diagnostic tool, subsidized by more insurance companies. But right now it’s none of those things — and the best defense I’ve ever had is from people like yourself who effectively argue “well, it wasn’t meant to be all that great.” But maybe I’m wrong.

Friday Night Fights is a series of weekly death matches between two no-mercy brawlers who will fight to the death — or at least agree to disagree — about which is better: Apple or Google, iOS or Android? Leave a comment Deals of the Day See all deals RF9 Samsung Gear S3 looks really nice. The rotating bezel seems more innovative as a user interface than the crown. They also have LTE integrated and a 4-day battery life (presumably without LTE.) Honestly I’m jealous and tempted. I love my Apple Watch Series 2, but it seems like they can do “better” than just performance and battery life. If they can at least get to an always-on screen option and/or longer battery life, that would be helpful. It already has about two-days of battery for me (even with workouts.) I would really like to see it get LTE (or 3G) connectivity like Gear S3 or LG Urbane. Jeremy Vaughn I’ve generated $84 ,000 right now now working over the internet moreover I’m a full time student .

It is actually seriously so easy to use so I’m just very glad that I found out regarding it . The potential within this is limitless . Here’s everything I do>>> FL-Y.COM/3kz0 David Starry I have read many reviews of the watch. I feel, not unlike many of the comments presented here that they are too overreaching and are in line with the fud that is generally generated around Apple products and its stock value. Batteries in all devices have been complained about since the beginning so it just seem silly to include them. The watch has delivered on what Tim Cook said it was for, to keep the phone out of my hands. I measure my phones battery life now in days and not hours due to the watch. Given it is still a young product category I can’t imagine how fast its maturity is supposed to be measured. Criticizing its grow without something to measure it by seems to be moot at this point. Removing the fud would be a nice place to start disguising its potential. I have read and imagined its health benefits like contacting emergency help for a heart attack. Being able to carry your own health records with you at all times. Given how long it takes to get a product to market I can just image what they are working on today that we won’t see for several more years. Trying to keep it simple to use must be the most frustrating part of developing, same with the iPhone. I see people fumbling around with their android phones everyday because it has so many options its gets confusing. I have tried to teach people how to use a computer for a long time but it is just too confusing for most people unless its for a job, well even then. Steve Jobs made it possible for everyday people to learn how to use a computer easily. I feel this is key to how and when the watch gets more features. Maybe they are aiming at security features of use for the watch. A dive computer. Overall I am very satisfied with the watch and what it can do for me today. Thank you for the discussion. devjah Hope they’re not adding FaceTime camera. If I’m going to FaceTime, I’m not gonna do this on my watch. WTF disqus_YEXmx1H3xe Top end watches don’t need to be upgraded all that often. My last watch was a Tag and I wore it for 15 years. When Apple comes out with a big innovation, I’ll probably be compelled to replace my Watch. Until then, I am quite happy with my original Watch. It does everything Apple said it would and pushes me to get a lot more exercise than my Tag did. In short, step by step innovation gets more people hooked and then a big change pushes us all to replace the one we have already bought. I would love to see more accurate sensors, wireless charging that allows it to charge while I’m wearing it, etc.Still, it does exactly what I bought it for and I will continue using it until a new feature is worth the retail price to me. wakeupmymac Meh Surprised that no one mentioned an edge to edge screen. For me the interface is too clumsy, taps, swipes etc aren’t registered properly making the simplest tasks frustrating. Often it is still easier for me to go find my phone. At the moment, for me at least, it is nothing more than a glorified step counter and occasional heart rate monitor. Josh Turiel With Series 2, it’s a good device that checks all the boxes to be a solid watch. The price is reasonable for a nice mechanical watch (it isn’t, and never will be, anything like a competitor for the $50 Timex or Casio). It is stylish enough to not be super dorky like most smartwatches are so far. It’s waterproof. The battery life is finally at the point where a normal person could not charge it one night and still be able to use it the next day. The functionality is great as it stands just on notification management and fitness alone. Not that it can’t improve more over time, but a watch is what it is, and there’s only so much you can cram into that form factor. I’m happy with my Series 2, my family enjoys their 1st gen watches, and I don’t think there’s any good reason to upgrade annually. Every few years is fine for a device like this. I don’t really care about cellular connectivity, either. Just increase battery life each generation and I’ll be happy, along with a little bit of styling updating once in a while. I’m sure there will be some new functionality as time goes by but I honestly can’t think of anything I want that isn’t already there. I don’t want a cell phone on my wrist. I just want a smart watch. Adrian Agreed–notifications and fitness mean that this watch is worth it. All I need when I upgrade from Series 2 to maybe Series 4 is better battery life, perhaps with the distance charging that Apple is supposedly working on (according to the TWiT podcast this last week) — maybe it’ll be charging while I’m sleeping and it’s collecting sleep data. For me this thing on my wrist as magical as my phone, as long as I know that it’s a watch, not a phone. The killer uses for me are: “Now Playing” that lets me control volume and skips for music & podcast apps Texts – quick glance & quick replies to short texts Ping – make my phone ping when misplaced — I use this 10x/wk recording apps – (“Just Press Record”, “Mic’d”, “Say&Go” are all good) for notes either on the watch or the phone Nike+ and the workout app – these really honestly have make me run the extra mile harder, and have paid for the watch, I’m sure, in a longer and more fit life Other apps I use very often and which have added significant value are: Dark Sky for weather, GTasks for my tasks, Fantastical for what’s next, Heart Watch for heart stats, Breathe for slowing down and changing perspective, Capture for camera remote, Streaks for staying on track with behaviors, V for Wikipedia to buzz me about local pts. of interest, Shazam for quickly getting that song, lyrics, and bookmarking it Plus a timer, sunrise-sunset, Siri, a stopwatch, ATV remote, alarm and other complications. In reviews and discussions I see little about these functions, which I find are fast & easy to use. What I’ve done that I feel many others haven’t is spend time on the learning curve, including a couple of hours today, so I can use the watch as quickly as I do my phone. It has taken time to learn how things work and what apps and complications work best for me. Like “Now Playing” does with music and podcasts, the “Home” app gives me very very quick access to controlling my Hue lighting. I agree that this may become even more useful as my HomeKit rolls more smart devices (what’s taking you so long, Apple?). I totally love having this control on my wrist instead of pulling my humongous 6sPlus out of the pocket (or finding it where I lay it down). Tip: get the Nike+ model for the same price. Aftermarket bands are cheap on amazon. For me this thing is just short of a miraculous piece of technology as is, and the whining I hear is not understandable. David McAfee I have been holding off getting an Apple Watch purely because of battery life.

Cook still did extremely well, with a compensation package valued at $8.7 million for Apple’s fiscal year that ended Sept. 24, according to a regulatory filing made Friday. But the amount was down from nearly $10.3 million in the prior year. The Cupertino, California, company cited a downturn in Apple’s revenue and operating profit as the main reason it cut the pay of Cook and its other top executives. Apple’s revenue dropped 8 percent to $216 billion, while its operating profit declined 16 percent to $60 billion. That was mainly because it sold fewer iPhones for the first time since the device came out in 2007. It also marked the first time that Apple’s annual revenue decreased since 2001, which was just before the company’s late co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the iPod. That digital music player set the stage for the iPhone and iPad. The iPhone triggered a revolution in mobile computing and became Apple’s biggest moneymaker, even as a wide range of device makers released competing products primarily running on Google’s free Android software. Most of the world’s smartphones are powered by Android, but the iPhone remains a popular high-priced status symbol. Even so, consumers are holding on to their existing iPhones for longer periods instead of upgrading to a newer model every year or two. That has raised investor concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone, a nagging worry that has been aggravated by the company’s inability to introduce another breakthrough product since Jobs’ death in 2011. Cook, Jobs’ anointed successor, had hoped Apple would have another huge hit with a smartwatch unveiled in 2014, but that device has only had moderate success. Read: Vodafone announced ‘SuperHour’ at Rs 16, offering unlimited 4G data for 1 hr Apple’s regulatory filing revealed that the company was bracing for a sales drop last year, although not quite as steep as what occurred. The compensation committee for Apple’s board of directors had established a revenue goal of $224 billion for last year, which would have been a 4 percent decline from the previous year. The company expected sales to rebound during the holiday shopping season on hopes that consumers would be snapping up its latest iPhones, the 7 and 7 Plus. Apple will release its quarterly results that include the holidays later this month.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Stocks Forex Commodities Gold & Silver Today's Pick Portfolio Tracker Boosted by Apple, Wall Street parties like it’s 19,999 Reuters   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet The value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average shown above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) as it nears 20,000 in New York, US, on Friday. Photo: Reuters Jan 6:   The Dow came within one point of 20,000 for the first time on Friday and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 reached record highs, boosted by Apple, extending a two-month rally fuelled by optimism about US President-elect Donald Trump. Apple climbed 1.1 per cent after Canada’s Competition Bureau did not find sufficient evidence the iPhonemaker had engaged in anti-competitive conduct, closing a two-year investigation into the company. Wall Street has been on a tear since Trump won the US election in November, with the Dow up 9 per cent as investors bet he will stimulate the economy with lower taxes and infrastructure spending. While Friday’s gains suggested the rally was not yet over, some investors have grown cautious. “The market’s advance is understandable because of the economic stimulus optimism associated with a new Trump presidency,” said CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall. “But parabolic market advances traditionally experience digestion of these gains, and I don’t think this time will be any different.” The record trading session followed a US Labour Department report that showed the economy added fewer-than-expected jobs last month but wages increased, suggesting resilience in the labour market. Stocks did not react significantly to a report that five people were dead in a shooting at Florida’s Fort Lauderdale airport. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 64.51 points,or 0.32 per cent, to end at 19,963.8 points. The index rose as high as 19,999.63 but lost ground. Goldman Sachs rose1.48 per cent, helping the Dow more than any other stock. The S&P 500 gained 7.98 points, or 0.35 per cent, to2,276.98, its highest close ever. The Nasdaq Composite added 33.12 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 5,521.06, also a record. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, led by the technology sector’s 0.96 per cent gain. For the week, the Dow rose 1 per cent while the S&P gained 1.7 per cent and the Nasdaq jumped 2.6 per cent. Investors eye earnings The strength of fourth-quarter earnings reports from US companies over the next few weeks will be closely watched by investors eyeing high stock valuations. Following its recent gains, the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, pricey compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Analysts on average expect fourth-quarter earnings to rise 6.1 per cent compared to a year before, when slumping oil prices crippled energy companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. During the session, Amgen rose 2.48 per cent after a US district judge blocked Sanofi and Regeneron from selling their cholesterol drug, which Amgen said infringed its patents. Regeneron fell 5.84 per cent and was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P 500. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a1.11-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 24 new 52-week highs and no new lows; theNasdaq Composite recorded 76 new highs and 15 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, abit under the 6.7 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Chinese smart phone brands such as Huawei, Lenovo, Xiaomi, ZTE, Coolpad, etc., together with Apple and Samsung, etc. were granted this honor. Since 2007, Apple and Google released the first smart phone successively, smart connected devices and smart phones have entered a fast-growing golden decade. According to relevant statistics, the annual growth rate of smart connected devices was not less than 25% from 2009 to 2014. While due to the constant market saturation, consumers slowed down their demand for new mobile phones. Consequently, smart phone growth rate came to an inflection point in 2015 and declined to single digits in 2016. However, smart connected devices have achieved rapid technological development in during past decade, a series of innovations such as Touch Screen, Metal Chassis, Fingerprint Recognition, Type-C Interface and Force Touch. Meanwhile, transformation and development of smart connected devices have been constantly promoted by the mobile Internet and intelligent applications. Therefore, in the new era of intelligence, smart connected devices and smart phone brands can effectively improve their second growth only by continuous technical adjustments and active transformation to the Internet and intellectualization. Although Apple and Samsung still remain the top two in the global smart connected devices and smart phones market, these well-known brands are gradually losing their strong appeal to users with the occurrence of Samsung Note 7 battery explosion accident and iPhone innovation ability decline. Coolpad, Huawei, ZTE, OPPO, vivo and other domestic high-end smart phones begin to dominate the market gradually and are accepted by more users. Thus, there are still opportunities for smart connected devices and smart phones market in the future. Only by continuous development of innovative technology and products, making hardware design panders to consumers' habits and conforms to the kinesiology principles, software applications with more humanization and operating comfortableness, can manufacturers give more vitality and competitiveness to their brands. Campaigns like 2016-2017 Global Top 20 Smart Connected Devices Brands and 2016-2017 Global Top 15 Smart Phones Brands are carried out to encourage intelligent terminal device enterprises and smart phone companies to conduct technological innovation actively, foster innovative products and promote industrial innovation and upgrading of intelligence.

Samsung, Apple, Huawei, OPPO, Vivo, LG, Xiaomi, ZTE, TCL-Alcatel, Gionee, Lenovo, Letv, Motorola, Coolpad and HTC had their names on the list of 2016-2017 Global Top 15 Smart Phones Brands. In the Individual Award aspect, Cool Changer S1 won the award of The Best Overall Performing Smartphone of 2016, ROBOO won the Annual Global "A.I. Robot for Kids" Gold Award. Mr. Patrick Kenealy said at the awards ceremony, "The year of 2017 will usher in the first decade of the development of smart connected devices and smart phones. Under the stimulus of innovative technology, smart phone and terminal industry now are undergoing drastic changes. The global smart phone market is basically captured by Apple, Samsung and a number of Chinese brands. We can see that with the trend of intellectualization, smart connected devices manufacturers headed by Chinese brands are constantly accelerating transformation and upgrading and striving for innovation. Based on the innovation of smart connected devices and smart phone manufacturers in terms of technology, design, interaction and user experience, these selection activities comprehensively analyzed and evaluated the development of global smart connected devices and smart phone industry in 2016, thus creating a better future for smart connected devices and smart phone companies." "It is a great honor for Coolpad to be named again on the lists of 2016-2017 Global Top 20 Smart Connected Devices Brands and Global Top 15 Smart Phones Brands, and Cool Changer S1 won the award of The Best Overall Performing Smartphone of 2016," Coolpad Group said, "The explosive development of mobile Internet and intelligent technology in recent years has created an unprecedented opportunity for Coolpad. Last year, it took us a whole year for strategic transformation, from product R&D to top-quality products, as well as more emphasis placed on brand influence. In the future, Coolpad will be more dedicated and professional to strive for excellence and provide products with more elegant appearance and better performance. Meanwhile, we will continue to focus on superior product strategy to introduce more ecological hardware platforms and intelligent hardware related products. Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. remarked, "We are happy that Huawei has been included into the list of 2016-2017 Global Top 20 Smart Connected Devices Brands and 2016-2017 Global Top 15 Smart Phones Brands. It indicates that the smart & connected industry and users have recognized Huawei's efforts over the years. Now Huawei Mate 9 and other flagship phones of Huawei with a series of new technologies like Leica dual camera, topnotch security solutions, and EMUI 5.0 OS can provide a more intuitive user experience. In the future, Huawei, by virtue of its advantages in 5G technology, will continue to reform and innovate to further develop information and communications technology, strengthen its industry leading position, strive to build itself into a smartphone brand winning more extensive recognition from consumers worldwide, and build a better connected world in an all-round way." Samsung Group noted, "Despite the fact that Samsung develops virtual reality and produces screens and processors for VR headsets based on its hardware manufacturing background, Chinese manufacturers offering low prices might pose a threat to it in price in a year or two. Samsung hopes to build a whole ecosystem through various ways where ordinary consumers can make their own content easily and communicate with friends via VR. Samsung is trying to provide the best user experience for customers, based on which it will make necessary improvements and innovations." Driven by innovative technology in the era of intelligence, global smart connected devices and smart phone industry will usher in a new leap once again, bringing a new round of development opportunities to brands and enterprises. Let's bear witness to the birth of the 2016-2017 Global Top 20 Smart Connected Devices Brands and 2016-2017 Global Top 15 Smart Phones Brands, make a comprehensive understanding on the development process and pattern evolution of global smart connected devices and smart phone brands in the past ten years, and experience the power of technological innovation together.

A drone that can dive into water and help anglers catch a big one. CES 2017, the consumer tech event held in Las Vegas this week, featured vendors with automated baubles, humanoid robots and "smart" everything -- a dishwasher, hairbrush and lawnmower, to name a few. But it's not so much the gadgets as their underlying technology that will make CIOs -- who seek out new tools for business, not the home or yard -- stop, look and listen. "The underlying theme is, everything's becoming connected and everything's getting smarter," said Mark Hung, an analyst at research outfit Gartner. Hung spoke to me from the show floor of the Las Vegas convention. The internet of things (IoT), which links devices, sensors and appliances to the web, and artificial intelligence (AI), which is getting better at mimicking the human kind, played big at CES 2017 -- and they'll eventually have an enormous impact on business applications. The manufacturing industry is already taking advantage of IoT, Hung said. For example, companies are connecting field equipment, so when things like turbines malfunction, they can notify a remote repair technician. One "huge potential market" that will eventually connect more of its machines, Hung said, is healthcare, where mobile medical applications and wearable devices can help improve patients' health. Smart, augmented consumer tech AI will have an equally seismic effect on business, said Alan Lepofsky, an analyst at Constellation Research Inc. He wasn't at CES, but he said the advanced AI software showcased there -- digital personal assistants like Microsoft's Cortana, which automakers Nissan and BMW will incorporate into their cars to help drivers form itineraries or shift into park -- gives a sneak preview on an improved way of working. "In the past, machines augmented our physical capabilities. Now, AI is augmenting our mental capabilities," said Lepofsky, who recently completed research on AI's impact on work. For example, Cortana can help someone writing a report by looking up related information, adding context and citations, he said. And then there's augmented reality, also turning heads at CES 2017. Known by the shorthand AR, the technology superimposes what people see with their own eyes with computer-generated information. An architect, say, looking at a recently constructed building can hold an iPad up to a wall and see the blueprints overlaid on top of it. AR's effect will be immense in businesses, Lepofsky said, even more so than cloud computing, which companies are adopting to reduce the cost and maintenance of IT and to experiment with new technologies, or mobile devices, which millions of employees use for work tasks. "Is cloud really a new way to work? Well, no, most people don't care where the back end of their stuff is stored," Lepofsky said. "Is mobile a new way to work? Well, I could access my information more often than I could [on a PC], but really I'm doing the same things -- I'm reading email or going into Slack." But AR -- long before its cousin, virtual reality, which is geared toward entertainment like gaming or videos -- is going to be used "to add context and information to our business scenarios," Lepofsky said. New iterations of existing technology like smart glasses could hasten the arrival of AR in businesses. Startups like ODG and Lumus, showed off glasses that can display more information than what prototypes like Google Glass could a few years ago -- and they look like regular glasses, not a mad scientist's headgear. "The whole category of smart glasses absolutely will make [AR] more mainstream," he said. "They're getting to the stage with computing power and battery life that they will become smaller. Not next year, not the year after -- but the nirvana will be that these will be in your contact lenses." New tools, new tests, no privacy CIOs pushing for digital transformation -- helping their companies build new business models using digital technology -- will be at the forefront of efforts to introduce cool new consumer tech into business, Lepofsky said. But even they will face big challenges as they start introducing things like digital assistants and AR. One is how much information people will let their employers know about them. "As these devices and IoT and digital assistants become more ingrained -- tracking my heart rate, tracking my respiratory system, tracking my blood sugar, tracking my cholesterol -- how much do I want my employer to know that?" Lepofsky said. "Privacy versus convenience is a huge thing for CIOs to focus on." And then there's the question of how to best store the massive amounts of data such applications require -- something CIOs are already grappling with, Hung said. And cybersecurity -- making sure that information is viewed only by people who are authorized. It's something CIOs without cutting-edge AR implementations know well. "The past couple of years, every other week or maybe even every week, you hear these security attacks that happened on unsecured endpoints," Hung said. "So how to balance ease of use with security is definitely an ongoing challenge." CIO news roundup for week of Jan. 2 The technology press was focused on consumer tech at CES 2017, and we were along for the ride. But it was a big week for other news, too. Senate hearing on U.S. cybersecurity and Russian hacking. Top U.S. intelligence officials asserted their confidence in Russia's involvement in a series of hacks into Democratic Party databases and candidate emails, intended to influence the 2016 presidential elections, at a Thursday hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC).  Congress must work together to "devise comprehensive solutions to deter, defend against, and, when necessary, respond to foreign cyberattacks," Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chairman of the SASC, said during the hearing. President-elect Donald Trump was briefed on the Russian hacking intelligence report Friday. Meanwhile, Minority House Leader Nancy Pelosi said intelligence disclosures in the report, portions of which will be made public Friday, are "stunning." Apple invests $1 billion in Vision Fund. Apple confirmed Wednesday it is investing $1 billion in the $100 billion tech fund to be run by Japanese telecom and financial conglomerate SoftBank. "We believe their new fund will speed the development of technologies which may be strategically important to Apple," Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock told Reuters. SoftBank chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son announced the creation of the SoftBank Vision Fund in October with a $45 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. Qualcomm, Foxconn and Oracle founder Larry Ellison have also since joined the list of investors, according to Benjamin Spicehandler, a representative for SoftBank, making the London-based tech fund one of the world's largest pools of private capital. Apple's $1 billion investment is on par with its investment in Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing last May. California outlaws ransomware. On Jan. 1, a new law went into effect in California, making the use of ransomware a felony punishable by up to four years in a state prison. Senate Bill 1137, authored by state Sen. Bob Hertzberg (D-Calif.), was signed by California Gov. Jerry Brown in September last year after a string of ransomware attacks hit California hospitals. "This legislation provides prosecutors the clarity they need to charge and convict perpetrators of ransomware ... This bill treats this crime, which is essentially an electronic stickup, with the seriousness it deserves," Hertzberg said in a statement issued in 2016. Wyoming was the first state to outlaw ransomware, in 2014.  Verizon still unsure about Yahoo deal. Marni Walden, a Verizon executive vice president, said the company is reviewing the impact of the billion-user data breach that Yahoo reported in December last year and is unsure whether Verizon will proceed with closing the $4.8 billion Yahoo deal. "Unfortunately, I can't sit here today and say with confidence one way or the other because we still don't know," the Wall Street Journal reported Malden as saying at an investor conference in Las Vegas on Thursday. Earlier Thursday, AOL Chief Executive Tim Armstrong told CNBC he "remains hopeful the deal will close." Assistant editor Mekhala Roy contributed to this week's news roundup.

Picture: REUTERS Beijing — An influential Chinese state-run tabloid has chided the New York Times over its reporting practices after Apple removed the newspaper’s app from its China app store at the request of the Chinese government. The Global Times editorial, released on Friday, said the New York Times had in the past four years been "trying to wield influence in China’s internal affairs" by doing investigative stories on sensitive subjects. It did not give specific examples. "China is sincere in opening itself up but the prerequisite is to ensure its political security," said the editorial in the Global Times, an influential tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily. "The Western media should not question China if it is to close its doors by scrutinising one particular issue." Apple removed the newspaper’s English and Chinese-language apps on December 23, citing requests from authorities. The Global Times said Apple "cares most about business, so it is willing to respect Chinese laws", adding that Apple faced tough competition from local brands in Greater China. The New York Times pointed to a recent investigative report on government subsidies offered to Apple supplier Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, as a possible reason for the ban. In an report on the app’s removal, the New York Times cited their own spokeswoman as saying the app was removed shortly after a journalist made requests to government authorities, Foxconn and Apple seeking comment for the story. The New York Times called on Apple to reconsider the ban, and said the block was part of a wider attempt to prevent readers from accessing the US publication. The newspaper is one of many foreign publications that is blocked within the country by China’s cyberauthority. But the apps from other blocked news sites, including the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times, remain available on the China app store as of Friday. The internet regulator has yet to respond to Reuters’ queries on the matter. "The development of the internet in China must respect China’s laws and regulations, in principle," foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Thursday in response to a question about the apps.

The FBI on Friday released 100 pages of heavily censored documents related to its agreement with an unidentified vendor to hack into an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, California, shooters, but it did not identify whom it paid to perform the work or how much it cost. The records were provided in response to a federal lawsuit filed against the FBI by The Associated Press, Vice Media and Gannett, the parent company of USA Today. The media organizations sued in September to learn how much the FBI paid and who it hired to break into the phone of Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 people at a holiday gathering of county workers in December 2015. The FBI for weeks had maintained that only Apple Inc. could access the information on its phone, which was protected by encryption, but ultimately broke or bypassed Apple's digital locks with the help of an unnamed third party. The FBI, in its records release Friday, censored critical details that would have shown how much the FBI paid, whom it hired and how it opened the phone. The files had been marked "secret" before they were turned over under the lawsuit. The files make clear that the FBI signed a nondisclosure agreement with the vendor. The records also show that the FBI received at least three inquiries from companies interested in developing a product to unlock the phone, but none had the ability to come up with a solution fast enough for the FBI. The FBI also said in contracting documents that it did not solicit competing bids or proposals because it thought widely disclosing the bureau's needs could harm national security. The lawsuit was filed months after the FBI's sudden announcement in March that it had purchased a tool from an unidentified third party to open Farook's phone. The disclosure aborted a court fight that began when a federal judge had directed Apple to help the FBI break into the phone. The suit by the media organizations argued there was no legal basis to withhold the information and challenged the adequacy of the FBI's search for relevant records. It also said the public had a right to know whether the vendor has adequate security measures, is a proper recipient of government funds and will act only in the public interest. In refusing to provide the records, the FBI said the records had been compiled for law enforcement purposes and might interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, even though at the time the shooters were both dead and there were no indications others were involved. It was the third lawsuit the AP has filed against the Obama administration under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. Share More > Vote ERROR: Macro /ads/dfp-ads is missing!

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Apple CEO Tim Cook's pay slumps along with iPhone sales By Associated Press Published: 19:16 EST, 6 January 2017 | Updated: 19:16 EST, 6 January 2017 e-mail SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple penalized CEO Tim Cook for the iPhone maker's first sales slump in 15 years with a 15 percent pay cut. Cook still did extremely well, with a compensation package valued at $8.7 million for Apple's fiscal year that ended Sept. 24, according to a regulatory filing made Friday. But the amount was down from nearly $10.3 million in the prior year. The Cupertino, California, company cited a downturn in Apple's revenue and operating profit as the main reason it cut the pay of Cook and its other top executives. Apple's revenue dropped 8 percent to $216 billion, while its operating profit declined 16 percent to $60 billion. That was mainly because it sold fewer iPhones for the first time since the device came out in 2007. It also marked the first time that Apple's annual revenue decreased since 2001, which was just before the company's late co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the iPod. That digital music player set the stage for the iPhone and iPad. The iPhone triggered a revolution in mobile computing and became Apple's biggest moneymaker, even as a wide range of device makers released competing products primarily running on Google's free Android software. Most of the world's smartphones are powered by Android, but the iPhone remains a popular high-priced status symbol. Even so, consumers are holding on to their existing iPhones for longer periods instead of upgrading to a newer model every year or two. That has raised investor concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone, a nagging worry that has been aggravated by the company's inability to introduce another breakthrough product since Jobs' death in 2011. Cook, Jobs' anointed successor, had hoped Apple would have another huge hit with a smartwatch unveiled in 2014, but that device has only had moderate success. Apple's regulatory filing revealed that the company was bracing for a sales drop last year, although not quite as steep as what occurred. The compensation committee for Apple's board of directors had established a revenue goal of $224 billion for last year, which would have been a 4 percent decline from the previous year. The company expected sales to rebound during the holiday shopping season on hopes that consumers would be snapping up its latest iPhones, the 7 and 7 Plus. Apple will release its quarterly results that include the holidays later this month. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Tim Cook’s compensation not spared as Apple misses performance goals Posted Jan 6, 2017 by John Mannes (@JohnMannes) 0 SHARES Next Story Polaroid’s Pop returns the brand to its iconic instant format As a result of Apple’s performance based executive compensation packages, CEO Tim Cook and other leaders within the company will be taking pay cuts. Apple missed internal revenue and operating income targets for 2016 by 3.7 and 0.5 percent respectively, resulting in a 15 percent cut for the CEO. Apple is reporting annual sales of $215.6 billion and operating income of $60 billion for the period ending September 24th 2016, according to a regulatory filing. Had the numbers not missed, Cook could have expected his 2015 compensation of $10.3 million to serve as a floor for 2016. Instead, the CEO will be hauling in $8.75 million. The drop is more severe than Apple’s actual miss, relatively speaking. Other Apple executives saw a slightly more modest 9 percent drop in compensation. Mr. Cook’s base salary did increase by 50% to $3 million — not to mention his large Apple stock holdings which haven’t been touched. This is the first time the company has missed its internal targets since 2009. Apple’s growth story has been somewhat cyclical, but every time the company’s value was in question, it delivered. Coming off a year that was neither failure nor success, the obvious question is whether the company can rebound. While some see the forthcoming 10th anniversary iPhone as make or break product for Apple, others point to the company’s growing services business as a potential salve. Left in the dark by Apple’s highly secretive R&D team, we can speculate near infinitely about a game-changing VR or AR device or heck even a self-driving car. Apple’s trading today doesn’t reflect a particularly hostile investor reaction. Apple shares are up over a percent on the day. The news about Cook’s compensation just simply isn’t that surprising. This was the year that Apple showed its vulnerability — the year that the sales volume of the company’s most important product, the iPhone, fell for the first time…ever. Eyes will be on Apple when it reports details on its first quarter results later this month on January 31st. This should provide additional clarity on sales of the iPhone 7 among other things.

Firm hints Apple set to be first customer for radical technique to charge phones from fifteen feet away The 10th anniversary iPhone could be the first to be completely wireless Energous specializes in long-distance wireless charging technology  Current wireless charging relies on contact between devices and a base unit  By Cecile Borkhataria For Dailymail.com Published: 12:21 EST, 6 January 2017 | Updated: 18:19 EST, 6 January 2017 e-mail 8 shares 6 View comments Rumors have emerged that the next iPhone will have wireless charging technology, making it the first completely wireless iPhone.  Steve Rizzone, CEO of California start-up firm Energous, fueled the rumors in an interview with The Verge where he said they've signed a 'key strategic partnership' with 'one of the largest consumer electronic companies in the world.'  The technology could work over distances up to 15 feet (4.5 metres) and is expected to be released toward the latter half of 2017, which would tie in with the expected release of three anticipated new models of iPhone. Scroll down for video Energous's WattUp technology could allow people to charge all of their devices wirelessly with software control that can enable you to prioritize which devices should be charged more quickly HOW WOULD IT WORK?  California start-up firm Energous is thought to be working on a mid-range wireless charging transmitter which could work over distances up to 15 feet (4.5 metres).  The 'WattUp' platform, which uses small antennas to transfer energy over fairly long distances.  It works at greater distances than existing wireless charging solutions that rely on traditional inductive charging coils. The charging process is controlled by software, meaning end users can decide the order in which devices receive power and create schedules for their charging. Mr Rizzone said he couldn't reveal the company his firm is working with, but he can 'virtually guarantee that you have products from this company on your person sitting on your desk, or at home.' In a research note from market analyst Louis Basenese, which was obtained by Apple Insider, a number of other connections between Apple and Energous were made.  Among them is the defection of Apple's Regulatory Certification Program Manager Billy Manning. Mr Manning spent seven years at the company before joining Energous as Director of Regulatory Operations in September 2016. It has also emerged that Energous is working with Apple suppliers Dialog Semiconductor and Pegatron.

Share this article Share Current wireless charging relies on contact between devices and a base unit (pictured). But leaked information suggests Apple is working with Energous, who specialise in long-distance wireless charging technology SHOULD YOU UPGRADE TO THE IPHONE 7?  Some technology sites are advising users to hold off on upgrading their iPhones until the next year's version, which will mark the 10-year anniversary of Apple's revolutionary handset. Analysts say the iPhone 8 may feature a curved display that reaches from one edge of the device to the other and a home button integrated into the screen. But patents previously filed by the Apple suggest the technology giant has also been exploring the option of more traditional inductive wireless charging. A patent applied for by the firm, details of which emerged in September 2016, refers to an 'inductive charging station' similar to the plastic wireless charger used by the Apple Watch. The move would also fit with suggestions that the iPhone 8 will feature glass casing, to support wireless charging. Serbian-American inventor Nikolai Tesla first envisaged long-distance wireless electrical transfer more than 100 years ago.  But it is yet to make its way to the mainstream.  Previous rumours suggested Taiwan firm Foxconn Technology Group, a division of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, were making wireless charging modules to go with Apple's next iPhone. A patent applied for by the firm (pictured), details of which emerged in September 2016, refers to an 'inductive charging station' similar to the plastic wireless charger used by the Apple Watch Apple's upcoming iPhone 8 (artist's impression pictured) could be set to ditch the current aluminium and glass design in favour of a plastic OLED screen that curves 'all over' Rumours also suggest the iPhone 8 could be made from Bulk Amorphous Alloy, which is a mix of titanium, nickel, copper and zirconium melted together. This is said to have the smooth texture of glass and the rigid sturdiness of rubber (artist's impression)  IPHONE 8 RUMOURS  Several rumours have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have: - Dual-lens 3D camera - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings - Curved glass casing - Plastic OLED screen - Wireless charging - A folding element - New 5 inch (12.7 centimetre) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimetre) models - A new 'pure white' model A research note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo obtained by MacRumors commented on industry expectations. Mr Kuo said: ‘We believe one of the reasons why new iPhones will switch from metal casing to glass casing is to support wireless charging. ‘In order to ensure a superior performance, we believe it is most appropriate for EMS suppliers to develop and make the wireless charger because then a comprehensive test can be conducted.’ ‘As Hon Hai needs to deploy most resources to develop and produce OLED iPhone, we expect Pegatron will be the exclusive supplier of the wireless charger.’ A wireless charger would also solve a problem caused by Apple ditching the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone. It would enable users to charge their phone while simultaneously using the Lightning port to plug in a pair of headphones. Some technology sites are advising users to hold off on upgrading their iPhones until the next year's version, which will mark the 10-year anniversary of Apple's revolutionary handset. Analysts say the iPhone 8 may feature a curved display that reaches from one edge of the device to the other and a home button integrated into the screen.

Credit: Adam Patrick Murray More like this The essential AirPod user guide for iPhones, Macs and Android When A.I. whispers in your ear all day 8 most significant tech gadgets of 2016: Winners and losers Video Mingis on Tech: New year, new CES -- and new AirPods At a Glance AirPods $159.00 MSRP $159.00 View on Apple There's a lot to like about Apple's new wireless AirPods. From the ease of the initial setup to the small carrying case that doubles as a charger to the sound quality of the speakers and directional mics, the AirPods do a lot of things right -- elegantly, even -- yet they are not entirely without flaws. The $159 wireless headphones were announced back in September, but didn't start shipping until last month and were quickly backordered. Only recently have customers actually started receiving them and they're still a rare find at Apple Stores. (Buying directly from Apple's online store means a six week wait before the order ships.) Apple Store employees have told me that they receive daily shipments, and sell out quickly. Your best bet if you want a pair sooner rather than later is to track availability at your local Apple Store via iStockNow.com. That's what I did just before Christmas. I was able to use the Apple Store iPhone app to purchase my pair on Dec. 21 from the Providence Place Apple Store in Rhode Island as soon as iStockNow's availability indicator lit up green. Within a minute, that store was out of stock. Open box, easy setup In the box is the pair of AirPods, the small white carrying case that doubles as a charger, a Lightning-to-USB cable similar (if not identical) to the one that ships with iPhones and basic documentation -- a small foldout pamphlet with simple instructions for pairing and using the AirPods. Adam Patrick Murray AirPods are compatible with iOS devices capable of running iOS 10, any Mac capable of running macOS Sierra, and any Apple Watch running watchOS 3. To work seamlessly between devices, all must share the same iCloud account. Using the same iCloud account is part of what allows Apple to boast they're "magical;" it makes setup a breeze. Once the AirPods are paired up with one of your Apple devices, they're paired up with all your devices sharing the same iCloud account. AirPod setup is as follows: unlock your iPhone, open the lid of the AirPod carrying case within a couple of inches of the iPhone, and tap Connect on the iPhone's screen. That's it. Your iPhone -- and now, every Apple device you own -- can use your AirPods. This is possible because they use Apple's custom W1 chipset. It piggy-backs on the existing Bluetooth protocol and means AirPods are compatible with anything that can stream through Bluetooth, including Android phones. The W1 chipset doesn't just help with pairing, though; it is designed to help maintain a stable connection to each individual AirPod while maintaining about five hours of continuous battery life. (Editor's note: The W1 chip is also used in several new Beats headphones and allows the same easy setup and lengthy battery time.) The AirPods represent Apple's follow-up to the elimination of the analog audio jack in the iPhone 7. In addition to providing a dongle if you need to connect an older pair of headphones, Apple rolled out new technology that improves on current wireless implementations. Notice that I said improved, not perfected. But we'll get to that in a bit. Fit, feel and sound The AirPods are in-ear, but they aren't the type that squeezes into your ear canal. This means wearing them doesn't block ambient noise. Initially, I used the AirPods one at a time while doing chores or fixing computers at work. But I've found that even with both AirPods in, hearing your surroundings isn't a challenge if the volume is kept low. The speakers have a good range of volume and a pretty good balance of highs, lows, and mids. Bass is, well, bass is bass on a tinny speaker; existing technology hasn't changed that. But to my non-audiophile ears, the sound is more than acceptable and into "very good" territory. (My previous go-to earphones were the SmartOmi Boots mini wireless earbuds, which are in-ear and thus provide better bass.) Michael deAgonia From left to right, a SmartOmi Boots mini wireless earbud, an AirPod and the standard Apple EarPods. Despite the ease with which the AirPods slip on, it takes a lot of effort to knock them out. In my use -- which has involved running, weight-lifting, a couple of bouts of Insanity classes, and, just to see if I could knock them out, sustained head-banging -- the only time they fell out of my ears was when they were physically knocked out. (Other people have reported less luck keeping them in place, though; your mileage may vary.) Using them There are a couple of ways to interact with the AirPods, but because they lack buttons, actions are limited. Inserting one or both AirPods will sound a chime, alerting you that they're connected and ready. While audio is playing, removing one will pause the audio -- perfect if someone walks up to chat. Placing the AirPod back in your ear automatically resumes whatever you were listening to beforehand. If you remove both AirPods and then put them back in your ear, you have to manually trigger the audio to re-start. Double-tapping either AirPods brings up Siri or Play/Pause your audio source, depending on your setting. (Settings can be changed in the Bluetooth category in iPhone Settings.) And...that's it. To do anything else, you use Siri, which responds to commands for adjusting volume, skipping tracks, starting playlists, and other Siri-related functions like getting the weather, placing phone calls and dictating messages. The built-in microphones pick up audio really well (using what Apple calls a voice accelerometer in concert with the beamforming mics). At work -- in a quiet cube farm environment -- I invoked Siri but didn't want to disturb coworkers with audible commands. To my surprise, the AirPods were able to pick up commands I whispered. Using your voice to control basic functions works well enough; but Siri still needs enhanced capabilities to make the experience better. For instance, using Siri means that there needs to be an active internet connection, even for on-device functions like skipping tracks or volume adjustment. And Siri often displays the answer to a question on the iPhone screen instead of reading it out loud. So in that sense, Siri is a letdown. Support for local functions without an internet connection would be a good improvement. So would adding configurable multiple-tap options per AirPod. (In addition to the two taps that initiate Siri, there could be options for three taps on the right AirPod to skip, and three taps on the left to go back a track, etc. Thankfully, that's an option that could be added later via software update if Apple so chooses. Let's hope they do.) Keeping them charged The quality and build seem solid. When they're slid into the charging case, the AirPods snap into place via hidden magnets. The case also closes with a satisfying snap, and is held shut by magnets. That means there's no latch to catch on something or break, or button to depress to open the lid. And because it uses a decent magnet, you can be confident the case won't just open and cause you to accidentally lose an AirPod. (It costs $69 each to replace them if you do.) Michael deAgonia The AirPods carrying case doubles as a charger Just putting the pods in the case for storage means they're getting charged. Fifteen minutes of charging buys three hours of audio; on full charge, the AirPods should last for five hours. The case, which is charged with the included Lightning cable, has about 24 hours of battery capacity. In my experience, I've had to charge the case about once a week, while using the AirPods during the work day and for gym sessions. If you want to check the battery status of the AirPods and the carrying case, you can do so in the Control Center on your iPhone under the AirPods option, or when you flip open the carrying case near the unlocked iPhone. (The AirPods need to be in the case though.) Final thoughts Michael deAgonia Some people think the AirPods look goofy in use. I don't. The AirPods aren't without issues. I have had several dropped connections, and each time it was embarrassing. In a couple of weeks of daily testing, there were a few times the connection completely dropped and my iPhone speaker broadcast to my coworkers that I was listening to sports radio (Go Patriots!). It's annoying having to scramble for the audio pause button, so I'm hoping Apple will improve the connection behavior in the future. I've also noticed audio cutouts at times, when the sound drops out for a second or so. Interestingly, I've seen more hiccups with macOS than iOS 10. And I should note that a few people have told me they look goofy, in case that matters. But I don't care. Ultimately, the AirPods do much more right than wrong. If you're already in the Apple ecosystem, these AirPods (or even the newest Beats headphones with the W1 chipset) will work very well across all of your devices; if you're not in the Apple ecosystem, these little earphones are still worth checking out. Apple hasn't completely ended wireless audio issues with AirPods, but it's done a damned good job in a few specific areas (like initial setup and audio quality) to make the AirPods worthy of consideration if you're in the market for wireless headphones.

It’s one of the most popular and top-grossing games on both Android and iOS, and with good reason. It’s extremely fun and very addicting. However, occasionally users run into problems, want to change their name, or transfer their village to a new device or from Android to iPhone. Advertisement We get asked a lot of questions about Clash. From transferring the game from an iPhone to an Android tablet, switching phones, connection problems, lost villages and more. There are countless problems that can easily be fixed, or otherwise solved with the help of Clash of Clans support. Read: How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone Typically users don’t run into actual in-game problems, and most of the questions being asked in forums are about changing phones and such. However, there are still occasional bugs or problems you could face. The first stop for users is the official Clash of Clans support forum, or continue on for more details regarding everything mentioned above and more. Advertisement Advertisement With millions and millions of players on both Android and iOS, this game has its share of problems. The biggest concern for most comes from a lost village, which is why we’ll start with always backing up your Clash of Clans account and village on Android or iOS. This can be done with Game Center, or Google+ on both platforms. How to Backup Clash of Clans First things first, gamers should always tie Clash of Clans to either Game Center on iPhone and iPad, or use Google+ and Google Games on Android. This is a crucial step that ties the game to your Apple ID or Gmail in case of loss, theft, damage to a device, or other situations. Start by opening Clash of Clans and hitting the settings button, which are three gear-shaped icons in a box near the bottom right. This is the main settings menu. In the middle and bottom is the important stuff. From transferring the game to another device, connecting to Facebook, or tying your game to Google or Apple’s Game Center. Click the bottom middle option and connect to Google Play, or the bottom for Game Center. This ensures you’ll always be able to recover your game. I’ve connected to Google+ with my gmail account. No matter what Android device I have, I can download Clash of Clans, connect to Google, and it will automatically transfer my entire village in seconds. I have the same village on more than one phone, and two different Android tablets. Advertisement Read: Clash of Clans December 2015 Update: Donate Spells & More The same goes for Game Center. Simply connect to game center at the bottom of this settings screen, which will instantly connect Clash to that iOS device. With Android users can simply transfer the entire village with Google+, but iOS requires Game Center and using a link code. The bottom left is where you’ll need to click to connect to Game Center This is the first step all users should take, to ensure they’ll never lose a village. If this isn’t done, Supercell might be able to recover a village if you know the email account, name, clan name and other information, but it could take days or weeks to be recovered. How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone Whether it’s on Android or iOS, the process of transferring the game is rather easy. With iOS and Game Center you’ll need a device linking code. However, you’ll need both devices side by side to enter the code, or write it down. It’s crucial that you follow the first step mentioned above, and sign into Game Center or Google+ on your current device first before trying to transfer the game. Better safe than sorry. Advertisement With Android, transferring your Clash of Clans village to a new device (phone or tablet) couldn’t be easier thanks to Google Play Games, and Google+. Download Clash of Clans on your new smartphone or tablet, go through the tutorial, then follow the steps from the video below. Simply connect and sign into Google+ inside the game and it transfers the data over. The process is slightly different with iOS, and users will need to use Game Center and the “link a device” code button shown at the end of the video, or in the screenshot below. Tap this to get started. Advertisement With iPhone or iPad you’ll need the old device and the new one, which can be a problem if a device is lost or stolen. If so, contact Supercell for further assistance. On iOS hit settings > Link a device > and tap “this is the OLD DEVICE“. Clash will generate a code for you. Leave this on the screen, write it down, or take a screenshot. Do not lose it. Download Clash of Clans on your new iPhone or iPad, follow the same steps as above, but click “this is the NEW DEVICE” and enter the code. Sign into Game Center, and Clash will transfer to your new iOS device. It’s worth mentioning that if you download Clash on a new device and buy gems, or progress past Town Hall level 4, you can’t transfer your old game data. Meaning you’ll have to uninstall and reinstall the game, then try the transfer. So don’t play at all, and just follow the steps above to transfer an old village. If you try to transfer a village but your Gmail is tied to the wrong one, make a new Google account and re-connect it. Head to settings > accounts > add account > Google and make a new Google account. Then open Clash, and sync your current game to a new Google account. Then try again on your new device, and it should load the right village. Find a Lost Village If you have lost your Clash of Clans account or village by losing a phone, getting it stolen, broke, uninstalling the game or doing a factory data reset and did not have it backed up, only the support team can help you. Start the game, hit settings, and press “Help & Support” to get started. Users can also proceed by contacting Clash of Clans support here. Head to Help & Support, and tap the “Start a conversation” button on the top right. This will connect you with Supercell support, and they can try and track down and find your lost account. Having a unique name makes this easier. The following information will be needed to find a lost village: Name of the lost village Name of the clan the lost village is a part of (to help track it down) Town Hall level of your lost village Last date & time played Player level in village (if available) Provide all the details you possibly can, do not delete the pre-populated information on the lost village page, and Supercell may be able to find and restore your village. If you lost the village on iOS for any reason and didn’t have it backed up to Game center, the same steps as above will be required. Depending on the uniqueness of the name, clan name, and available information Supercell support should be able to find and restore your village. If the Clan name is “Clash of Clans” or something generic, where thousands of others used the same, it may be more difficult. Always have a unique player and clan name. Fix for “Link Error 102” Sometimes users may run into an odd “link error 102” while trying to play or transfer Clash of Clans using the device link code. In order for the link to work often-times both devices need to be connected to the same internet connection. Meaning connect both the old and new device to the same WiFi connection at home, or a public WiFi hotspot like at Starbucks. If one device is a smartphone, and you don’t have WiFi, tether the internet connection in and connect your tablet or the other device to the original, so they’re on the same network, and retry the link code. If this still fails, try another wireless network. Connect both devices to a friends wireless network, a public library, Starbucks, or AT&T WiFi spots around many cities. If this still fails, use the in-game support tab mentioned above and answer all of Supercell’s questions, and a support member may be able to resolve the issue. How to Change Your Name Changing your name in Clash of Clans was nearly impossible until an update to the game back in April of 2015. In April Clash of Clans received an update with tons of new features, as well as the option to change your in-game name once. This can only be done for Town Hall level 5 and above. Read: How to Change Your Name in Clash of Clans While on the regular home area looking at your base, tap the 3-gears shaped button near the bottom right of the screen. Then tap “Settings” and select the “Change Name” button. A box will pop-up instructing the user to change their name, but you will be warned this can only be done once. And one time only. Now that Clash of Clans has this as an option, you can only do it once. So choose wisely. Simply enter the new name you’d like to enjoy during gameplay, and select continue. You’ll be prompted to write it again confirming it’s what you want, then a third confirmation page will make you write CONFIRM in all caps. This is to ensure this is the name you want to use, and users will once again be reminded this is their one and only name change. If for whatever reason you’d like to change it again, you probably can’t, but emailing support with a valid reason the staff may grant users a second chance. This won’t be as easy, but it is possible. Gem Purchase Didn’t Come Through While most in-game purchases for things like gems goes extremely smooth, occasionally Android and iOS users will have problems. Sometimes the Android, Apple, or Supercell servers may respond slowly, return an error, or fail. If this is the case users are recommended to wait a few minutes, check their email to see if it went through. If the purchase was accepted, wait a few minutes and the purchase should show up. Try closing the game and restarting it. And the gems should arrive. Gem hacks typically don’t work, and those with a jailbroken iPhone can sometimes cause other issues. If a purchase isn’t received within 24 hours, contact the Google Play Store or iTunes for a refund. Supercell cannot verify a purchase if it doesn’t clear, so users need to request a refund through the app store. Click here for more details. On Android the process is easier, and if you received an email that you bought gems, the same in-game support tab should usually resolve the issue. Gems Disappeared Gems don’t just disappear in Clash of Clans. The only way for them to be gone, is if they’re used. Meaning buying a shield, a builders hut, boosting, spending gems on gold, elixir or dark elixir, or speeding up building or troop upgrades. If gems are used accidentally by friends, family members, or children, too bad. Supercell cannot or will not refund gems that are accidentally used. However, if a purchase or connection problem caused lost gems, try the step mentioned above, or contact support. Can’t Find A Clan in Search Searching for a Clan in Clash of Clans can be challenging, simply because there are millions of players. Open the game, and hit the blue “i” button by your name near the top left. Then select “search clans“. If you can’t find the clan in search it’s because the name wasn’t original, and too many others used the same name. Make sure you know the clan name, badge design and colors, and even the Clan War level, to help find the right clan. How to Play on Android and iPhone Yes, you can play the same Clash of Clans village on both platforms. Playing Clash of Clans on your iPhone, but also want to play it at home on your Samsung Galaxy Tab or Nexus 7? Here’s how: To play the same village on two different devices that aren’t both Android or iPhone, uses the same steps as above. Use the link code instructions above and transfer your iPhone Clash of Clans village to a new device, which can be an Android device. Your village will still be accessible on both devices. Again, always sync to Game Center or Google+ to save progress. Other Clash of Clans Problems Overall there aren’t too many issues in Clash of Clans. It’s one of the most popular, stable, and best games on Android or iOS. While most of the issues users face have been detailed above, if you have any other issues head to the Clash of Clans support forum. If the game isn’t loading try rebooting your phone. If updates are failing try closing the game, closing apps like the App Store or Google Play, re-opening, and trying again. Typically these are all connection issues, and not related to Clash itself. Slow load times, searching in matchmaking and other things are often based on connection, base layout, and other variables. If you have any other problems hit the link above and ask someone on the official forums, try the in-game support system, or drop us a comment below. 64 Responses 12/04/2015 Salinajhone Reply 15 my best friend’s step-sister makes $62 every hour on the laptop .

The FBI on Friday released 100 pages of heavily censored documents related to its agreement with a mysterious vendor to hack into an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters, but it did not identify who it paid to perform the work or how much it cost. AP FILE PHOTO By Eric Tucker, The Associated Press Posted: 01/06/17, 6:08 PM PST | Updated: 1 week, 1 day ago # Comments WASHINGTON >> The FBI on Friday released 100 pages of heavily censored documents related to its agreement with an unidentified vendor to hack into an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, California, shooters, but it did not identify whom it paid to perform the work or how much it cost. The records were provided in response to a federal lawsuit filed against the FBI by The Associated Press, Vice Media and Gannett, the parent company of USA Today. The media organizations sued in September to learn how much the FBI paid and who it hired to break into the phone of Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 people at a holiday gathering of county workers in December 2015. The FBI for weeks had maintained that only Apple Inc. could access the information on its phone, which was protected by encryption, but ultimately broke or bypassed Apple’s digital locks with the help of an unnamed third party. The FBI, in its records release Friday, censored critical details that would have shown how much the FBI paid, whom it hired and how it opened the phone. The files had been marked “secret” before they were turned over under the lawsuit. The files make clear that the FBI signed a nondisclosure agreement with the vendor. The records also show that the FBI received at least three inquiries from companies interested in developing a product to unlock the phone, but none had the ability to come up with a solution fast enough for the FBI. The FBI also said in contracting documents that it did not solicit competing bids or proposals because it thought widely disclosing the bureau’s needs could harm national security. The lawsuit was filed months after the FBI’s sudden announcement in March that it had purchased a tool from an unidentified third party to open Farook’s phone. The disclosure aborted a court fight that began when a federal judge had directed Apple to help the FBI break into the phone. The suit by the media organizations argued there was no legal basis to withhold the information and challenged the adequacy of the FBI’s search for relevant records. It also said the public had a right to know whether the vendor has adequate security measures, is a proper recipient of government funds and will act only in the public interest. In refusing to provide the records, the FBI said the records had been compiled for law enforcement purposes and might interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, even though at the time the shooters were both dead and there were no indications others were involved. It was the third lawsuit the AP has filed against the Obama administration under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act.

Products under the Trend of Intelligent Technology News provided by IDG China Jan 06, 2017, 20:40 ET Share this article LAS VEGAS, Jan. 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- On January 5, 2017, Las Vegas witnessed the grand opening of the 50th International Consumer Electronics Show (CES). On Jan. 6th, the Awards Ceremony for 2016-2017 Global Top Brands hosted by International Data Group (IDG) was held in Wynn Hotel Las Vegas. Mr. Patrick Kenealy, Managing Director of IDG Ventures USA unveiled the lists of 2016-2017 Global Top 20Smart Connected Devices Brands and Global Top 15 Smart Phones Brands. Chinese smart phone brands such as Huawei, Lenovo, Xiaomi, ZTE, Coolpad, etc., together with Apple and Samsung, etc. were granted this honor. Since 2007, Apple and Google released the first smart phone successively, smart connected devices and smart phones have entered a fast-growing golden decade. According to relevant statistics, the annual growth rate of smart connected devices was not less than 25% from 2009 to 2014. While due to the constant market saturation, consumers slowed down their demand for new mobile phones. Consequently, smart phone growth rate came to an inflection point in 2015 and declined to single digits in 2016. However, smart connected devices have achieved rapid technological development in during past decade, a series of innovations such as Touch Screen, Metal Chassis, Fingerprint Recognition, Type-C Interface and Force Touch. Meanwhile, transformation and development of smart connected devices have been constantly promoted by the mobile Internet and intelligent applications. Therefore, in the new era of intelligence, smart connected devices and smart phone brands can effectively improve their second growth only by continuous technical adjustments and active transformation to the Internet and intellectualization. Although Apple and Samsung still remain the top two in the global smart connected devices and smart phones market, these well-known brands are gradually losing their strong appeal to users with the occurrence of Samsung Note 7 battery explosion accident and iPhone innovation ability decline. Coolpad, Huawei, ZTE, OPPO, vivo and other domestic high-end smart phones begin to dominate the market gradually and are accepted by more users. Thus, there are still opportunities for smart connected devices and smart phones market in the future. Only by continuous development of innovative technology and products, making hardware design panders to consumers' habits and conforms to the kinesiology principles, software applications with more humanization and operating comfortableness, can manufacturers give more vitality and competitiveness to their brands. Campaigns like 2016-2017 Global Top 20 Smart Connected Devices Brands and 2016-2017 Global Top 15 Smart Phones Brands are carried out to encourage intelligent terminal device enterprises and smart phone companies to conduct technological innovation actively, foster innovative products and promote industrial innovation and upgrading of intelligence. It is reported that the lists of Global Top 20 Smart Connected Devices Brands and 2016-2017 Global Top 15 Smart Phones Brands are the fruition of the IDG and IDC's co-operation.

Samsung, Apple, Huawei, OPPO, Vivo, LG, Xiaomi, ZTE, TCL-Alcatel, Gionee, Lenovo, Letv, Motorola, Coolpad and HTC had their names on the list of 2016-2017 Global Top 15 Smart Phones Brands. In the Individual Award aspect, Cool Changer S1 won the award of The Best Overall Performing Smartphone of 2016, ROBOO won the Annual Global "A.I. Robot for Kids" Gold Award. Mr. Patrick Kenealy said at the awards ceremony, "The year of 2017 will usher in the first decade of the development of smart connected devices and smart phones. Under the stimulus of innovative technology, smart phone and terminal industry now are undergoing drastic changes. The global smart phone market is basically captured by Apple, Samsung and a number of Chinese brands. We can see that with the trend of intellectualization, smart connected devices manufacturers headed by Chinese brands are constantly accelerating transformation and upgrading and striving for innovation. Based on the innovation of smart connected devices and smart phone manufacturers in terms of technology, design, interaction and user experience, these selection activities comprehensively analyzed and evaluated the development of global smart connected devices and smart phone industry in 2016, thus creating a better future for smart connected devices and smart phone companies." "It is a great honor for Coolpad to be named again on the lists of 2016-2017 Global Top 20 Smart Connected Devices Brands and Global Top 15 Smart Phones Brands, and Cool Changer S1 won the award of The Best Overall Performing Smartphone of 2016," Coolpad Group said, "The explosive development of mobile Internet and intelligent technology in recent years has created an unprecedented opportunity for Coolpad. Last year, it took us a whole year for strategic transformation, from product R&D to top-quality products, as well as more emphasis placed on brand influence. In the future, Coolpad will be more dedicated and professional to strive for excellence and provide products with more elegant appearance and better performance. Meanwhile, we will continue to focus on superior product strategy to introduce more ecological hardware platforms and intelligent hardware related products. Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. remarked, "We are happy that Huawei has been included into the list of 2016-2017 Global Top 20 Smart Connected Devices Brands and 2016-2017 Global Top 15 Smart Phones Brands. It indicates that the smart & connected industry and users have recognized Huawei's efforts over the years. Now Huawei Mate 9 and other flagship phones of Huawei with a series of new technologies like Leica dual camera, topnotch security solutions, and EMUI 5.0 OS can provide a more intuitive user experience. In the future, Huawei, by virtue of its advantages in 5G technology, will continue to reform and innovate to further develop information and communications technology, strengthen its industry leading position, strive to build itself into a smartphone brand winning more extensive recognition from consumers worldwide, and build a better connected world in an all-round way." Samsung Group noted, "Despite the fact that Samsung develops virtual reality and produces screens and processors for VR headsets based on its hardware manufacturing background, Chinese manufacturers offering low prices might pose a threat to it in price in a year or two. Samsung hopes to build a whole ecosystem through various ways where ordinary consumers can make their own content easily and communicate with friends via VR. Samsung is trying to provide the best user experience for customers, based on which it will make necessary improvements and innovations." Driven by innovative technology in the era of intelligence, global smart connected devices and smart phone industry will usher in a new leap once again, bringing a new round of development opportunities to brands and enterprises. Let's bear witness to the birth of the 2016-2017 Global Top 20 Smart Connected Devices Brands and 2016-2017 Global Top 15 Smart Phones Brands, make a comprehensive understanding on the development process and pattern evolution of global smart connected devices and smart phone brands in the past ten years, and experience the power of technological innovation together.

After an engineer accidentally left a test version of the iPhone 4 at a bar in 2010, Latimer set up a system to track, recover and destroy prototypes of coming products. Later, he taught overseas suppliers how to shield production lines and compartmentalize information to avoid leaks. Under Apple’s “need to know” philosophy, he did not even have access to much of the information he helped to secure. And like all Apple employees, he was discouraged from talking about his job with co-workers. His current employer, Pearl Automation, could not be more different. Founded in 2014 by three former senior managers from Apple’s iPod and iPhone groups, Pearl has tried to replicate what its leaders view as the best parts of Apple’s culture, like its fanatical dedication to quality and beautiful design. But the founders also consciously rejected some of the less appealing aspects of life at Apple, like its legendary secrecy and top-down management style. The startup, which makes high-tech accessories for cars, holds weekly meetings with its entire staff. Managers brief them on coming products, company finances, technical problems and even the presentations made to the board. “It’s very liberating to know what’s going on,” said Latimer, who left Apple in May to join Pearl. “Everyone is contributing here, so everyone has a need to know.” Best of all, he is working with many of his old Apple colleagues. Pearl, which is led by Bryson Gardner, has recruited heavily from Apple. More than 50 of Pearl’s 80 or so employees worked for the Cupertino tech giant at some point. Although Apple pays very well, many of the Apple recruits had gotten bored cranking out incremental improvements to the iPhone and the Mac, said Brian Sander, Pearl’s co-founder and chief operating officer. “They were vibrating. It was time for them to do something different,” he said. Pearl’s pitch was appealing: Make the roads safer by giving tens of millions of older autos the same high-tech safety features that the newest models have. “We want to help people to modernize their cars without having to buy a new one,” Sander said. The company’s first product, a backup camera called RearVision, costs $500 and began shipping in September. Sales are off to a slow start. Although the camera has received rave reviews, it is much more expensive than competing models. The online retailers Amazon.com and Crutchfield temporarily cut the price to $400 in December. Gardner declined to disclose specific sales figures but said Pearl had released the product too late to make it into physical retailers before the holidays. The company plans to expand distribution this year. Like Apple, though, Pearl is playing the long game. Engineers are testing self-parking technology and other driver-assistance features for future products. The company has raised $50 million from prominent venture capital firms, including Accel, Shasta Ventures and Venrock, but Gardner said it needs to raise more money in 2017. Pearl’s headquarters — in an office complex between vast redwood groves and Santa Cruz’s beaches — are a world away from Apple headquarters in the busy technopolis of Silicon Valley. The larger company’s influence, however, is clear. Apple, which has about 110,000 employees, breaks big projects down into smaller tasks. Those are assigned to small teams, and each sub-task is given to a specific employee, who must get it done — what Apple calls the “directly responsible individual.” Pearl has copied this system. “In leading small teams, that’s very effective,” Gardner said. Pearl has also imported Apple’s disciplined approach to engineering. Deadlines are regularly set, and flaws are relentlessly investigated. “Why did this fail?” Gardner said. “You really understand the full bounds of the problem.” Another Apple hallmark — elegant design — is also a core value. “We’re building something that has an Apple-quality fit and finish,” Sander said. Unlike competing models, the RearVision has two high-definition cameras to provide a better view, and one is tuned for night vision. The cameras peek out of a license-plate frame and are powered by a hidden solar panel. They transmit data wirelessly to an adapter that plugs into the car’s diagnostic port near the steering wheel. The images are displayed on an app on the driver’s smartphone. The setup allows the company to frequently update the software to fix bugs and add new features. Chrissy Meyer, Pearl’s director of hardware product development and another Apple alumna, said that her team tried 19 variations of the license-plate frame, including testing various shades of black, with and without aluminum flakes in the paint. (“They look really different in the sunlight,” she said.) Like Apple, Pearl dealt with dozens of suppliers, mostly in Asia, to obtain the 400 components in RearVision. “We were used to doing this with the iPhone and iPad,” said Joseph Fisher, Pearl’s co-founder and head of engineering. Indeed, the Pearl team tapped many of the same suppliers they worked with at Apple. But Pearl’s leaders also consciously rejected Apple’s view that only the top executives should have a view of the whole company. Apple’s longtime CEO, Steve Jobs, exercised control over the smallest details about products. When he stepped down in 2011, his power was distributed among more of the company’s executives, but decisions remained highly centralized. “At Apple, there are a few people in the company that decide what needs to be done, and everyone else is executing,” said Rishabh Bhargava, Pearl’s director of hardware, who formerly worked on the iPod and iPhone. At Pearl, he said, the engineering team has a voice in coming products and features, as well as the product design. Apple, for all of its success creating phones and computers, has spawned very few startups like Pearl in recent years, especially compared with peers like Google and Facebook. Eswar Priyadarshan, who sold his mobile advertising company, Quattro Wireless, to Apple in 2010 and stayed for four years, said he learned about design and aesthetics during his time there. But he noted that Apple’s high compensation, focused product mission and top-down decision-making tended to dampen the risk-taking necessary to start a company. Priyadarshan, who is chief executive of BotCentral, a six-person startup, compared Apple to a community of warrior monks. “Warrior monks don’t talk and do whatever is asked,” he said. Nest Labs, the most successful company to have been founded by Apple veterans in the last few years, was born in part because its founders, Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers, were told that Apple had no interest in their smart thermostat. “It was a great place to work: super-high growth, great product, lots of innovation,” said Rogers, who remained at Nest after its sale to Alphabet for $3.2 billion in 2014. “But Apple is very much, ‘How do we ship our next iPhone for Christmas?’” Nest has had its share of problems since the sale to Google, including management infighting, product delays and disappointing revenue growth before Fadell’s departure in June. But Rogers, who worked with some of Pearl’s founders at Apple and serves on its board, said that the startup absorbed many of the positive lessons of Nest: Recruit top Apple people, control your hardware and software, establish a culture of openness and empowerment, and constantly upgrade the product. Apple appears to hold no hard feelings toward Pearl, despite the startup’s steady recruitment of its workers. “Pearl Auto is a great example of the creativity and innovation driving the iPhone ecosystem,” said Josh Rosenstock, an Apple spokesman. “We wish them great success with their new product.” Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Cook still did extremely well, with a compensation package valued at $8.7 million for Apple's fiscal year that ended on September 24, according to a regulatory filing made Friday. But the amount was down from nearly $10.3 million in the prior year. The Cupertino, California, company cited a downturn in Apple's revenue and operating profit as the main reason it cut the pay of Cook and its other top executives. Apple's revenue dropped 8 percent to $216 billion, while its operating profit declined 16 per cent to $60 billion. That was mainly because it sold fewer iPhones for the first time since the device came out in 2007. It also marked the first time that Apple's annual revenue decreased since 2001, which was just before the company's late co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the iPod. That digital music player set the stage for the iPhone and iPad. The iPhone triggered a revolution in mobile computing and became Apple's biggest moneymaker, even as a wide range of device makers released competing products primarily running on Google's free Android software. Most of the world's smartphones are powered by Android, but the iPhone remains a popular high-priced status symbol. Even so, consumers are holding on to their existing iPhones for longer periods instead of upgrading to a newer model every year or two. That has raised investor concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone, a nagging worry that has been aggravated by the company's inability to introduce another breakthrough product since Jobs' death in 2011. Cook, Jobs' anointed successor, had hoped Apple would have another huge hit with a smartwatch unveiled in 2014, but that device has only had moderate success. Apple's regulatory filing revealed that the company was bracing for a sales drop last year, although not quite as steep as what occurred. The compensation committee for Apple's board of directors had established a revenue goal of $224 billion for last year, which would have been a 4 percent decline from the previous year. The company expected sales to rebound during the holiday shopping season on hopes that consumers would be snapping up its latest iPhones, the 7 and 7 Plus. Apple will release its quarterly results that include the holidays later this month. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

The FBI on Jan. 6, 2017 released 100 pages of heavily censored documents related to its agreement with a mysterious vendor to hack into an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters, but it did not identify who it paid to perform the work or how much it cost. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) Related Coverage Remembering San Bernardino’s victims 1 year later San Bernardino recalls terror attack with silence, speakers US seeks to seize San Bernardino shooter’s life insurance Autopsies reveal details of San Bernardino terror attack Some San Bernardino victims support efforts to hack iPhone Judge: Apple must help US hack San Bernardino killer’s phone WASHINGTON (AP) — The FBI on Friday released 100 pages of heavily censored documents related to its agreement with an unidentified vendor to hack into an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, California, shooters, but it did not identify whom it paid to perform the work or how much it cost. The records were provided in response to a federal lawsuit filed against the FBI by The Associated Press, Vice Media and Gannett, the parent company of USA Today. The media organizations sued in September to learn how much the FBI paid and who it hired to break into the phone of Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 people at a holiday gathering of county workers in December 2015. The FBI for weeks had maintained that only Apple Inc. could access the information on its phone, which was protected by encryption, but ultimately broke or bypassed Apple’s digital locks with the help of an unnamed third party. The FBI, in its records release Friday, censored critical details that would have shown how much the FBI paid, whom it hired and how it opened the phone. The files had been marked “secret” before they were turned over under the lawsuit. The files make clear that the FBI signed a nondisclosure agreement with the vendor. The records also show that the FBI received three inquiries from companies interested in developing a product to unlock the phone, but none had the ability to come up with a solution fast enough for the FBI. The FBI also said in contracting documents that it did not solicit competing bids or proposals because it thought widely disclosing the bureau’s needs could harm national security. The lawsuit was filed months after the FBI’s sudden announcement in March that it had purchased a tool from an unidentified third party to open Farook’s phone. The disclosure aborted a court fight that began when a federal judge had directed Apple to help the FBI break into the phone. The suit by the media organizations argued there was no legal basis to withhold the information and challenged the adequacy of the FBI’s search for relevant records. It also said the public had a right to know whether the vendor has adequate security measures, is a proper recipient of government funds and will act only in the public interest. In refusing to provide the records, the FBI said the records had been compiled for law enforcement purposes and might interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, even though at the time the shooters were both dead and there were no indications others were involved. It was the third lawsuit the AP has filed against the Obama administration under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple penalized CEO Tim Cook for the iPhone maker’s first sales slump in 15 years with a 15 percent pay cut. Cook still did extremely well, with a compensation package valued at $8.7 million for Apple’s fiscal year that ended Sept. 24, according to a regulatory filing made Friday. But the amount was down from nearly $10.3 million in the prior year. The Cupertino, California, company cited a downturn in Apple’s revenue and operating profit as the main reason it cut the pay of Cook and its other top executives. Apple’s revenue dropped 8 percent to $216 billion, while its operating profit declined 16 percent to $60 billion. That was mainly because it sold fewer iPhones for the first time since the device came out in 2007. It also marked the first time that Apple’s annual revenue decreased since 2001, which was just before the company’s late co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the iPod. That digital music player set the stage for the iPhone and iPad. The iPhone triggered a revolution in mobile computing and became Apple’s biggest moneymaker, even as a wide range of device makers released competing products primarily running on Google’s free Android software. Most of the world’s smartphones are powered by Android, but the iPhone remains a popular high-priced status symbol. Even so, consumers are holding on to their existing iPhones for longer periods instead of upgrading to a newer model every year or two. That has raised investor concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone, a nagging worry that has been aggravated by the company’s inability to introduce another breakthrough product since Jobs’ death in 2011. Cook, Jobs’ anointed successor, had hoped Apple would have another huge hit with a smartwatch unveiled in 2014, but that device has only had moderate success. Apple’s regulatory filing revealed that the company was bracing for a sales drop last year, although not quite as steep as what occurred. The compensation committee for Apple’s board of directors had established a revenue goal of $224 billion for last year, which would have been a 4 percent decline from the previous year. The company expected sales to rebound during the holiday shopping season on hopes that consumers would be snapping up its latest iPhones, the 7 and 7 Plus. Apple will release its quarterly results that include the holidays later this month. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He added it will be difficult for China's foreign trade to improve in 2017 due to rising costs and other factors. China is the world's largest trading nation. It could be heavily exposed to protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.

According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Cook received $8.75 million in total compensation, which includes a $3 million base salary. In 2015, Cook earned more than $10 million. Other top execs including Eddy Cue, who runs internet software and services at Apple, and retail chief Angela Ahrendts, also saw declines in compensation for 2016. The filing says execs received 89.5% of cash incentives for the year, during which Apple reported its first decline in annual sales since 2001. Operating income also sunk from $71.2 billion in 2015 to $60 billion last year. Shares of Apple are up nearly 1% in Friday trading. For 2016, Apple shares climbed 11%. The dip in revenue is tied to sales of the iPhone, down from previous years. During the fourth quarter, Apple sold 45.5 million iPhones, a 5% drop from the same time last year. Meanwhile, a report from Nikkei Asian Review says Apple will cut production of the iPhone during its 2017 first quarter. This year could provide the iPhone and Apple with a sales rebound. It marks the 10th anniversary of the device, and rumors suggest Apple has big plans for the next iPhone, which should launch in the fall. © Apple Tim Cook at WWDC 2015.

networks News provided by ubisys technologies GmbH Jan 06, 2017, 20:00 ET Share this article LAS VEGAS, Jan. 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- "We're showing a slightly modified ubisys G1 acting as bridge between a ZigBee network and Apple HomeKit at this year's ZigBee Alliance booth. The bridge seamlessly integrates ubisys smart home deployments into Apple's popular smart home framework. You can use Siri to dim lights, set a cozy temperature, close window shades, recall scenes, or do the same using iOS 10's built-in Home app. At the core, the ubisys Smart Facility Service manages the whole ZigBee network. On top of this rock-solid foundation, we provide an adapter for Apple HomeKit, a piece of software running in addition to the other services hosted on G1," Dr. Arasch Honarbacht, founder, co-owner and managing director of ubisys stated. The ubisys Smart Facility Service controls IoT equipment in a facility, e.g. a consumer's home, and is capable of managing ZigBee networks using its embedded radio and other IP-enabled smart home equipment. It runs on the ubisys Gateway G1. The new solution covers everything from smart bulbs, dimmers, switches, window coverings, thermostats, temperature and motion sensors, to door/window contacts. It also extends to energy-harvesting flavors of environmental sensors made using ZigBee Green Power technology, for example. A similar adapter for IoTivity is already available and ubisys will add an Amazon Smart Home Skill adapter later this year to complement its offering. All these adapters can run in parallel on the same ubisys gateway, accessing the same ZigBee network, making this gateway a fluent speaker of all major IoT languages. The mature, fit-for-purpose technology to which ZigBee has evolved over the past 15 years is the workhorse at the core of ubisys' solutions. The various adapters mentioned above bring ZigBee's unique advantages under the umbrella of those other high-level frameworks. ZigBee products and solutions made by ubisys are synonymous for mature, reliable, robust, secure, interoperable, ultra-low power mesh networking, including support for self-powered, energy-harvesting, maintenance-free switches and sensors. "Don't expect to see ultra-low power, energy-harvesting products to talk IP natively anytime soon. The overhead of IP is significant and prohibitive for battery-less ultra-low power solutions," Honarbacht explained. "With our bridging technologies, IP-based frameworks can nevertheless take full advantage of true low-power products while remaining easy to integrate." As IoT standards emerge, evolve, and consolidate, there is still no single, universal IP protocol to "rule them all". While former competitors Open Interconnect Consortium and AllJoyn/AllSeen Alliance have dissolved and merged into the Open Connectivity Foundation driving the IoTivity open-source reference implementation, the ZigBee Alliance has just introduced dotdot, extending its proven application layer to operate over IP networks. Despite all these standardization efforts, some of the biggest players will continue to use their market power to promote their proprietary high-level frameworks to de-facto industry standards. A tiny low-power IoT device might be able to support one of these protocols, but cannot reasonably support them all at the same time. In contrast, the gateway G1 is more than powerful enough to achieve this kind of seamless integration in a heterogeneous IoT landscape on behalf of all the devices it manages. Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide HomeKit support as a firmware upgrade to existing G1 models; a new generation of ubisys G1 including support for HomeKit is planned to launch late 2017. Nevertheless, existing models will continue to receive other upgrades including the new IoTivity and Amazon Smart Home Skill adapters.

The iPad Pro is currently available in 9.7- and 12.9-inch configurations and it's Apple's most powerful tablet so far. The two iPad Pro models are widely considered to be among the best tablets on the market, but they're due for a refresh and the upgraded models are expected to be even more powerful. 10.5- Or 10.9-Inch iPad Pro 2 With New Design The 2017 iPad Pro 2 lineup will reportedly include a 10.5-inch variant, in addition to the 9.7- and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models we've seen so far. Other reports have indicated that the new screen size would be 10.9 inches, not 10.5. As expected, the 10.5- or 10.9-inch size never-before-seen on an iPad model stirred the most interest so far, especially since this version is rumored to sport a revolutionary design. More specifically, the 10.5- or 10.9-inch iPad Pro 2 will reportedly boast a bezel-free display and a home button embedded underneath the screen, just like on the rumored iPhone 8. The mid-sized iPad Pro 2 would reportedly have roughly the same size of the 9.7-inch version despite sporting a notably bigger display, which indicates that Apple could unleash its sleekest and most svelte tablet yet. iPad Pro 2 Rumored Specs The iPad Pro 2 lineup is expected to rock top-notch specs with robust configurations. Rumored specs include Apple's A10X processor, 4 GB of RAM and possibly iOS 10.3 on board out of the box, complete with its touted "Theater" mode. The iPad Pro 2 could also boast True Tone displays, Force Touch or 3D Touch and more compelling specs and features that would take on the popular Microsoft Surface Pro 4. iPad Pro 2 vs Surface Pro 4 As a reminder, the Surface Pro 4 features a large 12.3-inch display with a resolution of 2,736 x 1,824 pixels (267 ppi), 4 GB of RAM, an 8-megapixel rear camera, a 5-megapixel front shooter, sixth-generation Intel Core processors up to i7, up to 1 TB of storage, and a bevy of software features designed to increase productivity. The iPad Pro 2 could go head to head with the Surface Pro 4 in terms of specs and it's expected to give Microsoft's tablet a run for its money, but one aspect could play a big role in one's decision to choose one high-end tablet over the other. Just like the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the iPad Pro 2 is rumored to ditch the headphone jack and this could be a turnoff for some interested customers. The Surface Pro 4, meanwhile, has a headphone jack and can be customized with up to 16 GB of RAM. On the other hand, the iPad Pro 2 could get an edge over its rival thanks to the iOS 10.3 Theater mode, the bezel-free display and the seamless home button with a fingerprint scanner embedded into the display. Just as the Microsoft Surface Pro 4, the iPad Pro line aims to serve as a desktop replacement and the iPad Pro 2 series should take things to the next level. When it comes to the release date, the iPad Pro 2 lineup is expected to arrive in March 2017, but nothing is confirmed at this point. All purported specs, features, and upgrades are still in the rumor state for now, so take everything with a grain of salt until an official announcement.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) , In this Feb. 17, 2016, photo an iPhone is seen in Washington. The FBI on Jan. 6, 2017 released 100 pages of heavily censored documents related to its agreement with a mysterious vendor to hack into an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters, but it did not identify who it paid to perform the work or how much it cost. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) , By ERIC TUCKER / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF WASHINGTON – The FBI on Friday released 100 pages of heavily censored documents related to its agreement with an unidentified vendor to hack into an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, California, shooters, but it did not identify whom it paid to perform the work or how much it cost. The records were provided in response to a federal lawsuit filed against the FBI by The Associated Press, Vice Media and Gannett, the parent company of USA Today. The media organizations sued in September to learn how much the FBI paid and who it hired to break into the phone of Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 people at a holiday gathering of county workers in December 2015. The FBI for weeks had maintained that only Apple Inc. could access the information on its phone, which was protected by encryption, but ultimately broke or bypassed Apple’s digital locks with the help of an unnamed third party. The FBI, in its records release Friday, censored critical details that would have shown how much the FBI paid, whom it hired and how it opened the phone. The files had been marked “secret” before they were turned over under the lawsuit. The files make clear that the FBI signed a nondisclosure agreement with the vendor. The records also show that the FBI received three inquiries from companies interested in developing a product to unlock the phone, but none had the ability to come up with a solution fast enough for the FBI. The FBI also said in contracting documents that it did not solicit competing bids or proposals because it thought widely disclosing the bureau’s needs could harm national security. The lawsuit was filed months after the FBI’s sudden announcement in March that it had purchased a tool from an unidentified third party to open Farook’s phone. The disclosure aborted a court fight that began when a federal judge had directed Apple to help the FBI break into the phone. The suit by the media organizations argued there was no legal basis to withhold the information and challenged the adequacy of the FBI’s search for relevant records. It also said the public had a right to know whether the vendor has adequate security measures, is a proper recipient of government funds and will act only in the public interest. In refusing to provide the records, the FBI said the records had been compiled for law enforcement purposes and might interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, even though at the time the shooters were both dead and there were no indications others were involved. It was the third lawsuit the AP has filed against the Obama administration under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act.

Henge Docks debuted a number of products to complement the new MacBook Pro. The original Vertical Dock allows you to dock your computer off to the side of a monitor, while the new Horizontal Dock allows you to securely dock the MacBook Pro without compromising usability. The Horizontal Dock features pressure sensors to know when the computer is present, and it then automatically connects itself with the computer. This dock has 13 ports available including HDMI, USB Type-A, and Ethernet. Henge Docks also announced the Tethered Dock, which gives you a station to connect multiple cables and charge your MacBook. CMRA showed off a prototype Apple Watch band that features a front and rear-facing camera, but it didn't have a functional model on hand. We only saw a dummy unit, so we'll have to wait to see the band in action. The CMRA is already available for pre-order, but won't ship out until later this year. Finally, NanoLeaf displayed its colorful array of Aurora lights. These HomeKit-enabled lights can be displayed on a wall and each individual light can be controlled through the Aurora app. NanoLeaf also demoed the new Aurora Rhythm sound sensor that allows the lights to react to music and sound. If you missed them, make sure to check out the videos we did at CES Unveiled and Pepcom, two events that had tons of cool Apple products. You'll also want to check out our full CES coverage, which has dozens more accessories worth looking at. Tag: CES 2017 [ 44 comments ] Top Rated Comments (View all) gadgetguy03 1 week ago The theme this year? Let's replace everything Apple took away! Rating: 33 Votes Guy Clark 1 week ago Many of the recently released accessories (for Macs in particular) show how inadequate the modern Mac is for the consumer. A 2014 Retina MacBook Pro is a far more flexible and useful machine than the 2016 abomination. Macs are no more than fashion accessories instead of productive tools these days with the exception of the iMac. Rating: 8 Votes DevNull0 1 week ago Amazing how many of these accessories just restore functionality Timmy took away. Rating: 8 Votes baryon 1 week ago I find it quite funny how most of these things used to be built into Apple products at no extra cost (literally), and now, in the name of making products thinner, you have to use these cases, adapters and docks that actually make them even thicker than the previous version. Also I bet they're ridiculously expensive. Yes, yes they removed the floppy drive and it was a great albeit premature idea at the time. Yes, the CD drive was a huge, bulky, unreliable piece that was a good riddance from a laptop. These things had their time and became obsolete, so it was just a matter of when, not if. But Now we're talking about removing tiny little things that make your life hell, none of which are going to go obsolete. MagSafe, the classic USB port, the headphone jack, the HDMI port, the SD card reader... None of these things are bulky and none of them are obsolete. Most cameras in 2017 continue to use SD cards, all screens and projectors use HDMI, all audio devices use an audio jack, and all digital devices use the classic USB port. With the exception of USB-C, these are going to remain this way for the entire life of this computer, and well beyond it. And you don't gain much either, these devices can't get much thinner now.

I'm looking for incessant whining about things I could easily just ignore. Have I found the right thread? Rating: 5 Votes AngerDanger 1 week ago Gotta love the Incipio case that 1) adds extra length to the already long iPhone and 2) makes landscape use asymmetrical. I've posted it before, and it'd probably make an industrial designer groan, but given the fact that headphone jacks are longer than they are wide, it would make sense to put the jack and Lightning input on either side of the case: Rating: 5 Votes Soccertess 1 week ago It's sad that the best products are to give pro users functionality from their new fashion devices. But does it not seem like this years CES companies have given up on Apple products, and focusing on other ecosystems? Rating: 4 Votes Bubba Satori 1 week ago Hi. I'm looking for incessant whining about things I could easily just ignore. Have I found the right thread? Yes you have Tim. Happy New Year. Please don't remove that next year. Rating: 4 Votes antonis 1 week ago So, most of the "Best Apple Related Accessories" are focused on bringing back features that were recently abolished by apple. Looks like people complaining in MR forums for all the latest apple choices, are not representing a small fraction of users after all.

By Danny Palmer | January 6, 2017 -- 16:26 GMT (08:26 PST) | Topic: Security The malware opens emails until the system crashes. Image: Malwarebytes A tech support scam is targeting Mac users with unusual malware which tries to crash the system, then encourages the victim to call a phony Apple support number in order to get the system restored to normal. Victims are infected with the malware via a malicious email or by visiting a specially registered scam website. Cybersecurity researchers at Malwarebytes warn that these websites are particularly dangerous for Mac users running Safari because simply visiting one of the domains can execute the attack. Here's how fake telephone tech support scams work Interested in finding out how fake telephone tech support scams work? Well, grab a cup or glass of your favorite beverage, and prepare to be educated, entertained, and horrified. Read More Once the malicious code has been triggered, it will first of all check to see which version of OS X the victim is using and then attempt to trigger a a denial-of-service attack by repeatedly opens draft emails. The DDoS continues drafting new emails in individual windows until so many windows are running that the system crashes due to lack of memory. The subject line of the emails tells the user a virus has been detected and to call the tech support number. There are also instances of the malicious software opening up iTunes without any user prompting and displaying the fraudulent phone number there. Systems running the most up-to-date version of the Apple operating system -- macOS Sierra 10.12.2 -- don't appear to be affected by the DDoS attack against the mail application, so users should patch their systems to ensure the most protection against the attacks. This is far from the first support scam to target web users, with Microsoft users also regularly targeted by cyber fraudsters. Microsoft previously warned Windows users to remain vigilant when it comes to tech support scammers malware. ZDNet contacted Apple for comment but had not received a reply at the time of publication.

Start out by checking or changing these settings. Sarah Tew/CNET Laptops by Matt Elliott January 6, 2017 2:53 PM PST @themattelliott Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS After you have jumped through the initial screens from the Mac Setup Assistant that had you log in with your Apple ID, connect to a network and so on, your work is not done. Here are 10 settings to change or at least check on your new MacBook. 1. Check for updates Has Apple released an update to MacOS Sierra since it built your MacBook? Find out by clicking the Apple button in the upper-left corner of your screen and then clicking About This Mac. You should be staring at the General tab of the About This Mac window. If so, click the Software Update button, which will launch the App Store app and check for updates. Photo by Matt Elliott/CNET 2. Show battery percentage Like an iPhone, a MacBook displays a small battery icon at the top of the display to show how much battery power remains. It's more helpful if next to this icon it also displays the percentage of battery you have left. To show the percentage, click the battery icon in the menu bar and click Show Percentage. (If you don't see a battery icon, go to System Preferences > Energy Saver and check the box for Show battery status in menu bar.) Photo by Matt Elliott/CNET 3. Set up Siri Siri should be enabled by default, but if you would prefer to use Siri only on your iPhone, then you can disable Siri by going to System Preferences > Siri and unchecking the box for Enable Siri. If you plan on using Siri frequently, then you can use this Siri window to choose Siri's voice, language and a keyboard shortcut. Photo by Matt Elliott/CNET 4. Customize Touch Bar If you have a new MacBook Pro model with the Touch Bar, then head to System Preferences > Keyboard and click the Customize Control Strip button and then simply drag the buttons you want to show up on the default view of the Touch Bar to the Touch Bar below the display. Don't worry, they'll make the leap from your display across the hinge and to the Touch Bar. (And please don't ask me why Apple calls it the Control Strip in some places and Touch Bar in others because I don't know.) Photo by Matt Elliott/CNET 5. Sync folders via iCloud I find it incredibly useful to sync the Desktop and Documents folders between my two Macs and my iOS devices. To sync these two folders, go to System Preferences > iCloud and click the Options button for iCloud Drive. Next, check the box for the top item, Desktop and Documents folders. Photo by Matt Elliott/CNET 6. Choose default browser Even though it uses more system resources than Safari, I use Chrome instead of Safari because the favicons help me keep track of all of my open tabs. To set a default browser, go to System Preferences > General and make a selection other than Safari for Default web browser. Photo by Matt Elliott/CNET 7. Set scrolling direction A MacBook's "natural" scrolling direction doesn't feel natural to me. If you want the two-finger swipe gesture to scroll vertically in the opposite way, head to System Preferences > Trackpad and click on the Scroll & Zoom tab. Next, uncheck the box for Scroll direction: Natural. Photo by Matt Elliott/CNET 8. Get your Dashboard MacOS Sierra lets you juggle multiple desktops via Mission Control, which you can swipe through using the three- or four-finger swipe gesture. The Dashboard is a special desktop that lets you pin various apps to it for quick access to current weather conditions, your calendar, a calculator and other info. To enable the Dashboard, go to System Preferences > Mission Control and change the Dashboard setting from Off to either As Space or As Overlay. The former sets up the Dashboard as your leftmost desktop, and the latter overlays it on your current desktop with the press of the F12 key. Photo by Matt Elliott/CNET 9. Add and remove items from Dock Apple throws a number of stock apps into the Dock at the bottom of the screen. You can make room for the apps you use most frequently by removing others you don't need in the Dock. To remove an app from the Dock, simple click on its icon in the Dock and drag it to the desktop until you see Remove appear above the icon and then let go. Poof, it's gone! To add an app to the Dock, open it and then right-click on its icon in the Dock and mouse over the Option line in the menu and click Keep in Dock. Photo by Matt Elliott/CNET 10. Move the Dock The Dock sits at the bottom of your screen, but on a widescreen MacBook display, you might find it better to have it on the side. To move the Dock, go to System Preferences > Dock and choose either Left or Right for Position on Screen. While you're there, you can also drag a slider to adjust the size of the Dock. You can also make it disappear from view when you aren't using it by checking the box for Automatically hide and show the Dock.

Jackson County Search and Rescue was called out 11 times Friday for vehicles stuck on Colestin Road after drivers followed directions on Apple Maps, according to Sgt. Shawn Richards. "Right now we've got everyone turned around, but it's still very much an issue," Richards said. As of Friday afternoon, Apple Maps, the default navigation app on iPhone models, still routed travelers heading to California to take Colestin Road because it believes Interstate 5 is closed at the California border. Google Maps, however, correctly instructs drivers to stay on the interstate. I-5 is open, according to Oregon Department of Transportation spokesman Gary Leaming. He said ODOT put a message that read, "Siskiyou Pass open" on its large reader boards near exit 14 and Hilt in light of Apple's mistake. Messages to Apple weren't immediately returned Friday. Three families were pulled out of the snow on Colestin Road Thursday night, and a semi-trailer jackknifed while trying to exit the freeway at the Mount Ashland exit while following the app's directions, according to Leaming. Because of the glitch, Colestin Rural Fire District has posted signs near Exit 6 and the California border, according to Cheri Avgeris, wife of Fire Chief Steve Avgeris. Vehicles that were routed to the steep, narrow, mountain pass have included two-wheel-drive cars, motor homes, rental cars and U-Haul trucks, Cheri Avgeris said. The pass has about 2-1/2 lanes open because of the snow, and temperatures Thursday night were -3 degrees, with a high Friday of 14 degrees. Roads are "icy, really icy," she said. Further compounding the danger is that cell service is spotty in the area, Avgeris said, and telephone service could be miles away. She noted that James Kim, who died in rural Josephine County in 2006 while following a GPS route in the snow, also lacked cell service. Richards said drivers should use GPS devices and apps only as an assist. "You have to use all your senses," Richards said. "Turning off of dry freeway? It's probably inaccurate. You should turn around." Leaming advised drivers not to trust GPS mapping systems, especially in winter. Stay on state highways that are maintained, stop and ask questions, and use tripcheck.com, he said. — Reach reporter Nick Morgan at 541-776-4471 or nmorgan@mailtribune.com.

Cook still did extremely well, with a compensation package valued at $8.7 million for Apple's fiscal year that ended Sept. 24, according to a regulatory filing made Friday. But the amount was down from nearly $10.3 million in the prior year. The Cupertino, California, company cited a downturn in Apple's revenue and operating profit as the main reason it cut the pay of Cook and its other top executives. Apple's revenue dropped 8 percent to $216 billion, while its operating profit declined 16 percent to $60 billion. That was mainly because it sold fewer iPhones for the first time since the device came out in 2007. It also marked the first time that Apple's annual revenue decreased since 2001, which was just before the company's late co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the iPod. That digital music player set the stage for the iPhone and iPad. The iPhone triggered a revolution in mobile computing and became Apple's biggest moneymaker, even as a wide range of device makers released competing products primarily running on Google's free Android software. Most of the world's smartphones are powered by Android, but the iPhone remains a popular high-priced status symbol. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. Even so, consumers are holding on to their existing iPhones for longer periods instead of upgrading to a newer model every year or two. That has raised investor concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone, a nagging worry that has been aggravated by the company's inability to introduce another breakthrough product since Jobs' death in 2011. Cook, Jobs' anointed successor, had hoped Apple would have another huge hit with a smartwatch unveiled in 2014, but that device has only had moderate success. Apple's regulatory filing revealed that the company was bracing for a sales drop last year, although not quite as steep as what occurred. The compensation committee for Apple's board of directors had established a revenue goal of $224 billion for last year, which would have been a 4 percent decline from the previous year. The company expected sales to rebound during the holiday shopping season on hopes that consumers would be snapping up its latest iPhones, the 7 and 7 Plus. Apple will release its quarterly results that include the holidays later this month.

Home Industry Apple CEO Tim Cook’s pay slumps along with iPhone sales Apple CEO Tim Cook’s pay slumps along with iPhone sales Apple penalized CEO Tim Cook for the iPhone maker's first sales slump in 15 years with a 15 percent pay cut. By: Associated Press | San Francisco | Published: January 7, 2017 5:43 AM Cook still made out well with a compensation package valued at .7 million for Apple’s fiscal year that ended last September. (Reuters) Apple penalized CEO Tim Cook for the iPhone maker’s first sales slump in 15 years with a 15 percent pay cut. Cook still made out well with a compensation package valued at $8.7 million for Apple’s fiscal year that ended last September. But the amount was down from nearly $10.3 million in the prior year. The Cupertino, California, company cited in regulatory documents filed Friday downturns in Apple’s revenue and operating profit as the main reason for reducing the pay of Cook and other top executives. Apple’s revenue dropped 8 percent $216 billion while its operating profit declined 16 percent to $60 billion, largely because it sold fewer iPhones for the first time since the device came out in 2007. The company expected sales to rebound during the holiday season. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Now Sony has taken a move from Apple's playbook with its own wireless earbuds.     Instead of "bravery" or modern technological advancements, Apple's wireless AirPods conjure up other mental images--ridiculous cash-grab, to name one--but now that upcoming phones will start shipping without 3.5mm headphone jacks, the easy-to-lose audio buds are a trendsetter. Sony is next in this new forefront with its own wireless earbuds.   Sony's wireless buds come with a case that juices them up with on-the-go recharging, and are much more stylish than the Airpods, which look like two Oral B toothbrush heads. Sony's proprietary take on Apple's Airpods are just in their prototype stages, and don't have a release date or price just yet, but we should see more info drop later this year.   NEWS SOURCES:Engadget.com Recommended for You Samsung plans to launch wireless earbuds with Galaxy...

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Huawei Begins their Big Squeeze on Samsung in the U.S. Today | Main | Are Android OEMs Beginning to Rebel against Google? » January 06, 2017 Oh, this News would have put a Big Smile on Steve Jobs Face   Today we're learning that Gartner is forecasting that this is the year that shipment of devices running Apple's iOS and macOS will outnumber those running Windows. Who saw that possibility on the horizon when Steve Jobs returned to Apple back in 1996? I'll tell you who, no one. But if this news actually materializes, it would have been the crown that Steve Jobs would have smiled about. Beating that loud mouth Ballmer and copycat Gates would have made his day thinking back to the humble beginnings of Apple's first iMac.      Patently Apple covered the Gartner report on January 4 under the byline "Gartner Sees 2017 as a Stagnating Year for the Tech Sector." There was no official word from Ranjit Atwal, research director at Gartner, about Apple devices with their respective OSs possibly overtaking Windows 10 devices. So we're left having to believe that Atwal's added commentary, exclusive to Computerworld, actually took place.   Computerworld notes in their report that "In 2017, Apple's combination of iOS and macOS -- the former on iPhones and iPads, the latter on Macs -- will take second place from Windows on the devices shipped during the year. The gap between the two will widen in 2018 and 2019, with Apple ahead of Microsoft both years.   According to Gartner, which provided Computerworld with its latest device shipment forecast broken out by operating system, in 2016 Windows powered about 260 million devices of the 2.3 billion shipped during the year. Windows accounted for approximately 11.2% of the total devices, which overwhelmingly ran Google's Android. You could read about how Atwal arrives at his forecast here.   As much as I want to see that happen for the sake of a historical upset, I'm not sure it's going to be as easy as Atwal sees it. In December Patently Apple posted a report titled "Microsoft to Announce Qualcomm Snapdragon based Tablets and PCs with Built-In Cellular Capabilities on Thursday." Maybe I'm off base here, but with Huawei and Lenovo coming on board to promote Windows 10 on 2-in-1's along with new models from Samsung and Xiaomi to name just a few, I think the Windows meter is going to take a generous swing to the upside in 2017.   On the flip side, new Macs and iPads are going to debut in first half of 2017 and Apple may have more than just the anniversary iPhone up their sleeve for the September event to push iOS to all new highs. So both camps may have surprises to make this epic battle a lot of fun to stay on top of this year. For the history books, make your prediction below in the comments section and when we find out who won the battle next year we'll see who got it right.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

In turn this led to the organization deciding that they just could not recommend Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pros. However could 2017 solve the MacBook Pro battery issues? According to IHS, as reported by DigiTimes (via MacRumors), it seems that for the 2017 refresh of the MacBook Pro, Apple could be making the switch to IGZO displays, a display that consumes less power which in theory should allow the laptop to run for longer. There is also the upside that it will allow for significantly higher brightness, according to DisplayMate president Raymond Soneira who spoke to MacRumors. However he also notes that IGZO’s material costs are higher which means more expensive manufacturing costs, and that there have been yield issues which is why the technology isn’t so widely adopted yet. As it stands the MacBook Pros uses a-Si TFT-LCD panels for its display, so it will be interesting to see how different the IGZO panels could look. It is widely expected that Apple will refresh the laptops later this year. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had predicted last year that the refresh will result in upgrades to the CPU as well as a lower price point, but either way do take these reports with a grain of salt for now.

Cook still did extremely well, with a compensation package valued at $8.7 million for Apple’s fiscal year that ended Sept. 24, according to a regulatory filing made Friday. But the amount was down from nearly $10.3 million in the prior year. The Cupertino, California, company cited a downturn in Apple’s revenue and operating profit as the main reason it cut the pay of Cook and its other top executives. OPM tells DC-area feds how to plan for Inauguration Day Apple’s revenue dropped 8 percent to $216 billion, while its operating profit declined 16 percent to $60 billion. That was mainly because it sold fewer iPhones for the first time since the device came out in 2007. Advertisement It also marked the first time that Apple’s annual revenue decreased since 2001, which was just before the company’s late co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the iPod. That digital music player set the stage for the iPhone and iPad. The iPhone triggered a revolution in mobile computing and became Apple’s biggest moneymaker, even as a wide range of device makers released competing products primarily running on Google’s free Android software. Most of the world’s smartphones are powered by Android, but the iPhone remains a popular high-priced status symbol. Even so, consumers are holding on to their existing iPhones for longer periods instead of upgrading to a newer model every year or two. That has raised investor concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone, a nagging worry that has been aggravated by the company’s inability to introduce another breakthrough product since Jobs’ death in 2011. Cook, Jobs’ anointed successor, had hoped Apple would have another huge hit with a smartwatch unveiled in 2014, but that device has only had moderate success. Apple’s regulatory filing revealed that the company was bracing for a sales drop last year, although not quite as steep as what occurred. The compensation committee for Apple’s board of directors had established a revenue goal of $224 billion for last year, which would have been a 4 percent decline from the previous year. The company expected sales to rebound during the holiday shopping season on hopes that consumers would be snapping up its latest iPhones, the 7 and 7 Plus. Apple will release its quarterly results that include the holidays later this month.

 NOMURA: iPhone 8 is going to blow iPhone 6 out of the water Hannah Roberts Jan. 6, 2017, 8:00 AM 46,380 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook.REUTERS/Robert Galbraith Analysts at Nomura Instinet estimate that a "supercycle" will develop in the last three months of 2017 that will make iPhone 8 a much, much bigger product than iPhone 6. iPhone 6, launched in 2014, was an era-defining product for Apple that propelled the company to record sales. But Apple's iOS subscriber base — the number of people using an Apple product — is expected to be 45-50% larger than it was in 2014, according to Nomura Instinet. This next supercycle "seems well underappreciated," analysts Jeffrey Kvaal and Gregory McNiff wrote. Their forecast is higher than the consensus of their peers: "Consensus calls for 80 million iPhones in F1Q18 (Dec '17) ... only modestly above the iPhone 6 supercycle (75 million). However, we estimate the iPhone 8 will launch into an iOS subscriber base 45-50% larger than the iPhone 6 did and model 86 million iPhones in F1Q18 (from 83 million)." The increase in subscribers has been driven by sales of the iPhone 6, the analysts say. "We believe the iPhone 6 drove the iOS base up ~35%, followed by 5-10% increases from the subsequent devices," they wrote. Anyone who is still using an iPhone 6 is a prime candidate for buying a new iPhone in late 2017. The possibility that the upcoming iPhone could tap into a large base of people who are waiting to upgrade has been floated by several analysts before as a rationale for being bullish on Apple. The iPhone 8 — codenamed "Ferrari," according to leaked manufacturing documents — is expected to include a new kind of OLED screen already used by Samsung, which would allow the phone to have a borderless, all-display front surface. This OLED model may trigger replacement demand among high-end users, especially if it comes in an all-new design with notably superior specs, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Other rumoured features the document mentions include a glass-sandwich design — glass on the front and back of the phone — an invisible home button, and wireless charging.

While the graphics aren’t stunning in technical quality, the stylish and retro 60’s inspired theme is a nice throwback to the classic secret agent era of James Bond, Dick Tracy, and The Avengers. More importantly, however, the puzzles are challenging and engaging without being frustrating. While I was somewhat stuck at a few points, I didn’t find myself so stuck that I became tempted to look for hints online, which speaks to the game’s playability — you’re encouraged to keep poking around even when the answers aren’t obvious. While Agent A has been out for a while, the version 3.0 update adds a new chapter in a new environment with more interesting puzzles to solve, and even that’s open-ended — I’m already eagerly waiting to see what Chapter 4 holds. Another interesting point to note is that while the game is available both on the Apple TV and iPhone/iPad, players who want more of a challenge will want to tackle the iOS version. Somewhat by necessity of using the Siri remote rather than a touchscreen, the tvOS version presents “hot points” showing you everything you can interact with. While I prefer this to a free-floating cursor, it does provide a few more clues that aren’t available on the iOS side by showing you targets on areas you might not otherwise think to tap. Magic Fireplace ($1) — Virtual fireplaces were among the first apps to debut for the fourth-generation Apple TV last year, and the App Store is now pretty much littered with a whole bunch of pretty basic apps that either provide very limited fireplace options, low-quality images, or poor integration into the tvOS experience. So I was quite pleased when I discovered Jetson Creative’s Magic Fireplace. It’s an inexpensive virtual fireplace app that not only provides a selection of 26 high-quality slo-mo 60fps fireplaces, but a whole collection of other more advanced features ranging from customizing background sounds, mixing with music, displaying an on-screen clock, and even multiple color filters. All the fireplace videos looked stunning on my 65” plasma TV. Not surprising, considering the developer notes they were professionally mastered at 4K and the app isn’t just an iOS port — it was built with Metal specifically for the Apple TV. Individual fireplaces can be marked as favorites and you can scroll through them with the Siri Remote, or even automatically shuffle through your favorites or all fireplace selections. Eight different background soundtracks are also available, so you can customize how you want your fireplace to sound, and you can mix it with any music that’s already playing on your Apple TV and adjust the relative volume of the soundtrack so that it blends well with your music tracks. Black and white, sepia, grayscale, and retro filters are also in the app for changing up the colors, and four clock display modes allow you to optionally display the time and date over the fireplace. Maybe it’s just the heat that my plasma TV throws off by itself, but Magic Fireplace makes my living room feel even warmer than usual, and it ran pretty regularly here over the whole holiday season (naturally with appropriate Christmas music from Apple Music as a backtrack). The only downside is that it can’t be used as a default Apple TV screensaver, but that’s Apple’s limitation, not the developer’s. Strike! Ten Pin Bowling (free / $9) — This tvOS bowling game by Touch Mechanics turns the Siri Remote into a Wii-style motion controller, and will therefore be familiar to anybody who has wasted hours of their time bowling on the Wii. It’s a pretty straightforward bowling game, with smooth graphics and realistic physics, and I found it pretty engaging and hard to put down. It’s also good for indoor winter exercise — I easily made my Apple Watch workout goals after about an hour of play. The Siri Remote is used to pick up and throw the ball using natural motions that any fan of Wii bowling will already be familiar with, and the accelerometer in the remote lets you add spin and curve the ball as you swing and release. The full classic 10 pin game is here, along with three mini games and online play through Game Center, at least in the iOS versions — sadly, this seems to be unavailable when playing on the Apple TV. Other features like ball customization also appeared to be missing on the tvOS side, and it’s worth noting that while you’ll be able to bowl in the free version, the full tvOS games require separate purchases of up to $9 for the entire gaming pack, making the free version more of a trial version. That said, in my opinion, it’s a quality game well worth the price tag for the full series, and a lot of fun on the Apple TV. The only real downside is that I found myself concerned about accidentally hurling the Siri Remote into the TV screen. This may be the best justification we’ve seen to spend $13 on Apple’s Siri Remote Loop or something like Griffin’s Survivor Play for Siri Remote to improve your grip. Warp Shift (free) — Rounding out the set of apps I’ve been enjoying lately is FISHLABS’ new Warp Shift, and intriguing and challenging puzzle game with stunning graphics and sound design and engaging gameplay. While the premise seems pretty simple — rearrange a series of cube-shaped rooms to help your character find her way to the exit portal for each level — it ramps up in difficulty as you work your way through, and if you’re someone like me who always wants to nail the three-star rating on each level, you’ll be left twisting your brain to figure out how to do this in the very fewest possible moves. There are no in-app purchases here beyond completely optional hint packs, and even then FISHLABS gives you a free hint in exchange for watching an advertising video, so even if you’re really stuck you don’t really have to spend any money here unless you want to. Everything is done via taps and swipes, and scores are counted on move limits, not time limits, so there’s no rush, and the game is actually quite relaxing and ponderous as opposed to feeling rushed or energetic — even the soundtrack promotes a certain relaxing feel to the game. I actually found the whole experience to be very great for kicking back and de-stressing. Warp Shift is easily the most mesmerizing and relaxing puzzle game I’ve played since Monument Valley, and best of all, it’s entirely free.

Apple (AAPL.O) climbed 1.1 percent after Canada’s Competition Bureau did not find sufficient evidence the iPhone maker had engaged in anti-competitive conduct, closing a two-year investigation into the company. Wall Street has been on a tear since Trump won the U.S. election in November, with the Dow up 9 percent as investors bet he will stimulate the economy with lower taxes and infrastructure spending. While Friday’s gains suggested the rally was not yet over, some investors have grown cautious. “The market’s advance is understandable because of the economic stimulus optimism associated with a new Trump presidency,” said CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall. “But parabolic market advances traditionally experience digestion of these gains, and I don’t think this time will be any different.” The record trading session followed a U.S. Labor Department report that showed the economy added fewer-than-expected jobs last month but wages increased, suggesting resilience in the labor market. Stocks did not react significantly to a report that five people were dead in a shooting at Florida’s Fort Lauderdale airport. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 64.51 points, or 0.32 percent, to end at 19,963.8 points. The index rose as high as 19,999.63 but lost ground. Goldman Sachs (GS.N) rose 1.48 percent, helping the Dow more than any other stock. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 7.98 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,276.98, its highest close ever. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,521.06, also a record. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, led by the technology sector’s .SPLRCT 0.96 percent gain. For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent while the S&P gained 1.7 percent and the Nasdaq jumped 2.6 percent. INVESTORS EYE EARNINGS The strength of fourth-quarter earnings reports from U.S. companies over the next few weeks will be closely watched by investors eyeing high stock valuations. Following its recent gains, the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, pricey compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Analysts on average expect fourth-quarter earnings to rise 6.1 percent compared to a year before, when slumping oil prices crippled energy companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. During the session, Amgen (AMGN.O) rose 2.48 percent after a U.S. district judge blocked Sanofi (SASY.PA) and Regeneron (REGN.O) from selling their cholesterol drug, which Amgen said infringed its patents. Regeneron fell 5.84 percent and was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P 500. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.11-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 24 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 76 new highs and 15 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, a bit under the 6.7 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon The Dow came within one point of 20,000 for the first time on Friday and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 reached record highs, boosted by Apple, extending a two-month rally fueled by optimism about U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Apple climbed 1.1 per cent after Canada’s Competition Bureau did not find sufficient evidence the iPhone maker had engaged in anti-competitive conduct, closing a two-year investigation into the company. Wall Street has been on a tear since Trump won the U.S. election in November, with the Dow up 9 per cent as investors bet he will stimulate the economy with lower taxes and infrastructure spending. While Friday’s gains suggested the rally was not yet over, some investors have grown cautious. “The market’s advance is understandable because of the economic stimulus optimism associated with a new Trump presidency,” said CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall. “But parabolic market advances traditionally experience digestion of these gains, and I don’t think this time will be any different.” The record trading session followed a U.S. Labor Department report that showed the economy added fewer-than-expected jobs last month but wages increased, suggesting resilience in the labor market. Stocks did not react significantly to a report that five people were dead in a shooting at Florida’s Fort Lauderdale airport. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 64.51 points, or 0.32 per cent, to end at 19,963.8 points. The index rose as high as 19,999.63 but lost ground. Goldman Sachs rose 1.48 per cent, helping the Dow more than any other stock. The S&P 500 gained 7.98 points, or 0.35 per cent, to 2,276.98, its highest close ever. The Nasdaq Composite  added 33.12 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 5,521.06, also a record. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, led by the technology sector’s 0.96 per cent gain. For the week, the Dow rose 1 per cent while the S&P gained 1.7 per cent and the Nasdaq jumped 2.6 per cent. Canada’s main stock index fell on Friday as gold miners and other materials stocks led a broad retreat to end an otherwise robust week of gains to start 2017. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index unofficially closed down 90.53 points, or 0.58 per cent, at 15,496.05. The index gained 1.4 per cent over the holiday-shortened week. The strength of fourth-quarter earnings reports from U.S. companies over the next few weeks will be closely watched by investors eyeing high stock valuations. Following its recent gains, the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, pricey compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Analysts on average expect fourth-quarter earnings to rise 6.1 per cent compared to a year before, when slumping oil prices crippled energy companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.6 per cent after falling 1 per cent Thursday. It is little changed for the week. The offshore yuan fell 0.6 per cent to 6.8304 per dollar after a four-day climb. The euro dropped 0.7 percent to US$1.0534 and the pound retreated 1.1 percent to US$1.2288. Canada’s dollar was little changed at $1.3263 against its U.S. counterpart after the country posted its first trade surplus in more than two years and full-time jobs surged. Turkey’s lira was down 1.4 percent after touching a record low Thursday. Crude was little changed at US$53.74 a barrel in New York. U.S. government data showed strong job and wage gains while Kuwait and Saudi Arabia signaled they are curbing output. Gold futures fell 0.8 per cent to US$1,172.50 an ounce. Copper slipped 0.6 per cent and natural gas futures slid 0.7 per cent. © Thomson Reuters 2017 with files from Bloomberg News Find Financial Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Typo?

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley resident shares granddaughter's once-in-a-lifetime concert experience Friday Jan 6, 2017 at 12:57 PM Jan 6, 2017 at 5:01 PM Monica Solano Staff Writer @DP_MonicaInes APPLE VALLEY — Holding up a large yellow poster that read, “This is my 13th Birthday Present,” a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity was how young Briana Dinsdale described her seven minutes of fame when she was called up on stage by Keith Urban during a recent concert in Brisbane, Australia. “I knew they were going to the concert since they purchased the tickets well in advance, but I didn't think that would happen,” said Dinsdale's grandfather and Apple Valley resident William Wetzell. “I was both shocked and happy to know she had the best birthday ever.” Wetzell couldn’t contain his joy after being told his granddaughter was given the opportunity to stand alongside the country superstar on Dec. 17 and reached out to the Daily Press. The concert tickets were a birthday present for Dinsdale, but she never anticipated she'd get called on stage by Urban and given the opportunity to perform in front of thousands of people. “Knowing that Keith is such an amazing human being and to show that he cares for his fans was the biggest takeaway from that concert,” said Dinsdale, 13, who lives in Logan, Queensland, Australia. “Not many celebrities let their fans come on stage with them and take the time to get to know them.” Despite the long distance, Wetzell and Dinsdale remain very close thanks to an unbreakable bond over their love of music and Skype once a week, which is how Wetzell found out about the surprise at the concert. “She and the rest of her family are the love of our lives,” Wetzell said. “My wife and I could brag on and on about them. Music plays a huge part in their family and Briana has always been musically driven since she was a young girl.” A longtime fan of Urban, Dinsdale was starstruck when the famous country singer took notice of the sign and invited her to join him on stage. While on stage, Dinsdale told Urban she knew how to play piano and guitar, and she performed a few lines of “Temporary Home” by Carrie Underwood, wowing both Urban and the audience in the process. Urban then offered to take a selfie with the young girl before leaving the stage, all while her family captured the entire experience on video. Soon after, the video was posted on Dinsdale’s personal YouTube channel, where she also uploads her own original content and covers. The video, titled “The day I met Keith Urban,” has received over 104,000 views. “I’ve always been a fan of country music. I grew up with it thanks to my parents and playing piano when I was 4 was my parents' idea that music was an excellent way to assist my learning,” Dinsdale said. “Being a country singer, it allows you to be yourself and express your feelings in song. It brings the spark out in me.” During her free time, Dinsdale regularly performs and competes in country music competitions, and said in 2016 she was lucky enough to place first in a couple of categories. Along with participating in dance and running on her school’s cross country team, Wetzell said the young girl has also performed at the Raymond Theater. “She sang and recorded a song called ‘Grandpa’ as a Christmas present for me two years ago,” Wetzell said. “It was the best gift I’d ever received; I had to hold back tears. I'm very proud of her."  Dinsdale said she hopes to continue pursuing her dreams of becoming a famous songwriter, whether it be performing gigs at restaurants or playing in front of 15,000 people like Urban. “I would take in mind what Keith did for me and take the time to get to know my fans and let them get to know me,” Dinsdale said. "Just like Keith." Monica Solano can be reached at MSolano@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6231. Follow her on Twitter @DP_MonicaInes.

According to the report, the tech giant may continue using a-Si TFT-LCD for its computers until the end of the first quarter before making the shift to IGZO. Samsung and Sharp will allegedly start supplying IGZO panels to Apple by mid-2017, the report says. IGZO is a semiconducting material made up of Indium, Gallium, Zinc and Oxygen. It makes transistors smaller and provides a crystal clear display, Sharp explains on its site. IGZO has twice the resolution of ordinary LCDs, uses less power and delivers “life-like picture in super high definition.” Its electron mobility is 20-50 times faster than the MacBook Pro’s current display material.  Related Stories No More Battery Life Indicator with macOS Sierra 10.12. 2 Update CES 2017: You Will Soon Use Apple Pay At Vending Machines Apple’s switch to IGZO displays also suggests the company may soon introduce a new line of next-generation MacBook Pro. Apple will order approximately 13.6 million MacBook Pro display panels this year, fewer than the 16.2 million units ordered in 2016, IHS says. LG Display will likely remain as Apple’s largest supplier. Panels for MacBook Air will decrease from 6 million units in 2016 to 2.7 million this year, since production of those devices will end in 2017, the report says. Meanwhile, procurement for the MacBook Pro will rise from 8.8 million units last year to 9.7 million this year.

This will be the company’s first official store in the country, which also plays home to the headquarters of Samsung, Apple’s largest competitor in the smartphone space. A spokesperson for Apple confirmed the plans with Reuters via email, saying “We’re excited about opening our first Apple Store in Korea, one of the world’s economic centers and a leader in telecommunication and technology, with a vibrant K-culture.” The person wouldn’t say, however, where in Seoul the retail store will be located, or when it will open. There are 15 retail job listings for the store on Apple’s website, including a store leader and business manager, but they don’t reveal any added details. Regardless, when it happens, this will be an interesting move for Apple as it’s essentially moving onto Samsung’s home turf. The two companies are not only competitors, but they are also litigation rivals locked in several lawsuits, and supply chain partners.

And chances are that longtime Mac owners will have a mini DisplayPort-capable monitor lying around, as Apple has supported the standard since 2008. But if you want to connect your new MacBook to your mini DisplayPort monitor (including pre-2011 iMacs in Target Display Mode), you need to be aware of some compatibility limitations when it comes to Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C adapters. As discussed on Mac Geek Gab Episode 638, Apple’s Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter, while seemingly the simplest option, isn’t going to do the job. That’s because even though Macs with Thunderbolt 2 ports could output mini DisplayPort video, Apple didn’t include that functionality in the Thunderbolt 3 adapter. As stated in Apple Support Article HT207266: The Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter doesn’t support connections to these devices: Apple LED Cinema Display DisplayPort or mini DisplayPort displays DisplayPort or mini DisplayPort adapters, such as Mini DisplayPort to HDMI or Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapters Thunderbolt 3/USB-C to mini DisplayPort So if Apple’s adapter isn’t the answer, what is? One solution would be to pick up a Thunderbolt 3 docking station that has either a mini DisplayPort or full-sized DisplayPort output, such as the OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock. But Thunderbolt 3 docking stations are relatively expensive, and if all you’re looking for is a way to connect your 2016 MacBook Pro to your mini DisplayPort monitor, there’s a cheaper solution. As discussed on the NosillaCast podcast, you’ll need to turn to a third party adapter for mini DisplayPort compatibility. One such option recommended by a listener to the NosillaCast is the All Smart Life USB-C to mini DisplayPort Adapter, currently priced at $21.99. You’ll also find a range of similar adapters over at Amazon. Just plug it into your 2016 MacBook Pro, connect your monitor to the adapter’s mini DisplayPort connection, and you should be good to go. Apple’s Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter is still useful, of course, but only for connecting legacy Thunderbolt devices or Thunderbolt-capable displays such as the 27-inch Thunderbolt Display.

From Disney animators sketching classic characters, to an illustrator using an iPad Pro to design the New Yorker’s latest cover. In today’s latest artistic drive, Apple has partnered with five young Chinese artists to reinvent classic Nianhua folk art. On Apple’s new Made in CNY page, artists share the tools of their trade along with their art. Apple has written a small piece on each artist who showcase five different stylings used to tell the story of the Nianhua, Chinese for ‘Year Picture.’ More interestingly, Apple is also showing individual times to meet these very artists at different Apple Stores located around China. Interested customers can head over to the site to register for the events when they become live. The artists have used a mix of Apple products to create the final works seen on the website, including MacBook Pros, iMacs, and iPad Pros and the Apple Pencil. In Jianh Shan’s Fortune Flows (pictured above), the artist drafted the artwork down on paper, before eventually moving to Adobe Illustrator to round out the final touches. With Lucky Rooster, Victo Ngai used the Apple Pencil, iPad Pro, and the Procreate app to sketch out her work, and moved to the MacBook Pro to finalize the composition.

Head over to the Made in CNY page to read more on how each artist designed their work and to download free copies of each as a Mac, iPhone, or iPad wallpaper.

Reuters/Mike Segar The iPhone 7 Plus is the best phone Apple has ever produced to date, but how does it fare battery-wise against its predecessors? Let’s see if the Cupertino-based tech giant’s latest handset can topple the older iPhone 6s Plus and the even older iPhone 6 Plus in a battery endurance test. The new iPhone 7 Plus equips a non-removable lithium-ion battery with 2,900 mAh capacity. It offers up to 21 hours of phone calls and 60 hours of music play. Apple’s latest smartphone can last a couple days of moderate usage. One advantage that the iPhone 7 Plus has over the previous models is that it packs the latest energy-efficient A10 Fusion chipset, which allows for a longer battery life. No fast charging feature is available on the iPhone 7 Plus, so charging can take more than two hours before the battery is full. The iPhone 6s Plus lithium-ion battery is also non-removable although it has a much lower capacity compared to that of the iPhone 7 Plus at 2,750 mAh. The 6s Plus delivers up to 24 hours of talk time and 80 hours of music play. Just like its successor, it can last up to two days with normal use. The iPhone 6s Plus also has a battery-saving feature that provides an extra number of hours. Users can turn it on by going to Settings so they can be notified when the battery level drops to 20 percent. The iPhone 6s Plus also takes about two hours to fully charge. The iPhone 6 Plus furnishes a non-removable 2,915 mAh lithium polymer battery, which is slightly more powerful than that of the iPhone 7 Plus in terms of strength, although it provides the same number of hours as the iPhone 6s Plus when it comes to phone calls and music play. According to Trusted Reviews, the iPhone 6 Plus can last two full days of reasonable use provided that the display brightness is set to 50 percent. When TechRadar pitted the three Apple iPhone Plus handsets against each other in a rigid battery performance test, the iPhone 6 Plus was completely drained after just 3 hours and 34 minutes of work. The iPhone 6s Plus lasted 3 hours and 54 minutes while the iPhone 7 Plus withstood the heavy labour the longest, lasting 4 hours and 15 minutes.

A newly discovered video, posted to YouTube by independent tech journalist Sonny Dickson, shows an iPhone running an iPod-like precursor to the iOS operating system, dubbed Acorn. In the prototype, the iPhone was controlled by a virtual “click wheel” in the bottom half of the screen, not the familiar touch-button apps we know today. The prototype had a menu display in the top half, just like early version of the iPod, and a black strip in the middle with buttons for rewind, menu, play/pause and fast forward. The Acorn software was entirely text-based, with options for “favorites,” “recents,” “dial” and “SMS,” in addition to all the menu items familiar to iPod users at the time. Though the video doesn’t show a call being placed, it gives us a peek at a dialer that probably would have driven iPhone owners insane. It appears as though people would have had to dial numbers like on an old rotary phone. God help them if they wanted to type a text message. “You can see why we ditched it?” iPod designer and former Apple executive Tony Fadell tweeted Friday morning. The click-wheel iPhone has long been legend. Steve Jobs biographer Walter Isaacson wrote that Apple’s engineers weren’t sure customers would be able to master a smartphone with a touchscreen, so they pursued an alternate operating system controlled by a click wheel. Until Friday, a patent filed in 2006 was our only glimpse at what a click-wheel iPhone could have looked like. It turns out the patent drawings were very similar to the prototype revealed on Friday. Early prototypes for the iPhone are rarely seen: Apple famously destroys its rejected designs to avoid leaks. But we’ve been treated to a few glimpses into Apple engineers’ thinking about how the first iPhone should have been designed. A patent dispute with Samsung in 2012 made public several early versions of the iPhone’s hardware, including some truly odd shapes and sizes. According to Isaacson’s biography, Apple’s engineers got fully behind the touchscreen concept because they could not figure out how to dial and text using a click wheel. The touchscreen iPhone we’re all familiar with ultimately debuted in 2007.

Noel Randewich Reuters Published Friday, Jan. 06, 2017 4:25PM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 06, 2017 4:25PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print The Dow came within one point of the 20,000-point milestone for the first time ever on Friday, boosted by a rise in Apple shares and extending a two-month rally fuelled by optimism that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s policies will bolster the economy. Canada’s main stock index fell on Friday as gold miners and other materials stocks led a broad retreat to end an otherwise robust week of gains to start 2017. All three major U.S. indexes were set to notch record high closes, helped by Apple. The iPhone maker climbed 1.16 per cent after Canada’s Competition Bureau did not find sufficient evidence it had engaged in anti-competitive conduct, closing a two-year investigation into the company. U.S. stocks have risen sharply since Trump won the U.S. election in November, with the Dow up 9 per cent. While Friday’s gains suggested the rally was not yet over, some investors have grown cautious. “The market’s advance is understandable because of the economic stimulus optimism associated with a new Trump presidency,” said CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall. “But parabolic market advances traditionally experience digestion of these gains, and I don’t think this time will be any different.” The first record high of the year for the S&P 500 followed a U.S. Labor Department report that showed the economy added fewer-than-expected jobs last month but wages increased, suggesting resilience in the labour market. Stocks did not react significantly to a report that five people were dead following a shooting at Florida’s Fort Lauderdale airport. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 64.99 points, or 0.33 per cent, to 19,964.28, the S&P 500 gained 8.01 points, or 0.35 per cent, to 2,277.01 and the Nasdaq Composite added 33.12 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 5,521.06. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index closed down 90.53 points, or 0.58 per cent, at 15,496.05. The index gained 1.4 per cent over the holiday-shortened week. The Canadian dollar fell 0.07 of a cent to 75.5 cents (U.S.) after a strong week of gains as commodity prices rose. Nine of the 10 TSX sectors were down, led lower by a 3.48-per-cent decrease in the materials sector, and a decline of 1 per cent by the consumer staples sector. Crew Energy was down 4 per cent, Air Canada fell 1.24 per cent, while MacDonald Dettwiler rose 2.8 per cent after announcing a $100-million contract with NASA. In the U.S., Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by the technology sector’s 1.07 per cent gain. The Nasdaq was on track to end the week up 2.7 per cent. The S&P 500 headed for a 1.8 per cent weekly rise while the Dow was on track to end 1.1 per cent higher for the week. The strength of fourth-quarter earnings reports from U.S. companies over the next few weeks will be closely watched by investors eyeing high stock valuations. Following its recent gains, the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, pricey compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Analysts on average expect fourth-quarter earnings to rise 6.1 per cent compared to a year before, when slumping oil prices crippled energy companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. During the session, Amgen rose 2.7 per cent after a U.S. district judge blocked Sanofi and Regeneron from selling their cholesterol drug, which Amgen said infringed its patents. Regeneron fell 5.3 per cent and was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P 500. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.12-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 24 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 71 new highs and 14 new lows.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Canadian Competition Bureau Closes its Investigation into Apple Conducting Anti-Competitive Practices | Main | Oh, this News would have put a Big Smile on Steve Jobs Face » January 06, 2017 Huawei Begins their Big Squeeze on Samsung in the U.S. Today   In December Patently Apple posted a report titled "Samsung is going to Experience the 'Big Squeeze' in 2017 and their U.S. Market Share is Headed for a Crash." The report noted that Huawei, Oppo and Xiaomi were coming to the U.S. in 2017 and with more quality Android smartphone options, Samsung was likely to experience a decline in U.S. smartphone market share. On Monday Samsung's Co-CEO Kwon Oh-hyun addressed employees and warned that Samsung would experience "lagging" growth in its key markets and pledged reforms to avoid a repeat of the "expensive" Note 7 smartphone recall debacle.   This week at a pre-CES event, Huawei Device USA revealed that its highly-acclaimed Huawei Mate 9 will be available in the United States starting January 6, 2017. Building on Huawei's renowned innovation, the beautifully-designed Mate 9 delivers an all-new Android experience, featuring fast computing performance for 18 months with the new Kirin 960 chipset and machine-learning algorithm, SuperCharge technology for safe and fast charging, and a stunning new photo experience. For more of the details on this smartphone see Huawei's full press release here.   Oppo is likely aiming to enter the market later this fall. The only one of the original three that won't be coming to the U.S. as first forecasted is Xiaomi who basically chickened out. Xiaomi's global VP, Hugo Barra was quick to dispell any hope for their Mi line of Xiaomi phones entering the U.S. this year.   Bara squirmed around the rumors by saying that "We don't have any specific-enough plans yet that we're comfortable talking about yet." Of course the bravado was at a fever pitch about Xiaomi coming to the U.S. when Xiaomi was hitting the top five smartphone makers chart in China. This year they were wiped off that chart by Oppo and Vivo (owned by BBK) and new challengers are on the way like OnePlus.   So their glorious dreams of entering the U.S. on a flying chariot of fire is now all but a lost opportunity. They're just one brand amongst many mid-tier players with nothing much that could distinguish them.     Barra added that "We don't want to go anywhere near the half-hearted efforts to launch a brand in the US just to say we're in the US."   At the end of the day, Samsung was able to change the narrative about their disastrous Note7 today by pre-announcing that the conglomerate known as Samsung was going to announce a very strong quarter.   But let's not lose sight of the reality that their mobile division was a major loser this quarter and if it wasn't for an army of other products made under the Samsung brand, their stock would have gotten run over by Wall Street brokers running for the doors.   The reality of the day is that their Co-CEO said on Monday that they would experience "lagging" growth in its key markets – and that of course is a reference to the U.S., first and foremost, and it's due to new competition on the way that started this week with Huawei's announcement at a pre-CES event.   The big squeeze has begun and the anniversary iPhone is only going to give Samsung a bigger headache later this year. But as much as I'm not a fan of Samsung, they're a resilient mega beast and the Galaxy S8 is going to be jammed packed with goodies to delight their fans.   Samsung may even try to get under the skin of Apple fans by offering their new Galaxy S8 customers free wireless earbuds to mock Apple's very expensive AirPods. It's hard to believe that Samsung would go that far to sell their new smartphone, but that's what the rumor was this week. Desperate times push companies to take desperate measures and the big squeeze on Samsung has only begun.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Andrew Cunningham - Jan 6, 2017 6:14 pm UTC Enlarge / Apple's executive pay for 2016. Apple reader comments 150 Share this story Further ReadingApple is 19 percent less profitable in Q4 of 2016 than in Q4 of 2015 Apple raked in $215.6 billion in sales in 2016, but it wasn't enough to keep the company from reporting its first year-over-year sales decline since 2001. According to the company's definitive proxy statement filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the company's sales declined from $233.7 billion in 2015, and its operating income likewise fell from $71.2 billion in 2015 to $60.0 billion in 2016. The decline in these two metrics was enough to significantly cut incentive-based pay for Tim Cook and a number of other high-level Apple executives. The SEC report lists the earnings of six "named executives," including CEO Tim Cook, CFO Luca Maestri, Retail SVP Angela Ahrendts, Internet Software and Services SVP Eddy Cue, Hardware Engineering SVP Dan Riccio, and General Counsel Bruce Sewell. Cook's base salary is set at $3 million, while the other executives' base pay is $1 million. Each executive has the opportunity to earn up to four times his or her base salary if the company meets net sales and operating income goals. Incentive payout targets versus where Apple fell in 2016. Apple Last year, all of the executives maxed out their potential cash bonuses—Cook received an $8 million cash bonus based on his then-$2 million base salary, and the other named executives earned $4 million based on their $1 million base salaries. This year, Cook earned $5.3 million and other executives earned about $1.8 million, a little less than twice each executive's base salary. Each of the executives aside from Cook received $20 million in stock, $8 million of which is incentive-based (though the way these incentives are awarded depends on Apple's stock performance relative to other companies rather than its revenue). Apple's revenue fell this year mostly because the iPhone declined—the iPhone 6S was unable to repeat the iPhone 6's success. Sales in China fell precipitously after surging in 2015, and unexpectedly strong sales for the iPhone SE lowered the iPhone's average selling price. Revenue from services like the App Store and Apple Music grew at a steady clip throughout the year, but it wasn't nearly enough to make up for the iPhone's stumble or the smaller year-over-year dips in iPad and Mac sales. For 2017, Apple will be making its executives' pay even more dependent on performance—specifically, up to 50 percent of "long-term equity incentives" (i.e. stock) will rely on the company's performance in the coming fiscal year. The company's earnings call for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 will happen on January 31, and the company has projected revenue between $76 and $78 billion, slightly beating the $75.9 billion it earned in the first quarter of 2016.

LIKE   TWEET   SHARE   PIN   SHARE   POST MAIL MORE Posted January 6, 2017 at 8:08pm by iClarified · 7263 views · Translate Apple is planning to shift to IGZO display panels for the MacBook Pro in the second quarter of 2017, according to an IHS report via DigiTimes. It's estimated that Apple will purchase 13.6 million notebook panels in 2017, that's fewer than the 16.2 million it purchased in 2016. LG will likely remain Apple's largest supplier. IHS believes that Apple will stop production of the 11.6-inch MacBook Air this year and so the number of MacBook Air panels it purchases will reportedly decrease from 6 million to 2.7 million as there is considerable 13.3-inch inventory. Currently, Apple uses a-Si TFT-LCD panels for the MacBook Pro but that will purportedly change very soon. Apple may continue to procure a-Si TFT-LCD panels for the MacBook Pro until the end of the first quarter of 2017 and then shift to IGZO TFT-LCD panels. In addition to Samsung Display, Sharp will begin supplying IGZO TFT-LCD panels to Apple as soon as mid-2017. Procurement for the MacBook Pro will increase from 8.8 million units in 2016 to 9.7 million units in 2017. IGZO panels use less power, have improved touch sensitivity, and increased pixel density. DisplayMate President Raymond Soneira told MacRumors that IGZO can also result in "significantly higher brightness," but the material costs "considerably more" to manufacture. "Sometimes IGZO is simply referred to as Metal Oxide," says Soneria. "The higher the PPI and the wider the Color Gamut (like DCI-P3 for the new MacBook Pro) the greater the benefits of IGZO over a-Si, particularly for LCDs." Notably, IGZO displays can be made smaller, perhaps allowing for a thinner MacBook Pro; however, Apple would have to balance this with battery life concerns, especially following battery issues with the new MacBook Pro. IGZO displays have been rumored for the MacBook Pro in the past; however, those rumors never materialized. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

With that in mind, how will third party accessory manufacturers figure out whether there is a large enough market for Apple Watch add-ons? The CMRA is a bold attempt for sure, being an industry-first smart watchband for the Apple Watch. First revealed to the world last November by Glide, the CMRA will boast of not just one, but a pair of High Definition (HD) cameras which will work in tandem to deliver a seamless photo and video capturing experience from your wrist itself. Yes, you might be seen as fiddling with menu options on your Apple Watch by those who do not know any better when you are actually performing a James Bond routine, trying to capture what’s going on around you. The dual-camera band would see the Apple Watch gain a self-facing camera which will pave open the way to snap selfies with your smartwatch, or to carry out a video chat on it. Certainly an accessory that is truly original at this point in time. Pre-orders for the CMRA are available for $169 a pop, where it ought to ship from this spring onward if there are no hiccups. If you missed out on the pre-order, then the final retail price would be a far more expensive $249. Filed in Gadgets. Read more about CES, CES 2017.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley resident shares granddaughter's once-in-a-lifetime concert experience Friday Jan 6, 2017 at 12:57 PM Jan 6, 2017 at 5:01 PM Monica Solano Staff Writer @DP_MonicaInes APPLE VALLEY — Holding up a large yellow poster that read, “This is my 13th Birthday Present,” a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity was how young Briana Dinsdale described her seven minutes of fame when she was called up on stage by Keith Urban during a recent concert in Brisbane, Australia. “I knew they were going to the concert since they purchased the tickets well in advance, but I didn't think that would happen,” said Dinsdale's grandfather and Apple Valley resident William Wetzell. “I was both shocked and happy to know she had the best birthday ever.” Wetzell couldn’t contain his joy after being told his granddaughter was given the opportunity to stand alongside the country superstar on Dec. 17 and reached out to the Daily Press. The concert tickets were a birthday present for Dinsdale, but she never anticipated she'd get called on stage by Urban and given the opportunity to perform in front of thousands of people. “Knowing that Keith is such an amazing human being and to show that he cares for his fans was the biggest takeaway from that concert,” said Dinsdale, 13, who lives in Logan, Queensland, Australia. “Not many celebrities let their fans come on stage with them and take the time to get to know them.” Despite the long distance, Wetzell and Dinsdale remain very close thanks to an unbreakable bond over their love of music and Skype once a week, which is how Wetzell found out about the surprise at the concert. “She and the rest of her family are the love of our lives,” Wetzell said. “My wife and I could brag on and on about them. Music plays a huge part in their family and Briana has always been musically driven since she was a young girl.” A longtime fan of Urban, Dinsdale was starstruck when the famous country singer took notice of the sign and invited her to join him on stage. While on stage, Dinsdale told Urban she knew how to play piano and guitar, and she performed a few lines of “Temporary Home” by Carrie Underwood, wowing both Urban and the audience in the process. Urban then offered to take a selfie with the young girl before leaving the stage, all while her family captured the entire experience on video. Soon after, the video was posted on Dinsdale’s personal YouTube channel, where she also uploads her own original content and covers. The video, titled “The day I met Keith Urban,” has received over 104,000 views. “I’ve always been a fan of country music. I grew up with it thanks to my parents and playing piano when I was 4 was my parents' idea that music was an excellent way to assist my learning,” Dinsdale said. “Being a country singer, it allows you to be yourself and express your feelings in song. It brings the spark out in me.” During her free time, Dinsdale regularly performs and competes in country music competitions, and said in 2016 she was lucky enough to place first in a couple of categories. Along with participating in dance and running on her school’s cross country team, Wetzell said the young girl has also performed at the Raymond Theater. “She sang and recorded a song called ‘Grandpa’ as a Christmas present for me two years ago,” Wetzell said. “It was the best gift I’d ever received; I had to hold back tears. I'm very proud of her."  Dinsdale said she hopes to continue pursuing her dreams of becoming a famous songwriter, whether it be performing gigs at restaurants or playing in front of 15,000 people like Urban. “I would take in mind what Keith did for me and take the time to get to know my fans and let them get to know me,” Dinsdale said. "Just like Keith." Monica Solano can be reached at MSolano@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6231. Follow her on Twitter @DP_MonicaInes.

The iPhone maker listed hiring notices for 15 positions dated Thursday on its website, including a store leader and a business manager. The listings did not specify the exact location or when those who are hired will begin working. "We're excited about opening our first Apple Store in Korea, one of the world's economic centres and a leader in telecommunication and technology, with a vibrant K-culture," Apple told Reuters in a statement yesterday. "We're now hiring the team that will offer our customers in Seoul the service, education and entertainment that is loved by Apple customers around the world." The company declined to comment on where in Seoul its store would be or when it would open. But South Korea's Yonhap News Agency said yesterday that construction was under way for the outlet at a location in a southern district of Seoul and that the work will likely be completed by end-November.

But now that AirPods are here and I’ve been using them daily for an extended period of time, the difference is even more striking than I anticipated. With AirPods, Apple has done what it does best: taken an emerging product category with a frustrating user experience and delivered a polished product made possible by its control over both the hardware and software. And the AirPods are one of the best examples of that in a long time. But is there any competition or even a decent alternative? Fit and Comfort The fit of AirPods was always bound to be a topic of controversy. Since they don’t have silicone or flexible tips like most competitors, which allows a certain level of customization and a particularly snug fit, they won’t work for everyone. And if they don’t fit, the rest doesn’t really matter. A lot has been made about the stem on AirPods that hangs down out of the user’s ear. Aside from housing the microphone closer to the mouth and giving some extra space for components in general, this gives AirPods another really big advantage that not many have mentioned. The charging contacts aren’t inside of the ear, which is a major downfall for the majority of competitors… I originally had hopes of using a pair from the competition as my new daily driver earbuds, replacing my wireless Jaybird earbuds that I’ve enjoyed for several months now, at least until I had a set of AirPods to compare side by side. That didn’t happen. Sol Republic’s Amps Air ($179) have great sound and for bass lovers beat out the AirPods. But they were way too bulky for me personally and ideally need to shave off about 20% in overall size before they can compete. And when weight and bulkiness wasn’t an issue– like with Skybuds and Bragi’s The Headphone— exposed charging contacts irritated my skin and caused discomfort over extended periods of use.  I had a lot of recommendations to try out Erato’s Apollo 7 buds ($249) following my previous reviews. They offered a comfortable fit and are the only non-AirPods option without charging contacts touching the skin, but the bullet-shape (opposed to the hearing-aid style of others) made them protrude in a way that both looked silly and felt a bit heavy in my ears. It’s not just the Erato and Bragi products, I had one or more of these issues with all 7 sets of cord-free earbuds I tested (full list below). The consensus on AirPods seems to be in: they fit better for more people than Apple’s old EarPods, and I found that to be true for my ears too… Zac mentioned on a recent episode of 9to5Mac’s Happy Hour podcast that it seems to be the lack of a cord pulling downward that gives the AirPods a nicer fit for more people compared to Apple’s old wired EarPods that otherwise have just about the same physical shape. Thats not unique to AirPods, but it’s part of the reason it seems AirPods are overall getting a thumbs up for fit. For that reason I’d recommend trying them even if EarPods weren’t particularly comfortable for you. There is of course going to be exceptions to that. Everyone has different ears. For me they pass the shake test no problem and I’ve been using them for daily workouts. There are also companies making accessories that might allow more people to find a comfortable and tight fit with AirPods, and I think there will be market for those.  Connectivity and Pairing When I did find a decent fit, everything but AirPods was a nightmare for connectivity and pairing.  It became quite clear in my tests in recent months that companies were having a tough time with cord-free earbuds and getting the individual earbuds to both pair and deliver stereo sound reliably. This is where the AirPods shine and live up to Apple’s ‘it just works’ promise where the competition has all failed miserably to come up with a solution.  The experience is the same with everything but AirPods. Turn on your earbuds (some will automatically turn on when taken out of their case) and then navigate to Settings, Bluetooth and select the product from a list to initiate a connection. Some are supposed to automatically pair after you’ve done this process the first time, but none of them seemed to be able to do that reliably, and that was frustrating to say the least. Erato’s Apollo 7’s would sometimes not deliver audio at all even though they’d appear as connected. Bragi’s The Headphone would sometimes deliver sub-par sound quality and require a reboot to fix. And Samsung’s and the rest almost never automatically paired reliably, requiring me to often cycle power on and off, fumble through Bluetooth settings, and swear a little while preparing to leave for my morning workout. AirPods have none of these issues. Open the case, stick them in your ears, and start playing your music. Open the case at any time and instantly get a breakdown of remaining battery for the AirPods and charging case (as pictured above). Apple needed to build something it’s calling the W1 chip to offer this seamless experience, and it makes a world of difference. You can finally use cord-free earbuds as easily as your old wired headphones, as long as you remember to charge them. Sound Quality The Skybuds and Bragi’s The Headphone both seemed promising but I eventually stopped reaching for them due to a mix of not-so-great sound quality, the exposed charging contacts mentioned above, and frustration with the pairing process among my devices. An important thing to note: the sound quality issues with the earbuds I tested weren’t always due to low-quality components necessarily but seemed to be tied a lot to Bluetooth connectivity problems and fit. The Bragi Headphone is capable of sounding half decent, but I found the experience to be rather inconsistent. I’d often have to readjust the earbuds several times to get a fit that allowed them to sound decent, and sometimes I’d get low quality sound at first until turning off and then repairing. I experienced those issues with the Skybuds too. I was mostly reviewing these products for the headphone experience, so mic quality was never a make or break feature for me. I would describe call quality as poor to passable for most of the earbuds I tested, but AirPods offered noticeably clearer call quality compared to the top of the line competition. It’s still not something I’d rely on for important calls in noisy environments, but it’s another win for the AirPods. The sound on the AirPods is nothing to brag about, but it’s solid and consistent enough that they at least get a passable grade for a recommendation. Sol Republic’s Amps Air are the only option that had noticeably bigger bass and fuller sound than AirPods, and they needed a much bulkier design to achieve it. If you are waiting for audiophile quality sound in cord-free earbuds, they simply don’t exist yet. Charging Cases Wow. Just look at the AirPods charging case next to the competition. I never truly realized just how small this thing is— it’s not much bigger than the AirPods themselves— and that doesn’t mean it’s lacking any features that the other guys have. The case charges your AirPods a handful of times, giving you around 24 hours of listening time before needing to plug-in. That’s as good and in many cases much better than all of the competition. The charging case turned out to be one of the most impressive aspects of the AirPods after getting my hands on them and comparing to what the competitors came up with. The size is a big deal considering the point of the case is to carry it around with you. Apple’s is easily pocketable. The competition? Not so much.  My time with AirPods doesn’t come without a few complaints, but those mostly fall into the nitpicking category for now as they haven’t prevented me from using the product daily. And my complaints and feature requests— things like lack of volume control without Siri and no offline Siri support for basic functions— seem like no-brainers for Apple to add in future iOS updates.  Winner: AirPods But if AirPods don’t fit, what do you go for? If they must be cord-free, Samsung’s Gear IconX buds for me and handful of people I tested with offered the best fit in the most compact form factor that looked decent in the ear. A soft matte rubber material over the entire earbud makes them particularly comfortable in the inner ear, and small hooks are positioned to lock them-in for extra security. But I still found the charging contacts to irritate my inner-ear with use over extended periods of time, which is something you’ll have to test for yourself. They sounded a bit dull compared to Apple’s AirPods that are in contrast a bit tinny but much better sounding. Unfortunately you will miss out on many of the other upsides of AirPods if you don’t have headphones with the W1-chip. But in my tests Samsung’s Gear IconX offered the best alternative for both fit, style, and sound quality if AirPods are an absolute no-go due to fit. You could also try using AirPods with a rubber ear hook attachment for a better fit, and there are strap attachments for those really worried about losing one. Or look to wireless Bluetooth W1 options with cables like the Beats PowerBeats3 and upcoming BeatsX if cord-free isn’t a must have for you right away.  Runner-up: Samsung Gear IconX But what about CES taking place in Las Vegas this week? Surely there are a number of promising competitors being shown off? Nuheara is showing off its IQ buds ($299) that are still on preorder for Q1, Earin has $249 buds with not-so-great 3 hours of battery that also aren’t shipping, and both don’t do much to shake the hearing-aid look of the current competition. So no, not really.

Home Market Boosted by Apple, Wall Street parties like it’s 19,999 Boosted by Apple, Wall Street parties like it’s 19,999 The Dow came within one point of 20,000 for the first time ever on Friday, boosted by a rise in Apple shares and extending a two-month rally fueled by optimism that Trump's policies will bolster the economy. By: Reuters | Published: January 7, 2017 2:24 AM Stocks did not react significantly to a report that five people were dead in a shooting at Florida’s Fort Lauderdale airport. (Reuters) The Dow came within one point of 20,000 for the first time ever on Friday, boosted by a rise in Apple shares and extending a two-month rally fueled by optimism that US President-elect Donald Trump’s policies will bolster the economy. All three major US indexes were set to notch record high closes, helped by Apple. The iPhone maker climbed 1.16 percent after Canada’s Competition Bureau did not find sufficient evidence it had engaged in anti-competitive conduct, closing a two-year investigation into the company. US stocks have risen sharply since Trump won the U.S. election in November, with the Dow up 9 percent. While Friday’s gains suggested the rally was not yet over, some investors have grown cautious. “The market’s advance is understandable because of the economic stimulus optimism associated with a new Trump presidency,” said CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall. “But parabolic market advances traditionally experience digestion of these gains, and I don’t think this time will be any different.” The first record high of the year for the S&P 500 followed a U.S. Labor Department report that showed the economy added fewer-than-expected jobs last month but wages increased, suggesting resilience in the labor market. Also Watch: Stocks did not react significantly to a report that five people were dead in a shooting at Florida’s Fort Lauderdale airport. At 2:57 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 84.99 points, or 0.43 percent, to 19,984.28 points. The index rose as high as 19,999.63. The S&P 500 gained 10.56 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,279.56 and the Nasdaq Composite added 39.75 points, or 0.72 percent, to 5,527.69. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by the technology sector’s 1.07 percent gain. The Nasdaq was on track to end the week up 2.7 percent. The S&P 500 headed for a 1.8 percent weekly rise while the Dow was on track to end 1.1 percent higher for the week. The strength of fourth-quarter earnings reports from U.S. companies over the next few weeks will be closely watched by investors eyeing high stock valuations. Following its recent gains, the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, pricey compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Analysts on average expect fourth-quarter earnings to rise 6.1 percent compared to a year before, when slumping oil prices crippled energy companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. During the session, Amgen rose 2.7 percent after a U.S. district judge blocked Sanofi and Regeneron from selling their cholesterol drug, which Amgen said infringed its patents. Regeneron fell 5.3 percent and was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P 500. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.12-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 24 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 71 new highs and 14 new lows. Please Wait while comments are loading...

The iBoss had to live on a mere $8.7m 6 Jan 2017 at 20:52, Shaun Nichols Peak Apple With Apple revenues down, and the normally docile tech press finally turning on the iPhone maker, top executives at the Cupertino giant – including CEO Tim Cook – took a pay cut in 2016. In its annual filing with the SEC, Apple Inc reported that its CEO was hit with a 15 per cent pay cut last year. Steve Jobs' protege logged a base salary of $3m in 2016, while bonus pay tacked on another $5.7m. That is a drop from 2015, when Cook took home $10.2m, and 2014 when he made $9.2m. The drop in pay comes thanks to the slowdown in revenue growth at Apple. Even though Cook made more in base salary (he got just $2m in 2015), the bonus pay he received in 2016 was down 33 per cent from 2015, when Cook got an $8m bonus package. This as Apple has seen much of the luster wear off of its flagship iPhone lineup. With the market already saturated for smartphones, and production issues lingering, Apple saw a drop in phone sales for the first time in years, and overall revenues began to dip from their record highs a year ago. Don't feel too bad for Cook, however. His modest $8.7m take-home was fortified by a package of vesting stock options that netted him a cool $135m payout earlier in the year. Apple also shelled out $220,432 to cover Cook's security costs, $138,462 in vacation cash-out pay, $15,900 in contributions to Cook's 401k plan, and $2,925 to cover his life insurance premiums. Other Apple execs actually fared better than the CEO in 2016. CFO Luca Maestri, software head Eddy Cue, retail head Angela Ahrendts, hardware lead Dan Riccio, and general counsel Bruce Sewell all netted $20m stock awards from the company, in addition to their $1m salaries and $1.79m bonuses. Even Apple's board members took home a tidy pay package last year. Al Gore was given $352,492 for his time, while Bob Iger made $377,289, and James Bell pocketed $465,551. Sadly, Sir Jony Ive was not listed in the filing, so we can only speculate what the design guru gets paid to narrate watch ads these days. ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections 31 Comments More from The Register Lenovo shows off 'Microsoft-friendly' VR cosplay at CES CES 2017 No actual demo, though.

A regulatory filing reveals Cook received $1.53 million less in 2016 than the previous year, as his incentive pay dropped from $10.3 million to $8.75 million. The decline in sales didn’t just affect Cook’s compensation, but a number of other high-level executives also suffered for Apple’s first annual revenue decline in 15 years. Scroll down for video  While Cook’s base salary did increase from $2 million in 2015 to $3 million last year, his ‘incentive plan compensation’ dropped from $8 million to $5.37 million. However, other executives saw a $2.21 million drop in this area from the previous year APPLE BY NUMBERS  A regulatory filing reveals that Apple CEO Tim Cook and other high-level executives also suffered from the firm's decline in sales.  Apple’s annual sales were 3.7 percent below its target of $223.6 billion, and its operating income of $60 billion was 0.5% short of the $60.3 billion target.  Cook received $1.53 million less in 2016 than the previous year – his incentive pay dropped from $10.3 million to $8.75 million.  However, other executives saw a $2.21 million drop in this area from the previous year.  The filing, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, also lists how badly of a year the Cupertino company had altogether. Apple’s annual sales were 3.7 percent below its target of $223.6 billion, and its operating income of $60 billion was 0.5% short of the $60.3 billion target. And as a result, the executives were only given 89.5 percent of their targeted annual cash incentive. While Cook’s base salary did increase from $2 million in 2015 to $3 million last year, his ‘incentive plan compensation’ dropped from $8 million to $5.37 million. His incentive pay may have taken a hit, but the CEO still took home a total of 11.74 million for 2016.  On the other hand, other executives saw a $2.21 million drop in this area from the previous year - but each took home more than 23 million in total.  A filing from August highlighted that Cook received 1.26 million Apple shares, valued at around $135 million at the time, that were previously restricted.

Share this article Share 84 shares He earned a majority of these shares by sitting as CEO for Apple for five years. And the reset were given to Cook because of Apple’s stock performance.  The drop in sales for 2016 may have been a result users being disappointed with the new iPhone 7 line - as it seems to be just a refreshed iPhone 6.  A regulatory filing (pictured) reveals Cook received $1.53 million less in 2016 than the previous year, as his incentive pay dropped from $10.3 million to $8.75 million. A number of other high-level executives also suffered for Apple’s first annual revenue decline in 15 years It was also found in a survey that Apple products only accounted for 44 percent of new smartphone and tablet activations in the week leading up to Christmas. And although that was more than double what Samsung had – Apple was still down by 5 percent from 2015. The iPhone 7 may have been a flop among the crowd, but the firm says the next smartphone will be 'the most radical design ever'. The iPhone 8 is set to be unveiled this year for the firm’s 10 year anniversary – so many iOS users are sure Apple will impress them with new cutting edge technology. Apple’s annual sales were 3.7 percent below its target of $223.6 billion, and its operating income of $60 billion was 0.5% short of the $60.3 billion target IPHONE 8 RUMORS   Several rumors have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have:  - Dual-lens 3D camera  - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings  - Curved glass casing - Plastic OLED screen  - Wireless charging  - A folding element - New 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimeter) models  - A new 'pure white' model. An unnamed employee at an Apple site in Herzliya, Israel, where hardware is being developed for the iPhone 8, has leaked some details about the new handset in September 2016. The unnamed employee told Business Insider that the iPhone 8 would be 'different' from previous handsets, which have been critiqued as being too similar.  Until now, little has been known about Apple's next iPhone, although reports by a source speaking to Nikkei Asian Review have said that it will have a curved screen. If those rumors are true, the iPhone 8 could rival the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge which came out in February this year. The employee also mentioned that the iPhone 8 would have a better camera – although this usually happens with every update.    Read more: Apple is developing hardware for the 'iPhone 8' in Israel - Business Insider High-end iPhone to have Samsung-like curved OLED display in 2017: source- Nikkei Asian Review Apple CEO Cook¿s 2016 Pay Lower as Tech Giant Misses Targets - WSJ Share or comment on this article e-mail 84 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany She's falling for him?

MailOnline gives its verdict on Nintendo's latest console While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background.

Apple climbed 1.1 per cent after Canada's Competition Bureau did not find sufficient evidence the iPhone maker had engaged in anti-competitive conduct, closing a two-year investigation into the company. Wall Street has been on a tear since Trump won the US election in November, with the Dow up 9 per cent as investors bet he will stimulate the economy with lower taxes and infrastructure spending. While Friday's gains suggested the rally was not yet over, some investors have grown cautious. "The market's advance is understandable because of the economic stimulus optimism associated with a new Trump presidency," said CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall. "But parabolic market advances traditionally experience digestion of these gains, and I don't think this time will be any different." The record trading session followed a US Labor Department report that showed the economy added fewer-than-expected jobs in December but wages increased, suggesting resilience in the labour market. Stocks did not react significantly to a report that five people were dead in a shooting at Florida's Fort Lauderdale airport. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 64.51 points, or 0.32 per cent, to end at 19,963.8 points. The index rose as high as 19,999.63 but lost ground. Goldman Sachs rose 1.48 per cent, helping the Dow more than any other stock. The S&P 500 gained 7.98 points, or 0.35 per cent, to 2,276.98, its highest close ever. The Nasdaq Composite added 33.12 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 5,521.06, also a record. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, led by the technology sector's 0.96 per cent gain. For the week, the Dow rose 1 per cent while the S&P gained 1.7 per cent and the Nasdaq jumped 2.6 per cent. INVESTORS EYE EARNINGS The strength of fourth-quarter earnings reports from US companies over the next few weeks will be closely watched by investors eyeing high stock valuations. Following its recent gains, the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, pricey compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Analysts on average expect fourth-quarter earnings to rise 6.1 per cent compared to a year before, when slumping oil prices crippled energy companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. During the session, Amgen rose 2.48 per cent after a US district judge blocked Sanofi and Regeneron from selling their cholesterol drug, which Amgen said infringed its patents. Regeneron fell 5.84 per cent and was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P 500. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.11-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 24 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 76 new highs and 15 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, a bit under the 6.7 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Stocks did not react significantly to a report that five people were dead in a shooting at Florida's Fort Lauderdale airport. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 64.51 points, or 0.32 per cent, to end at 19,963.8 points. The index rose as high as 19,999.63 but lost ground. Goldman Sachs rose 1.48 per cent, helping the Dow more than any other stock. The S&P 500 gained 7.98 points, or 0.35 per cent, to 2,276.98, its highest close ever. The Nasdaq Composite added 33.12 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 5,521.06, also a record. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, led by the technology sector's 0.96 per cent gain. For the week, the Dow rose 1 per cent while the S&P gained 1.7 per cent and the Nasdaq jumped 2.6 per cent. INVESTORS EYE EARNINGS The strength of fourth-quarter earnings reports from US companies over the next few weeks will be closely watched by investors eyeing high stock valuations. Following its recent gains, the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, pricey compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Analysts on average expect fourth-quarter earnings to rise 6.1 per cent compared to a year before, when slumping oil prices crippled energy companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. During the session, Amgen rose 2.48 per cent after a US district judge blocked Sanofi and Regeneron from selling their cholesterol drug, which Amgen said infringed its patents. Regeneron fell 5.84 per cent and was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P 500. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.11-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 24 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 76 new highs and 15 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, a bit under the 6.7 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

X Apple faces massive interest bill as Irish transfer nears NTMA understood to be involved in effort to recover Apple taxes Fri, Jan 6, 2017, 19:59 Joe Brennan Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, received the equivalent of $145 million (€137.3 million) in the year to September. Photograph: Kimberly White/Reuters         Apple is preparing to pay a massive interest bill into an escrow account in addition to €13 billion of back-taxes the European Commission says is owed to the Republic after finding last year the iPhone maker’s Irish tax affairs breached state-aid rules. feqr Having missed an initial deadline on Tuesday for the collection of the taxes and interest, even as Ireland and Apple are appealing the EU decision, State officials are seeking to finalise the matter within weeks with the technology company. Accountancy firm Grant Thornton estimated in August that the interest cost alone could run to €6 billion, based on rates applied by the Revenue Commissioners. However, sources said that the figure will be lower, and calculated according to a less onerous state-aid recovery rate formula. It is understood the National Treasury Management Agency will play a role in the collection of the money, given the size and complexity of the transaction. However, control of the funds will ultimately be the responsibility of a trustee, as the case winds its way through European courts, a process which could take up to six years. Actively managed The sheer amount involved means the funds cannot merely be transferred into a bank account. The money will have to be actively managed, according to sources, most likely along the lines of how Apple runs its own cash hoard, which grew to a record $237.6 billion at the end of its financial year in September. Inside China’s ‘iPhone City’, the land of sweeteners and perks John McManus: Apple’s adventures in tax wonderland Apple ruling: EU accuses Ireland of inconsistencies on tax rules Only €20.5 billion of Apple’s overall pool is made up of actual cash or cash equivalents, according to the latest annual report. The remainder is invested in corporate bonds, US and other government debts as well as mortgage- and other asset-backed securities. The group’s effective interest rate the entire portfolio last year was 1.73 per cent. ADVERTISEMENT A spokesman for the Department of Finance said that while Ireland missed last Tuesday’s initial deadline for collecting the Apple taxes and interest, the European Commission is satisfied with progress that has been made by the State and Apple on the matter. He declined to comment further. It is understood the payment will be made soon. Firstly, the Revenue Commissioners must align the EU’s formula of how much tax is owed between 2003 and 2014 with Irish tax law. An EU Commission spokeswoman said Brussels remains in contact with Irish authorities on the matter. A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment. Meanwhile, it emerged on Friday that Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, received the equivalent of $145 million (€137.3 million) in the year to September as he was given $137 million of previously-awarded share bonuses tied to his 2011 promotion to the top job. His actual remuneration for last year fell by $1.5 million to $8.75 million as the group missed its own sale and profit targets. Mr Cook this week declined an invitation to appear at the Oireachtas finance committee to discuss the EU ruling. Apple told the committee it didn’t want to “potentially prejudice future outcomes” of the case. The decision not to give testimony drew criticism from a number of TDs, including Fianna Fáil finance spokesman Michael McGrath and his Sinn Féin counterpart, Pearse Doherty, as well as the Labour Party’s Seán Sherlock.       Topics: Apple tax Michael Mcgrath Pearse Doherty Sean Sherlock Tim Cook Department of Finance Eu European Commission Fianna Fáil Labour National Treasury Management Agency Oireachtas Sinn Fein Read More Apple dismisses tax bill, says Ireland ‘doesn’t do any engineering for us’ Cliff Taylor: Battle lines drawn in State’s EU Apple appeal Court ruling on Spanish tax may give clues to Apple appeal Meet ‘the Maxforce’ – the EU team that fined Ireland €13bn over Apple Apple CEO invited to attend tax ruling hearing in Dublin EU Court asks Government to tweak its Apple tax appeal Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy Oxfam report reveals ‘obscene’ gap between rich and poor Retail & Services Irish retailers angry as State leaves them out in the cold Rugby Ulster unable to build on start as Exeter end European adventure Economy We could be looking at ‘hard Brexit’.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Pandora turns south as investors shrug off latest acquisition talk By Rex Crum / January 6, 2017 at 11:38 AM Another year…and another batch of speculation begins about the future of Pandora Media. The Oakland-based internet radio company is preparing to roll out its first true, on-demand streaming music service, dubbed Pandora Premium. With close to 80 million users, the majority of whom use Pandora’s free, ad-supported music-listening option, Pandora hopes to attract some of those listeners to Pandora Premium and its expected $10-a-month subscription fee. For that amount, listeners will get to search and play anything they can find, build their own playlists and take their music selections with them offline when the service launches, possibly in the first quarter of the year. It’s a big move for Pandora, which is trying to maintain its leadership position among internet music-streaming rivals such as Spotify and Apple Music. And when it happens, it will arrive on the heels of continuing talk that satellite-radio company Sirius XM may be interested in buying Pandora, and how Apple might benefit from acquiring one, if not both companies. The theory is that Apple, which is making services a bigger part of it future business efforts, would strengthen that side of its operations with Pandora under its wing. Apple has about 20 million paid subscribers to its Apple Music service, but Pandora has nearly four times as many members. In addition to its upcoming Pandora Premium service, Pandora recently launched Pandora Plus, a $4.99-a-month streaming option with no ads which allows for unlimited replays of songs. Again, those are paying customers that would give a boost to Apple’s services business. Pandora shares, however, fell more than 4 percent Friday, to $12.48. A drop like that suggests that the market isn’t putting much credence in the latest Pandora-as-an-acquisition speculation. After all, Pandora has a market capitalization of $2.88 billion. Any purchase would include a premium of, say 25 percent on top of that. That would bring the price tag, at least as of this writing, to $3.6 billion. The only time Apple paid anywhere near that amount for anything was when it wrote a $3 billion check for Beats back in 2014. Neil Doshi, an analyst with Mizuho Securities, said he met with Pandora’s management and investor relations teams at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week. Doshi said the potential for Pandora this year is high, but questions remain, especially with Pandora Premium still set to launch. Doshi said company officials mentioned they would be “disappointed” if Pandora added only 1 million Pandora Premium subscribers this year. Doshi believes Pandora Premium will add 1.25 million subscribers, but admitted that “expectations are low” ahead of its launch. “There could be upside, but we need to test the product to see how differentiated it is, and how well the product is resonating with users,” Doshi said. We’ll all have to wait a few more weeks for the latest update on what Pandora is hearing from its listeners. The company’s fourth-quarter results are likely to come out near the end of the month.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: The Dow came within one point of 20,000 for the first time on Friday and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 reached record highs, boosted by Apple, extending a two-month rally fueled by optimism about U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Apple climbed 1.1 percent after Canada's Competition Bureau did not find sufficient evidence the iPhone maker had engaged in anti-competitive conduct, closing a two-year investigation into the company. Wall Street has been on a tear since Trump won the U.S. election in November, with the Dow up 9 percent as investors bet he will stimulate the economy with lower taxes and infrastructure spending. While Friday's gains suggested the rally was not yet over, some investors have grown cautious. "The market's advance is understandable because of the economic stimulus optimism associated with a new Trump presidency," said CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall. "But parabolic market advances traditionally experience digestion of these gains, and I don't think this time will be any different." The record trading session followed a U.S. Labor Department report that showed the economy added fewer-than-expected jobs last month but wages increased, suggesting resilience in the labor market. Stocks did not react significantly to a report that five people were dead in a shooting at Florida's Fort Lauderdale airport. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 64.51 points, or 0.32 percent, to end at 19,963.8 points. The index rose as high as 19,999.63 but lost ground. Goldman Sachs rose 1.48 percent, helping the Dow more than any other stock. The S&P 500 gained 7.98 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,276.98, its highest close ever. The Nasdaq Composite added 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,521.06, also a record. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, led by the technology sector's 0.96 percent gain. For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent while the S&P gained 1.7 percent and the Nasdaq jumped 2.6 percent. INVESTORS EYE EARNINGS The strength of fourth-quarter earnings reports from U.S. companies over the next few weeks will be closely watched by investors eyeing high stock valuations. Following its recent gains, the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, pricey compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Analysts on average expect fourth-quarter earnings to rise 6.1 percent compared to a year before, when slumping oil prices crippled energy companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. During the session, Amgen rose 2.48 percent after a U.S. district judge blocked Sanofi and Regeneron from selling their cholesterol drug, which Amgen said infringed its patents. Regeneron fell 5.84 percent and was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P 500. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.11-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Before the iPhone was released in 2007, Apple tested an interface that was completely different from what we know today. Rather than a home screen filled with icons, the Cupertino company built an operating system, dubbed AcornOS, that looked more like what was available on iPods. Sonny Dickson released a video of AcornOS in action, which shows an on-screen click wheel used to navigate the OS. It’s unclear how seriously Apple considered the software, but thank goodness it was never released. The click wheel was good for its time but it’s not particular elegant on a larger touch screen device, and the menu-oriented UI is a bit of a mess. Something as simple as showing missed calls takes a lot of scrolling, and it’s not particularly nice to look at. There are no icons and the click wheel takes up half of the screen. AcornOS looks more like something that was used internally rather than software that was seriously considered for release. However, Dickson does point to a patent Apple files in 2006 for a “multi-functional handheld device,” which would have included a click wheel. Basically, exactly what we’re seeing in the video above. Was AcornOS really a thing? It’s unclear what device Dickson is using AcornOS on, or how he obtained it, but it shows off a never-before-seen part of Apple’s history. As MacRumors notes, former Apple CEO Steve Jobs put Tony Fadell, who created the iPod, and Macintosh executive, Scott Forstall, in a head-to-head competition to come up with a mobile OS for the iPhone. Obviously, Forstall and his team won, although he is no longer with the company. Check out the video above to see what may have been.

Apple rose 1.3 per cent, helping all three major indexes, after Canada's Competition Bureau said it did not find sufficient evidence iPhone maker had engaged in anti-competitive conduct, closing a two-year investigation into the company. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher in mid afternoon trade in New York on Friday, led by the technology sector's 1.12 per cent gain. Photo: Richard Drew US stocks have risen sharply since Trump won the US election in November and while Friday's additional gains suggested the rally is not yet over, some investors have grown cautious. "The market's advance is understandable because of the economic stimulus optimism associated with a new Trump presidency," said CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall. "But parabolic market advances traditionally experience digestion of these gains, and I don't think this time will be any different." The first record high of the year for the S&P 500 follows a US Labor Department report that showed the economy added fewer-than-expected jobs last month but wages increased, suggesting resilience in the labor market. At 2.14pm ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 94.45 points, or 0.47 per cent, to 19,993.74 points. The index earlier rose to as high as 19,999.63. Advertisement The S&P 500 had gained 12.83 points, or 0.56 per cent, to 2281.83 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 47.16 points, or 0.86 per cent, to 5535.09. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by the technology sector's 1.12 per cent gain. Amgen rose 3 per cent after a US district judge blocked Sanofi and Regeneron from selling their cholesterol drug, which Amgen said infringed its patents. Regeneron was off 5.4 per cent and was the biggest per centage loser on the S&P. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.19-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.05-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 24 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 70 new highs and 12 new lows.  Advertisement HuffPost Australia Man Spends 30 Hours Disputing False ...

Earnings: Mark Your Calendar Can Apple finally return to growth? Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Jan 6, 2017 at 3:31PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will announce the results for its important holiday quarter on Jan. 31, according to an updated schedule on the company's website. Investors will undoubtedly be watching the update closely. Apple's fiscal first quarter of 2017, ending Dec. 31, marked the first full quarter of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus availability. Will the new iPhone help Apple return to revenue growth? Ahead of the earnings release, here's an early look at some of the key metrics worth looking into. iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. Revenue Apple's fiscal 2016 marked a rare year-over-year decline in revenue for the company. Sales during the fiscal year were about $217 billion, down about 8% from Apple's record $234 billion in revenue during fiscal 2015. The company's inability to grow its top line has suppressed the stock's valuation as investors wonder if Apple can grow from here. Apple stock currently has a price-to-earnings ratio of just 14 -- wildly low for an established market leader as dominant as Apple. Still, some investors may be hoping Apple can either turn revenue around during fiscal 2017 -- or at least put a stop to top-line declines. Investor hope for a return to growth is actually encouraged by Apple management; the company guided for fiscal 2017 first-quarter revenue between $76 and $78 billion, representing a slight uptick from Apple's $75.9 billion of revenue in the year-ago quarter. Investors may be hoping Samsung's recall of its Note 7 during the holiday quarter will serve as a catalyst for Apple's September-launched iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. With Samsung's flagship smartphones clearly standing out as the biggest competition to Apple's iPhones -- especially in the U.S. -- the Note 7's recall should have helped drive some incremental iPhone sales during the quarter. And since iPhone accounts for about 60% of Apple's total revenue, a solid quarter for iPhone should make a return to growth more likely. Earnings per share Another key area to watch will be Apple's earnings per share. But investors shouldn't expect the metric to return to growth the way revenue could. Even if revenue turns upward, Apple is expecting a lower gross profit margin in its first quarter than it sported in the year-ago quarter; a lower gross profit margin on only a slight uptick in revenue would likely mean EPS for the quarter will still be lower than in the year-ago quarter. Apple store. Image source: The Motley Fool. Apple said it's expecting a gross profit margin between 38% and 38.5% for its first quarter. In the year-ago quarter, Apple's gross profit margin was 40.1%. Importantly, as investors digest the quarter's results, investors should keep in mind that even if Apple's EPS declines on a year-over-year basis because of a narrower gross profit margin, worsening profitability will likely mostly be attributable to factors unrelated to Apple's regular operations. In the year-ago quarter, Apple's gross profit margin benefited from a $548 million award for patent infringement. Further, Apple's guidance for a 38% to 38.5% first-quarter gross profit margin takes into account expectations for 60 to 70 basis points of currency headwinds. Whatever EPS Apple reports, it would likely be worth investors' time to look for an explanation from management about what factors drove EPS higher or lower (probably lower) during the quarter. For a reference point, the consensus analyst estimates for Apple's revenue and EPS during the quarter are $77.4 billion and $3.22, respectively. This would compare to revenue and EPS of $75.9 billion and $3.28, respectively, in the year-ago quarter. Apple will release its first-quarter financial results after market close on Jan. 31. The results will be available on the tech giant's investor relations website.

Twitter Facebook Microsoft’s OS supremacy over Apple to end in 2017 Gartner forecasts Windows device shipments will falter, then flatten; iOS and macOS will overtake, extend lead in 2018-19 Gregg Keizer (Computerworld (US)) 07 January, 2017 07:07 - - - - print email Comments Apple will steal a march on Microsoft this year when for the first time this century shipments of devices powered by its operating systems outnumber those running Windows, research firm Gartner said today. In 2017, Apple's combination of iOS and macOS -- the former on iPhones and iPads, the latter on Macs -- will take second place from Windows on the devices shipped during the year. The gap between the two will widen in 2018 and 2019, with Apple ahead of Microsoft both years. According to Gartner, which provided Computerworld with its latest device shipment forecast broken out by operating system, in 2016 Windows powered about 260 million devices of the 2.3 billion shipped during the year. Windows accounted for approximately 11.2% of the total devices, which overwhelmingly ran Google's Android. Meanwhile, iOS and macOS -- the latter was formerly dubbed OS X -- sank to 248 million devices in 2016, a 10% drop from the year prior. The cause: Slackened sales of the iPhone, Apple's dominant device and biggest money maker. Gartner predicted that iOS + macOS, unlike Windows, will recover in 2017. Apple's OSes will climb 8% to 268 million this year, add 3% in 2018 to reach 276 million, then increase another 3% in 2019, with that year's device shipment forecast at 285 million. Windows will dip this year, then stagnate for the following two years. Microsoft's operating system will power about 252 million devices shipped in 2017 -- the bulk of them personal computers -- for a year-over-year decline of 3%. Windows will account for 253 million devices in 2018 (for a near-zero growth rate) and 257 million devices in 2019 (an annual growth rate of 1.8%). The gap between Microsoft and Apple -- 12 million last year, with Microsoft atop -- will widen to 27 million by 2019, advantage Apple. Gartner's forecast was another gloomy report on almost every device category, with shipments flat this year compared to last and growth not projected until 2018. "The global devices market is stagnating," said Gartner analyst Ranjit Atwal in a statement Wednesday. Mobile phone shipments are growing only in emerging markets in the Asia and Pacific markets, Atwal added, and noted that, "The PC market is just reaching the bottom of its decline." The PC industry's troubles have affected Microsoft most of all; Windows is almost entirely dependent on PC shipments, which have been stuck in a protracted slump. Future shipments were further hit when Microsoft walked away from the smartphone business last year. Gartner pegged total shipments of PC-like devices at 268 million for 2016, a 7% contraction from the year before, and contrary to an October forecast, now says shipments would again decline in 2017, dropping 0.7% to 266 million. Circumstances will improve only marginally in the two years following, as shipments rise to 272 million in 2018 and 278 million in 2019. The new normal is a sub-300 million market. PCs will not disappear -- something some pundits fretted about as the sales and shipment downturn extended past earlier records -- but the business has been hard hit: In 2012, for instance, more than 350 million PC-like devices shipped globally. Gartner is still betting that a PC replacement cycle will boost shipments, even if only slightly. But this week's forecast -- unlike the one in October -- predicted a delayed growth. In October, Gartner had said the PC business would claw its way back into the black in 2017; this month's prognosis is that growth won't occur until 2018. Most analysts have essentially written off growth in the consumer portion of the PC market; instead, they expect that any gains will come from commercial customers, who still rely on personal computers, as they try to transition from Windows 7 to the newer Windows 10 before Microsoft retires the former in three years. Computerworld (Data: Gartner) Microsoft's decades-long operating system supremacy over Apple will end in 2017, according to Gartner Research, as iOS and macOS power more devices shipped than does Windows.
