Now, instead of releasing an iPad Air 2 successor, the company has scrapped the Air line altogether and has introduced an all new affordable iPad simply called - 'iPad'. Tablet sales are tailing off rapidly. Tablets, which were once envisioned as the next big thing in computing are witnessing a rapid decrease in popularity. Even the mighty iPad is not immune to this development - iPad sales have been decreasing year on year since 2014. Also Read: Apple's iPad Air 2 gets a refresh, iPhone SE gets more storage The 2017 iPad is an attempt by Apple to bolster iPad's flagging sales. Last year's super high-end (and super expensive) iPad Pro models, which were an attempt by Apple to appeal to Pro users, failed to set the market on fire. Now Apple has decided to focus on the other end of the market - users who just want a simple, affordable iPad that works. To understand this new iPad properly, we need to take a trip down memory lane. The 9.7 inch iPad was the first tablet Apple launched and consecutively launched the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th gen of the iPad. Apple then forked the iPad line-up and introduced the Air and Mini series. So where does the new iPad slot in? It is not a sequel to the iPad Air, in spite of the fact that it looks almost exactly like the iPad Air 1. Apple just calls it the iPad, when in fact it is actually a spiritual successor to the iPad 4, which was released back in 2012. The iPad 2017 is an odd mishmash of new hardware and recycled bits from old iPads that does not necessarily come across as an update to last year's iPad Air 2. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Let's talk about the good points first. The 2017 iPad, as with all iPads, claims to have a stellar 10 hour battery life (more details in our upcoming full review), has a nice and crisp Retina display, runs the latest iOS 10 operating system flawlessly and almost never leaves you wanting in terms of performance. In my limited testing, the iPad handled all that I threw at it with aplomb, almost never slowing down even with a multitude of tabs open in Safari and a lot of apps open in the background. A pleasant surprise is the fact that this iPad supports the split-screen multitasking feature introduced with iOS 10. The iPad Air 2 lacked this feature. The iPad 2017 is an odd mishmash of new hardware and recycled bits from old iPads that does not necessarily come across as an update to last year's iPad Air 2. This is not necessarily a bad thing Thus in essence, Apple has succeeded in their aim of creating an affordable iPad that comes with all the essentials. The compromises made can be excused when we take the low $299 dollar price into consideration, which is the cheapest entry point ever for a new full size iPad. Although in India, the 2017 iPad costs Rs 28,999, which is a whopping 150 dollars more than the US price. In India, the new iPad costs exactly the same as the iPad Air 2 did before it was discontinued. In this light, the 2017 iPad seems like a downgrade in some aspects. At this price, the new iPad becomes a hard sell. While it comes with a better processor than the iPad Air 2 ( Apple A9 as compared to A8X), it has a display that lacks some of the fancy tech first seen in the iPad Air 2. It also does not come with stereo speakers and is thicker and heavier. The iPad Air 2 was the first iPad ever to come with a fully laminated display. Instead of the digitiser, LCD and glass being three separate components, Apple bonded them together. Such an arrangement not only makes content look much better, it also reduces reflection by a considerable margin. Also Read: 5 reasons why iPhone SE at Rs 19,999 is totally worth it, 1 reason why it's not The 2017 iPad does not come with a bonded display. This might sound like a small thing, but in reality is quite noticeable. Not only is the display very reflective, the display just does not feel modern. Almost all smartphones these days come with fully laminated display and looking at the 2017 iPad's screen made me realise how much we have gotten used to this arrangement. All in all, the 2017 iPad by itself seems pretty neat. It is undoubtedly the best tablet in this price range and comes with phenomenal battery life, the latest iOS 10 operating system, a powerful processor and the promise of future updates. That's what the ipad has always been...the best tablet you can buy. It's only that iPad Air 2 still casts a long shadow. But let's leave that for the full review.

Apple’s new video campaign does just that, shedding light on some of the basic ways to shoot with an iPhone 7. But there’s something particularly noticeable about some of these videos. Especially for South Africans. Available to view on Apple’s official site and on YouTube, the video series showcases a few landmarks that Cape Town residents would instantly recognise. One is undeniably Table Mountain, looking across from Lion’s Head. Another is of Muizenberg Beach’s famous colourful changing huts. While those two are definitely filmed on South African soil, we had an office debate about the rest. This one is seemingly filmed looking across False Bay from a chasm (possibly the Kogel Bay caves). The others, well… we all threw our postulations in the hat based on house colours, the incline of streets, the colour of poles and various vegetation in the background that we’ve seen in the city before. Table Mountain and Muizenberg Beach’s colourful changing huts are just two instantly recognisable SA landmarks in Apple’s latest iPhone 7 videos Ultimately, we could assume that some are also filmed in South Africa, but we can’t confirm it. Additionally, it seems that some of the iPhone 7 Plus videos are not filmed in SA, with cars using the right-hand side of the streets a dead giveaway. Nevertheless, even if we can’t completely verify a few of these videos’ filming locations, it’s a massive boost for South Africa and Cape Town that Apple felt it worthwhile filming some clips in a how to video series here. We’ve reached out to Apple global and its local distributor to shed more light on the videos, and will update this piece if we hear back. For now though, have a look at the full playlist here, and let us know where you think Apple filmed some of these videos in the comments below.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: These 3 Stocks Just Raised Their Dividends Last week's lifters are among the top names in their respective industries. Eric Volkman (TMFVolkman) May 12, 2017 at 7:27PM Although the current earnings season is winding down, dividend raises continue to rain onto the market. Last week, the market was practically soaked as it saw nearly 30 lifts, by my count.  And at least a few of those raises were from big, high-profile companies. Here are three of the more famous issuers bumping their payouts. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Apple Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been an aggressive dividend raiser since resuming its quarterly payout just over five years ago. The tech giant's latest hike is an 11% bump to $0.63 per share. The company has been fairly generous with its raises. Since the relaunch, and adjusted for a 7-for-1 stock split in 2014, the distribution has risen considerably. Adjusted for that split, it has grown from around $0.38 per share to the present level. Apple also announced an expansion of its share repurchase program, increasing the maximum authorized amount to $210 billion from the previous $175 billion. The two moves reflect how the company has been doing as of late. Encouragingly, it's returned to revenue and profitability growth earlier this year, following three quarters of declines. In its recently reported second quarter, it managed to increase the former by almost 5% on a year-over-year basis to nearly $53 billion. Per-share net profit advanced by 11% to $2.10.   Apple remains extremely profitable, with gross margins approaching 40%. Both cash from operations and free cash flow have seen growth recently, and the latter is more than sufficient to cover dividend payouts and share buybacks. I'd be very optimistic about the future of this dividend. AAPL Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YCharts. Apple's new payout will be dispensed on May 18 to stockholders of record as of May 15. At the most recent closing stock price, it would yield 1.6%. That's a touch lower than the current 1.9% average of dividend-paying stocks on the S&P 500. The company did not provide an end date for its current share repurchase initiative. PepsiCo PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP), one of the top names in the food/beverage industry, is also one of its most aristocratic. That is to say, it's high on the list of Dividend Aristocrats, the group of stocks that have raised their dividends at least once annually for a minimum of 25 years in a row.  In February, along with its Q4 and fiscal 2016 results, the company promised a 7% increase in its quarterly dividend to just under $0.81. Last week, the company made good on that promise by formally declaring the enhanced payout. PEP Dividend data by YCharts. The declaration comes after a first quarter that beat analyst expectations, although it wasn't exactly a quarter for the record books. Revenue inched up less than 2% on a year-over-year basis to land at just over $12 billion. And that increase was due to increased pricing, as opposed to organic growth (volumes were either flat or down in most regions).   On a slightly more encouraging note, per-share adjusted net profit rose by almost 6% to clock in at $0.94. Times are tough for businesses built on a core of sugary drinks (hello, Coca-Cola!) and traditional snacks, since consumers are continuing to opt for healthier alternatives. Pepsi is holding up fairly well considering, although if I were an investor, I'd prefer that the company break its recent habit of spending most, or even more, than its annual free cash flow on dividends and share buybacks. PepsiCo's extra-fizz new distribution is to be paid on June 30 to investors of record as of June 2. It yields a theoretical 2.9%.  Marriott International Storied hotel operator Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) is maintaining its one-raise-per-year habit. The company has declared a quarterly payout of $0.33 per share, a 10% increase over its predecessor. That's to be expected, and not only because the company's a regular lifter. Its most recently reported quarterly results pleased the market, with Marriott convincingly beating expectations on both the top and bottom lines. For the period, revenue rose by a beefy 47% to $5.56 billion, with adjusted net income also experiencing a pleasant boost (of 36%) to $395 million. The latter shook out to $1.01 per share, well exceeding the average $0.91 estimate from analysts. That top-line figure, meanwhile, was comfortably above projections of $5.29 billion.  What went right? Well, Marriott is doing a good job of squeezing more from its visitors. Revenue per available room -- a key metric in the hotel industry -- saw a 3% rise during the quarter, even as the company added roughly 17,000 rooms to its total count. Those improved fundamentals, plus recent strategic asset sales, are keeping cash flow nice and buoyant. Free cash flow has been rising steadily and encouragingly over the past few years, and at the latest annual tally of nearly $1.4 billion, it easily covered the approximately $942 million in dividend payouts and share repurchases. I think this trend will continue, and I expect the company will continue adding to the former. MAR Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts. Marriott's upcoming dividend will be handed out on June 30 to shareholders of record as of May 19. It would yield 1.3% on the current stock price.

Well, the iPhone 7 specifically. So, the company has gone to the trouble of putting together a series of tutorial videos to make sure people can take great mobile shots, while satisfying their inner hipster. There are 16 videos all up, covering everything from selfies to... one-handed selfies. You can check them out either on Apple's own site or its YouTube channel, however the latter only appears to have nine of the clips. How useful are the tutorials? They're all done in portrait format, which suggests Apple itself has no idea how to use its own gadget. Joking aside, it's fairly basic stuff so there's not much here for the experienced hand. However, if you know someone who's terrible at taking decent photos with their iPhone 7, this might be worth a less-than-subtle share on your social media channel of choice.

Volatility’s disappearance goes under the microscope. Time to rejoice or run for cover? Also recommended: Fascinating trend supercharges blue chip stocks. It’s Friday in the Wall Street Daily nation. That means it’s time to embrace the adage that a picture is worth a thousand words. This week, I’ve handpicked two charts to convey Apple’s current — and likely continued — dominance. Then, it’s on to a handful of graphics that underscore the shocking disappearance of market volatility in a time of so much political uncertainty. Is it time for investors to rejoice or run for cover? Let’s find out… Candy Apple Corporate records are meant to be broken. Apparently, Apple wants to break them all. Repeatedly. Consider: 2015: Apple reports the single highest quarterly profit in corporate history of $18 billion 2016: The company tops its own profit record, reporting an $18.4 billion haul. 2017: Apple reveals it has the biggest cash hoard in corporate history, at $256.8 billion. If Apple’s cash pile were its own public company, it would be the 13th largest in the world, right ahead of General Electric. Of course, all along the way, these records have propelled Apple’s stock to record highs. This year alone, Apple’s stock hit 19 new record highs (and counting). As a result, Apple’s market capitalization — you guessed it — hit a record high of $800 billion. As you can see in the following chart, many companies made a valiant effort to reach the same heights and failed. It appears that the company is on a crash course with an unfathomable $1 trillion market capitalization now. Can anything stop it? Chime in using the comments section with your thoughts. Exclusive Content The $100 Trump Retirement Roadmap Trump is set to unleash a $11.1 trillion tsunami in the markets… Now that he's officially taken office, dozens of tiny firms could skyrocket by 100%, 300% and even 721%. This is your chance to turn a small stake of $100… into a life-changing fortune. Click here to find out how. If I were a betting man, though, I wouldn’t bet against Apple. My True Alpha subscribers have been betting on Apple since December 2016. While the stock is up 31% since then, they’re sitting on profits of over 150%. (Click here to find out how, and to start your risk-free trial to our premium advisory today.) And while I’m convinced that Apple’s trend of hitting new highs will continue, here’s one trend I’d bet you dollars to doughnuts doesn’t last… O Volatility, Volatility, Wherefore Art Thou, Volatility? Wall Street’s fear index is currently plumbing near record lows. The CBOE Volatility Index dropped to 9.77 — its lowest since 1993. That’s even more remarkable considering the political volatility we’re witnessing — here and abroad. Historically, political unrest and unpredictability can spook investors. Not this time. Not yet, at least, which brings us to this Reuters observation… A declining VIX typically indicates a bullish outlook for stocks, but the extreme lows the index has touched are sounding caution for some stock investors. Count Citi among them. The firm’s Macro Risk Index recorded its sixth-consecutive monthly decline to hit an extreme low. According to Citi, “Comparable low levels of risk aversion have historically been followed by higher volatility, stronger USD, higher bond prices and weak performance of global equities.” The takeaway: Don’t panic. But don’t be oblivious. Speculators should consider going long the VIX. It’s only a matter of time before volatility returns. As for everyone else? Make sure you have trailing stops in place to protect your profits in the event of any sudden and severe market sell-offs.

Zeman   @phonescooper Apple today said it plans to invest $200 million in its business partner Corning. Corning makes the Gorilla Glass used on iPhones and many other modern smartphones and tablets. Apple said the funds will support Corning's research and development efforts, as well its equipment purchases, and manufacturing facilities. Apple is targeting Corning's facility in Harrodsburg, Ky., which has supplied Apple with glass since the first iPhone in 2007. The Harrodsburg facility employs about 400 people. Earlier this year, Apple committed to spending $1 billion through its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to foster innovation among American manufacturers. Corning is the first recipient of these funds. more info at Apple » Related Review: RhinoShield Playproof and Crashguard RhinoShield has some inexpensive Apple iPhone cases for sale that claim to offer big protection with a minimal footprint.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Reviving Goliath: Liberty Utilities contributes $410,000 to Measure F opposition Friday May 12, 2017 at 5:44 PM May 12, 2017 at 5:44 PM With contributions currently totaling $410,000, Liberty Utilities has far outpaced the campaign raising money in support of Measure F. Should the water company contribute another $74,000 before the June 6 special election, the amount spent lobbying for Measure V last November will be surpassed. Meanwhile, Measure F proponents are attacking a Canadian corporation and pleading their case for 'water freedom.' Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — The campaign against Measure F has spent nearly 93 times more than its opponent leading up to a June 6 special election that will determine whether the Town of Apple Valley can bankroll a potential Liberty Utilities water-system takeover and purchase by incurring a maximum of $150 million in revenue bond debt. EXPENDITURES AND CONTRIBUTIONS Between Jan. 1 and April 22, the No on Measure F/Apple Valley Taxpayers Against Higher Water Fees campaign spent $264,437.90 on its effort to defeat the measure, according to campaign finance documents. As the sole funder of No on Measure F, Liberty Utilities has contributed $410,000 to the campaign as of Friday. The Citizens for Water Freedom group, meanwhile, has spent $2,856.32 in support of the measure, with contributions from Councilman Larry Cusack, Burrtec Waste Industries and Apple Valley Communications — Cusack’s company — totaling $15,000, according to documents. FAMILIAR SCENARIO Liberty poured nearly $484,000 into the Yes on Measure V campaign last year. In contrast, proponents for Measure W raised less than $26,000, documents show. At the time, Measure W supporters likened the funding disparity to a battle of biblical proportions, saying they were “competing with Goliath.” But on Election Day, Measure V garnered more than 67 percent of the vote, a decisive win that set up the Measure F vote. Liberty has contributed nearly $894,000 between the two campaigns, documents show, a figure Citizens for Water Freedom member Rick Piercy called "amazing." "We feel like we need to do everything we can to stand up to what we see as a real problem in that a big corporation in Canada controls our water,” Piercy said. "I just get very upset about the fact that we’re being manipulated by the (California Public Utilities Commission) and the folks out of Canada, and my feeling is they really don’t care. We’re a source of revenue." The reference is to Algonquin Power & Utilities Corporation. As a subsidiary of Algonquin, Liberty purchased Apple Valley Ranchos Water Company — as well as systems in greater Los Angeles and Missoula, Montana — from the Carlyle Group in early 2016 for $327 million. But Diana Carloni-O’Malley, of the No on Measure F campaign, said "the history of this takeover has been to demonize Liberty Utilities." "I do not fault any person or entity to fight for their business," Carloni-O’Malley said of the money the company has spent thus far. "If the town wanted to take Napa Auto Parts, I believe (Mayor) Scott Nassif would fight for his business in the same way." WHAT THE MONEY BUYS The more than $264,000 Liberty has put toward that fight has bought the campaign significant exposure, including more than $132,000 in “TV or cable airtime and production costs,” documents show. It also funded economist John Husing’s recent analysis of the town’s takeover attempt; Economics and Politics, Inc. — Husing’s research firm — received $50,000, an amount Liberty officials say is standard for such services. But nearly $39,000 in "campaign literature and mailings" has been the campaign's driving force, according to Carloni-O’Malley. "I don’t know how much people understand about this issue," she said, "so the strength we’ve had is getting mailers out to people. We’ve sent multiple mailers that fact check and correct the town." As for Citizens for Water Freedom, contributions have afforded the group $2,251.32 in "campaign paraphernalia," namely 50 signs erected throughout the town. Piercy said "getting boots on the ground" is how Measure F supporters are combating an aggressive opposition. "We’re talking to groups. We need to spend a lot of time getting the truth out, talking to friends and letting people know what’s really going on here," Piercy said. "This all makes Goliath a whole lot bigger than David, but we’ve got five smooth stones and our sling, so we’ll try our best." Last week, the campaign came under fire from Citizens for Government Accountability — a group against the takeover — after town resident Pat Hanson filed a complaint with the state’s Fair Political Practices Commission alleging failure "to disclose properly who the signs were from," a post on CFGA's website shows. “The committee failed to include a disclosure statement of at least 5 percent of the height of the advertisement,” Hanson wrote in her complaint, also available on CFGA’s website. In response, Piercy said Hanson was correct, adding that “the guy who printed our signs thought (the regulation) was 0.5 percent, not 5 percent” of the signs’ height. "You make an error and you correct the error. That’s what we did,” he said. “We spent about $400 putting stickers on the signs with the correct size of the committee name. That could have been used for something else, but if you have integrity you fix what is messed up." The Citizens for Water Freedom campaign now awaits word from the commission’s Enforcement Division on possible fines. WHAT’S AT STAKE Passage of Measure F would authorize the town to finance a purchase of Liberty’s water system by issuing debt in the maximum amount of $150 million, according to the measure’s impartial analysis. Pursuant to resolutions adopted by the Town Council on March 9, the interest rate on debt repayment cannot exceed 12 percent. Measure F opponents have argued the town won’t have funds for improvements to the system’s aging infrastructure, let alone money for debt service. Assistant Town Manager Marc Puckett has said he expects the price of the system to be far less than Measure F’s asking amount, adding that the interest rate will be closer to 5 percent. By Puckett’s estimation, nearly $12 million will be available to fund debt service and lower water rates via the elimination of profits, taxes and other expenses associated with Liberty’s ownership. Opponents have also criticized the town for holding a special election — which comes with an estimated $220,000 price tag paid for by the town — before a right-to-take trial has been set. But officials believe potential passage of Measure F is similar to “prequalifying before you shop for a house,” according to town spokesperson Kathie Martin. “We need to know we have the approval of the citizens before we spend the money and see the takeover action to its conclusion,” Martin said. A trial-setting hearing for the the right-to-take trial is scheduled for June 26, court documents show. Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254.

Now we’ve taken a tour of Brookfield’s Apple based connected home at Delano at Eastwood Village in Irvine and were able to meet up with Brookfield’s COO, Adrian Foley. Keep reading after the break for a look inside and to learn more about this forward thinking homebuilder. AirPods Late last year KB Home announced optional smart-home upgrade packages for homebuyers and pre-fabricated homebuilder WeberHaus recently began offering a HomeKit package as well. However, Brookfield Residential is offering the first homes to include a HomeKit package standard. Brookfield has plans to bring its connected home integration to seven developments across San Diego, Orange, and Los Angeles counties. The first development to feature the standard HomeKit package is Delano at Eastwood Village in Irvine. The luxury townhomes with pre-installed HomeKit products will give ‘turn-key’ a new meaning with homeowners having access to their door lock, lighting, thermostat, and more, all from Apple’s Home app on iPhone and iPad and with Siri and Apple Watch. The particular HomeKit products (and wireless router) being installed standard include: Lutron Caseta lighting (in select areas of the home) Honeywell Lyric T6 Smart Wi-Fi Thermostat Schlage Sense Smart Deadbolt (Bluetooth and HomeKit-enabled front door lock) Ubiquiti Wireless Access Point (WAP – providing peak Wi-Fi performance throughout the home) Homebuyers also have the option to upgrade the included standard HomeKit accessories with Lutron’s Triathlon smart blinds, and Brookfield may offer Ring Video Doorbells as an option in the future. Video walkthrough Brookfield Residential has taken a thoughtful approach in bringing its connected home to fruition. The company utilized beta testing with its team members and current homeowners to gain feedback on both their experiences as well as product quality and reliability. Schlage’s Sense Smart Deadbolt will please both the tech savvy and those new to home automation with HomeKit, Bluetooth, touch keypad, and also traditional key functionality. The choice to use Lutron’s switch-based Caseta products provides a smooth and friendly user experience as it eliminates the potential frustration with accidentally turning off wall switches and losing your connection with Philips Hue setups (although at the expense of Hue’s features like colored bulbs and support for services like IFTTT). Another smart move on Brookfield’s part is offering homeowners tech support. Alongside bringing its connected HomeKit homes to market, it has created a tech support portion within its customer care department. Brookfield Residential has a unique approach with self-led tours (after stopping in at the sales office) for those interested in checking out its Delano connected home. HomeKit is fully functioning in the model home with an invitation to give it a try by the front door using a mounted iPad with Apple’s Home app. Each of the HomeKit products are labeled throughout the townhome (pictured below) so anyone touring it will understand the value of the different accessories and how they work. The TV in the open living space draws attention to the connected home features The Ubiquiti WAP is installed in the ceiling of the second floor for optimal coverage Mr. Foley shared that Brookfield chose Apple’s HomeKit with security and privacy at the core of the platform decision. The company likes Apple’s deliberate process for determining approval for HomeKit products, and ultimately believes HomeKit will have the most security, privacy, and highest quality products in the smart home market. Foley added that Brookfield sees the standard HomeKit package as a basic starting point and the company is looking to gather feedback from homeowners and implement new products and technology moving forward. While HomeKit and home automation in general hasn’t yet been widely adopted, I think Brookfield’s approach may start to move the needle in three ways. First, the company’s implementation introduces less tech savvy folks to the capabilities and value of HomeKit with a support system to help along the way. For savvy customers Brookfield is offering a great jumping off point to build a more robust home automation setup. It will be easier to invest in the ecosystem when baked into a house’s purchase price; buyers shouldn’t even notice an increased cost versus a comparable new house without HomeKit. Second, with HomeKit planned for seven new Brookfield home developments in California, I think it’s likely that other developers are going to take note and follow suit (when building/buying a new home, you already have the cost of a standard lock, thermostat, lights, etc. and is the best time for both builders and buyers to install smart home products). Third, as homeowners and homebuilders are implementing HomeKit products more often, we’ll see third-parties more regularly releasing products and updates to provide growing features and capabilities that will provide more value in having a connected home. Mr. Foley believes that the difference between a new home with home automation pre-installed and a used home with no automation will continue to grow to the point that home automation will become an expected feature in homes. With a solid base HomeKit package as a standard feature and a strong vision for the future, there’s no doubt that Brookfield Residential is on the leading edge of home automation and we’re eager to see the company’s vision evolve over time.

PUBLIC LIBRARY Apple wants to transform historic Carnegie Library 1 / 1 Back to Gallery WASHINGTON — Steve Jobs made Apple into a top American retailer by designing crisp, modern stores with features reminiscent of the company’s products. Glass boxes and aluminum panels abounded. But as Apple moves to turn its stores into experiences — places for concerts, art exhibitions and photography classes — the tech giant has begun to pursue distinctive yet familiar buildings that its customers might admire as well. In Washington, Apple has set its sights squarely on the Carnegie Library in Mount Vernon Square. One of thousands of libraries built nationwide with funds donated by steel tycoon and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, it opened in 1903 as the first desegregated public building in the city. Latest business videos Apple officials say they plan to restore the building to its original grandeur and outfit Carnegie as a place to hold free concerts, art exhibitions, workshops for teachers and coding classes for children. Trial programs at other Apple Stores have included presentations from community artists and photographers, as well as concerts and talks by bigger names — the hip-hop producer RZA led an “Art of Beatmaking” session at the Apple Store in Brooklyn last fall. The company plans to release a schedule of events around the country this month. The ultimate goal, of course, is to sell more iPhones and iPads. Where the Carnegie Library once housed the city’s book collection, Apple plans a Genius Grove, a tree-lined sales floor where associates will show customers how to make the best use of Apple products for music, photography or other passions. The Cupertino company already operates a Genius Grove in its flagship San Francisco Apple Store on Union Square. “This is a way of creating a reason to come to the store, to touch and feel our products, but also to have an engaging experience with someone who is passionate about the same thing,” said B.J. Siegel, the senior design director for Apple’s retail division. Finding historic buildings with stories rooted in their communities are part and parcel to the experience Apple is trying to create, Siegel said. The company has opened stores in a former restaurant bay in New York’s Grand Central Terminal, in a Depression-era brick storefront in Brooklyn, and in a 130-year-old former bank in Paris. Rather than plastering the buildings with the familiar logo, Apple’s designers say they will focus on restoring the building’s historic character. It can take a little work to find the store’s signs and logo — which is the point. “For us, it wasn’t about coming in and leaving our mark,” Siegel said. “It was about bringing the history back out and respecting it. “We’ve discovered that big, garish logos on historic buildings don’t work very well, so often we try to find more subtle ways to brand the building.” That couldn’t be further from the failed strategy of the previous pursuit of the Carnegie Building. The International Spy Museum proposed moving into the building more than three years ago, but it sought to double the size of the 63,000-square-foot structure by adding two expansive, glass-encased wings. The Historic Preservation Review Board turned the proposal away. Apple does plan to install a skylight in the Carnegie Building’s roof above a central events area, and there are bound to be questions about handing one of the city’s more cherished buildings to a corporation. But there is wide agreement among officials that the Carnegie Building could be better used. Despite its visible location, it serves mainly as an office space for the Historical Society of Washington, D.C., and as a venue for the occasional wedding or reception organized by Events DC, which manages the building. When Apple signed a letter of intent in December to lease the building, Mayor Muriel Bowser issued a statement saying that an Apple Store there “could link D.C.’s rich history to our continued economic renaissance, will demonstrate the strength of our retail market, and will tell companies across the globe that the District is open for business.” Even the Historical Society isn’t going anywhere; Siegel said that Apple considers it a benefit to have such a unique community institution as a neighbor, and that the organization would maintain offices on the second floor. Gregory O’Dell, president and chief executive of Events DC, said he is “working to support Apple with its plans as well as our partners in the Historical Society.” Apple is scheduled to present its plans to the area’s Advisory Neighborhood Commission on Monday evening. In New York, Apple picked up a historic preservation award for its work restoring the sort of buildings that, in Jobs’ era, it would not have considered. Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president for retail, considers it essential to the company’s future that it be more than a place to buy things. “Starbucks figured it out, for being a gathering place, right? ‘Meet me at Starbucks,’” Ahrendts told CBS in a recent interview. “I’ve told my teams, I’ll know we’ve done a great job if the next generation ... says, ‘Meet me at Apple.’” Jonathan O’Connell is a Washington Post writer.

Get a cup of coffee. This article is a big geeky at points by virtue of using a lot of acronyms. But be patient! It contains important information about the restructuring of the US workforce. By William Lazonick, professor of economics at University of Massachusetts Lowell. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website How the U.S. New Economy Business Model has devalued science & engineering PhDs This note comments on Eric Weinstein’s, “How and Why Government, Universities, and Industries Create Domestic Labor Shortages of Scientists and High-Tech Workers,” posted recently on INET’s website. At the outset of his paper, Weinstein argues that: Long term labor shortages do not happen naturally in market economies. That is not to say that they don’t exist. They are created when employers or government agencies tamper with the natural functioning of the wage mechanism. The contention, written from the perspective of the late 1990s, is that in the first half of the 1990s an oversupply (“a glut”) of science and engineering (S&E) labor that depressed the wages of PhD scientists and engineers was primarily the result of the promotion of a government-university-industry (GUI) agenda, coordinated by the National Science Foundation under the leadership of Erich Bloch, head of the NSF from 1984 to 1990. Beginning in 1985, the NSF predicted a shortfall of 675,000 S&E personnel in the U.S. economy over the next two decades. According to a study by the NSF’s Policy Research and Analysis (PRA) division, quoted by Weinstein, salary data show that real PhD-level pay began to rise after 1982, moving from $52,000 to $64,000 in 1987 (measured in 1984 dollars). One set of salary projections show that real pay will reach $75,000 in 1996 and approach $100,000 shortly beyond the year 2000. Weinstein argues that the GUI agenda (inspired by Reaganomics) sought to prevent these salary increases. He contends that the legislation that enabled this oversupply was the Immigration Act of 1990 that expanded the H-1B nonimmigrant visa program and instituted employment-based immigration preferences. Given that most of these foreigners came from lower-wage (Asian) nations, it is assumed that they were attracted to work in the United States by what for them were high wages, whereas Americans with S&E PhDs began to shun S&E careers as the salaries became less attractive.1 There is a lot missing from Weinstein’s perspective, which is also the perspective of demographer Michael Teitelbaum, who Weinstein cites extensively and who was at the Sloan Foundation from 1983 to 2013, rising to Vice-President in 2006. Weinstein and Teitelbaum view the salaries of scientists and engineers as being determined by supply and demand on the labor market (“the natural wage rate” and “the natural functioning of the labor market”). From this (neoclassical) perspective, they completely ignore the “marketization” of employment relations for S&E workers that occurred in the U.S. business sector from the mid-1980s as well as the concomitant “financialization” of the U.S. business corporation that remains, in my view, the most damaging economic problem facing the United States. This transformation of employment relations put out of work large numbers of PhD scientists and engineers who previously had secure employment and who enjoyed high incomes and benefits as well as creative corporate careers. The marketization of employment relations brought to an end of the norm of a career with  one  company  (CWOC)—an  employment norm  that was  pervasive  in  U.S.  business corporations from the 1950s to the 1980s, but that has since disappeared. 2 The “financialization” of the corporation, manifested by massive distributions to shareholders in the forms of cash dividends and stock buybacks, undermined the opportunities for business-sector S&E careers. The major cause of marketization was the rise of the “New Economy business model” (NEBM) in which high-tech startups, primarily in information-and-communication technology (ICT) and biotechnology, lured S&E personnel away from established companies, which offered CWOC under the “Old Economy business model” (OEBM). As startups with uncertain futures, the New Economy companies could not realistically offer CWOC, but instead enticed S&E personnel away from CWOC at Old Economy companies by offering these employees stock options on top of their salaries (which were typically lower than those at the Old Economy companies). The stock options could become extremely valuable if and when the startup did an initial public offering (IPO) or a merger-and-acquisition (M&A) deal with an established  publicly-listed company. The rise in S&E PhD salaries from 1982 to 1987, identified in the NSF study that Weinstein quotes, was the result of increased demand for S&E personnel by New Economy companies, with some of the increase taking the form of stock-based pay, which in the Census data drawn from tax returns is lumped in with salaries.3 Competing with companies for S&E personnel, the rise of the NEBM in turn put pressure on salaries at Old Economy companies as they tried to use CWOC to attract and retain S&E labor in the face of the stock-based alternative. By the last half of the 1980s, this New Economy competition for talent was eroding the learning capabilities of the corporate research labs that, in many cases from the early twentieth century, had been a characteristic feature of Old Economy companies in a wide range of knowledge-intensive industries. 4 The CWOC norm under OEBM had provided employment security and rising wages from years-of-service with the company and internal promotion of S&E personnel (significant proportions of whom in science- based companies had PhDs). As I show in my book Sustainable Prosperity in the New Economy?, the beginning of the end of CWOC was the transformation of IBM, the world’s leading computer company, from OEBM to NEBM from 1990 to 1994. In 1990, with 374,000 employees, IBM still bragged about its adherence to the CWOC norm (calling it “lifelong employment”), claiming that the company had not laid off anyone involuntarily since 1921. By 1994 IBM had 220,000 employees, and, with senior executives under CEO Louis Gerstner themselves getting fired for not laying off employees fast enough, CWOC was history. Over the course of the 1990s and into the 2000s, other major Old Economy companies followed IBM’s example, throwing out of work older employees, many of them highly educated and with accumulated experience that had previously been highly valued by the companies. Already in the early 1990s, the marketization of employment relations was responsible for a precipitous decline of employment at the corporate research labs that had underpinned the twentieth-century growth of Old Economy high-tech companies, of which IBM was an exemplar. In 1993, a conference held at Harvard Business School decried the “end of an era” in industrial research, with papers from the conference appearing in a volume Engines of Innovation, published in 1996.5 In the introductory chapter, entitled “Technology’s Vanishing Wellspring,” conference organizers and volume editors Richard Rosenbloom and William Spencer argued that industrial research (as distinct from product development) of the type that had been carried out by corporate labs in the “golden era” of the post- World War II decades “expands the base of knowledge on which existing industries depend and generates new knowledge that leads to new technologies and the birth of new industries.” In the more competitive environment of the 1980s and 1990s, however, in the new industries of “biotechnology, exotic materials, and information products (and services based on them)”, Rosenbloom and Spencer observed that it was more difficult for companies “to keep new technologies fully proprietary”, and hence “research activities have been downsized, redirected, and restructured in recent years within most of the firms that once were among the largest sponsors of industrial research.” 6 There is little doubt that S&E PhDs were major victims of this transformation. But the problem that they, along with most other members of the U.S. labor force, have faced is not simply the marketization of employment relations. For reasons that I have fully described in my publications cited above, the transition from OEBM to NEBM was accompanied by the “financialization” of the U.S. business corporation as, from the last half of the 1980s, U.S. boardrooms and business schools embraced the ideology that, for the sake of superior economic performance, a business enterprise should be run to “maximize shareholder value” (MSV). Instead of retaining employees and reinvesting in their productive capabilities, as had been the case when CWOC had prevailed, MSV advocated and legitimized the downsizing of the company’s labor force and the distribution of corporate revenues to shareholders in the forms of both cash dividends and stock repurchases. 7 With the demise of CWOC, older employees were the most vulnerable, not only because they tended to have the highest salaries, but also because the shift from OEBM to NEBM was a shift from proprietary technology systems, in which employees with long years of experience were highly valued, to open technology systems that favored younger workers with the latest computer-related skills (often acquired by working at other companies). Under CWOC, older employees were more expensive not because of a “natural wage rate” that was the result of supply and demand on the S&E labor market, but because of the internal job ladders that are integral to a “retain-and-reinvest” resource-allocation regime. The salaries of S&E employees tended to increase with years of experience with the company, with a defined-benefit pension (based on years of service and highest salary levels) in retirement. These types of secure employment relations, and the high and rising pay levels associated with them, were the norm among established high-tech companies in the mid-1980s, but, as exemplified by IBM’s transformation, started to become undone in the early 1990s, and were virtually extinct a decade later, as Old Economy companies either made the transition to the NEBM, or disappeared.8 The culprit in the weakening in the demand for, and earnings of, S&E PhDs from the early 1990s was the demise of CWOC—a phenomenon that Weinstein (and Teitelbaum) entirely ignore. With the rise of NEBM, companies wanted employees who were younger and cheaper, and that was the major reason why at the end of the 1980s the ICT industry pushed for an expansion of H-1B nonimmigrant visas and employment-based immigration visas. It is not at all clear that an influx of PhDs from foreign countries via these programs was undermining the earnings of S&E PhDs in the early 1990s. Most H-1B visa holders had Bachelor’s degrees when they entered the United States. At the same time, large numbers of non-immigrant visa holders entered the United States on student visas to do Master’s and PhD degrees, and then looked to employment on H-1B visas to enable them to stay in the United States for extended periods (up to seven years).9 It was in response to the availability of advanced- degree graduates of U.S. universities that in 2005 an additional 20,000 H-1B visas were added to the normal cap of 65,000. Without the influx of foreign students into U.S. S&E Master’s and PhD programs, many of these programs would not have survived. Through this route, the H-1B visa program has made more foreign-born PhDs available to corporations for employment in the United States. But I posit that it has been the demise of OEBM and rise of the NEBM, not an increased supply of foreign-born PhDs, that has placed downward pressure on the career earnings of the most highly educated members of the U.S. labor force. Besides giving employers access to an expanded supply of younger and cheaper high-tech labor in the United States, the H-1B visa along with the L-1 visa for people who had previously worked for the employer for at least one year outside the United States have another valuable attribute for employers: the person on the visa is immobile on the labor market—he or she can’t change jobs—whereas under NEBM the most valued high-tech workers are those who are highly mobile. This mobility of labor can boost the worker’s pay package but is highly problematic for a company that needs these employees to be engaged in the collective and cumulative learning processes that are the essence of generating competitive products. Under OEBM, CWOC was the central employment institution for college-educated workers precisely because of the need for collective and cumulative learning. But it was the rise of NEBM, not the Immigration Act of 1990, that undermined CWOC. The growing dominance of NEBM with its open systems architectures then led employers to make increased use of H-1 and L-1 visas in the 1980s, prompting them to get behind an expanded cap for H-1B visas in the Immigration Act of 1990. 10 Once OEBM was attacked by NEBM, with its offer of stock-based pay, these corporations became fertile territory for the adoption of the ideology that a company should be run to “maximize shareholder value” (MSV). This momentous transformation in U.S. corporate governance occurred from the late 1980s, legitimizing the transition from a “retain-and-reinvest” to a “downsize-and-distribute” corporate- governance regime. In the 1990s and beyond, this corporate-governance transformation laid waste to CWOC across corporate America, knowledge-intensive companies included. 11 With corporate research eroding as high-tech personnel responded to the lure of stock-based pay from NEBM companies— including not only startups but also those such as Intel, Microsoft, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, and Cisco Systems that during the 1990s grew to employ tens of thousands of people, most of them with stock- based pay—senior executives at the Old Economy high-tech companies began to see their company’s stock price as not only key to the size of their own stock-based pay packages but also as an instrument to compete for a broad-based of high-tech personnel. As exemplified by IBM in the 1990s and beyond, a company’s stock price could be raised by laying off expensive older workers and using the resultant “free” cash flow (as the purveyors of MSV called it) to do stock buybacks. 12 As I have documented in detail, over the past three decades this legalized looting of the U.S. business corporation has only gotten worse. As shown Table 1, driven by stock buybacks, net equity issues by U.S. nonfinancial corporations were, in 2015 dollars, minus $4.5 trillion over the decade 2006-2015. In 2016 net equity issues were minus $586 billion. Net equity issues are new stock issues by companies (in this case nonfinancial corporations) minus stock retired from the market as the result of stock repurchases and M&A deals. The massively negative numbers in recent decades are the result of stock buybacks. I have calculated net equity issues as a percent of GDP by decade to provide a measure of the value of buybacks done relative to the size of the U.S. economy. In both absolute inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percent of GDP, buybacks have become a prime mode of corporate resource allocation in the U.S. economy. Contrary to popular belief, in aggregate U.S. corporations fund the stock market, not vice versa. Note that almost all of the buybacks in the decade 1976-1985 occurred in 1984 and 1985 after in November 1982 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted Rule 10b-18 that gave license to massive buybacks, in essence legalizing systemic stock-price manipulation and the looting of the U.S. business corporation. Table 1: Net equity issues of nonfinancial corporations in the United States, 1946-2015, by decade, in 2015 dollars, and as a percent of GDP Decade Net Equity Issues, 2015$ billions Net Equity Issues as % of GDP 1946-1955 143.2 0.56 1956-1965 110.9 0.30 1966-1975 316.0 0.58 1976-1985 -290.9 -0.40 1986-1995 -1,002.5 -1.00 1996-2005 -1,524.4 -1.09 2006-2015 -4,466.6 -2.65 Source: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Statistical Release Z.1, “Financial Accounts of the United States: Flow of Funds, Balance Sheets, and Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts,” Table F-223: Corporate Equities, March 9, 2017, at    https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/current/. Over the years 2006-2015, the 459 companies in the S&P 500 Index in January 2016 that were publicly listed over the ten-year period expended $3.9 trillion on stock buybacks, representing 53.6 percent of net income, plus another 36.7 percent of net income on dividends. Much of the remaining 9.7 percent of profits was held abroad, sheltered from U.S. taxes. Mean buybacks for these 459 companies ranged from $291 million in 2009, when the stock markets had collapsed, to $1,205 million in 2007, when the stock market peaked before the Great Financial Crisis. In 2015, with the stock market booming, mean buybacks for these companies were $1,173 million. Meanwhile, dividends declined moderately in 2009, but over the period 2006-2015 they trended up in real terms. Among the largest repurchasers are America’s premier high-tech companies. Table 2 shows the top 25 repurchasers over the decade 2006-2015. Among the companies that one would expect to employ large numbers of S&E PhDs are Exxon Mobil, Microsoft, IBM, Apple, Cisco Systems, Hewlett Packard, Pfizer, Oracle, Intel, General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips. We do not know the historical numbers of S&E PhDs at these companies, but I hypothesize that numbers would be much higher than they are if the companies were not financialized. Many of America’s largest corporations routinely distribute more than 100 percent of net income to shareholders, generating the extra cash by reducing cash reserves, selling off assets, taking on debt, or laying off employees.13 As I have shown, the only logical explanation for this buyback activity is that the stock-based pay that represents the vast majority of the remuneration of senior corporate executives incentivizes them to manipulate their companies’ stock prices, leaving most Americans worse off. 14 Table 2: The 25 largest stock repurchasers among U.S.-based corporations, 2006-2015, showing net income (NI) stock buybacks (BB), and cash dividends (DV) Source: Calculated from data downloaded from Standard & Poor’s Compustat database. The Weinstein-Teitelbaum focus on a GUI design to expand the supply of S&E PhDs ignores the transformations of corporate governance and employment relations that have decimated career employment for this group of workers over the past three decades. At the same time, the channeling of trillions of dollars of value created in U.S. nonfinancial corporations to the financial sector has opened up jobs on Wall Street that can provide quick income bonanzas for highly-educated members of the U.S. labor force, many of whom might have otherwise pursued S&E careers. Among the wealthiest of these Wall Street players are corporate predators—euphemistically known as “hedge-fund activists”—who have billions of dollars in assets under management with which they can attack companies to pump up their stock prices through the implementation of “downsize-and-distribute” allocation regimes and, even if it takes a few years, dump the stock for huge gains.15 In the case of Apple, we have shown how Carl Icahn used his wealth, visibility, hype, and influence to take $2 billion in stock-market gains by buying $3.6 billion of Apple shares in the summer of 2013 and selling them in the winter of 2016, even though he contributed absolutely nothing of any kind to Apple as a value-creating company.16 Apple CEO Tim Cook and his board (which includes former U.S. Vice President Al Gore) helped Icahn turn his accumulated fortune into an even bigger one by having Apple repurchase $45 billion in shares in 2014 and $36 billion in 2015—by far the two largest one-year stock buybacks of any company in history. Imagine the corporate research capabilities in which Apple could have invested, and the S&E PhDs the company could have employed, had it looked for productive ways to use even a fraction of the almost unimaginable sums that it wasted on buybacks.17 From 2011 through the first quarter of 2017, Apple spent $144 billion on buybacks and $51 billion on dividends under what it calls its “Capital Return” program. But the company is “returning” capital to shareholders who never gave the company anything in the first place; the only time in its history that Apple has ever raised funds on the public stock market was $97 million in its 1980 IPO. 18 A number of “hedge-fund activists”—Nelson Peltz of Trian, Daniel Loeb of Third Point, and William Ackman of Pershing Square are among the most prominent—have been able to put up one or two billion dollars to purchase small stakes in major high-tech companies, and, with the proxy votes of pension funds, mutual funds and endowments, have been able put pressure on companies, often by placing their representatives on the boards of directors, to implement “downsize-and-distribute” regimes for the sake of “maximizing shareholder value.”19 In the summer of 2013, Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management bought DuPont stock worth $1.3 billion, representing 2.2% of shares outstanding. In May 2015 Peltz lost a proxy fight to put four of his nominees on the DuPont board, but in October 2015 DuPont CEO Ellen Kullman, who had opposed Peltz, resigned, and the new management began to implement Peltz’s plans to cut costs and hit financial targets, to be done in the context of a merger with Dow Chemical, which had fallen into the hands of another corporate predator Daniel Loeb. Meanwhile, in October 2015, Peltz bought 0.8 percent of the shares of General Electric (GE), and began to pressure another iconic high-tech company to cut costs and increase its stock price. GE was already a financialized company that had done $52 billion in buybacks in the decade 2006-2015 (see Table 2)—a massive amount of money for the purpose of manipulating its stock price. Undoubtedly responding to additional pressure from Peltz, during 2016, GE, with profits of $8.0 billion, paid out $8.5 billion in dividends and spent another $22.0 billion on buybacks. This financialization of U.S. high-tech corporations undermines, among other things, the employment of S&E PhDs. We need research on this subject to quantify its impacts. I submit, however, that such a research agenda must focus on transformations of regimes of corporate governance and employment relations. Relying on the neoclassical economist’s notion of a “natural wage rate” determined by the interaction of supply and demand, Weinstein, a mathematician, and Teitelbaum, a demographer, missed the transformations in corporate governance and employment relations that marked the late 1980s and early 1990s—and beyond—and as result, in my view, failed to understand the changing fortunes of S&E PhDs in the marketized, globalized, and financialized New Economy. Given the dominance of what I have called “the myth of the market economy”20 in the thought processes of economists, Weinstein and Teitelbaum were by no means alone in erroneously focusing on supply and demand on the PhD labor market while failing to recognize the centrality of corporate governance and employment relations in determining the earnings and career prospects of S&E PhDs. It is time for new economic thinking on these critical questions.

Reply ↓ David McClain May 12, 2017 at 10:10 am As one who actually lived this process, I can tell you that the premise of this article must be basically true. Back in the early ’90s I set out to fill in the gaps of my own computer science background (I’m actually an astrophysicist). And my classes were filled entirely by people from Asia, except for myself and one other Anglo. Job ads in the journals were already beginning to ask for PhD level CompSci with emphasis on, e.g., voice recognition, for a pay rate of $26K (1992 !). That was definitely appealing to the foreign students and unappealing to American STEM students. During that period, the only job market for native PhD STEM students became the American Defense and Intelligence agencies, because they required security clearances and US Citizenship. I found myself driven in those directions too. Now, after many years doing my own thing, I look around at the STEM marketplace and I am shocked to find large numbers of compatriots being pressured into the GIG Economy, and pay rates are appalling by former standards.

From another perspective this is just over investment in education. Technology for the most part is just increasing complexity and increasing complexity has diminishing returns. With energy becoming less available, we probably need a lot less complexity. Reply ↓ anonymous in Southfield May 12, 2017 at 6:15 pm I was reading the article earlier at work and thought I would finish reading the comments With energy becoming less available, we probably need a lot less complexity. Relevant in many ways. Take intensive horticultural methods which could increase yields on agricultural products. Organic gardening (a garden is anything smaller than a field (about 40 acres)) can yield up tremendous amounts per square yard because the soil is tilled intensively and carefully. The organic content of the soil in commercial farming districts is very low as the methods used (particularly intensive nitrogen implants) destroy the Soil microorganisms thereby lessening the amount of nutrients available to vegetative methods in the roots. So by taking the technology level down (small equipment and lots of loving labor, lots of mulching a careful cohabitation of plants) the yields per acre can be in fact astronomical with organic methods.

Reply ↓ Altandmain May 12, 2017 at 10:21 am Basically the rich are waging class war. That’s the problem no matter how you slice and dice this one. This whole “New Economy” has been one big war on wages. I mean look at the collusion too between Google, Apple, and Intel to keep wages low. https://www.wired.com/2015/01/apple-google-tech-giants-reach-415m-settlement-poaching-suit/ Considering how slap on the wrist this was, what incentive is there to not do it again? They know they can get away with this. Not to mention, this H1B and L1B program has become a way to keep wages low in the technology sector. In many sectors, there really isn’t a “shortage” of Americans. Oh and for all the talk of these companies being “innovative”, if they are prioritizing money on stock buybacks over R&D, that’s not really innovative as much as it is trying to boost salaries by capitalizing on the huge cash reserves they get for being the dominant companies in their sector. Same could be said about Exxon. Not much being spent on R&D means that they are more about rent seeking rather than innovation. Perhaps not yet as blatant as those patent trolls, which are little more than shell companies that sue other companies over patents, but that is their ideal business model. I think that at the end of the day, even though many engineers in the tech companies are in the top 10% in terms of income percentile, their interests are closer aligned with working class people. The other issue is that I bet when many of these engineers turn into their 40s, they are going to witness first hand the very real age discrimination that exists in the technology industry. Basically it comes down to, the rich are really greedy. The issue right now for the rich is that they are desperate to keep the looting from happening, while people are increasingly aware that the system is against them. Bernie Sanders got a lot of support in the Valley and while it is a very Democratic leaning area, I cannot imagine that Trump’s anti-H1B and L1B stance would have been opposed by the average employee. I think that the rich are not going to concede anything and that there needs to be some sort of solidarity union amongst all workers.

Early on, the use of stock-based compensation drove down wage-based compensation and increased the role of financial speculators. Today, the speculators get the stock, but wages remain suppressed and only foreign workers will accept them. The author is correct: the causes are complicated, but the result drove down wages and job security for STEM workers. Reply ↓ mary May 12, 2017 at 11:30 am I got my Ph.D. in biology in 2000.

Reply ↓ cr May 12, 2017 at 12:01 pm Post WWII labor overplayed its hand by the 1970’s. Corporations and their decided they had had it. Corps and management proceeded to change the rules of the game on everything–courts, trade, taxation and regulation. These countermeasures have had disastrous long term consequences. Corporations now run the country in a fascist manner. Government capture has created myriad problems beyond financialization, only one tool in the corporate quiver. Oligopolies across most to all industries comes to mind. Rail, air, health insurance, banking, defense, telecom, entertainment…. But this paper is also lamenting a lack of business capex, which is directly correlated to public investment. When you decided to offshore manufacturing and fail to invest in infrastructure you get a double whammy that hits business capex. Increasing regulation and taxation on small and midsize companies has lead to consolidation. Approximately 5000 public companies have likely been consolidated. Sarbanes-Oxley added millions to compliance costs making it highly uneconomical to be a public company with less than $300 million in revenue. Dodd-Frank has created increases in cost for financial firms that had nothing to do with the crisis. In fact, the big banks have benefited enormously from implementation of this legislation. Reply ↓ Vatch May 12, 2017 at 12:20 pm For anyone else who was confused by the terminology, as I was briefly, capex = capital expenditure. Reply ↓ Altandmain May 12, 2017 at 1:13 pm Not sure about the labor part overplaying their hand. They just wanted an even wage and productivity rise. It is capital IMO that has overplayed its hand and the rise of neoliberal economics which has led to declines in public R&D spending. There isn’t anything like the Space Race anymore. Reply ↓ tony May 12, 2017 at 3:20 pm Frankly, labour underplayed its hand. At one point it had capital by the throat, and should have finished it off then. If peace is not an option, you should utterly and permanently destroy your enemy. Reply ↓ Sluggeaux May 12, 2017 at 4:53 pm Labor did NOT overplay its hand after WW2 — Taft-Hartley was a HUGE smack-down to labor after the privations of the Depression followed by the war effort. The decent wages during the post-war period were part of a concerted effort to convince workers that they didn’t need unions and to be complacent. Labor leadership certainly became corrupt from all the money sloshing around without global competition due to war devastation of Europe and Japan, the Cold War, and the death throes of colonialism, but this was not due to “overplaying” their hand. Reply ↓ allan May 12, 2017 at 12:15 pm Reply to cr@May 12, 2017 at 12:01 pm Sarbanes-Oxley … Dodd-Frank … The trends described in the post predate by decades the communist tyranny [/s] imposed by those bills. The wholesale closing or offshoring of corporate research labs already started in the 1980s, driven in part by corporate raiders like Milken, Pickens and Icahn. IBM, GM, Kodak, Xerox, GE … they all had labs that provided jobs to STEM graduates and a stream of discoveries and inventions to generate more jobs. Now these are largely gone or substantially off-shored. What has happened to corporate R&D shouldn’t be used as an excuse to make life easier for the Wall Street culture largely responsible for it.

Longer tenure (mid to late mid career) engineers were being eased out for young grads. When I was in a ChemE program in the 70s, advice was to follow the engineering degree with either law or a business degree because the odds of a long career doing engineering was not great. No one advised going for a PhD in engineering. Reply ↓ Arizona Slim May 12, 2017 at 2:19 pm My father had a PhD in chemical engineering. When I asked him why he got the degree, which didn’t seem necessary for someone who spent much of his career in industrial R&D, he said, “I’m like Mallory climbing Mount Everest.

Reply ↓ shinola May 12, 2017 at 1:02 pm To me, this is the money quote (literally): “Many of America’s largest corporations routinely distribute more than 100 percent of net income to shareholders, generating the extra cash by reducing cash reserves, selling off assets, taking on debt, or laying off employees … the only logical explanation for this buyback activity is that the stock-based pay that represents the vast majority of the remuneration of senior corporate executives incentivizes them to manipulate their companies’ stock prices…” This not only applies to the STEM sector, but nearly every large corp. in America. “Earnings quality” (i.e stock price) takes precedence over everything else leading to the crapification of products & services and devaluation of employees.

The stockholders aren’t complaining. If any party is being disadvantaged by borrowing to fund stock buybacks, it’s existing bondholders. As David Swensen describes in an extended example in Pioneering Portfolio Management, managers compensated by stock options tend to treat corporate debt holders quite shabbily by piling on more debt, compromising the interest coverage ratio. High tech companies use stock buybacks to offset their widespread granting of stock options which — absent Rule 10b-18 — would badly dilute existing stock holders over time. Trying to paint the well-disclosed practice of stock buybacks as “looting” is histrionic ax grinding on Lazonick’s part. Over-leveraged companies are going to regret it in the next recession. But that’s a lamentable social phenomenon in a bubble-driven economy. Those who disagree with it are free to sell short over-leveraged stocks — perhaps a more meaningful way of expressing dissent than scribbling academic screeds.

HE RUNS NOTHING. And in his wake lies nothing but a blizzard of paper to cover the pain. Oh, if he said, “I know how to run your business better than you,” that would be something worth talking about. But he’s not saying that.

I ask myself if, from a mere one large corporation managing perspective, this was IBM’s 11th hour response to the by then devastating rise of its competitors like Apple & Microsoft. Also the irony that it did not help IBM at least in the midterm. So, IBM was the prime mover to initiate some aspects of a model change -change which every major player adhered to- in response to a new technological disadvantage vs. competitors, and in turned did not seem to do much for IBM in the immediate years. Although, if I recall well, IBM was immersed in many political battles and internal problems, legal and otherwise. Nevertheless, I doubt there was a historic inevitability on IBM’s ordinal force.

How could this “beat” happen? ….. a negative tax rate of -23%….

This was happening while Microsoft and Apple were clearly consolidating their oligopolistic empires. I read reports stating Oracle initial breakthroughs were taken from IBM’s research work.

Also, the quality of the readers’ comments is some of the highest I’ve seen in years of following NC Reply ↓ nowhere May 12, 2017 at 2:35 pm Not sure if anyone watches “Silicon Valley”, but here is a quote that seems fitting: Season 2 – Bad Money Richard: Once we get a few customers and start a subscription-revenue model. Russ: What? Revenue? No, no, no, no, no. No. If you show revenue, people will ask “How much?” And it will never be enough, but if you have no revenue, you can say you’re pre-revenue. You’re a potential pure play. It’s not about how much you earn, it’s about what you’re worth. And who’s worth the most? Companies that lose money. Pinterest, Snap chat… No revenue. Amazon has lost money every fucking quarter for the last 20 fucking years, and that Bezos motherfucker is the king. Reply ↓ Wisdom Seeker May 12, 2017 at 5:50 pm Just wanted to point out that there is one more link in the chain to be followed: the financiers would not have such an easy time playing Nero with our economy, if the banking sector were still properly constrained by a gold standard (=limited supply of printed credit), the risk of bank runs by outraged consumers, the Glass-Steagall separation of commercial from investment banking, personal rather than corporate punishment for fraud and abuse, antitrust enforcement, etc. In addition, the rise of 401(k) based investing, in which workers are tax-incentivized to buy in to the corporate stock scheming, but lack the normal shareholder voice in corporate governance, has taken the chains off the looters as well. It’s time to end the impunity. The government has been corrupted by the corporations, so only a populist uprising will produce reform. The uprising will require sacrifices of time, income, security. It will require boycotts of products that people like, but whose producers and vendors are evil. The products will not disappear while demand persists – but the producers and vendors must be brought to heel. Consider the following inductees into the Corporate Hall of Shame: Wells Fargo – customer abuse United Airlines – customer abuse UBER – employee abuse; legal system abuse Mylan (Epi Pens) – Monopolistic price abuse Hewlett Packard (spyware on laptops) – customer abuse … pick an industry, you’ll find a Hall of Shame candidate. Hit them all in the wallet until they reform.

Who got the loot and capital? Usual suspects.

The quarterly growth demanded by the financiers reminds me of those movies where the mobster shakes down merchants monthly or weekly for their “protection.” Reply ↓ Aumua May 12, 2017 at 10:12 pm So it’s the financial sector taking everything over, and running it into the ground for short term profit. Greed is winning. So ubiquitous, so dreary, hopeless. We probably won’t survive our own short sightedness. Dragged back into the primordial ooze by our evolutionary heritage. Reply ↓ Winston May 12, 2017 at 11:46 pm This is related to the Lasonick article: “the returns to companies’ R&D spending have declined 65% over the past three decades. Not coincidentally, this decline in companies’ research quotient or RQ (a metric I’ve developed that measures R&D productivity, or how much output they get for their innovation inputs) mimics the decline in U.S. GDP growth over the past 30 years.” https://hbr.org/2017/03/is-rd-getting-harder-or-are-companies-just-getting-worse-at-it Is R&D Getting Harder, or Are Companies Just Getting Worse At It?

In 2015, Apple took the stage in San Francisco and announced a slew of new products. Among them, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, the two devices that took over flagship duties from 2014’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus come with some powerful features they’ve received excellent reviews though some continue to feel underwhelmed by their battery life. Abnormal battery drain can appear at anytime though it typically rears its ugly ahead immediately after Apple releases a new iOS update. In the months since their release, we’ve seen a number of iPhone 6s users complain about abnormal battery drain. Baru sadar sehari ngecharge bisa sampai 3x. Iphone 6s seboros itu ya battery-nya? Apa battery gue bocor? :( — Irin (@khairinadiar) January 2, 2017 Considering getting a different phone literally just because of how many issues I have with battery life/charging my iPhone 6s — LOVE//LIGHTS//Q (@LameQuentin) January 2, 2017 Having so many battery and app issues with my iPhone 6S. I'm ready to #goPixel #google — Jonathan Dingman (@Dingman) January 2, 2017 Fortunately there are some ways to get bad iPhone 6s battery life fixed without having to perform a factory reset or take a trip to an Apple Store. How to Fix Bad iPhone 6s Battery Life We want to help you fix your battery life issues and ensure that you’ll be ready if the problems suddenly return in the future. These fixes will work if you’re on an iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus and they’ll work on any version of iOS 9 or iOS 10. Apple’s got more iOS updates on the way and iOS updates can be the root cause of some battery life issues. That’s why we recommend absorbing these fixes so that you’re prepared for all of Apple’s future iPhone 6s iOS updates. (Note: iOS 9 and iOS 10 come with a Settings Search at the top of the Settings screen. If you can’t find something, you can search for it there.) Wait Two Days If you just installed a new update, give it a couple of days before drastically altering your settings or habits. Battery life sometimes takes a day or two to settle in immediately after a new update is installed. Keep that in mind for future iPhone 6s updates. Use Low Power Mode If you haven’t started using it already, you’ll want to start using the Low Power Mode that Apple debuted with its iOS 9 update. Low Power Mode will allow you to stretch out your last 10-20% of iPhone 6s battery life without killing your core services. Best of all, it accomplishes this with one press of a button. Toggle it on, and you’ll save yourself in critical situations. If you’re at the 10-20% mark, you should get a prompt that asks you if you want to turn it on. You can also turn it on in your iPhone 6s’ settings if you need it before that. Go to Settings > Battery > Toggle Low Power Mode on. Use Airplane Mode in Bad Service Areas If you’re in a bad service area, your iPhone 6s/iPhone 6s Plus is going to work extra hard to find a signal. This can kill your battery. To offset this, you can do a few things. You can flip off cellular data or you can kill all of your connections using Airplane Mode. To toggle Cellular Data off, you’ll want to go to Settings > Cellular > and toggle it off at the top there. If that doesn’t work, try using Airplane Mode. You can toggle it off at the top of the Settings screen. Monitor Your Apps It’s easy to blame Apple and iOS for your battery life troubles but sometimes it’s a rogue app (or apps) causing the drain. If you’re noticing abnormal drain, you’re going to want to look into your app usage. If you use an app a lot, it’ll obviously drain a lot of battery. If you’re confident it’s not the constant use that’s killing the iPhone’s battery, you’ll want to dig in. We recommend getting familiar with the iPhone 6s’ battery usage tool. It’s located in Settings > Battery. It’ll show up under the Battery Usage header. This tool shows you which apps are eating the most battery. You can check the last 24 hours and you can check to see what they’re doing over an extended period of time. You can also, thanks to iOS 9, now check to see when they are eating battery. If something doesn’t seem right, you’ll want to take a few more steps. First, you can try downloading the latest bug fix update if you haven’t already. If that doesn’t work, try reinstalling the app or apps causing problems. If that doesn’t help, you’ll want to get in contact with the developer. Or, worst case scenario, uninstall it and find an alternative. Delete Facebook A recent piece from The Guardian asserts that the Facebook app is the cause of many iPhone battery life issues. Uninstalling it apparently delivered huge gains to performance so deleting is worth a try if you’re not attached to it. Limit Background App Refresh If you have background refresh turned on, apps will download information in the background so that new info is shown when you fire them back up. It’s useful but downloads can eat up battery in the background. This is why we recommend limiting it to the apps you use the most or killing it completely. To get a grip on this feature, head into Settings > General > Background App Refresh > Turn it off for the apps you don’t use or the apps causing problems. It’s also possible to turn it off completely but you may not want to do that. Shut Off Location Services Location Services (GPS) can absolutely wreck havoc on battery life. If you’ve ever used Google Maps or Waze for an extended period of time then you already should know that. To get a handle on what should use Location Services and when, head into Settings > Privacy. You can turn Location Services off completely with a toggle off but we recommend going through your apps to determine what should be using what when. You might not want some apps using Location Services in the background and you can limit that with a simple tap. Turn Off Push Like Location Services and Background Refresh, the iPhone 6s’ push feature for notifications, email, calendar, and more can suck up battery life. You’ll want to manage it. To look at your Push Notification settings, go into Settings > Notifications. There, you can shut off notifications for all of your apps or apps that you don’t use on your iPhone. You might also want to think about settings Mail, Contacts and Calendar to Fetch instead of Push. To do that, go into Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars and turn off Push. Manage the Retina Display Your iPhone’s screen can eat up battery if it’s not managed correctly. The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus come with sensors that power the auto-brightness feature. The auto brightness feature can be useful but it sometimes fails to work properly. If you think you can easily manage the brightness of your iPhone 6s Retina Display yourself, try adjusting it manually. It could help save you some battery. iOS makes this extremely easy. All you have to do is pull up from the bottom of the screen to enter Control Center. From there, just use the screen toggle to adjust your screen brightness. Turn it down when you don’t need the screen to be bright. Restart the iPhone 6s If you haven’t turned your iPhone 6s off for awhile, try restarting it. This simple fix has worked for us in the past. Reset Network Settings If that doesn’t work, try resetting your device’s Network Settings. This will cause the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus to forget Wi-Fi passwords to make sure you have those handy. To do that, head into Settings > General > Reset Network Settings. Reset All Settings If you’ve tired all of these little fixes and nothing’s worked, it’s time to take some drastic measures to fix your bad iPhone 6s battery life. The first step to take is to Reset All Settings on the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus. To get this done, go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings and then enter your passcode when the prompt tell you to. This could take a few minutes and it will force your device to forget your connections (and passwords) but it might fix your battery issues. It will not delete any files. Downgrade If that doesn’t work, you could try downgrading to the previous versions of iOS if the downgrade is available and it was working fine on your iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus. The downgrade process can be a bit tricky the first time but after you do it once you should be set. If you’re interested in dropping down to an older version of iOS you can read about the process here. Restore from Backup If none of these aforementioned fixes work, you can try restoring from a backup or wiping your iPhone 6s/iPhone 6s Plus completely starting from scratch. Plug in and backup to the computer or to iCloud. Turn off Find My iPhone – Settings -> iCloud -> Find my iPhone -> Off. In iTunes Click Restore. Follow the prompts and the iPhone will reinstall iOS 9/iOS 10 from scratch. When it completes click Restore from Backup to put your information back on the iPhone or Choose to set up as a new iPhone. You should only do this if nothing else works. Take Your iPhone 6s In If you don’t want to restore or perform a factory reset, you can also make an appointment to go see an Apple Genius at the Apple Store. (Or another store but we recommend Apple itself.) Geniuses will be able to run some diagnostics on your phone and they could help you figure out the problem. We once took in an iPhone 5s and discovered a bloated battery was responsible for the battery drain. If you’re under warranty, and you will be for a year from your purchase date, you might be able to get another iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus for free. You can find a list of your local Apple Stores right here. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 9 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 13 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 13 26 Responses 11/25/2015 Me Reply Thank you 02/19/2016 Janell Young Reply Thank you! 01/21/2016 Barbaraltrask Reply 0=18my best friend’s half-sister makes $87 /hr on the laptop .

Apple genius are of no use they replaced my phone without any luck.

It appears to be the carrier issue not the apple however it took us a very long time to figure this out.

I have been using an after market one and I’ve noticed my battery has been really bad, my husband said something about it a few days ago. I had 19% when we were out to eat and it just died without using it. So I started using the apple charger along with doing everything this article said to do and my phone battery is acting a lot better now, still dies fast for a phone I paid $850 for, but it’s better then it has been being. 09/29/2016 Victor Reply My 6s battery doesn’t drain rapidly I’m ok with it 10/01/2016 Holly Reply The battery life isn’t good at all! I would hate to think of being stuck somewhere with out a charger and something bad happenes to someone and not be able to dial 911!!! That’s my big concern! Not everyone carries a wall and car charger around with them because their phone doesn’t hold a good solid charge through the day!!! This really needs to be fixed! I’m surprised there hasn’t already been some type of law suit because of this very thing happening to someone! When my phone decides to die it just shuts down until I can get back to my car or home! AND a lot of cars won’t charge your phone which takes FOREVER in the car without the engine running!!! I would make this problem the first one on the list to fix!!! Thank you! 10/03/2016 Jeanie Stouffer Reply I agree with Holly and others. Was on the phone with Apple just yesterday trying to fix battery issues. Whu even have an $800 phone when I have to turn apps off/shut them down/low power mode/turn off app refresh blah blah. So disappointed with this iphone 6s. 11/23/2016 Guss Reply My 6S has been running relatively fine since I got back in January. But since iOS 10 was released, my phone has suddenly started having battery issues. As in it drains much faster now, and I haven’t been using it any differently. I’m not a social media fanatic. I check Facebook, Instagram and Twitter every so often. But I don’t live my life in them. Eg. prior to iOS 10 release, I spend 10 – 15 min going through FB posts, and replying to a few. Used up about 1% maybe 2%. Now, for the same amount of time, doing the same things, my battery goes down about 8-10%. Yes, I’ve learned to test stuff like this over the years. For referencing in times like this. I can’t prove, nor will any Apple authorities admit to it. But using basic logic and common sense, it leaves one to wonder. For the last 4 versions, what I’ve noticed was whenever a new iOS comes out, within a couple of weeks or so, my battery starts draining faster (no more usage than before). And whenever I contact Apple, they always say “I can’t help you if you aren’t on the latest iOS”. Hmmmm. And also keeping in mind, that Apple CAN and DOES push iOS updates to some peoples phone without their consent or knowledge. It doesn’t install, but it’s put there by Apple regardless. If they can do this, I’m absolutely certain they can do other things to our phones without our knowledge or consent. They’ve been doing it to me for years, since the iPhone 4S. In fact, just in the last couple of weeks, I’ve had to decline and delete the updates twice already. If and when I decide, I will do it myself. No reason why Apple should be twisting my arm to. I know all the troubleshooting tips. I’ve done them all, except for resetting and reloading. Which in my experience has NEVER worked for me. It was just a pain the arse to have to do. I really do believe that Apple does this to force people to update to the latest iOS, without looking like they are forcing people. Until anyone can explain with valid reasons as to why this happens to some and not all, this is the only logical explanation that comes to mind. Doesn’t take a lot of code to tweak something to cause the iPhone to use up more battery life in the background than normal. In Apple’s defense though, they did acknowledge (finally) a battery issue with their phones. And have offered to replace the battery on selected iPhone 6s that qualify. You’ll have to check in with an authorized Apple repair or got the Apple Store to check if your phone is one of them. 12/03/2016 Rich Reply I turned off all background apps, locations settings and turned down the retina display. It’s easily given me a few extra hours of battery life. 12/12/2016 MLB Reply For what you pay for an iphone it should have a decent working battery. I have turned off everything i can and still use my phone. The battery still needs to be charged by noon. I finally got a case that has a back up battery and that helps, but I still have to charge my phone several times a day. I agree with A previous comments by Ram which stated why have an iphone if you have to shut everything off. I am not going to run in and purchase yet another expensive phone in order to get more battery life. Apple should be taking care of the problem or allowing a greatly discounted upgrade for those stuck with the lemons. 01/04/2017 Alfonso Quiroz Reply I have the same problem, charged my iPhone 6S Plus (iOS 10.2) for approximately 5 hours at night and in the the morning when i unplugged it, it showed 100% but then within 5 minutes of being unplugged the phone dies and it showed the dead battery symbol so I could plug it in again. This only started happening after I installed the iOS 10.2. I bought an iPhone because I thought it was reliable but i was wrong. I’m not sure how the sales are going for the iPhone 7 but it is a big coincidence that the new iPhone comes out and a new software is released that causes issues on the old iPhones. I had the iPhone in the past and it was OK so i decided to buy the iPhone 6S plus and with the new software I’ve had a lot of problems. Even to the point where I’ve had my phone for about 9 months but when i enter my serial number on the apple website it says it is out of warranty. Pretty sad that Apple doesn’t care about their customers. 01/07/2017 Nrapendra pratap Sharma Reply Indeed great knowledge. I was looking for knowledge on downgrading IOS version. I also did a successfull experiment last night to stable my iphone 6s battery drainage. Link: https://youtu.be/AVqgyibz8H0 05/12/2017 Glenn Reply Can’t THANK YOU enough for the excellent suggestions. I was able to locate an app that I’ve never used that was consuming 35% of my battery. I was ready the bring my iPhone to the Apple Store for replacement of the battery. Thanks to your suggestions, I don’t need to do that… THANK YOU! Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: May 12, 2017 at 4:10 pm | UPDATED: May 12, 2017 at 4:31 pm Top of the Order:   Apple and Amazon, Sitting In a Tree: Has this ever happened to you? You’re at home, and you flip on your Apple TV. You start watching Netflix, or Hulu, or HBO Go, or even Sundance Now (home of the French spy drama “The Bureau,” which I highly recommend). Everything is going fine. And then you think, “Hey, I’ve heard a lot about “Goliath,” “The Man in the High Castle” and “Transparent,” and I sure would like to go over to Amazon Prime and check out those shows. I’ll just open up the Amazon Prime app on my Apple TV and…” Related Articles Biz Break: Snap wishes the last 24 hours could disappear and not come back Biz Break: Nvidia continues charging ahead with new chip markets With KKR’s help, Pandora may be on the selling block Apple borrowing billions while sitting on huge overseas cash pile Facebook on brink of launching its own TV shows Well, you wouldn’t be able to do that. And you can’t do it now, because Amazon’s Prime Video app isn’t available for the Apple TV. That doesn’t mean you can’t stream those Amazon shows via your Apple TV. The Amazon Prime app is available for the iPad and iPhone, and you can use Apple’s AirPlay technology to stream Amazon programs from those devices. But, really, wouldn’t it be much easier if Amazon just put its Prime Video app up for downloading directly onto the Apple TV so that you didn’t have to use another gadget to watch the latest episode of the L.A.-based cop show “Bosch”? Well, rejoice. Because according to Buzzfeed, Apple and Amazon are set to make nice and bring the Amazon Prime app to the Apple TV. An announcement on the deal is expected to be made at Apple’s upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference in June, with the app becoming available soon afterward. Why Amazon Prime hasn’t been on the Apple TV remains a matter of debate. Amazon has never submitted a Prime Video app to the Apple TV store, but Apple has never said it wouldn’t allow the app to be made available. Two years ago, Amazon pulled the Apple TV from its online store saying it, and Google’s Chromecast device, confused customers. Maybe Amazon just wanted to promote sales of its own Fire TV devices? But Amazon also sells gaming consoles, and set-top boxes like those from Roku that have Amazon Prime built in. Whatever the case, it looks like two of the companies that are among the most-secretive regarding their TV-gadget efforts have agreed to live and let live. Apple has never disclosed how many Apple TVs it has sold, and Amazon has neither disclosed how many Fire TV devices it has sold, nor the number of its Prime customers. Middle Innings: A $200 Million Start: And speaking of Apple…The company has wasted little time in putting its money where its mouth is with regards to its plans to invest $1 billion in manufacturing in the U.S. On Friday, Apple announced it will put $200 million into Corning’s plant in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, where Corning makes its Gorilla Glass that is used in iPhones and many other mobile devices. Our Apologies: Facebook said it was sorry to the group Women on Web for mistakenly taking down the organization’s Facebook page. Women on Web is a nonprofit group that gives women health-care information, including how women can reach doctors who offer abortion pills, and Facebook had originally said the group’s page didn’t meet its guidelines about not promoting or encouraging drug use. However, Facebook put the page back up after clarifying Women on Web’s intentions. Tweet What?: Anthony Noto, the chief financial officer and chief operating officer of Twitter, got into some Twitter heat Friday by suggesting that President Donald Trump should submit questions to, and answer questions on, Twitter itself. Trump is well-known for his love of using Twitter to take his message directly to anyone who follows him, and on Friday, he (maybe jokingly?) suggested that there should be no more White House press briefings. So, Noto offered the president a chance to use Twitter as his sort-of press room. However, a lot of high-profile Twitter users tweeted to Noto that they weren’t in favor of his idea. Bottom of the Lineup: Here’s a look at how some leading Silicon Valley stocks did Friday. Movin’ on Up: Gains came from Aviat Networks, IXYS, Gigamon, Barracuda Networks and Pandora. In the Red: Decliners included Rocket Fuel, SunPower, Abaxis, Quotient Technology and Synaptics. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index edged up by 5.3 points to 6,121.23. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 0.1 percent to finish the week at 20,896.61. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index ended the day down by 0.2 percent at 2,390.90. Quote of the Day: “First tunnel for The Boring Company begins.” — Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, announcing the start of technology digging tests for his Boring Company. Musk envisions a series of tunnels under the greater Los Angeles area that will alleviate the region’s traffic issues. Sign up for the 60-Second Business Break newsletter at www.siliconvalley.com.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple announces environmental progress in China Lens Technology has committed to power all of its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by the end of 2018, as part of Apple’s industry-leading supply chain clean energy program announced last year. Lens is the first supplier to make a clean energy commitment for all of its Apple production, and will meet its goal through an unprecedented power purchase agreement with local wind projects. Apple is working with suppliers to help transform the environmental landscape in China, and is proud to announce all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The UL standard certifies all of their manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or, when necessary, converted into energy. Since the program began in January 2015, the sites have diverted more than 140,000 metric tons of waste from landfills. “We want to show the world that you can manufacture responsibly and we’re working alongside our suppliers to help them lower their environmental impact in China,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. “We congratulate Lens for their bold step, and hope by sharing the lessons we’ve learned in our transition to renewable energy, our suppliers will continue to access clean power projects, moving China closer to its green manufacturing goals.” “Our power purchase agreement is the first of its kind in southern China and we hope it will serve as an example for other companies looking to transition to cleaner, more economical sources of power,” said Lens CEO Zhou Qunfei. “We’re pleased to be the first supplier to commit to covering all of our Apple production with renewable energy, and proud to source from local Hunan wind farms to power our facilities in Changsha.” Lens’ manufacturing with Apple currently includes two facilities in Changsha, Hunan province. Wind energy will cover 100 percent of the energy consumed producing Apple products at Lens facilities by 2018, avoiding nearly 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, equivalent to the energy use in 380,000 Chinese homes.

The California-based company announced Friday it would give the money to Corning Inc. to use at its facility in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. Apple and Corning first teamed up 10 years ago when former Apple CEO Steve Jobs ordered the plastic screen on the company’s first iPhone to be replaced with a scratch-resistant glass just a few months before the product was to launch. Since then, Corning says it has made 552 million square feet (51 million square meters) of its Gorilla Glass product for iPhones and iPads, or roughly enough glass to cover 10,000 football fields. “All of that work happened right here in Harrodsburg, and Apple owes you a big thank you,” Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams told workers at Corning’s Harrodsburg facility on Friday. Williams said the money is the first of $1 billion the company plans to spend on US-based companies from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund. “It’s only fitting that the first commitment from that fund be for Corning and specifically for Harrodsburg, where so much of our history is,” Williams said. Williams was joined by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Corning CEO Wendell Weeks. Officials from both companies did not say if the money would bring more jobs to Kentucky, or if the state offered any tax incentives for the investment. Corning officials said the money would be used “to sustain” the 400 employees who work in Harrodsburg. Officials said the partnership between Apple and Corning has produced 1,000 jobs in the United States. It was the fourth major business investment in Kentucky this year. In January, Amazon announced it would spend $1.4 billion to build a worldwide cargo hub in northern Kentucky. Toyota has said it will spend $1.3 billion in its Georgetown plant that produces its flagship Camry sedan. And last month, Braidy Industries announced it would spend $1.3 billion to build an aluminum plant in eastern Kentucky. State taxpayers could pay nearly $100 million in tax incentives to those companies over the next 10 years if they meet projected goals with spending and job creation. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Reliable leaker claims to reveal iPhone 8 launch timing, and it’s not what we’re expecting Zach Epstein BGR News May 11, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share This year is shaping up to be the most exciting time period for smartphones in about a decade. When Apple first released the iPhone in 2007, it was a total game-changer that dramatically altered the course of the industry. Now, in 2017, we’re seeing a major shift in design that makes content far more immersive than it has ever been before on smartphones. Devices like the LG G6 and Samsung Galaxy S8 are expected to be something of a preview of Apple’s iPhone 8, which should push things even further in this direction. What’s more, the iPhone 8 is expected to toss features like 3D scanning and enhanced augmented reality into the mix. The bad news is that all that tech is expected to come at a cost… or is it? Don't Miss: Your iPhone 7 Plus will last for way more than two days with this insanely thin battery case At this point, we’ve lost count of all the independent reports that have claimed Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 launch will be delayed. The phone is expected to be the first widely-available flagship device to feature a fingerprint scanner that is embedded into the display itself. It would certainly be understandable if manufacturing complexities associated with this major advancement caused Apple to push back the phone’s release, which is exactly what we’ve heard. While the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus are said to be on track of the standard September release, Apple is eyeing October or maybe even November for the iPhone 8’s launch, according to recent reports. What’s more, iPhone 8 supply is expected to be hugely constrained at launch, again due to the increased complexity of the phone’s components. Apple can’t even figure out how to make enough AirPods to meet demand five months after launch… so things aren’t looking good for a completely redesigned iPhone. While things still aren’t looking good as far as supply shortages go, a new rumor could bring some good news regarding the iPhone 8’s release timeframe. According to Twitter user @OnLeaks — who has a good track record despite his cringeworthy bio, in which he describes himself as a “Tech Leaks SupaStar” — Apple’s iPhone 8 is actually on track for a September launch. Hirings and trainings for new iPhones production just started at Foxconn… 😏 #iPhone8 pic.twitter.com/vbvqhOSUmX — OnLeaks (@OnLeaks) May 11, 2017 In the tweet above, the leaker says that Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn has begun to staff its facilities in preparation for Apple’s next-generation flagship iPhone. Then, in a subsequent tweet, he says that mass production of the iPhone 8 will begin in August ahead of a September launch. According to my sources: DVT started last month. PVT will start between June and July. Final mass production in August for September launch. https://t.co/2M2YyMjyi8 — OnLeaks (@OnLeaks) May 11, 2017 While this could certainly be good news, none of this is even close to being confirmed. But as we mentioned, @OnLeaks’ does have a good track record. If his unnamed sources are accurate though, it’s not all good news. Mass production one month ahead of launch for a phone with as much pent-up demand as the iPhone 8 would undoubtedly lead to severe shortages at launch.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Quanta Reports Best Q1 sales since 2012 Due to Strong MacBook Pro sales, Considers Dropping Apple Watch | Main May 12, 2017 The FTC Responds to Qualcomm's Motion to dismiss their case about Monopoly Power, Samsung & Intel File Amicus Briefs   In January Patently Apple posted a report titled "The U.S. Fair Trade Commission Sues Qualcomm for Forcing Apple to use its Chips in iDevices." The report noted that the U.S. Fair Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm accusing the biggest maker of mobile phone chips of illegally maintaining a monopoly over semiconductors used in cellphones and pocketing elevated royalties from customers. Earlier today the FTC responded to Qualcomm's motion to dismiss the case.   The FTC argued that Qualcomm's customers "accept elevated patent royalties they otherwise would refuse" only because they are forced "to negotiate in the shadow of Qualcomm's threat to withhold chips." As a result, "Qualcomm collects far more in royalties than other licensors in the industry with comparable patent portfolios."   Amicus Brief: Samsung   C/NET's report noted that "It's also being reported that Samsung, Samsung, the world's biggest handset maker, hasn't filed any lawsuits against Qualcomm, but it did file an amicus brief in support of the FTC on Friday, saying the court shouldn't dismiss the antitrust suit. In it, the company noted that it's a Qualcomm customer (it uses Qualcomm's chips in devices like the Galaxy S8), and it's also a potential competitor (Samsung builds and sells chips).   'In both capacities, Samsung has directly experienced, and been directly harmed by, the exclusionary conduct alleged in the FTC's complaint,' it said in a court filing Friday. '"Qualcomm refuses to license its [standard essential patents] on fair, reasonable, and on-discriminatory ... terms so that Samsung can make and can sell licensed chipsets. Given its position, Samsung is uniquely situated to assist the court in understanding the important antitrust principles at stake in this case.'   Samsung said in its filing that Qualcomm agreed to fairly license its technology if standards bodies adopt tech that required the use of Qualcomm patents. But the South Korean company said Qualcomm hasn't kept its side of the bargain. Instead of licensing its standard essential patents to rival chipmakers, it only gives licenses to handset manufacturers.   'Because Qualcomm does not license [chipset] competitors, handset manufacturers have no choice but to accept Qualcomm's onerous terms,' Samsung said. 'Qualcomm directly excludes competitors and harms competition.'   Amicus Brief Intel   Intel, one of Qualcomm's main rivals in semiconductors, also filed an amicus brief on Friday. The company, which was late and has struggled in the mobile chip market, became a supplier of iPhone mobile chips in Apple's latest models, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.   'Although Qualcomm has driven nearly all of its competitors out of the premium LTE chipset market, Intel has not thrown in the towel,' Intel said in a court filing.   The company noted that Qualcomm's business dealings with Apple 'put Intel's commercial success at risk and will do so in the future if Qualcomm is allowed to persist in its anticompetitive tactics. As the only remaining competitor in the premium LTE chipset market ... any harm to Intel's premium chipset business will have profound anticompetitive effects on the market as a whole.'"   For more on this, you could also check out FOSS Patents report here.

After years of competing to be the primary source of home entertainment, the tech giants have now come to truce and are set to add the Amazon Prime video app to Apple TV devices. Apple is expected to announce the new addition to the Apple TV App Store during the keynote at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 5. After years of competing to be the primary source of home entertainment, the tech giants have now come to truce and are set to add the Amazon Prime video app to Apple TV devices AMAZON VS APPLE  War broke out in 2015 when Amazon banned sales of Apple devices on its platform. The move was seen as a maneuver to control the living room. But the Cupertino company counteracted the attack by omitting any shows offered by Amazon in its iOS 10.2 update that included the TV app for its Apple TV – and the two have been rivals since.  However, the latest development has revealed that Apple TV will add the Prime video app to its App Store this summer.  War broke out in 2015 when Amazon banned sales of Apple TV devices on its platform. The move was seen as a maneuver to control the living room. 'Over the last three years, Prime Video has become an important part of Prime,' Amazon said, according to Bloomberg. 'It's important that the streaming media players we sell interact well with Prime Video in order to avoid customer confusion.' But the Cupertino company counteracted the attack by omitting Amazon's video app from its iOS 10.2 update, which included the TV app for its Apple TV – and the two have been rivals ever since. However, in a report shared by BuzzFeed News, sources revealed that the two firms have officially come to an agreement that will let users watch any shows via the Prime video app on their Apple TV. The sources also shared that the app could be available on the device this summer. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next The secret of crab camouflage: Video reveals 'natural...

Share this article Share The firms may have settled this dispute, but new developments have suggested that another could be on the rise. Amazon has been the major player in the virtual assistant space, selling more than 11 million Echo devices, but rumors have suggested that Apple wants a piece of the action and is creating a Siri-enabled smart speaker in bid to take on the e-commerce platform. Apple is expected to announce the new addition to the Apple TV App Store during the keynote at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 5 KGI analysts Ming-Chi Kuo revealed earlier this month that Apple will launch a smart speaker using its Siri assistant next month at its developer’s conference in San Jose.  'It will be positioned as a more premium product than the Echo … with a higher price tag to match,’ 9to5Mac shared regarding Kuo’s take on Apple’s smart speaker. He also predicted that the firm hopes to ship around 10 million of these as-yet-unannounced devices in the first year, and it will be made by Inventec, the same company that made Apple’s AirPods. Other rumors surrounding the secretive device have speculated that the device would let users push music, radio, and podcasts to the Apple hardware over Wi-Fi, which typically offers better quality than Bluetooth.  And it could 'carry some form of Beats technology and is expected to run on variant iOS'.    Read more: Apple Will Announce Amazon Prime Video Coming To Apple TV At WWDC KGI: Apple likely to announce ¿home AI¿ Siri Speaker at WWDC, positioned as high-end Amazon Echo competitor | 9to5Mac Apple News on iPhone, iPad and Macbooks | Daily Mail Online Amazon News on Offers plus Prime Video and Prime Air | Daily Mail Online Share or comment on this article e-mail 9 shares Most watched News videos Video shows parents fighting with students at Knight High School 'He's a showboat, grandstander' Trump slams Comey in NBC interview Thugs attack motorcyclist in attempted robbery stopped by helpers Cruel teen girl puts pet rodent in microwave to 'cook it' Giant mystery sea creature washes up on remote beach in Indonesia Horrific 100mph motorbike crash after drivers pull wheelies Cyclist climbs rail crossing moments before high speed train passes Bodycam captures the moment police fatally shoot stabbing suspect GRAPHIC: Shocking moment Mexican soldier 'executes suspect' Paddle-boarders surrounded by great white sharks Theresa May describes being motherless as 'sad' in LBC interview 'My country is the greatest country': Man rants at Muslim family Top barrister claimed a child abuse victim 'was not a...

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag.

Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses.

(AP) - Apple says it will invest $200 million in a rural Kentucky facility that it credits with rescuing the company's signature smartphone from a design flaw that would have led to scratched screens. The California-based company announced Friday it would give the money to Corning Inc. to use at its facility in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. Apple and Corning first teamed up 10 years ago when former Apple CEO Steve Jobs ordered the plastic screen on the company's first iPhone to be replaced with a scratch-resistant glass just a few months before the product was to launch. Since then, Corning says it has made 552 million square feet (51 million square meters) of its Gorilla Glass product for iPhones and iPads, or roughly enough glass to cover 10,000 football fields. "All of that work happened right here in Harrodsburg, and Apple owes you a big thank you," Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams told workers at Corning's Harrodsburg facility on Friday. Williams said the money is the first of $1 billion the company plans to spend on US-based companies from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund. "It's only fitting that the first commitment from that fund be for Corning and specifically for Harrodsburg, where so much of our history is," Williams said. Williams was joined by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Corning CEO Wendell Weeks. Officials from both companies did not say if the money would bring more jobs to Kentucky, or if the state offered any tax incentives for the investment. Corning officials said the money would be used "to sustain" the 400 employees who work in Harrodsburg. Officials said the partnership between Apple and Corning has produced 1,000 jobs in the United States. It was the fourth major business investment in Kentucky this year. In January, Amazon announced it would spend $1.4 billion to build a worldwide cargo hub in northern Kentucky. Toyota has said it will spend $1.3 billion in its Georgetown plant that produces its flagship Camry sedan. And last month, Braidy Industries announced it would spend $1.3 billion to build an aluminum plant in eastern Kentucky. State taxpayers could pay nearly $100 million in tax incentives to those companies over the next 10 years if they meet projected goals with spending and job creation.

Apple Awards Corning First Advanced Manufacturing Fund Investment $200M Investment Supports Revolutionary Glass Production Methods May 12, 2017 06:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time HARRODSBURG, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced Corning Incorporated will receive $200 million from Apple’s new Advanced Manufacturing Fund as part of the company’s commitment to foster innovation among American manufacturers. The investment will support Corning’s R&D, capital equipment needs and state-of-the-art glass processing. Corning's 65-year-old Harrodsburg facility has been integral to the 10-year collaboration between these two innovative companies and will be the focus of Apple’s investment. “Corning is a great example of a supplier that has continued to innovate and they are one of Apple's long-standing suppliers,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “This partnership started 10 years ago with the very first iPhone, and today every customer that buys an iPhone or iPad anywhere in the world touches glass that was developed in America. We’re extremely proud of our collaboration over the years and we are investing further with Corning who has such a rich legacy of innovative manufacturing practices.” Apple has committed to investing at least $1 billion with US-based companies as part of the fund, which is designed to foster innovative production and highly skilled jobs that will help lay the foundation for a new era of technology-driven manufacturing in the US. “Corning’s longstanding relationship with Apple has not only led to significant glass innovations that have enabled new capabilities for consumers, it has also helped create nearly 1,000 American jobs and allowed us to continue growing and expanding in the US,” said Wendell P. Weeks, Corning’s chairman, chief executive officer and president. “This investment will ensure our plant in Harrodsburg remains a global center of excellence for glass technology.” In the US, Apple now supports 2 million jobs across all 50 states, including 450,000 jobs attributable to Apple’s spend and investment with US-based suppliers. Last year alone, Apple spent over $50 billion with more than 9,000 domestic suppliers and manufacturers. Since the inception of Gorilla Glass in 2007, the partnership between Apple and Corning has created and sustained nearly 1,000 US jobs across Corning’s R&D, manufacturing and commercial functions, including over 400 in Harrodsburg. Corning has procured enough renewable energy to cover all of its Apple manufacturing in the US. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple’s four software platforms — iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple’s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple Accessories Market in China Is Expected to Grow at 8.5% CAGR Through 2016-2020 Valley Cottage, NY — (SBWIRE) — 05/12/2017 — The global Apple accessories market is expected to grow at 4.6% CAGR over the forecast period, 2016-2020. Demand is expected to remain strong in China, where rapid adoption of smartphones, combined with an increasing preference towards the ‚Apple’ brand is pushing sales. The market in China is expected to grow at 8.5% CAGR through the forecast period. Globally, the demand for Apple accessories is expected to be positively influenced by the growing BYOD trend. Weak distribution channels in emerging markets have remained a longstanding challenge for manufacturers. However, popularity of e-commerce and focus on creating alternative distribution channels have positively impacted Apple accessories sales in emerging markets. The steady growth in these markets is expected to offset weak demand in developed markets of the U.S. and Europe. Apple accessories sales in Asia will be driven by rising popularity of e-commerce websites and apps. As is the case in Asia, steady e-commerce sales are driving Apple accessories sales in Brazil and Russia. These factors will contribute to the overall growth of the global market. Future Market Insights identifies that undefined standards in terms of components and technology have led to price and product differentiation. Moreover, widespread availability of counterfeit and pirated products offered at a fraction of the original price in various developing countries can significantly inhibit demand for Apple accessories. Request For Sample@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-3374 The Future Market Insights report reveals that iPhone screen guards will continue to be the most-sought after accessory among consumers. iPad cases and iPad screen guards are expected to remain the other lucrative product types. Collectively, these three product segments accounted for over 50% revenue share of the global market in 2016, and the status quo will remain unchanged throughout the forecast period. Among these product types, iPad cases segment will only witness an increase in its revenue share by 2020. North America will continue to be the most lucrative market, with the US leading total sales. The North America Apple accessories market was valued at US$ 1.93 Bn in 2016, with the US accounting for US$ 1.38 Bn in revenues. Future Market Insights projects the North America market revenues to increase at a CAGR of 4% CAGR through 2020. The report further reveals that the Apple accessories market in Europe is predicted to register a CAGR of 4.0% in the span of next four years. However, the Apple accessories market in South East Asia is expected to witness relatively sluggish growth by the end of 2020. 3M, Bose Corporation, Western Digital Corporation (SanDisk), Logitech, Otter Products, LLC., Decoded, Adobe, Bang & Olufsen, Incase and ACCO (Kensington Computer Products Group) are the key manufacturers operating in the Apple accessories market globally.

Corning noted that its 65-year-old Harrodsburg, Ky., facility has played a major role in long collaboration between it and Apple and the highly resistant, durable “Gorilla Glass” that's used for iPhones, iPads and other iOS devices. Apple has also committed to invest at least $1 billion with U.S. based companies as part of the fund, which is aimed at creating new jobs and a “new era of technology-driven manufacturing in the U.S.”   “This partnership started 10 years ago with the very first iPhone, and today every customer that buys an iPhone or iPad anywhere in the world touches glass that was developed in America,” Jeff Williams, Apple’s COO, said in a statement. “We’re extremely proud of our collaboration over the years and we are investing further with Corning who has such a rich legacy of innovative manufacturing practices.” “This investment will ensure our plant in Harrodsburg remains a global center of excellence for glass technology,” added Corning chairman, CEO and president Wendell Weeks. Corning said it has procured enough renewable energy to cover all of its Apple manufacturing in the US. The Apple-Corning agreement comes on the heels of a commitment by Verizon to buy from Corning up to 20 million kilometers of optical fiber each year, from 2018 to 2020, for hardline networks that will deliver services to homes and businesses and to backhaul the company’s coming 5G network.

The company said Apple's notebook line will further help lift the company's performance later this year along with virtual reality headsets from Microsoft. Apple's Mac sales rose 14% year-on-year in the past quarter.   The Nikkei reports that Quanta Vice Chairman C.C. Leung stated that they expect their notebook shipments will enjoy a more than 10% sequential increase in the current quarter, and the second half now looks pretty good.   While MacBook Pro sales are positive, the fact is that they hurt the company's gross margin, according to Chief Financial Officer Elton Yang, leading to a fall from 5.1% in the fourth quarter to 4.73% in the January-March period.   The company could also be considering reducing Apple Watch orders next year due to ongoing losses, according to Vincent Chen at Taipei-based Yuanta Investment Consulting.   Chen said that according to his estimate, Quanta lost 4 billion New Taiwan dollars ($132.6 million) over the past two years in total on the Apple Watch, and it is likely the company will abandon the product and turn it over to Taiwanese rival Compal Electronics.   During Apple's Financial Conference Call on May 03, Apple's CEO stated that "We had great Mac results during the quarter. Revenue grew 14% to a new March quarter record and gained market share thanks to strong demand for our new MacBook Pros. Our Macs business has generated over $25 billion dollars in revenue over the past four quarters.

The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.   We just released Osmos 2.4.0 on iOS – our first release in almost 4 years. Why the long hiatus? Was it because 2.3.1, our previous release, was perfect? No, though it was solid and stable, and we were happy with it. Rather, it was due to our reliance on “floating-point determinism” for multiplayer. And for years afterwards I thought it might be the last version we ever released on iOS. Desynchronization: A Little Osmos Multiplayer History It’s 2013. Miley Cyrus is wrecking stuff in her underwear. I was about to submit version 2.3.1 to Apple for approval. This was a minor update from 2.3.0 – just a few fixes. We did a little testing, and all seemed solid. Then, just before submitting, we got a “blobiverse desync” error during a multiplayer test. What, you may ask, is a “blobiverse desync”? Well at the time it was something I never expected - nor wanted - to see again. It’s 2011. Everyone is getting into Minecraft. Aaron and I were working hard on creating a multiplayer mode for Osmos – a surprisingly ambitious and tricky project. One technical question we faced was how to synchronize game state between devices over a network. There are a lot of moving blobs in Osmos: It takes roughly 7 kb to represent the game’s state at any given moment. Multiply that by a decent framerate, and the network bandwidth required to stream Osmos state across a network gets into video streaming territory. We wanted to avoid putting that kind of load on people’s networks and devices. Instead, if we could simulate the game locally and identically on each device, transmitting only player input (mass-firing, mainly) across the network, the bandwidth requirements would be minimal. We decided to go that route. We encountered and solved so many technical challenges in our development of Osmos multiplayer, many of which I found super interesting, but I want to focus on just one here: simulation determinism. It’s actually a huge subject, so I’ll just touch on a couple bits and zoom in on an even narrower subject: floating-point determinism. For starters, a titch about simulating physics on computer. If you’re familiar with the term "lockstep simulation" - one of the things we implemented for Osmos multiplayer - feel free to skip the rest of this paragraph. Generally, physics is simulated a frame at a time: calculate, step; calculate, step; and so on. If you do it right, the smaller your time-step is (the time from frame to frame) the more precise your results will be. Precision aside, it’s important here to note that a different time-step will give you different results. For example, simulating one second in 60 steps (1/60th of a second per step) will give you a different result than simulating that same second in 30 steps (at 1/30th of a second per step). But so long as the framerate is decent and things are stable, these differences don’t get noticed by most players. In single-player Osmos we simply run as many frames as we can per second. If your device can handle it, this means the game will run at 60 fps, bound by the refresh rate of your display. But for various reasons some frames end up taking longer than others, sometimes due to the complexity of what’s happening in game, and sometimes due to what else the device might be doing in the background. So one frame make take 1/30th of a second, another 1/47th, another 1/60th, etc. And that’s fine. The problem arises when you want two different simulations to give identical results. In that case, the time-step used for calculations must be identical for both simulations. Physics programers call this a “lockstep” simulation, which we implemented for Osmos multiplayer. I won’t dive any deeper into this subject here, but a great resource on all this, including code examples, can be found on Glen Fiedler’s website. You may ask: is this necessary? Won't these calculation differences be minor? Who will notice? Well, Osmos falls into the category of sensitive systems that can produce drastically different results from slightly different initial conditions – aka the Butterfly Effect. For example: A tiny difference in mass-transfer between motes on different devices will cause them to exert slightly more or less gravity from that moment onwards, causing trajectories to vary more and more over time, until a near-miss on one device is a collision on the other – a “catastrophic” divergence. A player could die on one device but not the other. Not good. Moving on, once you've implemented a lockstep simulation over a network, how do you know if it's working correctly? Well, you could run a simulation on two devices and watch… and watch… and watch… until you maybe notice something looks different on the two displays. We did this for a little while, saw differences accumulate over time, and decided to get more rigorous. We computed a checksum / hash of the summed masses, x & y positions, and x & y velocities of all motes on the level (5 floats total), and started to send that across the network for every time-step. The devices would compare their local hash with the remote device’s hash, and if they differed we’d throw an alert up on the screen - blobiverse desync! - and dump a bunch of relevant numbers to a log file to analyze. One by one we found the divergences, and resolved them in various ways. And once we were done we were kind of amazed: devices from different generations, each running different versions of iOS - even the Xcode simulator - they all gave the same results! We had achieved simulation determinism. Huzzah! I remember chatting with Jonathan Blow at GDC 2012 about what we were up to. We got into some technical details, and I mentioned we were using a lockstep simulation as our multiplayer solution. He made a face I can only describe as "Ugh" with a dash of "Really?" I remember saying "I know. I know. But it's working well! We got this." We happily released Osmos multiplayer and never saw that error message again... ... until that final 2.3.1 build in 2013. What happened with that build? I had actually tested it a lot, and had never seen the desync. But one day right before release Dave and I were testing and - blammo - there it was. After some investigation we realized the desync only happened when playing 2.3.1 against the 2.3.0 store build. But what had changed? It turns out I had recently updated my version of Xcode. I tried reverting back to the previous version, and the problem went away. (I tested this to death.) Something in how the new Xcode was compiling our code gave different results from previous versions. Spooky. So, while Apple was still accepting builds from the older version of Xcode, we slipped it in. All went well with the release. But soon after, Apple stopped accepting builds from that version. We could no longer submit new versions of Osmos without breaking multiplayer. And for several years, we didn't feel we needed to. The 32-Bit App-ocalypse Over the past half-year, Apple has gotten more aggressive about culling “unsupported” apps from the App Store, with 32-bit-only apps slowly approaching the chopping block. It's pretty clear at this point that Apple will cut support for these with iOS 11. And so this January I rolled up my sleeves and started work on an update. I figured - worst case scenario - I might have to cut multiplayer entirely. I’m not actually sure what percentage of players play multiplayer. In any case I figure single-player Osmos is better than no Osmos. Modernizing the Osmos project so it would build and run using the latest Xcode and frameworks took some work, but less than I expected. Ditto for 64-bit support. There were only a few glitches related to memory alignment in our rendering pipeline and network protocol. For example, here are a couple before-and-after videos I put together demonstrating the kind of alignment bugs that required squashing.   Pretty smooth work for the most part. Desync issues aside, bigger changes were required for multiplayer. Apple’s networking and game frameworks have changed a lot over 4 years. And while I was at it I took a cue from Apple and removed all Game Center UI from the game, adding support for “background matchmaking” so players can practice/play single-player levels while waiting for a match. (There aren't as many people playing Osmos multiplayer these days, so it can be a while before someone else comes along looking for a match.) Hunting for Synchronicity Of course, synchronization was the big question / risk in this update. I didn’t expect the new version of Osmos to be compatible with the 2.3.1 store build, and sure enough it wasn’t. So we’d lose backwards compatibility at least. But I wondered if this new version would be compatible with itself across different devices and OS versions, like it was in “the good old days” – specifically, 32 vs 64 bit devices. It wasn’t. Ugh. And so began the deep dive into floating-point determinism. I tried many things. I spent a good chunk of time tinkering with compiler flags / settings. Turning off optimizations solved most of the desync issues, but I wanted to avoid that if possible. I tried flags like mfpmath and sse2, but they didn’t seem to get me anywhere, and documentation on the web with respect to those and clang is pretty thin. I revisited my understanding of floating-point math. I stared at waterfalls of numbers with many decimal places, trying to figure out where, why, and how things were diverging. I reduced the Osmos physics code to the point where nothing moved and no collisions occurred – at least that stayed in sync! I isolated the problem to the point where I had a single line of code that gave different results on 32 vs 64 bit devices for some (but not all!) input values. Simplified, it looked something like this: mote.x += mote.vx * dt; Simply update a mote's x-position by its x-velocity times the time-step. For example, with mote.x = 0.00668302644 mote.vx = 2.32162547 dt = 33/1000.0   // time-step in milliseconds The mote's new x-position on the iPhone 6 would be 0.0832966641 whereas it would be 0.0832966715 on the iPod 5. (A small difference, but still important.) Were IEEE standards being ignored? No. This difference only occurred in Final Release builds, with optimizations enabled. Eventually I convinced myself it was due to compiler optimizations causing some intermediate results to be temporarily stored in double / 64-bit registers on 64-bit devices, leading the final float / 32-bit result to be somewhat different. So I tried “unrolling” some simple calculations. For example, I expanded the single line above to float dx = mote.vx * dt; mote.x += dx; This kind of change helped in some sections of code, but not everywhere. In some places the compiler was still optimizing / merging instructions. So, how to tell the compiler not to daisy-chain floating-point calculations? Well, as someone who is absolutely not a compiler expert, I came across a neat trick: the somewhat esoteric volatile keyword. Rewriting the above code as volatile float dx = mote.vx * dt; mote.x += dx; tells the compiler to rewrite the result (as a float) to the dx variable as soon as it's calculated, and not to use any intermediate / higher-level registers. It’s a nice, code-local solution to the problem that can be applied in a very precise way where needed. I ended up having to do this to about 30 different blocks of code here and there in Osmos. It lengthens those sections of code (in some places from 10 lines to 40 lines of code), giving it more of an assembly-language style, but it works. Unfortunately that wasn’t the one, magic bullet that solved everything. It took me a while to track down the last couple sources of divergence, and they turned out to be the sqrt() and some trignometry functions. (Osmos is all about circles after all.) When compiler optimizations are enabled, these both give slightly different results for some inputs. For example, acos(0.830012262) returns 0.591666639 on my iPhone 6 and 0.591666698 on my iPod 5. Volatile doesn't help with this, so I tried rounding the results to the nearest degree, throwing away a bunch of precision, but giving indistinguishably-different results – totally fine so long as results match across devices. That worked. 99.999% of the time. Turns out every once in a while - hours of play on average - the results would end up on different integer boundaries after rounding. Ouch. Rounding can be a more complex operation than you might think, but it’s a solvable problem when there’s a ground truth you’re looking for, like the nearest integer to a given value. But when inputs are different, neither device in isolation has enough information to always come to the same result as the other. I lost days to that one, with much fun staring at streams and streams of tiny decimals. The solution? I went back to some basic circular-geometry and came up some new equations that would give a decent approximation of mote-mote area-overlap without the use of any trigonometry functions. The new approximation always underestimates the overlap, but that’s ok since the mass transfer generally gets spread across multiple time-steps anyways. I didn’t notice the difference, and I doubt anyone else would either. With that, and after tons of testing, I think Osmos 2.4.0 is solid on this front. All seems good after a few days in "the wild" as well. Can I guarantee there aren’t any super-rare divergences remaining? Nope. Hopefully people will let me know if they ever see it occur. TL;DR Overall I spent nearly 4 months working on this update. Most of that was on multiplayer, with one month of that spent in the rabbit hole of floating-point determinism. I hope this blog post helps others avoid some of that pain. To summarize: Lockstep synchronicity got you down? Try unrolling your calculations, assembly-style, and using the volatile keyword. Watch out for trig and other math functions. Sometimes they give the same results; sometimes they don’t. Don’t try rounding to solve your problem. It’s futile and just makes the problem rarer and harder to track down. Make sure you test with optimizations on. Moving forward I’m curious if a future version of Xcode will again break our synchronization, or if we’re now more-or-less future proof. Time will tell. ps. I could go on a lot longer on this and many other subjects related to Osmos multiplayer. If you find this blog post useful and/or interesting, please let me know. It’ll motivate me to blog more than once per year! ;-) Related Jobs Sony PlayStation — Playa Vista, California, United States [05.12.17] Technical Art Director Sony PlayStation — Playa Vista, California, United States [05.12.17] Senior UI Tools Programmer Sony PlayStation — Playa Vista, California, United States [05.12.17] Technical Architect Blue Isle Studios — Toronto, Ontario, Canada [05.12.17] Gameplay Programmer [View All Jobs] 297710 blog /blogs/EddyBoxerman/20170511/297710/Osmos_Updates_and_FloatingPoint_Determinism.php 553734 30003803 Loading Comments TECHNOLOGY GROUP Black Hat Content Marketing Institute Content Marketing World Dark Reading Enterprise Connect Fusion GDC Gamasutra HDI ICMI InformationWeek Interop ITX Network Computing No Jitter VRDC COMMUNITIES SERVED Content Marketing Enterprise IT Enterprise Communications Game Development Information Security IT Services & Support WORKING WITH US Advertising Contacts Event Calendar Tech Marketing Solutions Contact Us Licensing Terms of Service Privacy Statement Copyright © 2017 UBM, All rights reserved

The reveal came during a recent on-air interview with CNBC in which tech legend Steve Jobs’ successor said Apple would launch a $1 billion fund to help bolster the area of manufacturing that includes auto, aerospace, energy, and medical equipment. Cook said the first investment from Apple would be announced later this month and emphasized the growth of manufacturing as creating a “ripple in the pond” effect for the remainder of the economy. “Those manufacturing jobs create more jobs around them because you have a service industry that builds up around them,” Cook said. Apple has grown from 5,000 U.S.-based jobs 20 years ago to approximately 80,000 today. While one of the major drivers of the tech market, the company has taken its share of criticism in the realm of manufacturing with most of its devices being manufactured offshore in China.

By NOAH TRISTER, AP Baseball Writer, Updated: May 12, 2017 4:44 pm Follow @AuroraSentinel A bowl of apple pie nachos is shown at Coors Field in Denver, Saturday, May 6, 2017. The $6 bowl consists of cinnamon-covered nacho chips, apple pie filling and cheddar cheese, topped with whipped cream and then drizzled with caramel sauce. The concoction is rated at 740 calories.

The idea of serving edible grasshoppers at a baseball game didn’t come out of the blue. The Mariners brought that unusual offering to their ballpark this season, and although it might have seemed like a head scratcher to many fans and foodies, this crispy snack was meant to be more than just a quirky attention grabber.

It contains pork rinds topped with cheese sauce, crab meat, Old Bay seasoning, and scallions. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) The idea of serving edible grasshoppers at a baseball game isn’t as crazy as it sounds. The Seattle Mariners brought that curious offering to their ballpark this season, and although it might have seemed like a head scratcher to many fans and foodies, this crispy snack was more than just a quirky attention grabber. “This is like an authentic local delicacy,” said Diana Evans, a vice president of strategy and marketing for Centerplate, the Mariners’ hospitality partner. “We’re thrilled that people are excited about it.” The chapulines — toasted grasshoppers with chili-lime salt seasoning — arrived at Safeco Field this season courtesy of Poquitos, a Mexican restaurant in Seattle that serves them. For those fans who could wrap their minds (and mouths) around the idea of eating insects, the item proved quite popular, selling out during the opening home series. In an era when ballparks are constantly trying to add new features and attractions, spicing up the menu can be an easy way to enhance the experience for spectators. There will always be room for hot dogs, popcorn and peanuts, but Seattle’s experience with the chapulines shows how a creative new food offering can become the talk of baseball for a little while — and any team can pull it off. “Much like teams will use the offseason to make a big splash with a free agent signing or renovation … from a food and beverage standpoint, we’ll use the offseason to evaluate our menus and develop new offerings as well,” said David Freireich, a spokesperson for Aramark, which provides food and beverage services at eight ballparks. Although fancier food items can create some buzz at the ballpark, there are constraints. Fans do still want to watch the game, so a dish might not work if it’s hard to eat or takes a long time to make. The chapulines, on the other hand, can be eaten like just another ballpark snack. “Making sure that it’s something that you can walk around with, making sure that you don’t miss too much of the game while you’re waiting for it — and having it be both enjoyable and easy to eat,” Evans said. “That is, right there, our sweet spot.” Here are some more exotic culinary offerings from around baseball this season: APPLE PIE NACHOS (ROCKIES) Aramark offers this sweet snack at Coors Field — cinnamon sugar chips topped with apple pie filling, cheddar cheese, whipped cream and caramel. CHURRO DOG 2.0 (DIAMONDBACKS) The Diamondbacks unveiled their original Churro Dog a couple years ago — a churro inside a Long John doughnut, topped with frozen yogurt, whipped cream and chocolate sauce. The new version at Chase Field features Oreo cookie crumbs and strawberry topping. CRABMEAT PORK RIND CHIPPER (ORIOLES) In an area famous for its crabs, Oriole Park at Camden Yards offers pork rinds topped with cheese sauce, crab meat, Old Bay and scallions. DODGER BURGER (DODGERS) Dodger Stadium was already famous for its Dodger Dogs. Now you can order a burger that includes a grilled Dodger Dog on top. FALAFEL SANDWICH (PHILLIES) New at Citizens Bank Park, this sandwich includes house-made pita, lettuce, English cucumber, bell peppers, tomatoes and sesame mint yogurt sauce. GRILLI CHEESE (BLUE JAYS) Toronto reliever Jason Grilli has embraced the nickname “Grill Cheese” — and he designed the Grilli Cheese sandwich at Rogers Centre, with a portion of the proceeds going to Jays Care Foundation. “Sometimes, simple is best. You don’t need to think too far outside the box to come up with an idea that really captures the imagination of the fans,” Freireich said. MOST VALUABLE TAMALE (RANGERS) A few years ago, the Rangers began selling a Texas-sized hot dog that came on 2 feet of bun. Globe Life Park is now home to the M.V.T., which features the 2-foot hot dog stuffed in a tamale and covered in Texas Chili, nacho cheese and sour cream. PULLED PORK PATTY MELT (ROYALS) Kansas City shows off its barbecue prowess at Kauffman Stadium with this pulled pork item that includes onions, cheese, bacon and jalapeños. The bun is made of funnel cake. “While it may seem a little exotic, if you will, the truth is that the flavors really work well with one another,” Freireich said. “From the sweet and savory aspect of things, there might be skepticism on the part of fans, but more so than not, the reaction is very favorable and positive.” RAW COOKIE DOUGH (METS) DO Cookie Dough Confections, a New York City cookie dough shop that’s been all the rage recently, has an outlet at Citi Field. SLOPPY KO (TWINS) Target Field has introduced this flatbread sandwich with Korean-style barbecue beef topped with kimchi and a boiled egg. It’s sold at a concession stand named for Andrew Zimmern of “Bizarre Foods” fame. ___ More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball ___ Follow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister Tags: ap, apple pie nachos, ballpark food, chapulines, colorado rockies, Coors Field, food, Major League Baseball, MLB Top Videos FRIDAY NEWS IN A RUSH: 10 things in 60 seconds and A-TownTV NewsMinute THURSDAY NEWS IN A RUSH: 10 things in 60 seconds and A-TownTV NewsMinute WEDNESDAY NEWS IN A RUSH: 10 things in 60 seconds and A-TownTV NewsMinute TUESDAY NEWS IN A RUSH: 10 things in 60 seconds and A-TownTV NewsMinute HAIL OF A STORM: West metro pummeled by destructive hail; Aurora sustains mostly tree damage — VIDEO CLIPS View more Top Videos Aurora Sentinel Local news, sports & entertainment News Opinion Sports Guide Events Colorado Table Markets & Events Recipes Dining Pure Colorado Sustainable Living Drink American Buffet Aurora Magazine The Lifestyle magazine for the greater Aurora region Home Features Check Please About Us Email Newsletters Daily Headlines Prep Sports FindIt!

Photo / Jasper Juinen The Black Diamond library sits at a slight forward slant on Copenhagen's riverfront, resembling a pair of Borg spaceships peering into the water. On the morning of a European Commission citizens' dialogue in early February, the building's coal-dark facades were slicked with rain and mist, but more than 100 people had trooped into its auditorium. The event was an episode in a travelling roadshow in which the 28 European Union commissioners -- one per member state, each with a portfolio such as trade or transport -- take turns fielding questions and explaining their policies. One of the two commissioners anchoring the dialogue was Margrethe Vestager, the Danish politician who has turned into a heated celebrity as head of the EU's directorate general for competition. Her job as chief sleuth requires her to protect the union's vision of a fair market, and she's set about it with gusto. Last August, Vestager announced that Ireland had granted Apple illegal tax benefits, and she directed the company to pay more than US$14 billion in back taxes and interest. It was a rare boulder slung at a Goliath, and it drew cheers in many quarters in the US and overseas. Vestager's entire tenure has been laced with an instinctive mistrust of big corporations. She's driven investigations of Amazon.com, Fiat, Gazprom, Google, McDonald's and Starbucks -- and she still has two and a half years remaining in her term. Rulings on McDonald's and Amazon, both under scrutiny for their tax deals with Luxembourg, are imminent. If Vestager levies a multibillion-dollar fine against Google -- a distinct possibility because the company is fighting three separate European antitrust cases -- she will truly set headlines aflame. As with Apple and Amazon, these cases were bequeathed to Vestager by her predecessor, but she's accelerated them to their finish lines.American furyLarge American multinationals aren't used to being stymied overseas, and Vestager's consistent readiness to face off against them has provoked a startled fury. Continued below. Related Content Fran O'Sullivan: Technology giants eat media's cash Mary Holm: Don't take a gamble on the forex trade Brian Gaynor: Cannabis stocks don't take long to get high American fury Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive officer, called the tax decision against his company "total political crap". And a group of 185 American CEOs appealed directly to European heads of government to reverse the ruling, describing it as "a grievous self-inflicted wound". Even the US government has felt the need to speak out. A white paper released by the Department of the Treasury last August criticised Vestager's office for acting like a "supranational tax authority" and setting "an undesirable precedent". In late March the office of the US Trade Representative reiterated its opinion, as part of a broader report, that Vestager is deviating too far from prior case law. One former Treasury official from the Obama Administration said Vestager's staff resembled "a bunch of plumbers doing electrical work". None of this has dissuaded Vestager, who continues to defend one of the EU's foundational philosophies -- that a well-policed economy yields the largest and most widespread benefits for society. At a moment when the EU is convulsing with fresh doubt -- impelled by Brexit, various species of populist nationalism, Greek frailty, Russian meddling, and a disenchantment with eurozone debt -- Vestager has become one of the most visible, vocal champions of the union. This year she made Time magazine's list of the world's 100 most influential people. "I think she's tough and serious," Anthony Gardner, the US ambassador to the EU from 2014 to 2017, says. "I would even call her a superstar." Picture of diligence A year shy of 50, Vestager radiates efficiency and self-control. She never slouches; her clothes appear polished but comfortable, picked out for long working hours; not one movement is superfluous. Even her hair has been cropped short for years, as if to give her one less thing to do every morning. During the Black Diamond event, she was the picture of diligence. When the panelists sat down, she uncapped water bottles for them; when the moderator conducted a set of quick audience polls, she took photos of upraised hands; when Financial Stability Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis talked about Europe's wind-power industry, she twisted in her chair to listen to every word, not looking away from him once. In speaking about her work, Vestager is always fluently, adhesively on message. Even cursory attendance at her speeches and press events is enough to become familiar with her talking points. She frequently invokes the Treaty of Rome, which founded the European Economic Community 60 years ago, as a way of situating her office and its mission in the very headwaters of the EU. She likes to say Europe welcomes business of all kinds. "If you win on the market, that's fair -- we'll congratulate you," she said at the library. "But if you cheat on the way up, then that's for us to look at." Trump and protectionism Someone asked her if she'll be warier of acting against American companies now that Donald Trump is President. The audience tittered uneasily. Nothing would change, she replied. "We're not going hard at US companies specifically. It's not your flag that matters to us. What really matters is: If you want to do business in Europe, you play by the European rule book." This was another of her well-worn aphorisms, but it masked the latest international wrinkles. Trump has already shown himself to be volatile on trade policy, reflexively defensive of US interests, and an intermittent advocate of the collapse of the EU. His protectionist swagger has rattled Brussels; in March, Jean-Claude Juncker, the chief of the European Commission, warned that relations with Washington "have entered into a sort of estrangement", and that any American tariffs on European products will trigger swift reciprocal action. If this happens, Vestager's office will become even more politically charged, liable to be deployed in retaliation and to attract even more American anger. Ice queen Vestager began her political career in 1988, at 20, working for Denmark's Radikale Venstre -- in direct translation, the "Radical Left", though the party is habitually cast as the Social Liberals. Its principles are centrist, leaning toward economic conservatism. Vestager's maternal great-grandfather helped found the party, and her parents were members. Lutheran pastors both, the doors of their house were open to anyone who wanted to drop by for advice or spiritual succour. Vestager rapidly shinned up the party's ranks. When she was 29, she was put in charge of two ministries, education and ecclesiastical affairs, and served on several government committees. Her reputation as a thorough but prickly -- even callous -- politician grew. Almost inevitably, she acquired the label "ice queen". In the fall of 2011, Vestager's career reached a fulcrum. A conservative government, convinced it made fiscal sense to cut unemployment and early retirement benefits, staked its survival on the issues by calling fresh elections. Vestager supported the reforms, but she befuddled everyone by declaring her allegiance to an electoral alliance of left-leaning parties that were promising to roll back the austerity measures. When the coalition won, Vestager and the leaders of her allied parties hunkered down in a hotel on the outskirts of Copenhagen to wrangle over policy details and cabinet positions. On the question of cutting welfare, she refused to back down -- part of the reason the negotiations lasted three weeks. At one point during those weeks in the hotel, Vestager realised she was in control of the parleys, and she made an audacious demand: the finance ministry for herself. Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks as he attends the Economic Summit. Photo / AP As she expected, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the prime minister-elect, declined. Vestager called the marriage off. After a day, Henrik Kjerrumgaard, her communications adviser at the time, recalls, Vestager invited Thorning-Schmidt to her house. Thorning-Schmidt offered Vestager a troika of titles -- deputy prime minister, minister of the economy, minister of the interior -- amalgamated into a single job just for her. The austerity measures remained in place. Four years after taking over a small, flailing party, the minister's daughter had become the second-most powerful person in Denmark. Through the thick of the recession, Vestager struggled to revive Denmark's economy. In 2012, trying to explain the inevitability of austerity, she let slip a stray remark -- "That's how it is" -- that went viral; she was eviscerated for being uncaring and out of touch. That same year she chaired meetings of Europe's economic and finance ministers. Relying in part on that experience, Thorning-Schmidt named Vestager to the European Commission in 2014, where Juncker put her in charge of competition. Within the EU, the DG Comp -- the directorate general for competition -- considers itself an enforcement agency, wedded only to the rule of law and above the politicking that riddles the bureaucracy elsewhere. With the research capacities of a 900-strong staff, Vestager makes decisions related to cartels and antitrust, approves or rejects mergers, and investigates state aid cases, in which member countries single out companies for unfair advantages such as tax breaks. In the US, state aid by way of targeted tax incentives is a legitimate strategy to lure investment; in Europe, it's a forbidden tactic. Biblical patriarch Commissioners come into their offices with varying objectives. "Vestager has made the tax investigations a very big priority indeed," says Gert-Jan Koopman, a deputy director general in DG Comp. He disagrees with the perception that Vestager nurses a vendetta against American companies. The splashiest cases of her tenure -- Amazon, Apple, and Starbucks -- were all opened by Joaqun Almunia of Spain. "It's very unreasonable to claim that she proactively decided to go after these companies," Koopman says. The numbers bear this out. Of the 276 companies involved in antitrust cases opened by Almunia, 39 were American; in Vestager's term, the breakdown is 11 of 81. The friction between corporate America and DG Comp is in some manner cultural. American executives are often flummoxed when Vestager discusses competition law in the severe moral terms of a Biblical patriarch. "When we have a case and you take away the specifics and the technicalities of the law, what you find is basically the same as Adam and Eve," she says. "It's about greed -- wanting to have something and taking a shortcut to get it. Or sometimes fear -- fear of being driven out of the market if your competitors are growing into a strong position." Meetings between American CEOs and competition commissioners can go badly. As ambassador to the EU, Anthony Gardner, met often with visiting CEOs on their way to meet Vestager and gave them an informal lay of the land. "I was very clear with them. Don't go in and lecture. It won't work with her," he says. "And what they should not do is engage in a public-relations campaign of slamming the commission, which has unfortunately happened in a few cases." When Apple's Cook visited Vestager in her office in January 2016, she was at her steely best, one witness to the meeting says. "I think Mr Cook was more in a lecturing mode, and somehow they didn't really connect terribly well." Apple declined to comment for this story. Vestager says the Apple case is, in its principles, no different from any other state aid investigation. Her declaration of Apple's US$14b-plus-interest tax bill flared brightly, she says, "because it's a big number, and because it's a company that everyone knows". No state aid ruling has ever resulted in a recovery so enormous. In a March 2016 letter to Vestager, Cook wrote that he was concerned "about the fairness of these proceedings"; when the decision was announced, Apple and Ireland promptly appealed it. The money will be placed in escrow until European courts deliver a final decision, a process that's likely to take years. In the meantime, there will be other cases, other rulings. DG Comp is determining if Bayer AG's US$66b purchase of Monsanto will make the EU's agrochemical market anticompetitive. Vestager is also readying her decision on Luxembourg's tax relationship with McDonald's, which could be ready before the European Commission breaks for the summer in August. Her investigation may already have forced McDonald's to react; in December, the company announced it will shift its tax base to the UK. Obligation to be an optimistHowever insistent Vestager might be that her job involves a pure application of the law, it's also inarguably informed by politics. It is, for example, a political virtue to demonstrate to eurosceptics -- as she does -- Brussels's supervision of its member states and its resolve to protect the welfare of Europe's citizens. "In general, there is a different sort of awareness and a legislative momentum on tax cases," she says, attributing this attentiveness to the financial crisis and the tax revelations contained in the Luxembourg Leaks and Panama Papers episodes. "People have felt that benefits were cut in some member states, public salaries were cut maybe 10 to 15 per cent -- very hard-core decisions to get in control of your spending. And then, when people see that not all businesses contribute, I think the frustration and the anger about this have been largely underestimated." In the choppy new world order, if the US abandons its post at the tiller and retreats into itself, Vestager says, "Europe can step forward to fill whatever vacuum might appear." There is no room for worry, no time to fret. "I think it's more an obligation to be an optimist. Pessimism will never get anything done."

If your iPhone isn’t as fast as you’d like it to be, your first thought might be to take it to the closest Apple Store. But why spend an hour or more at the Apple Store (more if there isn’t one close to you) when you can speed up your iPhone from your computer chair or couch in a matter of seconds. You don’t need to be an Apple Genius or even an expert to speed up your iPhone right now. All you need is a few seconds during a quiet part of the day. If your iPhone is starting to feel sluggish, try one of these remedies. Some of these will work better than others so you might need to use trial and error until you find the right combination for you and your iPhone. Restart Your iPhone A simple restart could have a significant impact on your device’s speed, especially if you haven’t turned it off in awhile. To shut off your phone, hold down the power button until the prompt appears. Follow the on-screen instructions and power your iPhone down. Wait a minute and then hold the power button down again to power the phone back on. Clear Space If you’ve owned your iPhone for awhile you’ve probably collected a ton of clutter on your device’s hard drive. If you’re anywhere close to your hard drive’s threshold, you’ll want to do some cleanup. Freeing up space could speed up your iPhone. To get started you’ll want to head into Settings > General > Storage & iCloud Usage and select Manage Storage. From that screen you can determine what can stay and what needs to go. Maybe it’s a game you no longer play, a video you no longer watch, or hundreds of photos you no longer need. You should be able to find something to delete. Deleting your messages could save you a ton of space and help speed up your iPhone. If you notice your Messages taking up multiple GBs of storage, it might be a good idea to get that under control. To cut down on the amount of saved messages on your iPhone, go to Settings > Messages and scroll down to the Message History section. Tap on Keep Messages and select 1 Year or 30 Days. This will delete any messages older than a year or 30 days so make sure to save the photos and videos from within those messages that you wish to keep. Clear Browser Cookies & Data You can also free up some memory by clearing your browser’s cookies and data. If you use Safari go into your iPhone’s Settings > Safari > and scroll down to where it says Clear History and Website Data. Tap that. Clearing this will remove your browsing history, cookies, and other data from Safari. History will also be cleared from any devices signed into your iCloud account. If you can handle that, tap Clear History and Data again. If you’re using Google Chrome on your iPhone, you’ll want to head into the app itself and tap the three vertical circles in the top right corner. From there, tap Settings > Privacy > Clear Browsing Data. There, you can select what you wish to delete. If you’re noticing serious lag on your iPhone it might be a good idea to start clean. Select them all (you’ll notice a check mark on the right once you’ve done this) and then click Clear Browsing Data. Install iOS 10.3.1 If you failed to install iOS 10.3 and you have yet to install iOS 10.3.1 on your iPhone, you’ll want to consider it. Apple’s iOS 10.3 update delivered a brand new file system called APFS. If you chose not to install iOS 10.3, iOS 10.3.1 will automatically convert your device’s filesystem from HFS+ to APFS. Installing iOS 10.3.1 and APFS could improve your device’s boot time (the time it takes for the phone to go from an off state to on), the overall speed (our iPhone 5 feels faster with iOS 10.3.1 and APFS on board), and a bump in storage which, again, could improve your device’s speed. The move to iOS 10.3.1 might seem daunting for those of you with older iPhone models on older versions of iOS. If you’re straddling the fence, take a look at our full list of reasons to install the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone right now. Turn Off Animations Turning off some of your iPhone’s animations and transitions could deliver a nice little bump to your device’s overall speed. To reduce Motion Effects, go into your iPhone’s  Settings > General > Accessibility and toggle Reduce Motion on. Toggling this on will disable some features like the bubble effect in the Messages app. While you’re there, you’ll also want to reduce the transparency and blur effects on your iPhone to. This could help your iPhone’s GPU. To Reduce Transparency on your iPhone, tap Increase Contrast and then tap the toggle to turn on the Reduce Transparency function. Disable Widgets Try cutting down on the amount of active widgets to see if that gives your iPhone a speed boost. If you have a lot of widgets active on your iPhone, they could be hogging your device’s precious resources and thus, hampering its overall speed. To start killing off widgets, swipe to the right while you’re on your iPhone’s home screen. Scroll all the way to bottom of the list of widgets and select Edit. Disable iPhone widgets to improve your device’s speed. You’ll be taken to a new screen where you should see a long list of services and apps. These are your widgets. If a widget is active, you’ll notice a red circle with a minus sign to the left of its name. If it’s inactive, you’ll see a green plus. To remove a widget, tap the red circle with the minus sign and tap Remove. You can remove all of them or a few as needed. Kill Processes in the Background If you aren’t good at managing the apps and services on your iPhone there’s a good chance some of your apps and services have become resource hogs. Getting a handle on your items running in the background could pay dividends. The first service to look at is Background Refresh. When Background Refresh is flipped on, your apps will be refreshed with new information while running in the background. It’s nice but it might be the cause of your lag. If you don’t need instant data, go to your Settings > General > Background App Refresh and toggle Background Refresh off. This will completely kill the service. If you’d prefer to whitelist some apps, go down your list and toggle Background Refresh off for individual applications. If you have Automatic Downloads turned on, you might have apps downloading new content in the background. To disable Automatic Downloads, go to your Settings > iTunes & App Stores > and toggle Music, Apps, Books & Audiobooks, and Updates off. Wipe Your Device If these quick fixes don’t help you speed up your iPhone in seconds, it’s time to press the red button and go nuclear. If you’re using an older phone like the iPhone 5 or iPhone 4s, it might be time to wipe the phone and start from scratch. We recently did this on our iPhone 5 and the results were fantastic. It feels 100x faster than it did before. Restoring your iPhone will take more than a few seconds to complete because you’ll need to start by making a backup. Once you backup your iPhone, you’ll want to head to Settings > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings to get started. For additional support, take a look at our full length guide. Go to Apple Contacting Apple support on Twitter is an option but we recommend taking your iPhone to the nearest Apple Store so Apple Geniuses can run diagnostics. Appointments fill up quickly so if your situation is dire, you’ll want to try a book a visit as soon as you possibly can. Buy a New iPhone If all else fails, it might be time to buy a new phone. Devices like the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c will probably see their software support end here in a few weeks. In other words, you won’t be able to count on Apple and its iOS updates to fix your lag or sluggishness. The iPhone 7 is Apple’s fastest phone but for those on a budget, you might take a look at the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s are still plenty fast with iOS 10.3.1 on board and they’re worth a look if you can no longer deal with your device’s speed. iOS 10.3.2 Release & Time: 5 Things to Expect & 4 Not To iOS 10.3.2 Release Date   1 / 9 Apple rarely announces iOS release dates ahead of time so its silence regarding the iOS 10.3.2 release date hasn't been surprising.  It's difficult to predict an exact release date but the beta and Apple's tendencies can help us narrow it down a bit for you.  Apple is currently on iOS 10.3.2 beta 5 which means the company has released updates to beta testers. That's a lot for a small maintenance update like iOS 10.3.2 and it probably means we're getting close to the official roll out. The last maintenance update to go through a beta, iOS 10.2.1, saw four beta releases before it was released to the public.  Apple also tends to release new iOS software on Monday. This isn't guaranteed but the company's been pretty consistent with its iOS 10 updates.  At this point we'd be shocked if we made it out of May without a release. Look for iOS 10.3.2 to land on one of the remaining Mondays, May 15th or May 22nd. Monday May 29th is a national holiday in the United States and we don't expect Apple to release iOS 10.3.2 on Memorial Day.  We'd be very surprised if the iOS 10.3.2 beta stretched into June and the rumored arrival of iOS 11.   1 / 9 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Nowadays, it is not uncommon to see a company that develops a new product in the U.S., manufactures it in Asia and sells it in Europe. The world is becoming a marketplace, not only for selling, but also for buying. Wage rate differentials, expanding foreign markets, faster information technologies and improved transportation are breaking down barriers of time and space between countries, forcing companies to take a global dimension. Competing, and most importantly, being successful in this “new” world requires a different approach.  ADVERTISEMENT As mentioned by General Electric (GE) Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt at Georgetown University on May 4, when he joined GE in 1982, 80 percent of revenue was in the United States. In 2017, nearly 70 percent of revenue will be global. They have customers in 180 countries and their exports exceed $20 billion.   General Electric's U.S. workers earn high wages because they make leadership products that are sold around the world. “Globalization has made us become more efficient, more competitive,” Immelt said. The essential question then becomes, 'What makes some companies more successful than others?' The definition of global supply chains is at the core of the answer, i.e., who makes what and where it is made become critical factors in determining how efficiently an iPhone reaches the end user. Global supply chains are the response to the increasing integration of international markets, as firms try to remain competitive. More importantly, the battlefield is changing from “my company” against “your company” to “my supply chain” against “your supply chain.” As many say, we are competing with everyone from everywhere for everything!   Therefore, the basic premise that politics and business are not related is fundamentally wrong. It is impossible to isolate the optimization of business performance, such as cost, quality and productivity from the externalities imposed by government policies, such as taxes, regulation and protection. That explains why supply chains are so extended for just about any business you can imagine.   A company like Apple involves hundreds of suppliers around the world. A typical iPhone travels the world before reaching final customers. The constant struggle of offshoring and reshoring is part of the continuous search for the ideal balance between business and politics. It is myopic to assume that companies make drastic decisions overnight. Changes respond to strategic decisions where multiple trade-offs are evaluated.   In research I recently helped conduct with the Global Supply Chain Benchmark Study Consortium, we found companies are currently restructuring their global production footprints. Most firms engage in offshoring; reshoring does occur but seldom for corrective reasons. Firms localize production in developed economies and use developing economies as production hubs. This explains many of the trends we see with Apple's latest announcement.  Apple is not inexperienced in creating U.S. jobs. According to the plan, Apple is launching a $1 billion fund to invest in U.S.-based advanced manufacturing companies. This is consistent with the company’s recent strategies. Apple has already created 2 million jobs in the United States. According to CEO Tim Cook, Apple has employed workers in all 50 states, boasting 80,000 company workers in areas like research and development, customer support, Apple stores and financial services.  In addition to Apple, the companies affiliated with its supply chain contribute to providing U.S. jobs. As reported by Cook, U.S.-based suppliers, such as Corning, which provides glass for the iPhone and iPad, and 3M, which creates adhesive materials for Apple, add an additional 450,000 jobs.  It is tempting to argue that Apple is responding to political pressure. I believe the response is more in line with the challenges companies face managing complex supply chains. As our research demonstrates, changes in supply chains are not decided overnight. They are more the response of a solid strategy developed over time.  This is not a public relations move designed to get the federal government off their backs. The challenge is to decide what and how to outsource in order to maintain control over key elements that provide the core competence. Many leading companies have realized that it is worthwhile investing to make sure offshoring and reshoring are properly executed and that they positively influence product development costs, inventory levels, after-sales service and the fulfillment of customer demand. Is the political pressure tweaking the long-term strategy? No doubt, but it is definitely not the main driver. The amount and complexity of the “real” linkages in the existing global supply chains “trump” over public relations pressures.   Ricardo Ernst is a professor of operations and global logistics at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business.

Apple Activity Challenge: Mother's Day edition! By Rene Ritchie Friday, May 12, 2017 at 8:29 am EDT 0 Comments Got an Apple Watch? Then get moving this Mother's Day with Apple's latest activity challenge and earn a rose-themed badge and iMessage sticker! The latest Apple Watch fitness challenge is for Mother's Day. All you have to do to score a special rose-themed badge and sticker is complete a one-mile walk, run, or wheelchair workout on Mother's Day, May 14, 2017. You can use the built-in Apple Watch Workouts app or any app that integrates into the workout system, including Nike+, Strava, even Pokémon Go for Apple Watch. While the Thanksgiving challenge was sadly U.S. only, like the subsequent New Year's challenge and Earth Day challenge, were international. Mother's Day, despite being celebrated on the same day in numerous countries around the world, is perplexingly and frustratingly U.S. only. Hopefully Apple will come to understand the international appeal of these challenges and go back to making the available to all customers, everywhere. For those in the U.S., simply start your workout on Monther's day local time, complete at least a mile, and the badge and sticker — as well as the health benefits! — will be yours. If you're looking for extra ways to have fun while you get fit: Take your mom, or that person who's always been like a mom to you, along for the workout. Make it a photo walk or wheel and take great pictures and make new memories along the way. See if you can write out the word "MOM" using the built-in route-tracker or your favorite workout app, especially Strava because yes, that's a thing. Now that the weather's nice up north again, play some Pokémon Go while you're out and about, using the Pokémon Go workout app. If there's a charity walk-a-thon or run in your area, consider joining in. That way you not only get a badge but you help raise awareness and money for a great cause. It doesn't matter how you do it, though, just that you do it. Our bodies feed on motion and the more we feed it, the better it does and the longer it lasts. And once you're done, Tweet your pics to @iMore or Instagram @iMoreGrams so we can share in your success!

It also makes it possible for you to download music, movies and TV shows you purchase on iTunes across all your devices. You can sync email, calendar, notes and reminders, too. Apple is always working on new features and trying to make it perfect for every user. Though there aren't many rumors floating around about what's in store for the future of iCloud, there are some interesting possibilities on the horizon. Here's what we know so far! Will Apple increase the free iCloud storage tier? You can upgrade from 5GB of free iCloud storage for as low as $0.99 USD to 50GB, but it's getting harder to stick with the free tier, and some other cloud storage companies offer more storage for free. Though we haven't heard anything official, it's possible that Apple is looking into offering a little more storage in the free tier, doubling it to 10GB. Additionally, the 2TB iCloud storage plan is twice the price of 1TB. Since Apple is always giving us more reasons to store our documents and data in iCloud, it would make it easier on our pocketbooks if the 2TB tier came with a little discount. Maybe $14.99? Will Apple add iTunes content to iCloud.com? There have long been rumors that Apple is working on making it possible for you to start watching a movie or listening to a song on one device, and then finishing it on another via Handoff. It would be even more awesome if Apple made it possible for you to access all your music and movies via iTunes on the web. Apple could add iTunes to its icloud.com access from any computer or device. All our movies, tv shows, and music are already in iCloud anyway. Is Siri getting contextual learning with iCloud and iMessage? There was recently an unverified rumor that Apple is working on boosting iCloud and iMessage support for Siri. According to The Verifier, Siri will supposedly be able to learn some of the things you do on a regular basis and suggest actions based on where you are and the time of day. International Business Times notes, The digital assistant will reportedly be able to carry out current voice commands and it will also be able to learn a user's usage habits and offer different action options based on the context of content, similar to Samsung's Bixby, the report said. If this rumor proves to be true, it sounds like Siri might be able provide suggestions, like texting your partner when you leave to come home from work, or recommend an Apple Music playlist when you arrive a the gym. Are there any other rumored features coming to iCloud? There isn't a whole lot of information swirling around about big changes to iCloud this year, but there is a chance Apple will let us selectively save iCloud desktop and documents folders instead of only being able to save all or nothing. There are plenty of things we'd like to see come to iCloud, but we won't know anything for sure until we hear it straight from Apple.

No it isn't. I have MP3s I have downloaded from various places that are not on iTunes. I cannot get AlienHand, Naden, or various other artists on iTunes. The same for anything you make yourself, comes from a local band, or an obscure live version of a song (Apple Music eats those too): all things that serious music fans may have. Now if they can expand Wi-Fi Sync to iCloud, that would be, but all our music is not on iCloud. 0 1 sec ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Newsletter Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Apple says that the investment will focus on Corning's facility in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. From Apple: Apple today announced Corning Incorporated will receive $200 million from Apple's new Advanced Manufacturing Fund as part of the company's commitment to foster innovation among American manufacturers. The investment will support Corning's R&D, capital equipment needs and state-of-the-art glass processing. Corning's 65-year-old Harrodsburg facility has been integral to the 10-year collaboration between these two innovative companies and will be the focus of Apple's investment. Apple's announcement notes that Corning works to recapture material from used glass in order to help reduce waste, another area of interest for Apple. Recently announced, Apple's Advanced Manufacturing Fund will see the company invest at least $1 billion with U.S.-based companies. The aim is to help these companies create jobs for skilled workers and boost manufacturing in the United States.

Unfortunately, most of the information out there is misleading and/or wrong and has been from the beginning. Furthermore, not only does this misinformation not help, but it’s clouding the serious, legitimate problem. It’s not GPS nor only about Apple Let’s get two things out of the way first: the data in question is not GPS and Apple isn’t the only party collecting this data. The data consists of cell tower and Wi-Fi hotspot locations, not GPS coordinates. Second, it’s been shown that Google collects this data from Android devices, and anyone else in both the mapping and smartphone businesses should be doing the same. If they aren’t, they’ll be out of one of those businesses soon. Remember these points for later. Taking it from the top… The firestorm ignited when Pete Warden and Alasdair Allan announced their discovery of a file called “consolidated.db” that contains a list of locations and time stamps. This file is located on iOS devices and their backup files located on users’ computers. They further demonstrated how the data can be used to generate a map of these locations. By itself, that would have been a fine piece of work. However, Allan and Warden peppered their report with insinuation and omissions that led others to draw their own conclusions as to the purpose of this data, which led to the current atmosphere of controversy and misinformation. Perhaps worst of all, they failed to give credit where it’s due. Taking it from the REAL top… Turns out the existence of the consolidated.db file was published in a book called “iOS Forensic Analysis for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch” in December 2010. This revelation comes from Alex Levinson, a contributor to that book, who posted this photo of page 335 for proof. Levinson further points out that he and Sean Morrissey, the book’s primary author, demonstrated their own utility similar (and superior) to Warden and Allan’s mapping application in February 2011 at the DoD Cyber Crimes Conference in Washington, DC. Levinson explains that while the consolidated.db file is new in iOS 4, the data is not. It previously existed in a file called “h-cells.plist”. Levinson also shares his thoughts on how the data is used in both that post and a new one. However, to really understand its purpose, I think we need to go back even further. They’re not spying; you are. While it’s been claimed that we don’t know how Apple will use this location data, we actually do. In a letter to Congress in June of last year addressing a change in their privacy policy, Apple explained that they are building and using their own location database, in addition to and instead of Google and Skyhook Wireless databases. What exactly is in this database? Cell tower and Wi-Fi hotspot locations, same as in the consolidated.db file. See, technically, what’s in that consolidated.db isn’t a list of places your iPhone has been. It’s actually a list of cell tower and Wi-Fi hotspots your iPhone has detected. Your iPhone’s location can be inferred from that list (with varying degrees of accuracy), but that’s not its purpose. Think of a spy tracking a terrorist cell. As the cell moves, the spy reports back to his or her agency with their locations. The spy does not report his or her own location, but since he or she is maintaining proximity to the terrorists, a rough estimate can be inferred from the data. That’s what’s happening with the location data in consolidated.db. Apple isn’t spying on you; you’re spying for Apple. I didn’t sign up to be a spy Well, you might have. When you set up your iOS device, Apple asks if you want to help improve its products by sending anonymous diagnostic and usage information. As indicated earlier in Apple’s letter to Congress about the change in the privacy policy, this includes location-based data. It’s important to note this agreement is separate from any agreement to use location-based services. LBS is about using your location, while the relevant part of this agreement is about acquiring the location of cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots. Your location can be inferred from the data if and only if someone knows it’s from your device. Collected anonymously, it’s a map of tower and hotspot locations. Aggregated with data from other users, it loses relevance to any one user. The data collection really has nothing to do with tracking users. So what’s the point? The reason Apple is collecting this data is to build and maintain their own assisted GPS database. Using the known locations of cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots, assisted GPS estimates your location without a GPS lock and cuts the time required to get a lock. When Apple launched the iPhone, they signed a deal with Skyhook Wireless to provide this service. But in April 2010 with iOS 3.2, Apple started using their own database, and they’re not alone. Location-based services are building to be big business with a big pot of money attached to it. Research by Microsoft indicates the LBS market is growing rapidly. Skyhook Wireless went after Google for millions in a lawsuit in which they claim Google pressured Motorola into breaking their contract for LBS with Skyhook. Any company that offers location-based services needs a dynamic database of waypoints, such as cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots, in order to accurately tell mobile users where they are, particularly in urban environments where GPS is restricted. One option is to license that database from Skyhook Wireless. Another is to build your own, such as Apple and Google are known to be doing. I guarantee Microsoft, RIM and others who offer mobile location-based services are either already following Apple’s and Google’s lead or figuring their own method of leveraging their user base to do so. If they’re not, they’re watching someone else eat their piece of the LBS pie. So if everyone does it, what’s the problem? While folks wrestle with an imaginary privacy scare grown through misinformation, there remains a legitimate privacy concern that is going mostly unnoticed. It concerns the lack of clear disclosure that this data was being collected and the risks involved in collecting it. Apple asks for diagnostic and usage information about your iPhone, which is fair enough to do. However, I don’t believe tracking tower and hotspot locations counts. That information is external to the device, not part of it. If Apple wanted to collect data on my iPhone’s location, I would consider that a fair part of that agreement. But instead they’re using my iPhone to collect tower and hotspot locations, and that’s not right. I only signed up to give info about my device, not those belonging to other people. The lack of transparency on that point is a serious problem, far more legitimate than the paranoia circulating. To be clear, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with reporting tower and hotspot locations back to Apple. I just think this falls outside the range of “diagnostic and usage information about your iPhone”. It’s about property that belongs to others. Therefore, it requires separate, specific permission, as well as a detailed explanation of the risk involved. By retrieving the data anonymously, Apple protects your privacy from Apple. What they don’t do is protect your privacy from anyone else. If someone else extracts this data from your iDevice or the backup file on your computer, that person is the one violating your privacy, beginning the moment they access your device without consent. True, it’s not Apple’s fault someone else accessed your data, but they should have told users this data was there to be taken. As far as privacy invasion goes, this data is trivial compared to the call and message history, contacts, and appointments on most people’s phones. The difference is users know that data is there and can erase it. Can’t do that with a file you don’t know about. The bottom line is, there is a problem, a serious one, but it’s not the one most people think. Apple is not spying on you; you’re spying for Apple. Same goes for Google and Android users. And if you think Microsoft, RIM, Nokia, and the wireless carriers are not or will not be deploying their own spies, well, you must not think very highly of their ability to compete. It’s not about who’s doing it, but how, and Apple isn’t doing it the way they should. Congress dropped the ball when the issue was raised last year (probably because they didn’t understand the problem), and all the fearmongering and misinformation this time only obscures the real problem. Update 4/27/11: Nailed it. 10 Responses 04/27/2011 Quentin Dewolf Reply the interesting part is that the cell phone companies have a very well known log of all phone calls and what towers they used and even how strong the connection was. Both for coverage review and for billing. If you are so worried about being tracked then you must not use a phone, credit card, or computer as all of these are tracked in logs and always have been. 04/28/2011 iPhone Spy Reply i was recently looking through the history on my computer, when i closed the window, went back in and the history was suddenly GONE. It was not after midnight at the usual automatic history erase time. My question.. My bf has an iphone. Is it possible he is controlling and spying on the computer with the VNSea App???? 04/29/2011 Web Hosting Reviews Reply Excellent statement!!.. 04/29/2011 gEEk Reply What if you looked at it not as reporting about other people’s devices but on the environment your iPhone is in? Would you see it breaking the terms of “diagnostic and usage information” if the iPhone collected and reported the temperature of the environment it was used in? How is that different from collecting and reporting transmitters in the iPhones environment? 04/29/2011 Sumocat Reply That would be fine if that was how it worked, but it’s not. The system reports on the locations of hotspots and towers, which are private property, not by the wireless signals, which is publicly broadcast. Using the temperature analogy, it’s like collecting the temps of nearby buildings instead of the temp of the ambient air. That said, the idea of environment reporting is valid. Skyhook Wireless does recognize location by wireless signal environment. Their wardriving system for hotspot recognition captures location data by identifying wireless signal patterns, not by locating hotspots. (This is enhanced by voluntary registration of Wi-Fi hotspots, which does capture locations, but again, that’s voluntary.) Possibly hotspot locations could be inferred from that data, just as devices use it to infer their own locations, but it’s not captured directly. I do not know if the data capture system they employ through mobile devices works the same way. 04/30/2011 gEEk Reply Aren’t they specifically reporting the location of the phone when it detects a wireless signal, not the location of the transmitter itself (which I don’t think the phone has any way of knowing for a non-voluntarily registered hotspot). The wireless routers are private property. The radio signals they broadcast are not private property. As long as the phone doesn’t connect to the network (other than reading the SSID) I don’t see how private property has been violated. I think a more appropriate temperature-based analogy would be building a database of indoor locations and outdoor locations based on the ambient temperature of the air at the phone. This only involves the phone observing its immediate environment, which is where the radio signal is located. Another useful analog is Google Maps StreetView. Although not crowdsourced (making it more similar to Skyhook) it is a database resulting from recording of electromagnetic waves in a public environment that have reflected or been transmitted from private property correlated to locations. Moreover the images have plenty of identifying marks visible on this private property including address placards and business signs. 04/30/2011 Sumocat Reply “Aren’t they specifically reporting the location of the phone when it detects a wireless signal…” — That is also happening but the database in question is of hotspot and tower locations. That data is being generated somehow. They could be using the phone locations to reverse triangulate the hotspot and tower locations. Using the spy analogy, that would be akin to reporting on one’s own coordinates and proximity to the terrorists. Less precise but still spying. 09/07/2011 abir ahmed Reply I do not understand why Apple should do this tracking business?! It will draw a bad impact on the market. tommy@ Restaurants around me 06/20/2012 myspy-online Reply Hi, there is a program up to a meter indicating the location of the smartphone and there is an opportunity to see the sms, mms, picture, email and more… 05/12/2017 joan Reply i hire a hacker once on http://underworlddwellers.esy.es to help me spy on my husbands iphone so i could monitor his whatsapp activities and it worked perfectly i still have the spyware server i dont know how he did it Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

They determined that the wearable, when paired with neural network algorithms, is 97 percent accurate in detecting paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common type of heart rhythm problem. With further work, the Watch and other wearables might help prevent strokes in susceptible patients. Apple has been pitching the Watch with ResearchKit to doctors and scientists as a serious health tool. Cardiogram initiated the research last year to figure out whether it could detect the signs of a stroke, a quarter of which are caused by irregular heartbeats.

Engineers used those subjects to train a deep learning system to discern patients with arrhythmia versus those with normal heartbeats.© Cardiogram They then tested the system on 51 patients scheduled for a procedure to restore normal heart rhythms. All used an Apple Watch and 12-lead ECG prior to and after the procedure. The AI algorithm and Apple Watch were able to identify AF with 97 percent accuracy and 98 percent sensitivity, according to the study. The research holds a lot of promise, especially since the algorithm is just an early version and could easily be made more accurate. Two-thirds of strokes can be prevented with cheap drugs, but the onset of one is difficult to detect -- so doctors could save the lives of susceptible patients with just an off-the-shelf wearable. The team plans to tweak the algorithm and validate it against "gold standard" EKG tests. It will then incorporate it into the Cardiogram app, and "investigate the ability to detect health conditions beyond atrial fibrillation," Cardiogram says. With that test a success, it could also push more hospitals and research groups onto ResearchKit and other wearables for patient monitoring and research.

Login Search Apple Invests $200 Million in iPhone Screen Glass Maker Corning May 12, 2017, 01:02:38 PM EDT By Janko Roettgers, Variety Shutterstock photo Apple has invested $200 million in Kentucky-based glass manufacturer Corning , which has been supplying the company with glass for iPhone screens and other products for years. The investment is part of a $1 billion commitment to U.S. manufacturing. Most of the $200 million will be invested in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, where Corning has been manufacturing glass for the past 65 years. Corning will spend the money on research and development and glass manufacturing equipment, according to a news release. Corning has been supplying Apple with glass ever since the introduction of the iPhone 10 years ago. The company is best known for a product it calls Gorilla Glass, which has been optimized to be damage and scratch resistant. In addition to the iPhone, Gorilla Glass is also being used for phones from Samsung, HTC, and Huawei, among others. Apple announced earlier this month that it would invest $1 billion into U.S.-based manufacturing. That announcement can be linked to efforts to sway the new administration as it looks to reform the tax code, which could allow Apple to repatriate some of its foreign profits. Apple at the time also claimed that it was responsible for 2 million U.S. jobs. The company itself employs around 80,000 people in the U.S., ranging from store clerks to software developers. Apple also counted 1.5 million jobs "created and supported by the app store" as part of those 2 million. However, at least 75 percent of those app developers also work on Android apps, according to the study referenced by Apple.

Sure, it can keep an eye on large changes in your heart rate, making it reasonably good at telling you how long you worked out for. But anything more than that is a bit outside its capabilities. Recommended for You An Algorithm Summarizes Lengthy Text Surprisingly Well A Single Autonomous Car Has a Huge Impact on Alleviating Traffic The World’s Largest Electric Vehicle Maker Hits a Speed Bump Mind-Reading Algorithms Reconstruct What You’re Seeing Using Brain-Scan Data This Mega-Sensor Makes the Whole Room Smart Which is why it’s interesting that on Thursday, a study emerged suggesting that readings from an Apple Watch can indeed be used to detect atrial fibrillation—a worrisome heart condition that, if the sufferer isn’t hooked up to a heart monitor, often produces no noticeable symptoms. The the trick behind the study, which was conducted by Greg Marcus and a team of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, and a startup called Cardiogram, was that it used artificially intelligent software to tease information out of the Apple Watch data. To do that, the researchers gathered data from 166 people who met several criteria: they wore an Apple Watch, were known to have atrial fibrillation, and also had an AliveCor device, an FDA-approved electrocardiogram (EKG) that hooks up to an iPhone (the company is also developing a watch band that can be worn with an Apple Watch, but that hasn’t yet received FDA approval). Each of these users generated two streams of data simultaneously: one from the watch, and one from the EKG that was capable of accurately showing when someone’s heart was fibrillating. By training a machine-learning algorithm on the two streams, the team reasoned the algorithm could teach itself to identify what fibrillation looked like in the less precise Apple Watch data. A test on readings from about 50 people seemed to bear that out—the algorithm was 97 percent accurate in flagging fibrillation. It’s an encouraging result, but far too small a sample size to declare success. The study also suffered from some limitations that will hamper real-world implementation. The subjects had to remain still while taking readings, for example, because Apple has said that some movements can result in inaccurate results. Cardiogram, which has $2 million in funding from Andreessen Horowitz and others, according to BuzzFeed, is entering a field that’s been riddled with problems. Just ask the people behind Quanttus, a startup that got a hard lesson in how difficult it is to get accurate biological readings from wrist-worn devices. It’s also a field that has competition. Alphabet’s health-tech company, Verily, is building what it calls a “Cardiac and Activity Monitor” that likely has an EKG on it, among other capabilities—part of a large-scale health study that Verily is conducting. When we spotted it last year, it appeared to be built specifically for tracking people’s health, rather than consumer use. It was plain-looking, and had an e-ink display that preserved battery life, so people could wear it for much longer stretches than Apple’s offering, which, after all, is really just a gadget.

However, the Apple dividend yield hasn't gotten much attention because it has never gone much higher than 2% since Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) brought it back in 2012. And with Apple stock trading near all-time highs at $156.42, the current AAPL dividend yield is just 1.62% despite last week's 10.5% boost. It's still short of the Standard & Poor's 500 average yield of 1.94%. But, as with many things Apple, appearances can be deceiving. For example, the annual Apple stock dividend payout of $13.22 billion is now the highest in the world, surpassing the $12.77 billion of Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM). And while Apple has raised its dividend every year since 2012, the Apple stock price has simply outpaced the rate hikes. Yield decreases as a stock price rises, and AAPL stock is up nearly 90% over the past five years. The modest Apple dividend yield has disguised just how much value the Apple dividend has added for those who hold AAPL stock. While the stock alone is up just over 100% over the past five years, the total return – which includes the dividend payments – is nearly 170%. As impressive as that is, it merely foreshadows what Apple investors can expect in the future. That's because even though it's the biggest on the planet by dollar value, Apple's dividend has tons of headroom… Why the Apple Dividend Yield Has a Lot of Room to Grow The 10.5% Apple stock dividend increase brings it to $0.63 a share per quarter, or $2.52 per share annually. But because Apple is such a cash machine, that payout is far below what Apple can afford. The company's earnings per share are expected to be close to $9 for fiscal 2017 (which closes Sept. 30 for Apple). Don't Miss: You Can Profit from the Same Trend That Drove U.S. Stocks Up 1,262% in the 80s and 90s That means Apple's payout ratio – the proportion of earnings paid out in dividends – is only 28.1%. If you look at the table below of the 10 companies in the S&P 500 with the highest annual dividend payouts, you'll see that Apple stands apart from its peers in both categories. Company (Ticker) Payout Ratio Dividend Yield Annual Dividend Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) 28.1% 1.65% $13.22 billion Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) 78% 3.73% $12.77 billion Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) 51.7% 2.27% $12.06 billion AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) 67.1% 5.09% $12.04 billion Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) 60.9% 4.95% $9.41 billion Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) 47.4% 2.73% $9.12 billion General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) 58.9% 3.31% $8.38 billion Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) 95.4% 4.06% $8.18 billion Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) 50% 3.82% $7.62 billion JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) 30% 2.30% $7.14 billion The 10 Largest Annual Dividends in the S&P 500 Most of the other top dividend-paying companies have payout ratios in the 50% to 60% range, almost twice Apple's. In other words, the Apple stock dividend could double and still leave the company plenty of room for future increases. Since 2012, Apple has raised its dividend each year. But more importantly, the company has promised to continue doing so – most recently in Apple's Q2 earnings conference call last week. Income investors love stocks that consistently raise dividends every year, which will broaden Apple's appeal even further. And given what we know about Apple's business and commitment to returning cash to shareholders, the only questions about future Apple stock dividends are how large they'll be and how much they'll amplify total returns. In addition to the low payout ratio, here are three reasons growth of the Apple stock dividend will accelerate in the years ahead… What to Expect from the Apple Stock Dividend Join the conversation.

Apple recently launched a site that helps you learn to take better photos with your iPhone, whether you're snapping at night, a close-up or a selfie.More Apple launched a new site Friday with 16 videos dedicated to teaching iPhone 7 owners how to take better photos. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has always marketed how great its phones are at taking photos, often showing off shots snapped by professional photographers, but it hasn't yet provided such useful and simple tutorials to users. The videos are simple, allowing everyone to better understand what they can do with the phones that are already in their pocket. The topics include "how to shoot a great portrait" and "how to shoot without a flash," which can actually be difficult if you're taking pictures in low light. Other tutorials teach you how to use functions you might not have known existed on an iPhone — like how to snap a photo while also filming, and how to set a selfie timer. To snap better photos from a unique angle, for example, Apple recommends tilting the iPhone 7, looking straight up, or getting low on a subject before snapping the picture. To shoot action photos, Apple says you should hold the shutter button down, allowing it to shoot multiple frames per second, and then view your gallery of burst photos and select the favorite one. The videos are about 30 seconds each and walk users through each step, making recommendations on how photographers might want to position themselves, or the subject, and what functions to use on the iPhone 7. The tutorial page is useful, but it's also another indication that Apple wants to continue to support the products its customers buy — something its competitors have yet to do. While the page is focused on the iPhone 7, owners of older iPhones should find plenty of value here, too. Here's the page.

(AP) — Apple says it will invest $200 million in a rural Kentucky facility that it credits with rescuing the company's signature smartphone from a design flaw that would have led to scratched screens. The California-based company announced Friday it would give the money to Corning Inc. to use at its facility in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. Apple and Corning first teamed up 10 years ago when former Apple CEO Steve Jobs ordered the plastic screen on the company's first iPhone to be replaced with a scratch-resistant glass just a few months before the product was to launch. Since then, Corning says it has made 552 million square feet (51 million square meters) of its Gorilla Glass product for iPhones and iPads, or roughly enough glass to cover 10,000 football fields. "All of that work happened right here in Harrodsburg, and Apple owes you a big thank you," Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams told workers at Corning's Harrodsburg facility on Friday. Williams said the money is the first of $1 billion the company plans to spend on US-based companies from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund. "It's only fitting that the first commitment from that fund be for Corning and specifically for Harrodsburg, where so much of our history is," Williams said. Williams was joined by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Corning CEO Wendell Weeks. Officials from both companies did not say if the money would bring more jobs to Kentucky, or if the state offered any tax incentives for the investment. Corning officials said the money would be used "to sustain" the 400 employees who work in Harrodsburg. Officials said the partnership between Apple and Corning has produced 1,000 jobs in the United States. It was the fourth major business investment in Kentucky this year. In January, Amazon announced it would spend $1.4 billion to build a worldwide cargo hub in northern Kentucky. Toyota has said it will spend $1.3 billion in its Georgetown plant that produces its flagship Camry sedan. And last month, Braidy Industries announced it would spend $1.3 billion to build an aluminum plant in eastern Kentucky. State taxpayers could pay nearly $100 million in tax incentives to those companies over the next 10 years if they meet projected goals with spending and job creation.

The California-based company announced Friday it would give the money to Corning Inc. to use at its facility in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. Apple and Corning first teamed up 10 years ago when former Apple CEO Steve Jobs ordered the plastic screen on the company’s first iPhone to be replaced with a scratch-resistant glass just a few months before the product was to launch. Since then, Corning says it has made 552 million square feet (51 million square meters) of its Gorilla Glass product for iPhones and iPads, or roughly enough glass to cover 10,000 football fields. “All of that work happened right here in Harrodsburg, and Apple owes you a big thank you,” Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams told workers at Corning’s Harrodsburg facility on Friday. Williams said the money is the first of $1 billion the company plans to spend on US-based companies from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund. “It’s only fitting that the first commitment from that fund be for Corning and specifically for Harrodsburg, where so much of our history is,” Williams said. Williams was joined by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Corning CEO Wendell Weeks. Officials from both companies did not say if the money would bring more jobs to Kentucky, or if the state offered any tax incentives for the investment. Corning officials said the money would be used “to sustain” the 400 employees who work in Harrodsburg. Officials said the partnership between Apple and Corning has produced 1,000 jobs in the United States. It was the fourth major business investment in Kentucky this year. In January, Amazon announced it would spend $1.4 billion to build a worldwide cargo hub in northern Kentucky. Toyota has said it will spend $1.3 billion in its Georgetown plant that produces its flagship Camry sedan. And last month, Braidy Industries announced it would spend $1.3 billion to build an aluminum plant in eastern Kentucky. State taxpayers could pay nearly $100 million in tax incentives to those companies over the next 10 years if they meet projected goals with spending and job creation.

According to a study conducted through the University of California San Francisco, Apple Watches have successfully detected abnormal heart rhythms when paired with an AI-based algorithm and an app, Cardiogram. The 6,158 participants in the study were recruited through Cardiogram. Most participants had a normal EKG reading, but 200 individuals claimed to have been diagnosed with an abnormal heartbeat. Engineers and researchers then used the Apple watch app and technology to develop a system for detecting the abnormal heart rhythms. Researchers are now using the success of the study to begin exploring the possibility of early stroke detection. Disease-detecting smartwatches are perfect examples of smart technology being utilized for life-altering or saving practices, not just entertainment or convenience.

X Apple invests $200m in iPhone glassmaker Corning Investment will help develop the group’s facility in Kentucky about 11 hours ago Tim Bradshaw Corning, a public company with a market capitalisation of $26 billion, has provided the iPhone’s glass screen for the last decade. Photograph: EPA         Apple made the first investment from its new $1 billion US “advanced manufacturing” fund into the multibillion-dollar company that has provided the iPhone’s glass screen for the last decade.  Corning, a public company with a market capitalisation of $26 billion that was founded more than 165 years ago, will receive $200 million from Apple to help develop its facility in Harrodsburg, Kentucky.   Gorilla Glass, Corning’s hardened material that was put into production to supply the first iPhone in 2007, is manufactured in Kentucky, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, according to the company’s website. Corning also has facilities around the world including Mexico and China, as well as the US. Apple’s investment will be focused on research and development and capital investments in Kentucky, in the hopes of benefiting its own products while also making Corning more competitive in a global market.  Corning’s shares were up less than 1 per cent on Friday morning at $29.04, while Apple stock hit a new record intraday high at $156.42, giving it a valuation of $817 billion.  Apple’s pledge to invest at least $1 billion to stimulate American jobs and manufacturing, which was announced last week, came after criticism from President Donald Trump during last year’s election campaign that it was so reliant on overseas manufacturing for the iPhone and its other products.  - (Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017)       Topics: Trump Apple Corning China Japan Kentucky Mexico San Francisco(US) South Korea Taiwan United States Read More Tesla begins taking orders for new solar roof Microsoft profits up 27% on demand for cloud services Intel’s profits in first quarter rise near 45% Oracle’s Irish arm sinks to pre-tax loss as revenues stay steady Beware of web services whose real product is you Revolut signals banking revolution with 30,000 Irish customers Fintech firm CurrencyFair targets SMEs with revamped offering  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy IMF warns help-to-buy scheme adding to property pressures Work Four ways to employ self-explaining in your own learning Gaelic Football Jim McGuinness: The Border rivalries are needed, especially in Leinster Innovation Sugru raises over €2m in crowdfunding campaign Sponsored Truth serum: how serums won a place in our beauty regimes The Story of Home: A dream of tiny houses The Story of Home: Light and shade ‘I’m still taking it 20 years on and loving it’ Latest Business Housing crisis deepens as supply dries up 07:49 Sugru raises over €2m in crowdfunding campaign 07:00 Property group and State to invest €100m in commercial property 06:16 Blow for Israel’s democracy and Eurovision hopes 05:43 Weak EU economies need to turn around, warns fund manager 05:41 How to?

Buzzfeed reports that Apple will be announcing at the WWDC that the Amazon Video app will be coming to Apple TV. While Amazon has provided a limited capability streaming app for iOS devices, it has never submitted an app for Apple TV. On the surface, Amazon’s reluctance seems to stem from the fact that Apple TV is a direct competitor to its Fire TV box. This view is reinforced by the fact that the retailing giant removed Apple’s device from its inventory. However, there is more to it than Apple being a competitor to Fire TV and the Prime streaming service. After all, Amazon still sells Roku Express, which would seem is a direct competitor to Fire as well. So why the beef with Apple. In 2015, Amazon announced that it would stop selling Apple TVs, and Google’s Chromecast as well, because those devices did not “interact well with Prime Video” and created “customer confusion.” ”Over the last three years, Prime Video has become an important part of Prime. It's important that the streaming media players we sell interact well with Prime Video in order to avoid customer confusion. Roku, Xbox, PlayStation and Fire TV are excellent choices.” If one is to believe Amazon’s statement, then one would have to assume that the ban falling right on the heels of the release of Fire TV was just a coincidence. There is more to the story, although it is veiled and secretive. While Apple TV and Fire TV are competitive devices in one respect, they are also complementary in another. Amazon is a provider of streaming content; Apple only started producing original TV content earlier this year according to Macworld. Therefore, Apple TV requires apps from other vendors such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon to provide enough content to justify buying the $150-200 box. On the one hand, this puts Amazon in an advantageous position over Apple in that it has something that the fruit company needs. On the other hand, Apple has something that Amazon wants which is its viewing customers. So really, the whole dispute may have been over who provides more value and which company is going to fork over money for the privilege of using the other’s service or product. There is no direct evidence of this assertion. However, some circumstantial evidence indicates that this might be the case. Recode reported, “At last year’s [2016] Code Conference, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos wouldn’t go into detail about the dispute between the two companies, telling the audience that ‘private business discussions should remain private.’” Additionally, at the same conference, Bezos gave a long winded excuse for the ban that just sounded weak, but also mentioned “business terms” without going into detail. “We want our player, our Prime Video player, to be on the device, and we want it to be on the device with acceptable business terms. And so, you can always get the player on the device; the question is can you do so with acceptable business terms. And if you can’t, then we don't want to sell it to our customers, because they’re going to be buying it thinking they can watch Prime Video and then they’re going to be disappointed. And they’re going to return it.” What were those “acceptable business terms?” We may never know for sure, but 99 percent of business discussions involve money, so it is not unreasonable to conclude that is exactly what Amazon and Apple were talking about in private. It is worth noting that Apple does take a 30 percent commission from apps on the App Store. While the Amazon Prime streaming app is typically free to download and install, buying or renting content through the app would fall under Apple’s terms regarding the commission. This is likely why the iOS versions of Amazon's Prime application will not allow users to rent or make purchases of content through the app. What we know for sure is that Apple and Amazon have been in talks since before the 2016 Code Conference. Now we hear that Apple will announce the Amazon Prime streaming app to the app store later this year. Amazon will also be lifting its ban on the Apple TV before the end of Q3 2017 and start allowing third-party vendors to sell it on their storefronts again. So apparently the two companies have come to an agreement. We may never know Apple’s conditions in that agreement, but a good bet would be that it is either waiving or reducing its 30 percent fee for Amazon so that they can allow renting and purchasing from within the app. Related Reads HBO content now available on Amazon's Prime Instant Video service Amazon Prime Air sidelined by the FAA Non-Prime members now pay more in Amazon's physical bookstores Post a comment 45 interactions Share this article: Now Read This… Massive ransomware attack spreads across the globe Terminator 2 movie (almost) entirely recreated in GTA V Volta V Wooden PC: An heirloom gaming machine Popular 46 comments Crowdfunded Star Citizen raises over $148 million, but release date has been postponed indefinitely 23 comments Nvidia unveils its first Volta GPU, the Tesla V100 31 comments Russian blogger given 3.5-year suspended jail sentence for playing Pokémon Go in church 11 comments Massive ransomware attack spreads across the globe Terminator 2 movie (almost) entirely recreated in GTA V Add New Comment You need to be a member to leave a comment.

While it’s not uncommon at all to see nice price cuts on the Apple Watch Series 1 or even Apple’s original Watch models, the new Apple Watch Series 2 rarely sees any price drops. And when it does, they’re typically nominal at best. There’s nothing nominal about the big Apple Watch Series 2 sale currently taking place on the Best Buy website, however, and you still have time to score a big discount on 34 different Apple Watch Series 2 models. Don't Miss: Reliable leaker claims to reveal iPhone 8 launch timing, and it’s not what we’re expecting Whether you want a 42mm Apple Watch Series 2 in space gray aluminum with a black sport band, a 38mm Apple Watch Series 2 Nike+ edition with a black/volt band, a space black Apple Watch Series 2 model with the Milanese Loop bracelet, or an entry-level gold aluminum Apple Watch Series 2 Sport model with a midnight blue strap, Best Buy has got you covered. You’ll save $70 on each of those four Apple Watch models, along with 30 other Watch and strap combinations currently available on Best Buy’s site. Thanks to this huge sale, Apple’s newest Apple Watch Series 2 models now start at just $299 for the 38mm models and $329 for the larger 42mm models. Those prices are absolutely amazing considering we’re talking about the best smartwatches in the industry here. In fact, some might argue that they’re the only smartwatches that are even worth considering at this point, though Samsung has really stepped things up lately with its Tizen watches. We’re not here to talk about Tizen, though. We’re here to point you to the best sale there has ever been on the Apple Watch Series 2. You’ll find the aforementioned models along with the rest of the Watches included in Best Buy’s big sale right here on the retailer’s website.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple’s iPhone 8 will be the most expensive iPhone the world has ever seen Yoni Heisler BGR News May 12, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Everyone’s excited by the new form factor and advanced features the iPhone 8 will bring to the table, but a new research note from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs (obtained by Business Insider) relays that upgrading to Apple’s next-gen iPhone won’t come cheap. Amid conflicting reports regarding the iPhone 8 price point, Jankowski writes that the base level iPhone 8 will cost $1,000. Notably, this jibes with previous rumors we’ve seen regarding Apple’s pricing plans. Don't Miss: Reliable leaker claims to reveal iPhone 8 launch timing, and it’s not what we’re expecting The bump up in price might seem jarring at first glance, yet it doesn’t seem unreasonable given the device’s advanced new design, larger display, and slew of new features. Accordingly, the BOM for the iPhone 8 will be significantly higher than any iPhone model released to date. Specifically, the entry-level iPhone 8 with 128GB of storage is said to cost $1,000 while a model with 256GB will cost $1,099. This makes the entry-level iPhone 8 upwards of $130 more expensive than Apple’s top of the line iPhone 7 Plus. Breaking down the considerable increase in iPhone 8 components, Jankowski’s research note relays the 5.8-inch OLED display alone will add $35 to the asking price. 5.8″OLED screen (adds $35) No bezel, all screen 3D sensing (adds $20) Better, faster NAND/DRAM memory (adds $16 to $29) Capacity starting at 128GB A11 processor No home button Biometric authentication All in all, the price bump we’ll see with the iPhone 8 doesn’t seem too outrageous. As is typical from Apple, the iPhone 8 will be a premium device geared for consumers willing to pay more to get more. Further, the iPhone 8 price point isn’t that far removed from Apple’s top of the line iPhone 7 Plus, a device that proved to be far more popular with consumers than even Apple anticipated. To this point, Jankowski adds that Apple’s larger-screened iPhone models have become increasingly popular with each successive iPhone release, which is to say that demand for premium iPhone models is growing. As for the other two devices in Apple’s 2017 iPhone lineup — the iPhone 7s and the iPhone 7s Plus — Jankowski believes that the devices will be priced at $649 and $769, respectively. All of that said, if the iPhone 8 design features a Touch ID sensor embedded into the display itself, I’m sure that consumers will flock to the device in droves, the $1,000 sticker price notwithstanding. Further, seeing as how the current iPhone design has grown somewhat stale, the prospect of a brand new iPhone model with an edge to edge OLED display will undoubtedly attract current iPhone owners who might not otherwise have even been in the market for an upgrade. Of course, the looming question surrounding Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 is whether or not Apple can actually release the highly anticipated device by September.

The next iOS release won’t be iOS 11. Instead, it’ll be a new version of iOS 10.3 dubbed iOS 10.3.2. iOS 10.3.2 will likely be a small maintenance update with bug fixes and security patches. An iOS 10.3.2 release date isn’t confirmed but we expect it to arrive before WWDC 2017 and the unveiling of Apple’s next major operating system change. Apple isn’t talking about the iOS 11 update just yet but that should change in a few short weeks when it takes the stage on June 5th to address developers and consumers around the world. As we push deeper into the year we’re starting to get more iOS 11 questions from friends, family and readers. They want to know when iOS 11 is coming out and they also want to know what they can expect from iOS 11 in terms of features. While some of these questions are difficult to answer in April, there are a few basics we can provide you with. Here are a few things you can count on when it comes to Apple and the iOS 11 release for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. Exclusive iOS 11 Features Count on some exclusive iOS 11 features for the new iPhone and for newer versions of the iPhone, iPad, and iPod. iPhone 7 Plus Portrait Mode. You can count on an exclusive feature or two for the iPhone 7s/iPhone 8. The iPhone 7 Plus features a Portrait mode, also known as Bokeh mode, that isn’t available on any other iOS devices. The iPhone 7 also features an updated Taptic Engine that provides feedback when you interact with certain parts of iOS 10. When the Notification Center drops, you’ll feel a thud. The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 Plus version of iOS arrived with the ability to shoot Live Photos. Live Photos move when pressed thanks to 3D Touch. Most of the time, these features are exclusive because a device doesn’t possess the necessary hardware. For instance, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s don’t feature 3D Touch. Here are a few other examples: The iPhone 5 iOS 10 update also failed to bring burst photo mode, slow-motion video mode, and voicemail transcription. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus iOS 10 updates didn’t come with the Raise to Wake featured on the iPhone SE, iPhone 6s and iPhone 7. Nothing is confirmed but we’re already hearing about some of the iOS 11 features that could help Apple sell the iPhone 7s/iPhone 8. The company is reportedly planning substantial upgrades to Siri, iOS’ personal assistant. There’s also chatter about improved Haptic feedback. The specifics don’t matter at this point. What it boils down to is this. If you own or are planning to buy a newer version of the iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, your iOS 11 update will be more robust than your friend with an older piece of hardware. Look for the first iOS 11 features to be confirmed on June 5th during the company’s WWDC 2017 keynote. iOS 11 Beta You can count on an iOS 11 beta release ahead of the official iOS 11 release date. The WWDC 2017 developer conference is slated to kickoff on June 5th in San Jose, California. Apple’s confirmed a keynote address for 10AM Pacific and it’s during that keynote where we’ll likely see Apple confirm the early version of iOS 11. If you’re looking to try iOS 11 early, you’ll want to circle June 5th on the calendar. We expect iOS 11 beta to be released, for developers, shortly after the keynote. Apple will almost certainly release two versions of the iOS 11 beta: One for developers and one for the free Beta Software Program. Best case scenario is Apple releases both on the same day. Worst case scenario is Apple waits a few weeks before releasing the free version of the iOS 11 beta. Developers must pay an annual $99 fee to become a developer and gain access to the beta. Missing Devices You can count on some devices being left behind on iOS 10. Last year, it was iPhone 4s, iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad mini, and iPod touch 5th-gen users who were left behind on iOS 9.3.5. This year, we expect at three two devices to be held back on iOS 10. Nothing is confirmed but we’re confident Apple will keep the iPhone 5, the iPhone 5c and the iPad 4 on iOS 10. We also wouldn’t be surprised if the (recently discontinued) iPad mini 2 made the list as well. We could see a few others join the list but if you own an iPhone 5, iPhone 5c or an iPad 4, start preparing for life on iOS 10. We’ll probably find out for sure in early June when Apple releases the first version of the iOS 11 beta. iOS 11 Release Date You can count on an official iOS 11 release in the fall alongside the company’s new iPhone. Thus far, iPhone 7s/iPhone 8 release date rumors point to another release in and around the month of September. This has been standard practice for several years now and there’s no reason to believe Apple will stray from protocol. Apple iPhone/iOS release protocol calls for a fall media event where the company confirms the new iPhone and an iOS release date. Typically, the company releases new iOS software for older devices a few days ahead of the new iPhone release date. Look for the iOS 11 beta to stretch over several months with a final iOS 11 release date in September or October at the latest. New Emojis & 64-Bit There are loads of iOS 11 rumors out there but one thing we expect the release to deliver are new emojis for the iOS keyboard.   Shocked Face with Exploding Head is a candidate for Unicode 10. Unicode 10 is scheduled to be released in mid-2017 which means iOS 11 could be the update that brings us Face With Hand Over Mouth, Merperson, Curling Stone, T-Rex, Orange Heart, and Person in Steamy Room, and many more. You can get a feel for what the new emoji characters will look like on the iOS keyboard in the walkthrough video below. If we use the iOS 10 and Unicode 9.0 release as a guide, look for an iOS 11.x update to bring these emojis to your iPhone and iPad. iOS 10.2 delivered Unicode 9.0 emojis to iPhone and iPad in December. You can also count on one major shift. Apple will reportedly drop 32-bit support with the iOS 11 release later this year. This isn’t confirmed but all signs point to the change occurring with the release of Apple’s next major operating system. Devs: I'm hearing very clearly iOS 11 won't have 32bit app support at all. Update legacy apps now if you want them to survive past September — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) April 8, 2017 The first real warning signs appeared in the iOS 10.3 beta when a popup started notifying developers their apps needed to be updated. Here is what the popup in iOS 10.3 beta 1 relayed to iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad users: This app will not work with future versions of iOS. The developer of this app needs to update it to improve its compatibility. If this change pans out, it means that legacy applications will no longer function, at all. Given that this will be a huge change for developers, we expect Apple to detail the change on stage during its annual developer event in June. iOS 11 Beta: 7 Things to Expect & 5 Things Not To Expect an iOS 11 Beta Announcement on June 5   1 / 12 If Apple decides to release an iOS 11 beta, and we're very confident it will, you can expect the company to confirm the release during its WWDC 2017 keynote on June 5th.  WWDC 2017 kicks off in early June though it will do so from a new location. Apple's taking its annual developer conference to San Jose this year. On June 5th, we expect Tim Cook and other Apple executives to address developers in attendance and the thousands of Apple enthusiasts and consumers watching from home.  The company hasn't said what it will be announcing but that keynote will probably be the launch pad for the iOS 11 update and its beta.  If Apple sticks to its protocol, you can expect an iOS 11 beta release shortly after the conclusion of the WWDC 2017 keynote on June 5th.    1 / 12 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

By JenniferBooton Reporter Apple Inc. is trading at all-time highs, but there are hopes for the stock to go substantially higher, if consumers are willing to spend substantially more for an iPhone. Goldman Sachs increased its 12-month price target on Apple AAPL, +1.40%  stock Friday because of the expectation that Apple will introduce a superpremium smartphone with a $1,000 price tag. Goldman analyst Simona Jankowski reiterated a buy rating in a note to clients, and pushed his target to $170 from $164, which implies upside of more than 10% from Thursday’s closing price and would give Apple a market capitalization of nearly $900 billion. Earlier this month after notching a number of share-price records, Apple became the first company with a market cap that exceeds $800 billion. Jankowski projected Apple will unveil its first $1,000 iPhone in September and that it could help rocket average selling prices and gross margins and “drive meaningful upside” to the stock. Apple is expected to unveil three new phones in September, Jankowski wrote, including a new ultra-premium-tier phone with a 5.8-inch screen that would feature an OLED screen and new advanced features, such as 3-D sensing to enable augmented-reality applications. The other phones would be of two screen sizes and more closely align with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Jankowski expects the more expensive iPhone to contribute 58% of total sales between the three phones in the quarters following their September launch. He pointed to higher demand for bigger-screen phones as evidence of this trend. In recent quarters, Apple has boasted record demand for the plus-size versions of its phones. See Also: What does Apple’s $300 billion in cash really mean? Apple has said anticipation and media hype leading up to the iPhone 8 launch has been a factor in iPhone sales performing below expectations. Last year, Apple recorded its first-ever annual decline in iPhone sales. While the flagship product returned to growth in Apple’s first fiscal quarter, it missed expectations against last quarter, which Apple CEO Tim Cook blamed on a “pause” in demand leading up to the launch of the iPhone 8. That anticipation has many analysts forecasting a “super cycle” for the coming iPhone launch. “The next iPhone is shaping up to be the most anticipated iPhone since the launch of the iPhone 6 in September 2014,” said Jankowski. Read: Apple expected to ship 250 million iPhones in 2018 However, industry tracker IDC said last month that smartphone shipments have been fueled by lower-priced phones in China and not refreshed premium phones. While Apple’s share of the world-wide smartphone market fell slightly to 14.9% from 15.4% year-over-year in the first quarter, Huawei’s share increased to 9.8% from 8.4%, OPPOs increased to 7.4% from 5.9% and Vivo’s climbed to 5.2% from 4.4%. While a pause in demand in anticipation of the iPhone 8 launch may be partially to blame, IDC expects more affordable phones to continue to drive demand. “Although we have seen an abundance of premium redesigned flagships that just entered the market, moving forward, we still expect most of the growth to come from more affordable models in a variety of markets” IDC analyst Anthony Scarsella said. The pricier phones—which Goldman believes will include a 128 gigabyte model priced at $999 and a 256 gigabyte model for $1,099—led the brokerage to increase its estimate on the average price consumers will pay for iPhones. Goldman’s fiscal 2018 average selling price, or ASP, estimate increased to $763, compared with the FactSet consensus estimate of $675. In some models, Goldman has ASPs soaring as high as $797. Last year, Apple’s iPhone ASPs were $645. In 2015, the year of the iPhone 6 super cycle, ASPs hit $671. Read Also: Apple issues $7 billion in corporate bonds Goldman increased its fiscal 2018 earnings per share estimate to $11.50 from $11, compared with the Street view of $10.42. The higher expectations are the direct result of higher ASPs, as opposed to expectations that Apple will sell more units. Goldman expects Apple to sell 243 million units in 2018, in-line with the FactSet estimate of 242 million. Shares of Apple gained 1.4% to $156.10 Friday, yet another closing record high. The stock has increased 18.2% in the past three months and 72.8% in the past year, vastly outperforming both the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.11%  and S&P 500 index SPX, -0.15% The Dow, a 30-member index that includes Apple, has gained 3% and 18%, respectively.

By Richard Chang 05/12/17 Leslie Fisher. Photo by Nick Didlick. Leslie Fisher has turned her name and talents into her own successful ed tech consulting company. The director of Fisher Technologies, Inc., and the creator and operator of lesliefisher.com, the former K–12 systems engineer for Apple now consults, trains and presents to K–12 educators for a living. Fisher, who lives in San Dimas, CA, will present at seven different sessions during the ISTE (International Society for Technology in Education) conference, June 25-28, in San Antonio, TX. Her presentations include “Dive into Google Classroom,” “G is for Gadgets,” “Google Cardboard AKA Virtual Reality,” and “Apps, Tools, Methods and Practices for Leading With Technology.” THE Journal caught up with Fisher, who keeps a busy schedule flying to and from ed tech conferences and sharing her passion for education technology, cool gadgets and fun, engaging things teachers can do with tech in their classrooms. THE Journal: What are your thoughts on education technology today, and what do you talk about when you go to ed tech conferences? Leslie Fisher: We’ve always been surrounded by technology. If you look back, people were looking at what early technology could do in the classroom. We’ve always had it. It’s always going to change. In one hour, I can talk about the tools you can use tomorrow. The tools teachers could deploy in their classrooms that enhance student engagement, and even teacher engagement. I’ll talk about something that I think could make a good, quick, positive impact. I just talked to a conference today in Ohio. And I recently talked to another group — they need virtual reality. I got to smaller conferences and do consulting, even professional development. THE Journal: How would you describe ISTE to someone who’s not that familiar with the conference? Fisher: What I would say is, ISTE is the closest thing you can get to an education technology rock concert. You’re not going to get any more choices than ISTE. There are tons of presenters, educators and vendors. It’s a big deal. And for the attendee, you are not drinking through a fire hose, you’re drinking through a fire hydrant. It’s a great chance to hang out with other educators and learn what they’re doing. It’s a wonderful opportunity for varied learning. THE Journal: Chromebooks have been steadily gaining popularity in the K–12 classroom. Which do you prefer — the iPad or the Chromebook? Fisher: If I had a dollar every time people asked me that. It’s a tough one for me. I prefer a keyboard, and I prefer something affordable. It’s true that younger hands work best with the iPad. But it gets down to the individual learner. With the Chromebook, be prepared to put something on there that makes it more dynamic. On the creativity side, it’s a little lacking with the Chromebook. But Adobe recently made some of their apps available to the Chromebook, so those are definitely worth checking out. THE Journal: What do you think about virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) in the classroom? Is the cost point for VR prohibitive? « previous 1 2 next » Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

By JenniferBooton Reporter Apple Inc. is trading at all-time highs, but there are hopes for the stock to go substantially higher, if consumers are willing to spend substantially more for an iPhone. Goldman Sachs increased its 12-month price target on Apple AAPL, +1.40%  stock Friday because of the expectation that Apple will introduce a superpremium smartphone with a $1,000 price tag. Goldman analyst Simona Jankowski reiterated a buy rating in a note to clients, and pushed his target to $170 from $164, which implies upside of more than 10% from Thursday’s closing price and would give Apple a market capitalization of nearly $900 billion. Earlier this month after notching a number of share-price records, Apple became the first company with a market cap that exceeds $800 billion. Jankowski projected Apple will unveil its first $1,000 iPhone in September and that it could help rocket average selling prices and gross margins and “drive meaningful upside” to the stock. Apple is expected to unveil three new phones in September, Jankowski wrote, including a new ultra-premium-tier phone with a 5.8-inch screen that would feature an OLED screen and new advanced features, such as 3-D sensing to enable augmented-reality applications. The other phones would be of two screen sizes and more closely align with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Jankowski expects the more expensive iPhone to contribute 58% of total sales between the three phones in the quarters following their September launch. He pointed to higher demand for bigger-screen phones as evidence of this trend. In recent quarters, Apple has boasted record demand for the plus-size versions of its phones. See Also: What does Apple’s $300 billion in cash really mean? Apple has said anticipation and media hype leading up to the iPhone 8 launch has been a factor in iPhone sales performing below expectations. Last year, Apple recorded its first-ever annual decline in iPhone sales. While the flagship product returned to growth in Apple’s first fiscal quarter, it missed expectations against last quarter, which Apple CEO Tim Cook blamed on a “pause” in demand leading up to the launch of the iPhone 8. That anticipation has many analysts forecasting a “super cycle” for the coming iPhone launch. “The next iPhone is shaping up to be the most anticipated iPhone since the launch of the iPhone 6 in September 2014,” said Jankowski. Read: Apple expected to ship 250 million iPhones in 2018 However, industry tracker IDC said last month that smartphone shipments have been fueled by lower-priced phones in China and not refreshed premium phones. While Apple’s share of the world-wide smartphone market fell slightly to 14.9% from 15.4% year-over-year in the first quarter, Huawei’s share increased to 9.8% from 8.4%, OPPOs increased to 7.4% from 5.9% and Vivo’s climbed to 5.2% from 4.4%. While a pause in demand in anticipation of the iPhone 8 launch may be partially to blame, IDC expects more affordable phones to continue to drive demand. “Although we have seen an abundance of premium redesigned flagships that just entered the market, moving forward, we still expect most of the growth to come from more affordable models in a variety of markets” IDC analyst Anthony Scarsella said. The pricier phones—which Goldman believes will include a 128 gigabyte model priced at $999 and a 256 gigabyte model for $1,099—led the brokerage to increase its estimate on the average price consumers will pay for iPhones. Goldman’s fiscal 2018 average selling price, or ASP, estimate increased to $763, compared with the FactSet consensus estimate of $675. In some models, Goldman has ASPs soaring as high as $797. Last year, Apple’s iPhone ASPs were $645. In 2015, the year of the iPhone 6 super cycle, ASPs hit $671. Read Also: Apple issues $7 billion in corporate bonds Goldman increased its fiscal 2018 earnings per share estimate to $11.50 from $11, compared with the Street view of $10.42. The higher expectations are the direct result of higher ASPs, as opposed to expectations that Apple will sell more units. Goldman expects Apple to sell 243 million units in 2018, in-line with the FactSet estimate of 242 million. Shares of Apple gained 1.4% to $156.10 Friday, yet another closing record high. The stock has increased 18.2% in the past three months and 72.8% in the past year, vastly outperforming both the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.11%  and S&P 500 index SPX, -0.15% The Dow, a 30-member index that includes Apple, has gained 3% and 18%, respectively.

Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White is the most bullish Apple analyst, and he loves Snap, too. He says in a note distributed to clients on Friday that the Snapchat parent company presents an "excellent buying opportunity" at its current price and that the company "reminds us of Apple in its younger days." White has the highest price target for Apple at $202, out of 52 analysts covering the stock, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. White's price target for Apple would value the company at over $1 trillion. So comparing the disappearing chat app company to Apple is a huge compliment for White. Snap has had a rough few days after its first earnings report missed Wall Street expectations and sent the stock crashing more than 20%. Here's why Snap reminds White of Apple: We view Snap as an original in the camera App world and this authenticity will be tough for competitors to successfully replicate in the eyes of millennials. Moreover, Snap fosters a culture of creativity and a management team that holds the long-term vision necessary to nurture the innovation engine that we believe can create long-lasting value for shareholders. Snap is also pushing into fashionable hardware, a space that Apple practically owns. One of Snap's biggest challenges at the moment is slowing user growth. When Spiegel was asked about it during Snap's earnings call, Spiegel responded by talking about his product philosophy. Spiegel said: So, ultimately, I think the way that we try to help people understand how we think about daily active user growth is really through the lens of creativity and creation, because we built our entire business on creation. ... So the last thing I will say is that the way we talk about DAU growth in our Company really as it pertains to creativity is about removing friction from the creative process. So we've talked about Lenses which I think are a great product. And the reason why I think that that prompted such an explosion in creativity is because it really lowered the barrier to creation on our service, because people enjoy looking like a puppy and things like that. Drexel gives Snap a "buy" rating and a price target of $30. This article was originally published on Business Insider. Copyright 2017.

The investment comes from Apple’s recently announced Advanced Manufacturing Fund, and is going to be used for Corning research and development, capital equipment needs, and state-of-the-art glass processing. Gorilla Glass: All your iPhone are belong to us Apple announced Friday morning that Corning is the first recipient of money from its $1 billion Advanced Manufacturing Fund. The fund was unveiled earlier this month by CEO Tim Cook in an interview on Jim Cramer’s Mad Money show. Apple aims to use its money to help foster advanced manufacturing processes in the United States. That could translate into more jobs, but it will also help progress in automated manufacturing techniques, which is a fancy way of saying “robotics.” The money Apple is investing into Corning is earmarked for the company’s Harrodsburg facility. Apple COO Jeff Williams said, This partnership started 10 years ago with the very first iPhone, and today every customer that buys an iPhone or iPad anywhere in the world touches glass that was developed in America. We’re extremely proud of our collaboration over the years and we are investing further with Corning who has such a rich legacy of innovative manufacturing practices. Apple uses Corning’s Gorilla Glass on for the display surface on the iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and some Apple Watch models. This investment strengthens that relationship and telegraphs Apple’s plan to stick with Gorilla Glass for the long term. Corning CEO Wendell P. Weeks says the decade-long partnership with Apple has helped create nearly 1,000 U.S. jobs in the company, including 400 in Harrodsburg. Those are numbers Apple no doubt likes considering the company has been bragging about helping create 2 million jobs across the United States. Workers in Corning’s Harrodsburg facility Investing in Corning, and the other U.S.-based companies that are sure to follow, is a double win for Apple. The iPhone and iPad maker gets the good publicity that goes along with supporting U.S. companies, and it ultimately gets better components for its own products. It also means Apple doesn’t have any plans to move from Gorilla Glass to sapphire glass for iPhone displays. Hopefully it also means we’ll soon have displays that don’t shatter or crack when you drop your iPhone on its corners.

Until those problems are resolved, sapphire glass will be a niche technology. May 13, 2017 at 12:40 EDT AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Smartwatches and wearable technology have been around for some time now but only recently have they begun to gain mass adoption. Companies like FitBit and Apple have brought these technologies to the edge of what is possible to do with something that you wear on your wrist. Gartner estimate that the wearables market will reach an estimated value of $72 billion by 2020, almost twice the $39 billion it’s valued at today. Smartwatches alone will account for $20 billion of this, compared to $13 billion today. One of the main driving forces behind this spending is the Apple watch, a smartwatch capable of integrating with the rest of the range of apple smart products including iPads, iPhones, and Macs. The Apple watch was announced in 2014 and went on sale in the spring of 2015, and quickly became the fastest selling wearable on the market. The initial release of the Apple Watch saw 4.2 million sales in the second fiscal quarter of 2015. Since then Apple has released an updated version known as the Apple Watch Second Generation which comes in two tiers, the Apple Watch Series 2 and the Apple Watch Series 1. Both have upgraded spec but are otherwise identical in design to the first generation. Do you have an Apple Watch and want to make the most of it or are you thinking of getting one but don’t know what to do with it? Take a look a CBR’s helpful guide on how to use the Apple Watch and you’ll be set up and ready to go in no time. First of all you will need to set up the device, just like with most Apple products this is a relatively straightforward and painless process though will need an iPhone 5S or higher. Simply check that your Bluetooth is on and ensure you’re connected to WiFi and open the Apple Watch app on your phone, if the watch is one it should show what looks like static on the screen. Now you need to hold the watch in view of the phones camera and the phone will decode the static and link the two devices. Now all you need to do is follow the onscreen prompts to configure your language, watch orientation, and a passcode. Once you’re linked with your Apple ID you’re good to go and its time to get to the fun stuff. Next up, you’re going to want to install some fun apps to get the most out of your new wrist mounted computer. Watch OS3 comes with several native apps but in order to truly find what applies to you you’ll have to look around the store. It’s also worth noting that you should probably uncheck automatic install of apps, as you probably don’t want every single app on your phone to download itself onto your watch. One of the more popular uses for the watch is to measure your fitness, this is another easy step and simply requires you to input your health information and you can start tracking your activity. You can even set reminders for yourself if you feel that you haven’t had the exercise you require. The watch is also great for paying contactlessly, rather than getting your phone or wallet out of your pocket every time you want to pay for something. Once your card details are installed on the watch then Apple Pay can be used the same way it always is. Be careful you don’t scan it accidentally though! The watch will also receive notifications that come through to your other devices so you can ensure that you never miss that important phone call or text. The Apple Watch is a relatively straightforward product and much like other Apple products the simplicity and ease of access are a big selling point. These are just the basics of course, and if you want to experiment and find out what else the watch can do then start tinkering and you’ll open up a new world of possibilities.     Tags Apple Apple Watch How to watch os Previous ArticleBBC, Atos agree £560m digital transformation deal Next ArticleNHS held to ransom as massive cyber attack hits hospitals nationwide Most read Hackers turn political saboteurs as cracks in the cloud signal a new frontier for cyber crime Ellie Burns 26th April 2017 IBM brings cognitive assistant to factory for cutting down inspection time Byomakesh Biswal 25th April 2017 Oracle, the newest tech startup?

The investment will support Corning’s R&D, capital equipment needs and state-of-the-art glass processing. Corning's 65-year-old Harrodsburg facility has been integral to the 10-year collaboration between these two innovative companies and will be the focus of Apple’s investment.  “Corning is a great example of a supplier that has continued to innovate and they are one of Apple's long-standing suppliers,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s COO. “This partnership started 10 years ago with the very first iPhone, and today every customer that buys an iPhone or iPad anywhere in the world touches glass that was developed in America,” Williams added. “We’re extremely proud of our collaboration over the years and we are investing further with Corning who has such a rich legacy of innovative manufacturing practices.” Popular Now Tool and Dying: Auto Leaders, From Ford to FCA, Brainstorm on Saving the Shops that Sustain Them Supply Chain & Logistics: Top 5 Warehouse Challenges and How to Overcome Them Theory of Constraints Tapped to Accelerate BP's Gulf of Mexico Cleanup “Corning’s longstanding relationship with Apple has not only led to significant glass innovations that have enabled new capabilities for consumers, it has also helped create nearly 1,000 American jobs and allowed us to continue growing and expanding in the U.S.,” said Wendell P. Weeks, CEO. “This investment will ensure our plant in Harrodsburg remains a global center of excellence for glass technology.” Since the inception of Gorilla Glass in 2007, the partnership between Apple and Corning has created and sustained nearly 1,000 U.S. jobs across Corning’s R&D, manufacturing and commercial functions, including over 400 in Harrodsburg. Corning has procured enough renewable energy to cover all of its Apple manufacturing in the US. >Apple has committed to investing at least $1 billion with U.S.-based companies as part of the fund, which is designed to foster innovative production and highly skilled jobs that will help lay the foundation for a new era of technology-driven manufacturing in the U.S In the U.S., Apple now supports 2 million jobs across all 50 states, including 450,000 jobs attributable to Apple’s spend and investment with U.S.-based suppliers. Last year alone, Apple spent over $50 billion with more than 9,000 domestic suppliers and manufacturers.  Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

This is Sy. It's been a busy week for health care news between some high-profile setbacks for certain major cancer drug makers, high-profile victories for others, the confirmation of a new FDA chief, health care merger drama, and a slew of public health reports about the opioid epidemic, hepatitis C, and U.S. life expectancy. One big headline item: the new CDC report finding that the opioid and heroin addiction crisis is fueling a massive surge in hepatitis C cases. Read on for the day's news, and enjoy your weekend. Sy Mukherjee @the_sy_guy sayak.mukherjee@fortune.com DIGITAL HEALTH Apple Watch may be eating into Fitbit sales. Fitness tracker firms like Fitbit and Xiaomi may be losing some sales to the Apple Watch, according to a new analysis by Canalys. The drop isn't devastating, but it is significant: while fitness tracker sales slumped 7% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same timeframe one year ago, smartwatches boomed by 25%, the vast majority of which were Apple Watches. For its part, Fitbit is also planning its own smartwatch to try and take on Apple's products. (Wareable) How will Trump's cybersecurity order affect health care? President Trump on Thursday signed a wide-ranging executive order on cybersecurity. And while it mostly centers on law enforcement and the national security apparatus, it could also affect the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)—a department that has been roundly criticized for its cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Trump's order could prove challenging for HHS: it requires agencies to submit risk management reports within 90 days and to hew to the National Institute of Standards and Technology's framework on cybersecurity. (FierceHealthcare) INDICATIONS U.K. investor Neil Woodford announces "Glaxit" from GlaxoSmithKline. Neil Woodford, the major U.K. fund manager who has waged a multi-year effort to convince pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline to split up its business units, has had enough. Woodford is out with a blog post titled "GLAXIT" announcing that he's abandoning his fund's position in GSK. "I have long believed that value could be created for the company’s shareholders if it split itself into separate, more specialised business units. The sum of the parts is significantly greater than the whole," he wrote, adding that "investing in Glaxo has been a frustrating experience." Recently installed CEO Emma Walmsley has defended the company's decision to remain unified, citing consistency that comes from the consumer health unit. Another advance in lung cancer, this time from AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca shares soared a whopping 9% in early Friday trading as the company announced unexpectedly strong results from a late-stage trial of its immunotherapy drug Imfinzi in lung cancer patients. The early and promising results could actually give the firm an advantage over rivals like Roche and Merck, the latter of which scored an important FDA approval for its immunotherapy drug Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy for advanced lung cancer this week. "In theory, this could open a market opportunity of $1.75 billion to $3.5 billion (or more) for the drug, which is not included in our current forecasts," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a research note. (Reuters) THE BIG PICTURE Hepatitis C cases are rising sharply because of the opioid epidemic. The ongoing American opioid and heroin epidemic is fueling another scourge: hepatitis C infections, according to a new Centers for Disease Control (CDC) report. New hep C cases tripled between 2010 and 2015, with young people fueling the surge. The report authors point the finger directly at shared needle use between heroin users and identified which states—and policies—are keeping the infections in check. "State laws that increase access to syringe exchange programs and clean needles and syringes, and policies that facilitate access to HCV treatment through state Medicaid programs can reduce HCV transmission risk," said the study authors. The states that are following those protocols? Massachusetts, New Mexico, and Washington state.

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Wearables The Apple Watch Series 2 has never been as cheap as it is right now on Best Buy Zach Epstein @zacharye May 12th, 2017 at 1:26 PM Share Tweet Earlier this week, we told you that the sale so many of you had been waiting for had finally arrived. While it’s not uncommon at all to see nice price cuts on the Apple Watch Series 1 or even Apple’s original Watch models, the new Apple Watch Series 2 rarely sees any price drops. And when it does, they’re typically nominal at best. There’s nothing nominal about the big Apple Watch Series 2 sale currently taking place on the Best Buy website, however, and you still have time to score a big discount on 34 different Apple Watch Series 2 models. Don't Miss: Reliable leaker claims to reveal iPhone 8 launch timing, and it’s not what we’re expecting Whether you want a 42mm Apple Watch Series 2 in space gray aluminum with a black sport band, a 38mm Apple Watch Series 2 Nike+ edition with a black/volt band, a space black Apple Watch Series 2 model with the Milanese Loop bracelet, or an entry-level gold aluminum Apple Watch Series 2 Sport model with a midnight blue strap, Best Buy has got you covered. You’ll save $70 on each of those four Apple Watch models, along with 30 other Watch and strap combinations currently available on Best Buy’s site. Thanks to this huge sale, Apple’s newest Apple Watch Series 2 models now start at just $299 for the 38mm models and $329 for the larger 42mm models. Those prices are absolutely amazing considering we’re talking about the best smartwatches in the industry here. In fact, some might argue that they’re the only smartwatches that are even worth considering at this point, though Samsung has really stepped things up lately with its Tizen watches. We’re not here to talk about Tizen, though. We’re here to point you to the best sale there has ever been on the Apple Watch Series 2. You’ll find the aforementioned models along with the rest of the Watches included in Best Buy’s big sale right here on the retailer’s website.

Graham May 12, 2017 Adrienne LaFrance May 12, 2017 Technology Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size The explosive legal battle between Uber and Waymo is headed for a public showdown. A federal judge in California denied Uber’s request for private arbitration, according to court documents filed on Thursday night. Uber’s request for arbitration would have allowed the ride-sharing giant to defend itself behind closed doors. Instead, Uber will have to go to trial to answer Waymo’s accusations that an Uber engineer stole its self-driving car designs. Uber called the judge’s decision “unfortunate” in a statement emailed to The Atlantic. “We remain confident in our case and welcome the chance to talk about our independently developed technology [in] any forum,” an Uber spokesperson wrote. The case is poised to be among the biggest legal fights over intellectual property so far this century. The technology at stake is at the center of the emerging and potentially highly lucrative self-driving car industry, and the key players are two of the world’s top tech companies. (Waymo is the self-driving car company that originated at Google, and was rebranded in 2016.) Not only will there be a trial, but Judge William Alsup also referred the case to the U.S. Attorney for investigation of possible theft of trade secrets, a move that suggests the Uber engineer at the center of the case could face criminal charges. Waymo is accusing the former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski of secretly stealing a trove of files from the company before he quit to start his own self-driving truck startup. Uber acquired that company, Otto, for $680 million shortly after it launched last year. Levandowski has exercised his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, which played a role in Alsup’s decision to deny arbitration. “Even though he is not a defendant here,” Alsup wrote in the court filings, “Levandowski’s assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege has obstructed and continues to obstruct both discovery and defendants’ ability to construct a complete narrative as to the fate of Waymo’s purloined files. As a practical matter, it is hard to imagine how consolidating proceedings as to Levandowski and defendants, whether here or in arbitration, could alleviate these difficulties.” * * * Self-driving cars are arguably the great technological promise of the 21st century. They are in that rare class of technology that might actually change the world. And not just in the way everyone in Silicon Valley talks about changing the world—but really, fundamentally change it. So much so that their dramatic life-saving potential is almost secondary to the other economic, cultural, and aesthetic transformations they would cause. Those who aren’t able to drive themselves today—people who are blind, for example—would be granted a new level of transportation freedom. Mass adoption of self-driving cars would create and destroy entire industries, alter the way people work and move through cities, and change the way those cities are designed and connected. To build the technology that prompts all this change is to be in an enormous position of power. That’s why the race to bring self-driving cars to the masses is so intense. It’s also what makes this particular competition echo other transformative moments in technological history—going all the way back to the Railroad Wars, at least. (Incidentally, there was a different kind of driverless car back then.) “The Wright brothers jump into my brain immediately,” John Leonard, an engineering professor at M.I.T., told me in 2015. “But maybe it’s kind of like a decentralized space race. Like Sputnik, but between the traditional car companies and their suppliers versus tech companies and their startups.” There’s a lot of money at stake. A lot a lot. We’re talking billions of dollars per year in potential profits, maybe more. All of the major players know this. For some companies, it is a fight to the death. Each one intends to come out on top. * * * Waymo (formerly Google) When Google (now Alphabet) launched its self-driving car program in 2009, it had no competition to speak of. Culturally, the idea of a self-driving car was novel. Even the flying cars in 20th-century science fiction tended to have human drivers. So when Google began to go public with information about the project, in 2010, its level of seriousness about the effort wasn’t yet clear. “Some of these things will turn out to be wildly successful, and others will just fade away,” one investor told The Los Angeles Times at the time, referring to Google’s suite of unusual projects. Wild success still isn’t a guarantee, but it’s now obvious that Google—which has since spun off its self-driving-car unit into a company called Waymo—is deeply invested in the work it’s doing. Its test fleet is now on public roads in four states: California (since 2009), Texas (2015), Arizona (2016), and Washington state (2016). “We’ve self-driven more than 2 million miles mostly on city streets,” Waymo says on its website. “That’s the equivalent of over 300 years of human driving experience, considering the hours we’ve spent on the road. This builds on the 1 billion miles we’ve driven in simulation in just 2016.” All that driving and a near-perfect safety record—a reputation that has undoubtedly helped buoy the public’s perception of self-driving vehicles. Uber Uber catapulted itself into the self-driving car space in truly Uberesque fashion: With a scandal. In 2015, the ride-sharing giant hired an entire department away from Carnegie Mellon—some 40 robotics experts and engineers, including several top experts in autonomous-driving systems. Since then, Uber’s commitment to the future of self-driving cars has only intensified. (Consider the business incentive of eliminating human drivers, who get a cut of every ride they give.) In 2016, Uber began testing its self-driving vehicles on public roads in Pittsburgh, it doubled down its own proprietary street-mapping system—ostensibly to reduce reliance on competitors like Google and Apple—and poached Google’s top mapping expert to do so. Uber also acquired a fledgling self-driving truck company, Otto, for $680 million in 2016—but more on that in a minute. Given the talents of its employees and how much venture capital the company has on hand, Uber has emerged as a formidable player in the emerging self-driving car industry. Yet Uber continues to be plagued by controversies. After a dustup over Uber’s refusal to seek permits for its self-driving cars in California in late 2016, the company changed course and applied for a state testing permit. In February 2017, Waymo filed a federal lawsuit claiming a former Google engineer had stolen self-driving car secrets before leaving the company to found Otto. Waymo says that when Uber acquired Otto, the former Google engineer used the information he allegedly stole to help build a circuit board for Uber’s self-driving car systems. The legal battle is poised to be the first major intellectual-property fight of the driverless car era. Apple Apple remains one of the more mysterious and intriguing players in the self-driving car game. On one hand, Apple can’t afford not to pursue this emerging technology if many of its major competitors are. On the other, Apple? A car company? To be fair, though, that’s what people said of Google in 2010. And not all self-driving car companies will manufacturer vehicles themselves; some will just lease out the self-driving software for auto manufacturers. For years it was rumored that Apple had a secret self-driving car project in the works. But there were also reports that the project— which according to The Wall Street Journal had hundreds of dedicated employees as of 2016—was plagued by organizational and managerial problems. It wasn’t until December of 2016 that Apple officially made it known that it is working in some capacity on self-driving cars, via a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. “The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation,” wrote Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, “and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” Other than that, however, Apple has remained characteristically secretive about its work. Tesla Tesla wants to bring driverless cars to the market, but it has a markedly different approach than Waymo, which may be its biggest competition. While Google wants to build fully self-driving systems from the ground-up, its critics say this will take too long. In the interest of making everybody safer sooner, Tesla is adding increasingly autonomous systems, bit by bit, to its existing high-end vehicles. But there’s a big debate over which method—fully autonomous versus incrementally autonomous—is actually better for public safety. Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, has said it’s “morally reprehensible” to wait until the technology is advanced enough for complete autonomy. Yet critics of the Tesla approach say that here-and-there semi-autonomous features may present too much of a gray area for today’s drivers to safely navigate. The marketing around Autopilot, the current Tesla system, has arguably left people with the impression that Tesla’s cars are more autonomous than they really are. The very name, Autopilot, certainly suggests it might be okay for human drivers to stop paying attention. This concern came up again in the spring of 2016, when a Tesla driver who was using the Autopilot feature died in a car accident. At the time, Tesla’s Autopilot feature was in beta mode, meaning the drivers who tested it on public roads were required to acknowledge any risks involved. Federal investigators eventually concluded Autopilot was not to blame in the fatal crash. Tesla already claims on its website that all of its vehicles “have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver.” This is, at best, slightly misleading. Tesla’s hardware may eventually allow for a “full self-driving” system, but it’s definitely not there yet. Whichever approach to building a truly autonomous car is the right one, Tesla’s sense of urgency is helping to quicken the pace of competition in the driverless-car space. Legacy automakers Like Tesla, several legacy automakers are announcing their entry into the driverless-car space with incremental assisted-driving systems. This approach makes sense for them: After all, they already manufacture cars that people can go and buy—something that isn’t true of Apple, Google, or Uber—which means one of the best hopes for legacy carmakers to stay in business is to evolve now rather than attempting to play catchup later (which they may still have to do). But some legacy companies have gone farther than others. While nearly every major automaker pays lip service to the importance of developing autonomous vehicles, only some have backed up their talk with action. Volvo stands out among the more committed, for instance. In a project Volvo is calling Drive Me, the automaker will put a fleet of 100 driverless cars on the highways in Sweden. (As with tests by Google and Uber on public roads in the United States, humans will sit behind the wheel, ready to take control of the vehicles if needed.) In March 2017, Toyota unveiled its first self-driving car  prototype. The car came out of Toyota’s artificial intelligence research institute, which it launched with a $1 billion investment in 2015. Ford Motor Company has also made its efforts increasingly visible. Ford announced in August 2016 that it plans to be “mass producing vehicles capable of driving fully autonomously” by 2021. Six months later, the automaker announced a $1 billion investment in the software company Argo AI, a software startup specializing in self-driving cars. (“Ford is the majority stakeholder in Argo AI, but we are structured to operate with substantial independence,” Argo AI says.) “This work is easily the most challenging of my career, and it may be the most important, as well,” wrote Chris Brewer, the head of engineering for Ford’s Autonomous Vehicle Development department, in a blog post in March 2016. “Come to think about it, who better to develop a self-driving car than a company that’s been making cars for more than 100 years?” As with Ford and Argo AI, several other tech firms and automakers are forging partnerships. Chrysler and Google announced in May 2016 that they would team up to make a driverless minivan, while Volvo and Uber announced a partnership in August 2016. Newcomers We should expect to see more startups in the self-driving car space in the years to come. One example is Drive.ai, which launched in August 2016 and is creating deep-learning software for driverless cars. There will be others. Chris Urmson, the longtime head of Google’s driverless car initiative, left the company in August 2016, at a time when the project seemed to be shedding several key players. In December 2016, the technology-focused news website Recode reported that Urmson is starting his own self-driving-cars venture. Technology history tells us that the first company to build a technology is not always the company that ends up making a windfall. That may well be the case in the realm of autonomous vehicles. There are many uncertainties in all this, but one thing is clear: The cultural space occupied by the automobile is undergoing rapid, radical transformation. There are sure to be big winners and losers along the way. Share Tweet Comments Latest Video Why the White Working-Class Voted for Trump New data and analysis from PRRI and The Atlantic suggests that it was cultural anxiety more than economic distress that fueled white working-class support for Trump. Tynesha Foreman and Nicolas Pollock May 12, 2017 About the Author Adrienne LaFrance is a staff writer at The Atlantic, where she covers technology. She was previously an investigative reporter for Honolulu Civil Beat, Nieman Journalism Lab, and WBUR. Twitter Facebook Most Popular Presented by Bettman / Getty Five Reasons the Comey Affair Is Worse Than Watergate James Fallows A journalist who covered Nixon’s fall 45 years ago explains why the current challenge to America may be more severe—and the democratic system less capable of handling it. The tangled affair now known as Watergate began 45 years ago, before most of today’s U.S. population had even been born. (The median age of Americans is about 38, so most people in the country were born in 1979 or thereafter.) Thus for most people “Watergate” is a historical allusion—obviously negative in its implications, since it led to the only presidential resignation in American history, but probably hazy in its details. For me, Watergate is anything but hazy. I’d left graduate school and begun my first magazine job, with The Washington Monthly, in the fall of 1972, as news of the scandal emerged. Over the next two years, until Richard Nixon’s resignation, I was living in D.C. and tracking the daily progress in clue-following and domino-toppling via stories in The Washington Post and elsewhere—and then the riveting, televised Watergate hearings that made national celebrities of politicians like Senators Howard Baker and Sam Ervin, and of White House aides like Alexander Butterfield (who revealed the existence of Nixon’s secret system for taping White House conversations) and John Dean (who as White House counsel had told Nixon, “there is a cancer on the presidency”). Anyone of conscious age in that time can probably remember the jolts to national sentiment that the near-daily revelations evoked. Continue Reading Zohar Lazar How Pixar Lost Its Way Christopher Orr For 15 years, the animation studio was the best on the planet. Then Disney bought it. A well-regarded Hollywood insider recently suggested that sequels can represent “a sort of creative bankruptcy.” He was discussing Pixar, the legendary animation studio, and its avowed distaste for cheap spin-offs. More pointedly, he argued that if Pixar were only to make sequels, it would “wither and die.” Now, all kinds of industry experts say all kinds of things. But it is surely relevant that these observations were made by Ed Catmull, the president of Pixar, in his best-selling 2014 business-leadership book. Yet here comes Cars 3, rolling into a theater near you this month. You may recall that the original Cars, released back in 2006, was widely judged to be the studio’s worst film to date. Cars 2, which followed five years later, was panned as even worse. And if Cars 3 isn’t disheartening enough, two of the three Pixar films in line after it are also sequels: The Incredibles 2 and (say it isn’t so!) Toy Story 4. Continue Reading Carlos Barria / Reuters Two Dead Canaries in the Coal Mine Conor Friedersdorf If you’re not worried about FBI Director James Comey getting fired, this man might change your mind. If you're inclined to downplay the termination of FBI Director James Comey, reasoning that he was a flawed leader, or that President Trump was legally entitled to fire him, or that many of the Democrats objecting to his termination previously criticized him, or that liberals are so freaked out by the president that their latest freakout cannot be taken seriously, a civil libertarian like me is unlikely to change your mind. Long before Donald Trump decided to run for president, when Barack Obama had almost a full term left and Hillary Clinton seemed like his likeliest successor, I argued in “All the Infrastructure a Tyrant Would Need, Courtesy of Bush and Obama,” that “we're counting on having angels in office and making ourselves vulnerable to devils. Bush and Obama have built infrastructure any devil would lust after.” Continue Reading Amir Cohen / Reuters The Fidget Spinner Explains the World Ian Bogost The latest cultural trend is a perfect fossil of human life in the immediate present. There’s a new, dumb trend: the fidget spinner. It’s a toy like a top, but spun in the hand rather than on a surface. The user holds a pad at the center, and flicks one of three rounded blades. The spinner rotates around a bearing at the center. The light weight of the device and the low friction of the bearing allows it to spin for a long time. What is it for? The fidget spinner has been framed as just a toy—but also as a stress-relief tool, a classroom menace, a treatment for ADHD, and a possible salve to smartphone addiction, among other things. Fidget spinners might or might not be any of those things, but at their core they are something more, and something stranger: the perfect material metaphor for everyday life in early 2017, for good and for ill. Continue Reading Russian Foreign Ministry Photo via AP Trump's $100 Million 'Exceptions' in Russian Income David A. Graham A letter from the president’s attorneys says he has no income or loans in Russia—“with a few exceptions.” Updated on May 12 at 3:25 p.m. Donald Trump has received more than $100 million in income from Russian sources in one-time transactions over the last decade, but does not have any outstanding debts or holdings in the country, his lawyers asserted in a letter that emerged on Friday. The letter, signed by Sheri Dillon and William Nelson of the firm Morgan Lewis, states: With a few exceptions—as detailed below—your tax returns do not reflect (1) any income of any type from Russian sources, (2) any debt owed by you or [the Trump Organization] to Russian lenders or any interest paid by you or TTO to Russian lenders, (3) any equity investments by Russian persons or entities in entities controlled by your or TTO, or (4) any equity or debt investments by or or TTO in Russia entities. Continue Reading Gitte Schirrmacher / U.S. Navy / Reuters Trump Wants ‘Goddamned Steam,’ Not Digital Catapults on Aircraft Carriers Adrienne LaFrance “You have to be Albert Einstein to figure it out.” Navy officials were “blindsided” on Thursday, a spokesman told me, by President Donald Trump’s suggestion that he has convinced the Navy to abandon a long-planned digital launching system in favor of steam on its newest aircraft carrier. In a wide-ranging interview with Time magazine, Trump described his disgust with the catapult system known as Electro-Magnetic Aircraft Launch System, nicknamed EMALS, aboard the USS Gerald R. Ford. (Time has published only excerpts from the interview, not a full transcript.) The president described wanting to scrap EMALS, a key technological upgrade at the center of the multibillion-dollar carrier project, and return to steam. I said, “You don’t use steam anymore for catapult?” “No sir.” I said, “Ah, how is it working?” “Sir, not good. Not good. Doesn’t have the power. You know the steam is just brutal. You see that sucker going and steam’s going all over the place, there’s planes thrown in the air.” It sounded bad to me. Digital. They have digital. What is digital? And it’s very complicated, you have to be Albert Einstein to figure it out. And I said—and now they want to buy more aircraft carriers. I said, “What system are you going to be—” “Sir, we’re staying with digital.” I said, “No you’re not. You going to goddamned steam, the digital costs hundreds of millions of dollars more money and it’s no good.” Continue Reading Bill Hudson / AP He Was a Crook Hunter S. Thompson A scathing obituary of Richard Nixon, originally published in Rolling Stone on June 16, 1994 MEMO FROM THE NATIONAL AFFAIRS DESK DATE: MAY 1, 1994 FROM: DR. HUNTER S. THOMPSON SUBJECT: THE DEATH OF RICHARD NIXON: NOTES ON THE PASSING OF AN AMERICAN MONSTER.... HE WAS A LIAR AND A QUITTER, AND HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BURIED AT SEA.... BUT HE WAS, AFTER ALL, THE PRESIDENT. "And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird." ---Revelation 18:2 Richard Nixon is gone now, and I am poorer for it. He was the real thing -- a political monster straight out of Grendel and a very dangerous enemy. He could shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time. He lied to his friends and betrayed the trust of his family. Not even Gerald Ford, the unhappy ex-president who pardoned Nixon and kept him out of prison, was immune to the evil fallout. Ford, who believes strongly in Heaven and Hell, has told more than one of his celebrity golf partners that "I know I will go to hell, because I pardoned Richard Nixon." Continue Reading Gunpowder & Sky Hounds of Love Is One of the Most Horrifying Films of the Year David Sims The Australian kidnapping drama is not for the faint of heart. Hounds of Love opens in extreme slow motion. At first, the group of teenage girls we’re focused on seem frozen like statues, but the basketballs they’re tossing are flying through the air with a kind of hypnotic, dreadful sluggishness. It takes a few seconds to realize they’re moving, and a few more to realize we’re spying on them. The camera (whipping around this tableau with far greater speed) is from the point of view of someone in a car who’s driving past and transfixed by the girls. This skin-crawling scene feels voyeuristic without showing anything beyond a schoolyard basketball game and primes the pump for the horrifying events to follow. A well-made, restrained piece of horror cinema, Hounds of Love is nonetheless almost unwatchable—a serial-killer drama that keeps much of its murderous activity off-screen and leaves most of its details to the imagination. Of course, it’s all the more distressing as a result. The Australian director Ben Young’s debut film drew both praise and concern over its arguably exploitative content on its release in his home country last year, not least because the fictional events it depicts seem very similar to the real-life murders committed by David and Catherine Birnie. But if you can stomach its content, Hounds of Love is an undoubtedly effective work, an impressive calling card for a director sure to attract the eye of Hollywood. Continue Reading Ebru Yildiz / PolyVinyl Records The Depressingly Familiar Allegations Against PWR BTTM Spencer Kornhaber The duo were building a career by subverting rock and roll tropes—and then were accused of fulfilling one of the darkest ones. When Blink-182’s Mark Hoppus sang of being 23 and still acting like a freshman in his band’s 1999 smash “What’s My Age Again?”, he crystalized perhaps the default concern of pop punk. Rage against age—and the underlying feeling that you’re not living according to expectations—has been echoed in sneering songs from Descendents to NOFX to Paramore. In the past few years, the charismatic young pop-punk(-ish) band PWR BTTM have built a promising career by, as the professors at the New York liberal-arts college where they formed might put it, queering that sensibility. “My teenage angst will be with me well into my 30s,” PWR BTTM’s Liv Bruce brattishly deadpans for the recent single “Answer My Text,” in which the trans singer imagines the teenage girlhood she never had. “When you are queer, you’re always 19,” Ben Hopkins says with a sad little yodel on the waltzing “LOL.” In this, the band mined the subtext of pop punk and emo—two genres that, thanks to their frequent performance of male vulnerability, have long drawn the schoolyard taunt of “gay” from certain meathead masses. On both their 2015 debut Ugly Cherries and their new album Pageant, PWR BTTM sang of feeling out-of-step not because of vague nonconformism but because society literally doesn’t recognize them. Continue Reading Jim Bourg / Reuters If There Are White House Recordings, They Could Be Subpoenaed David A. Graham President Trump warned James Comey that there might be “tapes” of their conversation—and if there are, it would be illegal to destroy them. Maybe there are recordings from the Trump White House; maybe there aren’t. On the one hand, President Trump seemed to threaten the former FBI director in a tweet Friday morning, writing, “James Comey better hope that there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!” Later on Friday, Press Secretary Sean Spicer repeatedly refused to comment on the tweet and whether or not tapes exist. But if they do exist, those tapes could be subject to a subpoena demanding that the White House turn them over. That could either resolve the question and expose the inner workings of the White House, or it could spark a constitutional crisis. Former presidents famously did record goings-on in the White House, especially John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and, disastrously, Richard Nixon. It’s believed that no president since Nixon has taped in the White House, in order to avoid the problems Nixon faced—though, of course, it’s possible some did so secretly.

By Ian Paul Contributor, Macworld | May 12, 2017 11:10 AM PT Credit: Apple More like this iPad (2017) review: With a stripped-down iPad for $329, you may not need to go... Apple's new iPad lineup slashes prices, the iPad Air, and iPad mini storage... A 32GB Wi-Fi iPad is $299 today Video Can the iPhone make better AR than Facebook and Snapchat? | The iPhone Show It’s an Apple-flavored week for deals. Until June 4, Sam’s Club has the Wi-Fi-only iPad on sale. The retailer is offering the 32GB Space Gray iPad for $298 and the 128GB tablet in Gray or Silver for $358. The 128GB version is the better deal, since it’s usually $429 from Apple. That keeps $71 in your pocket—more than double the $31 you’ll save if you buy the 32GB tablet. Note that these prices are for Sam’s Club members only. These current-generation models feature the usual 9.7-inch retina display, a 64-bit A9 chip, an 8 mega-pixel camera with 1080p video, a 1.2MP FaceTime camera, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and up to 10 hours of battery life. Improvements over previous generations include a stronger backlight, a slightly larger battery, and an improved camera coprocessor. The standard fifth-generation iPad does lack extras you’ll find in the Pro line, like Apple Pencil support and True Tone, but if you’re debating between these and a Pro model, we genuinely believe that this iPad is the better option for most people.

This could mean a number of things, and chief among them is the idea that Apple could finally allow an Amazon Prime Video app on Apple TV. Originally, we heard that Amazon Prime Video could appear on Apple TV in the third quarter of this year, but new rumors say that it might get a reveal before that. According to sources close to the matter who spoke to Buzzfeed, Apple may look to announce Amazon Prime Video’s arrival during its WWDC 2017 keynote next month. It doesn’t sound like it’ll launch that day, but rather later in the summer. It’s worth noting, however, that a concrete release date hasn’t been nailed down yet. As expected, this agreement runs both ways, and Amazon could start offering Apple TV boxes through its digital storefront as well. Apple TV hasn’t been sold through Amazon specifically because there wasn’t an Amazon Prime Video app for customers to download, but with Apple now allowing it on the platform, Amazon is willing to drop that particular grudge. So, if these rumors turn out to be true, then we could see Amazon Prime Video on Apple TV and the Apple TV on Amazon by the end of the year. As always, we should take this with a grain of salt, but it does make a certain amount of sense. If Apple wants to grow the audience for Apple TV, giving Amazon users the ability to take advantage of their Prime subscriptions using the box is a good way to do that. Just as well, if Amazon senses that Apple is going to throw a lot of its weight behind Apple TV, then it’ll definitely want a slice of that pie by offering the device through its store. Assuming Buzzfeed’s sources are accurate, then we’ll find out just what’s going down on June 5 – a little over three weeks from today. Of course, we’ll have all the WWDC 2017 coverage you need here at SlashGear, so stay tuned.

A few standouts included the introduction of their 'Fluent Design System' that will advance the Windows UI for this fall with a subtle 3D interface that will also include motion, depth, Lighting effects and more as noted in the video in our report. Other announcements included iTunes coming to the Windows Store this fall, a giant leap for Pen control and their HoloLens platform coming to market this Christmas. To conclude their keynote, they announced a very interesting partnership for HoloLens which could be very interesting over time.   Fluent Design System     Apple's iTunes Coming to Windows Store   During yesterday's keynote, Terry Myerson, Microsoft's Executive Vice President of the Windows and Devices Group announced that Spotify was coming to the Windows Store at the 1:09:49 mark of the video presented further below.   Myerson then quickly added …"and they are not alone. Today, I'm excited to announce that iTunes will be coming to the Windows Store. Windows 10 and Windows 10S users will get the complete iTunes experience, including Apple Music, as well as full support for the iPhone. We're serious about enabling the best experience for Windows users and we're thrilled to have iTunes be a part of that."   When the Spotify announcement was made it was met with zero response from the full auditorium of developers. In contrast, when iTunes was announced, there was applause of approval and a loud "Ohhhh." Check it out in the video below.     Advanced Pen Input Coming to Windows 10 Fall Update   The Keynote had many interesting segments like the one with Joe Belfiore, Microsoft's Corporate Vice President, PC, Tablet and Phone. Belfiore spoke in detail about the new features coming to Windows 10 Fall Edition. According to Belfiore users will be able to work on a project at work on Windows then seamlessly switch to an iPhone or an Android device and back to Windows and never lose their place in their progress in the project. It's Apple's Continuity on steroids by being cross platform.   In and around the 1:22:46 mark of the keynote video, Belfiore talks about using their Digital Pen to navigate a display by being able to fluently scroll a webpage with the pen like a mouse. The pen will also allow users to quickly cut and paste content on the web and switch to Word and use a tap menu to paste it into a document as fast as could be done with a mouse today. This is something that many iPad Pro users would like to see come to the Apple Pen sometime in the future.   HoloLens Progress   The keynote ended on a high note showing the progress of HoloLens.Without a doubt the device has taken a huge leap in just a year.   The segment starts around the 1:21:44 mark through to about the 1:47:37 mark. One of the highlights of the Mixed Reality segment of the keynote came when Microsoft announced their deep partnership with Cirque du Soleil. That segment starts at the 1:38:29 mark of keynote video above and I'm sure that some of you will find this segment an interesting peek into one space within the Mixed Reality market.     Microsoft Introduced New Motion Hand Controllers for Mixed Reality Coming this Fall   HP and Acer will be selling Mixed Reality Headsets for Christmas 2017 with pricing starting at US$399 for the headset and new hand controllers shown above. Like any new device it will live or die by the quality of apps and/or games that it brings to market.   Microsoft has a huge lead in Mixed Reality in the Enterprise, education and now consumer market this fall. If anything, the Microsoft Keynote on Mixed Reality gives us a heads up as to what to expect from this technology, making Apple's entry only that more exciting if they get it to market by 2020 or sooner. Apple may be waiting for 5G networks to arrive before launching.   All in all, Microsoft seems to be advancing windows at an amazing pace and perhaps in some ways getting the leap on Apple when it comes to pen input and finally being able to bring cross platform performance into action.   Of course it's nice on paper and in a show and tell environment – but we'll have to see if these features actually pan out as shown in demos. I'm sure that many are hoping that Microsoft can pull it off as anyone working in a mixed device universe knows the value of such a feature.   Lastly, Microsoft's new UI will deliver subtle 3D imagery. This could be very refreshing to finally see 3D come to the user interface. While Apple has been working on this for more than a decade, it's once again Microsoft that will be stealing Apple's thunder.   After seeing what Microsoft will be introducing this fall, I can't wait to now see what Apple will be bringing to the tablet during their WWDC 2017 event next month.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

(NASDAQ: AAPL)'s CEO Tim Cook told CNBC's Jim Cramer in an interview in early May his company created an advanced manufacturing fund with an initial investment of $1 billion. The Billion Dollar Fund The purpose of the fund is to "ripple the pond" and help create manufacturing jobs. Cook delivered on his promise at the time to detail the first investment within weeks and did so on Friday. According to a CNBC report, Apple will invest $200 million in Corning Incorporated (NYSE: GLW), a member of Apple's supply chain that manufactures glass substrates for flat panel LCDs. Apple selected Corning in part because it has proven to be a supplier that continued to innovate. News of Apple's investment sent shares of Corning higher by around 1 percent to $29.08 on Friday and traded as high as $29.25. According to TechCrunch, Apple's selection of Corning is "logical" given the decade-long relationship between the two companies. In fact, Apple is responsible for pushing Corning to create the chemically strengthened glass now included in the iPhone and became the gold-standard for nearly every smartphone maker. The relationship between Apple and Corning has already created and sustained nearly one thousand jobs. "This partnership started 10 years ago with the very first iPhone, and today every customer that buys an iPhone or iPad anywhere in the world touches glass that was developed in America," CNBC quoted Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams as saying. "We're extremely proud of our collaboration over the years and we are investing further with Corning who has such a rich legacy of innovative manufacturing practices."

Apple said the investment will go toward Corning's research and development, equipment needs, and state-of-the-art glass processing.

Home Apple News Apple Rumors iPhone iPad iPod Mac Apple TV Apple Watch About Apple News Apple Rumors iPhone 8 iPhone 8 Rumours Share on Facebook TSMC begins production of A11 processor for iPhone 8 The company TSMC has officially begun the process of manufacturing the Apple A11 SoC chip for the iPhone in August 2017. At least this indicates the latest report by DigiTimes. Since TSMC wanted to start mass production of the iPhone 8 processor in April, but they faced some problems with the components, which we will detail in this article. This year TSMC will be the sole supplier of the A11 chips for Apple’s special edition iPhone. TSMC’s A11 chip is expected to be included also in the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, which are supposed to have the same design as the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, although according to some rumours could change slightly in some Secondary aspects. Start the iPhone 8! As usual, Apple has designed the A11 layers under its own specification and has gone to a third-party company to proceed with its production. Most tests and benchmarks indicate that Apple’s CPU designs offer the best performance in the smartphone industry.   So explained in DigiTimes the problems of TSMC in the production of the A11 chip from Apple: “TSMC has begun production of the 10nm chip for the next generation of the Apple iPhone 8 series, sources cite. The production was affected by problems involving mismatched components in the packaging process but have already been solved. “ Other rumours indicate that the iPhone 8 could have 3 GB of RAM, just like the iPhone 7 Plus. A few days ago, we reported that the production of the iPhone 8 would not start until October or November so its subsequent launch would be delayed more than a month over previous years.

Battery drain issues can be tricky but these fixes have worked well for us, and others, in the past. These fixes will work with all versions of iOS 10 including the company’s current version, the iOS 10.3.1 update. They should work for those of you running the iOS 10.3.2 beta as well. Check Your Apps Before you blame iOS 10 for your battery troubles, note that there’s a very good chance it’s something else causing the battery drain on your iPhone or iPad. If your battery life starts acting up with iOS 10 on board, the first place to look is at your collection of applications. There’s a very good chance an app, or apps, is hogging your device’s resources and causing the problem. The first place you’ll want to look is your Settings. Go into Settings > Battery and get familiar with the Battery Usage tool that arrived with the iOS 9 update in 2015. This tool will show you what apps are eating the most battery and when. Look for something out of the ordinary. If you do see something odd, check the App Store for an update. Developers are rolling out bug fixes and iOS 10 support updates that could improve performance. If an update fails to cure the issue, try reinstalling or uninstalling the app completely to see if that helps settle your device’s battery. Check Your Widgets Widgets are extremely prominent in iOS 10. And if you have a ton of widgets active, they could be sucking up a bunch of power in the background. If you’re experiencing terrible battery life, try getting a handle on your widgets. To get started, swipe to the right while on your device’s home screen. Scroll all the way to bottom of your widgets and select Edit. It’s a little circle icon. You should see a long list of services and apps. To remove a widget, tap the red circle with the white line and tap Remove. Remove as many as you desire and see if it has a positive effect on your battery’s performance. Use Low Power Mode If you haven’t been using iOS’ built-in Low Power Mode, now would be a good time to get familiar with this important feature. The iOS 9 update delivered a new feature called Low Power Mode. It’s important because it allows you to stretch out the last 10-20% of battery life on your device without having to make a bunch of manual changes. To enable Low Power Mode on your device go to Settings > Battery > Low Power Mode > On. This feature will help you conserve a few hours of battery life. Start using this feature on a regular basis. Use Airplane Mode If you suddenly start experiencing rapid battery drain, it might be because you’re in an area with poor cellular coverage. When you are in a bad service area, your iPhone or iPad will work hard to try and find a signal. This can cause your battery to drain rapidly. This is a perfect time to flip on Airplane Mode. Airplane Mode is found at the very top of your Settings and it will kill all of your connections when turned on. If you’ve done any air travel during the past few years, you’re probably familiar with the feature. Once you’ve entered a new service area, turn Airplane Mode off and you should notice an improvement to your device’s battery life. Disable iCloud Keychain If you don’t use iCloud Keychain, try disabling it to see if that improves battery life. This has worked for a number of people in the past. To disable iCloud Keychain on your device, you’ll want to go into Settings > iCloud > Keychain > Toggle iCloud Keychain off. If it doesn’t have a positive impact on battery, you can always toggle it back on when you need it again. Limit Background App Refresh Do you need your apps to automatically refresh in the background? No? Well then you might want to try disabling the Background App Refresh feature on your device. It could help you conserve battery life. Background App Refresh is handy because it will allows your apps to show you the latest data once you open them. It can also be a resource hog. If you don’t use or care about this feature, go to Settings > General > Background App Refresh > and turn it off for each app that is using too much power. It’s going to be an extremely tedious process for some of you but it could help your battery life. You can also turn the feature off completely if you don’t want to go through your list of applications one by one. If this doesn’t help, you can turn the feature back on for all of your apps or some of them. Manage Your Display Apple’s mobile devices use sensors to adjust the screen automatically in certain lighting environments. Sometimes these sensors work, sometimes they’re a little off. A bright screen can eat up battery life so we recommend getting a handle on your device’s display. First, try turning Auto Brightness off. To do this, go into Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Brightness > Off. Once you shut it off, you’ll have to adjust your screen brightness manually. this is easy with iOS 10. You can adjust it in your Settings in the Display & Brightness menu or you can simply swipe up from the bottom of the screen to bring up Control Center. Swipe up and you’ll see a bar that stretches across the length of the first Control Center card. Use it to adjust screen brightness. Turn Off Raise to Wake iOS’ Raise to Wake feature is handy but turning it off could help you save battery life. To turn off the Raise to Wake, go to Settings > Display & Brightness and then toggle the Raise to Wake function off. You can always turn it back on if you don’t see any gains. Restart Your iPhone or iPad If you’re looking for a quick fix, try a simple restart. Hold down the power button for a few seconds and swipe to shut the device down. Hold down the power button again to boot the device back up. Sometimes, this dislodges battery life issues. You can also try a hard reset. To do that, hold down the home button and the power button (volume down and power button on an iPhone 7/iPhone 7 Plus) for about 10 seconds. The device will restart itself. This won’t remove any data. Reset All Settings If none of these fixes help, it’s time to take more drastic measures to fix your bad iOS 10 battery life. The first solution we recommend is a reset of your settings. To do this, go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings and then enter your passcode. If you don’t have a passcode enabled, you obviously don’t need to replicate that step. This process should take five minutes or more and it will restore your settings to their factory defaults. So, make sure you have all of your Wi-Fi passwords handy because your phone or tablet will forget them. Downgrade to an Older Version of iOS 10 If you’d rather drop down to an older version of iOS you can do that. For a limited time. If you can’t tolerate iOS 10’s performance, you can drop back down to an older version to see if that improves your devices battery life. The downgrade loophole will only be open for a short time so you’ll need to act quickly if you want to make the move. For more on the process, take a look at our downgrade walkthrough. Upgrade to a Newer Version of iOS 10 If you’re running an older version of iOS 10 and you’re noticing abnormal battery drain, you might try upgrading to the current version of iOS 10. There’s no guarantee the iOS 10.3.1 update will solve your problem but we, and others, have noticed improvements. Restore the iOS 10 Update If you have a bunch of free time on your hands you can try a restore on your iPhone or iPad. This step should only be used as a last resort because it will temporarily erase everything on your device and could take awhile to complete. You can try restoring from your backup after you install iOS 10. If your iOS 10 battery life issues return after the restore, you will want to try this method again without restoring from your backup. Here’s how to do this on an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch: Plug in and backup to the computer or to iCloud. Turn off Find My iPhone – Settings -> iCloud -> Find my iPhone -> Off. In iTunes Click Restore. Follow the prompts and the iPhone will reinstall iOS 10 from scratch. When it completes click Restore from Backup to put your information back on the iPhone or Choose to set up as a new iPhone. Talk to Apple Support Online You should also get in contact with Apple support via its website or via Twitter. The company runs a Twitter account that takes questions about iOS problems and could help point you in the right direction. You can also get in touch with Apple Support via Apple’s website. Take Your Device Into an Apple Store If nothing on here works for you, and Apple’s online support fails, you could try taking your iPhone or iPad into an Apple Store to have a Genius run some diagnostics. Your issues could be related to a bloated battery, it could be something else entirely. If your device is still under warranty, they might even offer you a replacement. To find your closest Apple Store, head here. Buy a Battery Case If your device’s battery life still feels underwhelming, it might be time to invest in a battery case. Battery cases can be bulky but they can also be lifesavers, particularly when you’re out traveling for work or pleasure. There are a ton of battery case options out there and our list of the best iPhone cases will help you get pointed in the right direction. Buy a Battery Bank If you don’t want to strap a bulky case to your iPhone consider buying a battery bank for your device. Battery banks are small and extremely lightweight and some, like the RAVPower battery pack, can give you six full iPhone charges. The RAVPower battery pack is an excellent choice but there are plenty of others including Mophie’s powerstation plus mini and the Anker Powercore 20100. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 9 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 13 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 13 33 Responses 09/13/2016 tug Reply this is stupid.. if previously u dont have much issue having all the same settings.. all the same cellular coverage.. the problem is the iOS 10 itself.. asking someone to switch off this and that is not exactly the solution 09/14/2016 Z Reply For me the battery status shows that Messages app took 51% of battery in the background. Ridiculous. Turned imessage off and swiped up messages app from the background and i see a better battery. 09/22/2016 Leo Reply I play a lot of games when i was on the 9.3.5 firmware and battery wasn’t that bad but when I do it on IOS 10 it drains so fast. So obviously theres a problem with it. 10/04/2016 We're The Phucarwe Reply Silly. Nothing in here addresses the inherent battery-draining qualities of yet another Apple downdate. Most of the “enhanced” features are aimed at improving apple’s bottom line rather than your device performance. I’m beginning to think more and more about abandoning a ship I’ve been sailing since the 80’s. C’mon, Apple. 10/06/2016 SUZANNE HAMOOD Reply there need to be yet another update to the IOS10. we should NOT be paying 700.00 for a phone that wont hold a battery charge for 8 hours. I have noticed a HUGH difference and I am not a big phone user. I could usually start off the day with a 100% and if not used much that day end the day with more than 50% Its 2:30 in the afternoon and I haven’t Hardley touched my phone today its at 34% WTF!!! 10/07/2016 Steve miller Reply My 6s battery dies so fast with as much shut off and manual fetch email setting have helped a little but at 1% it seems to last for hours for some reason. I think the battery is still fine but something is ip with the battery indicator 10/08/2016 Jonas Reply Same apps, same settings and the difference is 9% battery drain over night compared to not even 1% on IOS 9. By % that is ridiculous and nearly and insane difference…. As other mentioned, this guide does not have much to do with battery tuning iOS 10, although in general terms it may work, but not for we who haven’t changed anything… 10/09/2016 Elle Reply for some reason my 6 drains at night after i upgraded the ios. Now every time I turn on my phone, instead of my lock screen I see my music screen and I’ve turned off that app. I went form 86% right before bed and woke up to 21%. 10/10/2016 Brian Reply My 5c says the battery life is fine, 50% plus, then without warning the phone will power down. When I try to power it back up, it shows the battery as being dead as a post. So I plug the phone in, and the phone immediately powers up, and shows the battery life as being where it was before it powered down…that was 57% this morning. 05/12/2017 Mark Reply Other than the specific percentages you cite, this is exactly what my iPhone 6 is doing. 10/10/2016 Rene Girardin Reply Here is a link to interesting discussions about iOS 10.0.2 and Fast Battery Drain on all iPhones. All the bla bla about how to lower battery usage is OK but there is a bug introduced in Network Settings. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7685072?start=30&tstart=0 10/11/2016 Matthew Grimsley Reply same with my ipone 6S. happened twice over the weekend. 10/13/2016 Ann Reply I think it’s so funny how our phones have a good battery life until an update comes along, but then it goes to poop and we are informed “Oh it’s probably dat app you using and not iOS 10” seriously??? 10/13/2016 Colin Nias Reply Even the staff in the Apple shops are reluctant to admit there is a problem, even though its plastered all over the internet. My 6 plus has the same issues, 100% in the morning, by 6pm I’m down to 25%. Loads of apps are still working in the background, Facebook and Mail seem to be the main culprits on mine. Apple really need to up their game and stop messing around with things. Listen, if it aint broke, don’t fix it. Simples!!! 10/13/2016 RB Reply Worthless article … “If you previously did not have issues wiith battery power and now do after installing iOS 10, the problem is likely something else and not iOS 10.” Makes perfect sense. 10/16/2016 Luigi Reply Guys I too have the same problem! I am angry!! But is it possible that these Apple release an update that sucks the battery like a ferrari to 240km / h ??? !! But crazy stuff !! It lasts less than half the time of use which I did with iOS 9. But what the heck !!! Apple immediately solve this problem !! Otherwise I swear that I buy an iPhone no longer !! 10/18/2016 jamie pollock Reply full charge at 7am… 3:30pm my iphone 6 shows 90% avail. Nothing special about my setup, I check email and send Texts during the day. I just don’t talk on it much nor use GPS. IOs 10 too. I must be lucky 10/19/2016 Mike Reply ISO 10 is a joke we pay to much and for the phone and service to have to go through this on every major update now it’s the worse it’s ever been I also have a iPhones 5 that says 33% and it just turns off and I have to plug it in and it comes back on with the same amount of power 33% wtf is the deal it’s like the older the phone the worse like they are trying to force everyone to buy the newest phone apple is about to have another class action law suit how many can they take at on time I love my iPhone but there seriously pushing me away and it seem like there doing it to a lot of customers bad business they need to do there homework before they release another update load it to a few different phones and models before you release shit 10/24/2016 Curtis S Reply Privacy > Location Services > System Services Turn off everything except Emergency SOS and Find My iPhone. 10/24/2016 Greg M Reply Hi I have updated my Ipad and now not only at first most of my Apps disappeared, Now it wont even charge to let me check things Surely an outfit like yours has have some accountability for this, this is a disgrace , I had been using this for my business, NOT Happy at all. 10/28/2016 Kai Reply Do not update to IOS 10…I repeat do not update. 10.1 does not help either. Battery life 10 mins if not plug into a charger. Constantly crashes and get stuck in reboot loop. Apple genius swear there is nothing wrong with the software when I brought my iPhone 6 in. Battery life performance at 80% when ran diagnostics, genius solution was to have it replaced. My only solution is to have the phone plug in a portable charger all day and remain plugged everywhere I go. Just waiting on the 7 to be in stock…if same problem arrives, I will be officially done with apple. 10/31/2016 David Harfst Reply This is not a problem with the apps draining the battery. It’s a bug, in my opinion, with how iOS monitors the battery. I’ve had my phone at 80% and all of the sudden it shuts off, and won’t power back on saying the battery is dead. Once I hook it up to power, it comes back on, still says it’s at 80%, and I can then disconnect from power again and it’s fine. This is happenning all the time since upgrading. The latter versions of iOS 9 did this too, but it would have to be down at 20 or 30%. I believe iOS 10.0.1 was better, but since going to 10.0.2, it’s worse again. This is a real pain. 11/03/2016 TS Reply Nothing listed here is a fix. These are all kluge-y awkward workarounds, none of which should be necessary with a properly-functioning OS. 11/20/2016 Mark Clulow Reply TOTALLY Shouldn’t have to go through all this though, this in nonsense. BOOOOOO! 12/31/2016 Kenneth Wilson Reply The problem is definitely the OS. IT seems Apple is trying to push people into buying new phones. Went to Apple. Did the whole reset thing.. no change. The y then suggest it was probably the because it would not charge in their kiosk and to replace it would be $300.00. Take the phone home and the phone charges without any issues. Changed every setting possible with no change. The IPhone 6 would last about 2 hours without doing anything on it. Changed the battery out. still no change. Ended up downloading the Public beta 10.2.1 Beta 2. Phone went from 2 hours to 8 hours with not really using the phone. It still has problems, but at least this helped, But Apple is definitely hiding something. 01/08/2017 pete Reply This is ridiculous. How is this a fix for the iOS battery drain problems? Clickbait. 01/25/2017 robert walker Reply bob, after installing ios 10.0.2 on my iphone5 after recharging and with 100% recharged,without using the phone at all it lost 40% of the charge ,something wrong big time apple . 01/28/2017 Stacey Reply I started with 100% battery life when I went to bed. Played a game for about 15 min and turned that off. Set the alarm, went to bed. Woke up wondering why my alarm didn’t go off on my phone. My phone was dead with only 2% battery life. I deleted the game, thinking it may have caused trouble, but it was only using 30% of my battery. Today after 100% charge and not using my phone, it’s already lost over 20% charge. Something is draining my battery and came here looking to see if I was the only one with an abnormally draining battery after 10.2.1 update. I use an iphone 7. Think I’ll go with Samsung galaxy for my next phone. Had troubles with iphone 6 with updates and I lost cellular connection with iphone 6, now having troubles again. Been one thing after another. I’m losing 1% of battery life every few minutes. I don’t have app refresh on either. Hope this gets fixed! 02/11/2017 Tim Reply Since upgraded to IOS 10, my Iphone 6 shuts off left and right with plenty of battery life left. Sometimes shuts off at 90% battery. This is messsed up! 02/12/2017 Rosemary Reply Since I upgraded to iOS 10.2 my battery has been draining up to 30% overnight & lasts no time at all throughout the day. I bought apple iPad Air as the battery life was 10 hours. Now I’m lucky to get 2-3hours. I’m really annoyed by this. I’ve had to follow online advice about switching off apps & conserving battery life by basically not using my iPad! Even with all this, there’s no great improvement. Is Apple going to fix this situation? It’s like they’ve bugged their own customers’ devices! Not the smartest move. I’m frustrated & let down. 03/08/2017 Karen Parker Reply “There’s no guarantee the iOS 10.2.1 update will solve your problem but we, and others, have noticed improvements.” I disagree as I did not have the battery drain issue until I installed 10.2.1. I have made all your recommended changes, turned off all notifications, and still getting less than 8 hours on a charge. If you go to Apple support they just keep up with the same old recommendations and will not even take ownership of the issue. So fed up I am ready to switch to Android if Apple doesn’t fix this nonsense soon. 03/12/2017 Nicole Seiler Reply 2 weeks after my 2 year contract ran out, by end of December 2016, I started to have serious battery problems on iPhone 6. It came suddenly, just like that. I hadn’t done any update. I am still on IOS 9.3.2. I didn’t risk to update on IOS 10, afraid issues will get worse. Example: I leave the house iPhone charged 100%. 1,5 hours later: 75%. I was maybe 15 minutes on Facebook in those 1,5 hours. One hour later I got a phonecall. I noticed that battery now showed just 57%. The call didn’t last more than 2 minutes. The iPhone shut down after the call. I hang it on an extern battery, it showed again 47%. 04/26/2017 Susan Griffiths Reply Hi my name is Susan, what l want to know about l have a old iPhone 4s what’s happened the battery life dead there no life in it at all what can l do to get it working Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Home Apple News Apple Rumors iPhone iPad iPod Mac Apple TV Apple Watch About iOS News Share on Facebook How should Apple call the new iPhone 8 Apple plans to introduce three new iPhone models by the end of this year 2017, specifically in September. Most likely, two of those models are the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, but there is a special edition model whose name is a mystery … This new product has generated a lot of expectations, although the smartphone of the 10th anniversary of the iPhone is a mystery, there is some news that has already filtered: wireless charge, OLED screen, Home Button with Touch Virtual ID, camera Dual upright, 3D sensors, facial recognition etc Most media have declined to use the “iPhone 8” nomenclature for this next-gen Apple terminal, but the truth is that no one knows what the new iPhone will be called. What will be the name of the new 10th anniversary iPhone? Over the past few years, Apple seems to have gone as safe as design and functionality. But the new iPhone will mark a before and after in the era of the company and we all expect a drastic renovation of its design. The iPhone 2017 will be the most important launch of Apple, so its name should be spectacular. We think it would not be enough to deal with the nomenclature “7s” by adding an additional model such as “iPhone 7s Pro”. We believe that his name will imply a great change. Some, as we mentioned earlier, have chosen to call it iPhone 8 . Although it is possible, it is unlikely. Others think it will be called iPhone X , alluding to the fact that it will be the 10th anniversary iPhone. On the other hand, the company of Cupertino could call it iPhone SE 2 , although it would not meet the same characteristics that the first model. Another possibility would be to simply use the nomenclature “iPhone”, as it happened with the last iPad . To conclude, other rumors suggest that the new terminal of Apple could end up giving it the name ofiPhone Edition , and this is a very elegant nomenclature, very Apple-style.

Home Apple News Apple Rumors iPhone iPad iPod Mac Apple TV Apple Watch About iPhone Share on Facebook This is the secret of Apple for the iPhone battery to last twice Apple continues to try to rectify its Achilles heel, meaning the battery life of your iPhone in the best possible way. And although inductive wireless load or the new SLP design will help improve its performance, it has just acquired a machine developed by Tesla capable of analysing the charge and discharge cycles and optimise it so that its useful life is twice that of the batteries Current. Recently, Jeff Dahn, the recognised researcher of the Tesla team – the electric car manufacturer – announced the development of this new technology in their machines and that users would also see the results within 4 years. Well, Apple has also acquired the machinery to develop them. The new batteries would continue to use Li-ion cell technology used in electrical appliances and the electric car. Working to accurately monitor load cycles to increase your life and what factors affect its deterioration is a great news, both for the future of the electric car and for users of Apple products, we will enjoy a few devices That will not leave us thrown throughout the day. From their website they have tried to describe their investigations so that we know the process of analysis and development: OUR PRECISION CHARGING SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO MEASURE THE CULOMBIC EFFICIENCY OF CELLS, WHICH TYPICALLY HAVE AN ACCURACY OF BETWEEN 10 PPM AND 50 PPM. THESE SYSTEMS HAVE 2 AMPS MAXIMUM CURRENT AND A VOLTAGE RANGE OF 0 TO 5V WITH AN INTEGRATED TEMPERATURE SENSOR ON EACH CHANNEL. During a talk at MIT, Jeff Dahn confirmed that Apple was one of the customers of Novonix, the division specialising in battery development. Although 4 years is a long time and obviously will not be in time for the iPhone 8, sooner than we think we can enjoy them.

The streaming service has been loath to give Apple TV access to its Prime video app, or even sell Apple products, for the past two years, but it looks like Amazon Prime is coming to an Apple TV near you, and it could be very soon. Buzzfeed News reports that Apple plans to announce this officially during its keynote address at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose on June 5. A source told Buzzfeed that Apple plans to launch the Amazon Prime app as soon as this summer, but cautioned that a hard date hasn’t been set yet and is subject to change. Amazon hasn’t sold Apple TVs (or Google Chromecast devices) on its site for two years, claiming “customer confusion.” I guess some customers had bought an Apple TV from Amazon, thinking the set-top box had Amazon Prime already loaded. Part of Apple and Amazon’s new agreement includes the provision that Amazon resume selling Apple TV products. A hard date for that hasn’t been set either. Earlier this month, Recode announced that Tim Cook and Jeff Bezos may have reached a deal, and as of Buzzfeed’s article the news is now official. The two services constantly compete for customers’ time and money, but an agreement between the two could gain them even more of each. ‘Carnival Row’ Picked Up at Amazon Without Guillermo del Toro Source: Amazon Prime Video App Finally Coming to Apple TV This Summer Filed Under: Amazon | Apple | elsewhere Category: Elsewhere Share on Facebook Share on Twitter More Leave a comment Send to a friend!

General Electric dropped 2.5 percent, while Wells Fargo lost 1.8 percent. Sign up for the online chat with Col. Brandon Pearce, NGA's chief information security officer, May 15, 12:30 p.m. Advertisement Nordstrom became the latest department store operator to turn in disappointing results. The company’s stock plunged 9 percent. Small-company stocks fell more than the rest of the market. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.33 percent. CONSUMER PRICES Consumer prices rebounded 0.2 percent in April WASHINGTON (AP) — Consumer prices rebounded moderately in April as energy prices climbed back up after a sharp decline in March. Commentary: The nobility of public service is making a comeback The Labor Department says consumer prices rose 0.2 percent after a 0.3 percent drop in March, which was the biggest fall in more than two years. Energy prices rose 1.1 percent after tumbling 3.2 percent the previous month. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, rose 0.1 percent. Over the past 12 months, inflation is up 2.2 percent. Core prices have risen 1.9 percent. The Federal Reserve tries to manage the economy so that annual increases in inflation are around 2 percent. The Fed raised its key interest rate in March, and analysts expect another hike in June. RETAIL SALES US retail sales rebounded in April after sluggish winter WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans stepped up their spending at auto dealers, hardware stores and e-commerce outlets as retail sales rebounded from two sluggish months. The Commerce Department says retail sales increased 0.4 percent in April from March. Sales ticked up just 0.1 percent in March and fell in February. The increase suggests that consumers may spur faster growth in the April-June quarter after the economy barely expanded in the first three months of the year. The rise also indicates that the struggles of large retail chains, such as Macy’s and JC Penney’s, reflect changes in consumer buying patterns rather than broader economic weakness. Sales at department stores fell 0.2 percent. Yet a category that includes online retailers reported sales growth of 1.4 percent, the strongest of any group. EARNS-JC PENNEY Losses at JC Penney double, sales slide PLANO, Texas (AP) — Losses at J.C. Penney doubled in the first quarter and sales at established stores fell for the third consecutive quarter, capping a terrible week for retailers. Revenue declined from $2.81 billion, to $2.71 billion, which was worse than Wall Street had expected. For the three months ended April 29, Penney lost $180 million, or 58 cents per share. A year ago the Plano, Texas, company lost $68 million, or 22 cents per share. Sales at stores open at least a year dropped 3.5 percent. Industry analysts watch that figure closely as a signal of a retailer’s health because it excludes the volatility of stores that were recently opened or closed. This week, Macy’s, Nordstrom and Kohl’s posted fading same-store sales numbers as well. BUSINESS INVENTORIES US businesses increased stockpiles slightly in March WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. businesses increased their stockpiles slightly in March, while their sales were flat. The Commerce Department says business inventories rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent in March, matching February’s gain. And sales were unchanged in March after inching up 0.2 percent in February. An effort by businesses to rebuild their stockpiles had added a full percentage point to economic growth in the October-December quarter, a period when the economy grew by a tepid 2.1 percent as measured by the gross domestic product. But growth slowed in the January-March quarter, in part analysts say because inventories subtracted from overall economic activity. Annual GDP growth was just 0.7 percent in the first quarter. APPLE INVESTMENT Apple to spend $200 million supporting Corning plant in Ky. FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Apple says it will give $200 million to Corning Inc. so it can invest in a Kentucky plant that makes glass screens for iPhones and iPads. The California-based company says the money will come from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund. It has pledged to spend $1 billion on US-based companies to create “innovative production and highly skilled jobs.” Corning has had a facility in Harrodsburg for 65 years. The company has collaborated with Apple for the past 10 years by making scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass for Apple’s products. The companies say their partnership has sustained 1,000 jobs, including 400 in Harrodsburg. Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams, Corning CEO Wendell Weeks, and U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell are scheduled to formally announce the spending during a 2 p.m. news conference in Harrodsburg. VOLKSWAGEN-UNION Unfair labor practices charged at Volkswagen’s US plant NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The National Labor Relations Board has filed another unfair labor practices complaint against Volkswagen for hiking health insurance premiums and changing working hours of employees who voted for union representation at the German automaker’s only U.S. plant. Volkswagen is mounting a legal challenge to NLRB rulings in favor of the small group of skilled-trades workers who voted in 2015 to be represented by the United Auto Workers union. But the NLRB says the federal appeals court case doesn’t override the UAW’s exclusive collective-bargaining rights over the terms and conditions of employment of the workers who maintain and repair the plant’s machinery and robots. Volkswagen Chattanooga spokesman Scott Wilson says that until the appeals court rules, the company is “unable to bargain with the UAW without compromising our legal argument.” FIAT CHRYSLER-RECALL Fiat Chrysler recalls 1M pickups for faulty software AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) — Fiat Chrysler is recalling approximately 1 million trucks in North America due to a software glitch that could prevent side air bags and seatbelts from deploying during a rollover. The company’s U.S. division said Friday that it is aware of one death, two injuries and two accidents that may be related to the problem. The recall includes some 2013-16 Ram 1500 and 2500 pickups and 2014-2016 Ram 3500 pickups. According to the company, after some trucks experience significant underbody impact, a computer module may incorrectly determine that one of its sensors has failed, temporarily disabling the side air bag and seat belt pretensioner. If the vehicle is turned off and then back on, those restraints become functional again. The company plans to reprogram the software in effected vehicles. SKOREA-HYUNDAI-RECALL South Korea recalls Hyundai cars, asks probe on cover-up SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea has ordered Hyundai and Kia to recall 240,000 vehicles for five types of defects initially raised by a whistleblower. The Transport Ministry said Friday it also asked prosecutors to investigate if South Korea’s largest auto group intentionally covered up the defects that could compromise safety. Twelve models including Avante, i30, Genesis and Sonata sedans and Tucson, Santa Fe and Sportage sport utility vehicles are subject to the recall. It is the government’s first compulsory recall for any local carmaker. Hyundai Motor Co. and its smaller affiliate Kia Motors Corp. are part of the world’s fifth-largest automaker Hyundai Motor Group. The move is a blow to Hyundai and Kia, which are reeling from a recall last month of 1.4 million vehicles in the U.S., Canada and South Korea. ALASKA-PEBBLE MINE EPA may allow massive mine near pristine Alaskan bay WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has settled a lawsuit over the proposed development of a massive gold and copper mine at the headwaters of one of Alaska’s premier salmon fisheries. The Environmental Protection Agency settled the long-running case Friday with the Pebble Limited Partnership. Under the agreement, the Canadian-owned company can seek a federal permit to build its mine near Bristol Bay. Pebble sued in federal court over what it claimed was EPA’s collusion with mine opponents to block the project, which a study shows could pose significant risk to salmon populations in the bay. A review by EPA’s inspector general found no evidence the agency acted improperly. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said Friday the settlement provides Pebble with a fair process for moving forward with the project while avoiding time-consuming litigation. GLOBAL ECONOMY-CANADA Canada rejects US duties on lumber as ‘baseless’ BARI, Italy (AP) — Canada says Finance Minister Bill Morneau rejected U.S. duties on softwood lumber as “baseless” in a meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. A Canadian ministry statement says Morneau and Mnuchin engaged in a “productive discussion” and that Canada committed to working out a durable solution of the issue. It said Morneau emphasized that trade between the two countries was balanced and supported middle-class jobs. Morneau and Mnuchin met on the sidelines of the Group of Seven finance ministers’ meeting in Bari, Italy. Trade is not formally on the agenda but that doesn’t prevent ministers from taking the matter up in one-on-one meetings. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he would consider retaliating against U.S. coal imports. Mnuchin tweeted only that he enjoyed his discussion with Morneau. EUROPE-US-LAPTOPS US, EU in urgent discussions on pitch to expand laptop ban BRUSSELS (AP) — The United States and top European ministers will hold urgent talks about a possible expansion of the in-flight laptop ban to flights from the EU. European Commission transport spokeswoman Anna-Kaisa Itkonen confirmed the talks will be held Friday. Itkonen said the EU had no information of a new threat that would prompt any expansion of the ban. The EU’s transport and migration commissioners have written to U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to seek clarification. U.S. officials have said the decision in March to bar laptops and tablets from the cabins of some international flights, mostly from the Middle East, wasn’t based on any specific threat but on longstanding concerns about extremists targeting jetliners. EUROPE-CHINA-TRADE EU slaps new anti-dumping duties on China steel products BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union has slapped anti-dumping duties on more steel products from China to stop them flooding Europe’s struggling steel market. The European Commission said Friday that a new investigation had shown that Chinese seamless pipes were being sold in Europe at dumped prices. Those Chinese exports will now be taxed with an extra duty ranging from 29.2 percent to 54.9 percent. Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said “this is another clear example of how we’re using the available toolbox of trade defense instruments to address unfair imports of steel.” In January, the EU imposed extra duties on China and Taiwan for dumping stainless steel tube and a type of butt-welded pipe fitting on the European market. BRITAIN-HOSPITAL PROBLEMS UK’s health service hit by ransomware attack LONDON (AP) — Britain’s National Health Service says hospitals across the country have been hit by a “ransomware” cyberattack but there is no evidence that patient data has been accessed. NHS Digital, which oversees hospital cybersecurity, says the attack used the Wanna Decryptor variant of malware, which holds affected computers hostage while the attackers demand a ransom. NHS Digital says the attack “was not specifically targeted at the NHS and is affecting organizations from across a range of sectors.” The attack is causing canceled procedures and appointments at hospitals across England. NHS Digital says 16 NHS organizations report being hit.

Gorilla Glass 3 promises 40 percent fewer scratches (video) Video What happens to companies that depend on the iPhone? Apple wasted no time putting its $1 billion U.S. manufacturing fund to work, announcing Friday that it will invest $200 million into Corning’s Harrodsburg, Kentucky glass-making plant. Corning, as everyone knows, manufactures the glass that Apple has used in iPhones and iPads since day one. “Corning is a great example of a supplier that has continued to innovate and they are one of Apple’s long-standing suppliers,” Apple COO Jeff Williams said in a Friday statement announcing the investment. “This partnership started 10 years ago with the very first iPhone, and today every customer that buys an iPhone or iPad anywhere in the world touches glass that was developed in America. We’re extremely proud of our collaboration over the years and we are investing further with Corning who has such a rich legacy of innovative manufacturing practices.” [ Further reading: We name the best high-resolution digital audio players ] Adam Patrick Murray Apple and Corning have a longstanding relationship, with Corning making glass for the iPhone and iPad since the beginning. Corning’s Gorilla Glass, introduced in 2007, played a huge role in the development of Apple’s devices. Corning will be able to leverage the $200 million investment, which will go toward equipment, glass processing, and research and development, to make new versions of its extra-strength glass. Apple at one point was testing sapphire glass from a different manufacturer, but that plan flamed out after the sapphire was found to be too weak for use in iPhones. The company went back to Corning, and Gorilla Glass has remained a staple. Corning’s business relationship with Apple has already created close to 1,000 jobs in the U.S. It’s unclear if the company will add to its headcount with Apple’s investment, but it’s entirely possible. “This investment will ensure our plant in Harrodsburg remains a global center of excellence for glass technology,” Corning CEO Wendell Weeks said in Friday’s announcement.

Tongo/Epa/REX/Shutterstock May 12, 2017 | 10:02AM PT Apple has invested $200 million in Kentucky-based glass manufacturer Corning, which has been supplying the company with glass for iPhone screens and other products for years. The investment is part of a $1 billion commitment to U.S. manufacturing. Most of the $200 million will be invested in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, where Corning has been manufacturing glass for the past 65 years. Corning will spend the money on research and development and glass manufacturing equipment, according to a news release. Corning has been supplying Apple with glass ever since the introduction of the iPhone 10 years ago. The company is best known for a product it calls Gorilla Glass, which has been optimized to be damage and scratch resistant. In addition to the iPhone, Gorilla Glass is also being used for phones from Samsung, HTC, and Huawei, among others. Apple announced earlier this month that it would invest $1 billion into U.S.-based manufacturing. That announcement can be linked to efforts to sway the new administration as it looks to reform the tax code, which could allow Apple to repatriate some of its foreign profits. Apple at the time also claimed that it was responsible for 2 million U.S. jobs. The company itself employs around 80,000 people in the U.S., ranging from store clerks to software developers. Apple also counted 1.5 million jobs “created and supported by the app store” as part of those 2 million. However, at least 75 percent of those app developers also work on Android apps, according to the study referenced by Apple.

Goldman Sachs upped its price target on Apple, on the idea that enough people will pay whatever’s necessary to get the iPhone 8. By Emily Bary May 12, 2017 12:00 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large iPhone users have become increasingly willing to pay up for the most expensive version. Illustration: Getty Images Warren Buffett recently commented that one of Apple’s key advantages is that iPhone users aren’t price sensitive. A new analyst note seems to confirm that thought. Apple is due to come out with its new batch of iPhones later this year, and rumor has it that the flagship model will sell for $1,000 or more, depending on the amount of storage you get. iPhone users have become increasingly willing to pay up for more expensive, larger models, and they could be even more eager with the next phone -- Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone model. More from Barron’s Next iPhone 8 Delays? Why Investors Need Not Worry Here Comes The iPhone ‘Supercycle’ Apple Fans are Paying Up for That Big iPhone Apple’s tiered strategy has become increasingly profitable. When Apple first created a larger Plus model, just 31% of buyers chose it over the standard new model. When the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus launched last year, 51% chose the larger model, according to research firm IDC. Now Goldman Sachs estimates that the iPhone 8 could account for 58% of units sold in the next upgrade cycle, when consumers are likely to have a choice between the iPhone 8, and improved versions of the 7 and 7 Plus. Jankowski bumped up her price target to $170, 9% higher than current levels, based on her belief that broad interest in more expensive iPhones will drive up Apple’s average selling price from an estimated $695 in the 2017 calendar year to $762 in 2018, the first full year that the device is available. Part of the reason why people may be so interested in getting the fanciest version of the iPhone this time around is that the gap between models keeps getting wider. Whereas originally the main difference between the regular iPhone and the Plus version was screen size and battery, today’s Plus model has a significantly better camera. The gap should get even bigger when the new models come out later this year, as Apple is expected to come out with just one size of its flagship phone, packed with potential features like wireless charging and an OLED screen. Both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus should get minor upgrades, but if you want the new technology, you’ll have to pony up. “Bottom line, if Apple is successful in differentiating the iPhone 8 vs. the rest of its portfolio (and peers), we expect consumers to step up the price they’re willing to pay for it,” Jankowski wrote. Big Picture: One analyst says iPhone fans will be especially eager to pay up for the fanciest iPhone model when new versions come out later this year.

Corning might also build lightweight glass necessary for Apple's rumored augmented reality glasses. Josh Lipton | @CNBCJosh 9 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Apple has chosen the first recipient of its $1 billion manufacturing fund    17 Hours Ago | 00:40 Apple's plan to invest $200 million into Corning to spur U.S. manufacturing jobs are further indication of the company's plans to add wireless charging and augmented reality features to future iPhones, according to analysts. Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz, who covers Corning, believes Apple is developing wireless charging technology for the next generation of iPhones, as has been previously suggested by other analysts. But that means Apple will have to use something other than metal on the back of the phone. "Metal can interfere with wireless charging technology," he told CNBC. "That means you need glass on the back of the phone, but glass that won't break. Or you need to use ceramics. Corning has a long history of investing in both glass and ceramics." Uerkwitz also notes that those materials can be relatively expensive, which is one reason these next-generation iPhones could carry a higher price tag. He estimates that Apple accounts for about 5 percent of Corning's business. Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights has a different take: He thinks the investment is for Apple's rumored augmented reality glasses. "You need specialized glass in the headset, glass that properly magnifies the 180-degree experience of AR. Also, that glass has to be really light. Corning could develop that for Apple." Moorhead also thinks Apple — with this investment — would demand exclusive rights to the intellectual property associated with this material. Both Apple and Corning declined comment.

Plenty of ports, including USB-C, DisplayPort, and HDMI out. Cons Inconvenient rear port placement. Optical drive is DVD only. Bottom Line The Dell OptiPlex 7450 All-in-One is a powerful business desktop with a brilliant 4K screen, plenty of power, and excellent connectivity. By Joel Santo Domingo The Dell OptiPlex 7450 All-in-One business desktop (starts at $1,069; $1,904 as tested) packs a 4K screen, powerful processor and graphics, and excellent connectivity in a sleek body that looks like a standalone display. It is somewhat expensive as configured, but its compact chassis and connectivity make it ideal for multi-monitor setups in cramped spaces, plus its 4K resolution and power make it a shoo-in for creative departments. It replaces the Dell OptiPlex 24 7000 Series All-In-One (7440) as our Editors' Choice for business all-in-one (AIO) desktops. //Compare Similar Products Compare Dell OptiPlex 24 7000 Series All-In-One (7440)   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple iMac 21.5-Inch With 4K Retina Display (2015)   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple iMac 27-Inch With Retina 5K Display (2015)   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Surface Studio   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell XPS 27 (7760)   %displayPrice%%seller% HP Envy 34 Curved All-in-One (2017)   %displayPrice%%seller% Polywell B150L2-i7   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell Optiplex 3040 Small Form Factor   %displayPrice%%seller% HP Z240 SFF Workstation   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo ThinkCentre X1   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell Precision Tower 3000 Series (3620)   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Veriton Z4820G-I5650TZ   %displayPrice%%seller% HP Elite Slice   %displayPrice%%seller% Cerise Circular Computer   %displayPrice%%seller% Large Screen, Large Workspace The OptiPlex 7450 is housed in a 23.5-inch 4K In-Plane Switching (IPS) touch display. The PC's body measures 15.5 by 22.7 by 2.5 inches (HWD) by itself, and its height-adjustable stand takes up 10.1 by 8.9 inches (WD) on your work surface. The panel is VESA-mount compatible, so you can attach it to an articulating arm or mount it on your cubicle or office wall. Its dark gray and black business-like aesthetic matches most Dell OptiPlex desktops and displays. It's a lot more plain looking than the flashy Microsoft Surface Studio, but it will blend into most office environments just fine. View All 7 Photos in Gallery The stand is very flexible. You can adjust the screen height from 17 inches to 20.75 inches tall. It also pivots, so you can view the display in a portrait-style orientation. Compared with the standard landscape orientation, portrait mode more closely matches the vertical layout for web design, and some billboard advertising. When you turn the system 90 degrees to the left or right, sensors automatically adjust the content on the screen to follow suit. You can opt for an articulating stand instead for an extra $24.50. The height-adjustable stand is likely to fit better in a single-user environment, while the articulating stand helps in a collaborative setting, where you can easily turn the screen to share with a colleague. The replaceable stand makes this OptiPlex more flexible than the Surface Studio or the HP Envy 34 Curved All-in-One. The 4K (3,840 by 2,160) display offers four times the resolution of a Full HD panel, which is the default for the OptiPlex 7450 base model. This gives you a lot more room to work, as well as smoother text and graphics. Thus far, we've only seen 4K resolutions on select AIOs like the 21.5-inch Apple iMac and the Dell OptiPlex 7440, though the 27-inch Apple iMac and Microsoft Surface Studio (4,500 by 3,000) both have higher-resolution panels. The screen on the OptiPlex 7450 has a 16:9 aspect ratio, matching the Apple iMacs as well as 4K TVs. There's no digitizer support for active pens, like on the Surface Studio, but the 10-point touch capacitive screen responds quickly to fingertip inputs. The stereo speakers are located under the screen, and sound perfectly fine for business communications, though they understandably lack bass. If you need top-notch audio, the Dell XPS 27, a consumer-oriented AIO, is a better choice. There's a 2-megapixel webcam centered above the display, which has a physical shutter for privacy. Modern Connectivity Plus a DVD Drive The system comes with a wireless keyboard and mouse, which helps keep desktop clutter under control. There's also an 8X DVD+/-RW drive, which some might think of as a relic of the early 2000s. DVDs are still used in businesses, since documents and historical records from that era may have been archived on CDs or DVDs. We wish it were a Blu-ray drive for better compatibility with more recent optical disc formats, though 4K-compatible Blu-ray players have yet to surface in desktop PCs. Wired connectivity is excellent. A headset jack, an SD card reader, a USB 3.0 port, and a USB-C port are located in arms reach on the left side of the display. Less conveniently located in the back, under a removable panel, are an audio line-out jack, a DisplayPort, an Ethernet Port, an HDMI-out port, two USB 2.0 ports, and four USB 3.0 ports. The rear ports are vertically oriented, so they are difficult to reach unless you first lay the system face down. The DisplayPort and HDMI-out ports let you drive up to three 4K displays, including the internal one. Since the system is self contained, it's easy to deploy a compact three-display workspace without the added bulk of a separate small-form-factor or tower desktop. Wireless connectivity comes in the form of 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2. Storage and Operating System Our test unit has a 256GB solid-state drive (SSD) and 16GB of RAM, upgraded from the 500GB hard drive and 4GB RAM in the base model. 16GB of RAM is certainly enough to keep dozens of websites, the core Office programs (Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook), and other apps like Spotify and Slack all active at the same time. Using an SSD instead of the base hard drive speeds up launching programs and loading local documents. If you need more local storage, there's a free 2.5-inch hard drive bay. The rear panel pops off, but it's a job for your IT staffers, as it's a little tricky and requires specialized tools. The system comes with Windows 10 Pro and a few preloaded utilities. Dell covers the system with a standard three-year warranty with on-site service after remote diagnosis. Speedy Performance An Intel Core i5-7600 processor and a discrete AMD Radeon R7 M465X GPU (upgraded from the base Core i5-7500 with integrated graphics) helped the OptiPlex 7450 make quick work of our benchmark tests. While it placed first on the Photoshop test (2 minutes, 50 seconds), it was in the middle of a tightly spaced pack for the other day-to-day and multimedia tests. Any Photoshop time under 3 minutes is excellent, and the OptiPlex 7450 is the only one to break that barrier among the AIO desktops compared here. The Dell XPS 27 was 9 seconds faster on the Handbrake test (1:05), but the results from other systems were clustered around the OptiPlex 7450. See How We Test Laptops On the PCMark 8 Work Conventional test, the OptiPlex managed 3,058 points, an average score among these power-user systems. The Microsoft Surface Studio (2,780) lagged the pack due to a slower processor and higher-resolution screen, and the HP Envy Curved AIO was a bit faster given its lower-resolution monitor, but all of these competitors will handle office tasks quickly and efficiently. The business-centric Dell OptiPlex 7450 isn't built for gaming, so it's understandable that it lagged the other AIO desktops on all six of our 3D benchmark tests. For example, the Microsoft Surface Studio trounced the competition using its enthusiast-level Nvidia GeForce GTX 980M graphics processor. That said, the OptiPlex 7450 was able to achieve playable results on the Heaven (37fps) and Valley (44fps) tests at medium quality settings at 1,366 by 768 resolution. Any result higher than 30fps shows smooth animation on average, and is playable. That means you can play a game like Minecraft or classics like Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic in a small window after you've finished working. Better Screen, Better Connectivity, Better PC Between the excellent 4K display and strong multimedia performance, your creative department will thank you for purchasing the Dell OptiPlex 7450. The 21.5-inch iMac also has a 4K screen, but its older internal components, lack of USB-C, and aging chassis keep it out of contention unless you're a macOS shop. The 27-inch version of the iMac has a 5K screen, but it also lacks USB-C, and is about $900 more expensive if you upgrade its memory, graphics, and SSD. The OptiPlex 7440 has the 4K screen and a lower price tag, but the new model adds a touch screen, discrete graphics, USB-C, a wealth of useful ports, and more memory for multitasking. Those upgrades are certainly worth the extra $250, and therefore the system is our new Editors' Choice for business all-in-one desktop PCs.

Here’s what you may have missed … iPhone KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo kicked off Tuesday morning by announcing there is a ‘rising probability of worst-case scenario for iPhone shipments.’ “While we are positive on potential replacement demand triggered by OLED iPhone, it’s too early to determine if demand will shift fully in that direction. We recommend investors keep tabs on the following issues: (1) whether the 3D sensor of OLED iPhone provides an innovative user experience; (2) whether OLED iPhone cancels Touch ID (fingerprint recognition); and (3) whether Apple’s competitors launch more innovative products which could compete with OLED iPhone in 4Q17-2Q18,” the analyst wrote. The Chinese Economic Daily News, however, disagrees – citing that production of Apple’s next iPhone is still on time and previous issues in this respect have now been resolved. Meanwhile new renders of the iPhone 8 surfaced – this week. The digital renders originally leaked via MySmartPrice’s Gear blog claimed to be ‘based upon factory CAD’ information and included both a video and 3D look at the company’s proposed design for the smartphone. On the back of speculation surrounding the iPhone 8, Apple’s iPhone 7 was this week named the world’s “Best Selling Smartphone” for Q1 2017. “We estimate Apple iPhone 7 shipped 21.5 million units and captured 6 percent marketshare worldwide in Q1 2017″, said Juha Winter, Senior Analyst at Strategy Analytics. “The iPhone 7 is by far the world’s most popular smartphone model, due to a compelling blend of user-friendly design, extensive supporting apps, and widespread retail availability for the device. Apple iPhone 7 Plus, with its bigger screen and higher pricing, shipped 17.4 million units for second place and 5 percent marketshare worldwide in Q1 2017. Apple today accounts for two of the world’s top five smartphone models,” the analyst concluded. Wednesday brought yet more supposed leaks relating to Apple’s plans for the iPhone. A leak from Weibo (published by SlashLeaks) specifically claimed to show the rear glass panel that would feature on this year’s redesign of the top-selling smartphone, although the actual authenticity of the image (seen above) is still in question … This was followed by a separate report by DigiTimes that broke on Thursday afternoon in which it was claimed Apple’s manufacturing partner, TSMC, had officially begun producing the chips the would be required to power the so-called “iPhone 8.” Korea Economic Daily later ran a report claiming that the Cupertino company had made a partnership with LG Innotek – the claimed market leader in the smartphone camera module market, last year, in order to develop “the world’s first 3-D facial recognition camera system.” This system, it said, could be used for “a variety of applications” from biometric authentication, to games … Finishing the week off in terms of iPhone news, Apple today published a new video series to its official YouTube channel. Called ‘How to Shoot on iPhone 7,’ the series will aim to teach iPhone owners how best to shoot action shots with the smartphone, alongside how to shoot in low light, take panoramas, close-ups, and how to shoot a great portrait. You can watch the full series of videos each of which last just 40-seconds – below. App Store In terms of what’s new and notable on the App Store, Pixelnest Studio has finally launched its frenetic and chaotic space shooter – Steredenn. Carved in “big beautiful pixels,” with insane boss battles, the game will see you embark on a journey in a ship as you engage the fight against dreadful space pirates in a never-ending combat for your survival … More info iPhone + iPad Steredenn $3.99 Meanwhile Grailr LLC’s fringe-science title Artificial Superintelligence will see you take the role of a startup founder, as you attempt to build the world’s first sentient supercomputer! Slide either left or right to train your AI, handle the bizarre requests of Silicon Valley residents, and explore parallel universes. If you can keep your employees, your investors, the government, and the internet from tearing apart the fabric of society, then maybe you’ll actually bring about the Singularity. More info iPhone + iPad Artificial Superintelligence $2.99 Looking for something with a bit more story? … If you are, new story-driven experience To The Moon by X.D. Network Inc. – which charts the tale of two doctors traversing backwards through a dying man’s memories to artificially fulfill his last wish – is definitely worth a look! More info iPhone + iPad To the Moon $4.99 For those of you interested in photography, (and specifically iPhoneography), Artful Pro –the premium version of ArtFul– claims to offer 60 filters covering saturation/clarity and focus effects. More info iPhone + iPad Artful Pro $2.99 Other new releases you may want to check out this Friday, include: Under Leaves, Penarium, Olli by Tinrocket, Race for the Galaxy and SPACEPLAN. Apple Music There’s a few major new music releases you should know about this weekend, ahead of THEHOTLIST 39. One of the biggest, Harry Styles. The former One Direction lead has officially released his debut album. The 10-track highly-anticipated recording marks the beginning of Styles’ solo career and features fun-sounding quips like Carolina, alongside rocky standouts: Kiwi and Only Angel. Styles’ first LP release comes on the heels of Apple Music announcing behind-the-scenes film: ‘Harry Styles: Behind the Album’ which saw its exclusive premiere in L.A. – earlier this week, and is expected to drop for service subscribers on May 15. A post shared by Arron Hirst (@arronhirst) on May 10, 2017 at 5:07am PDT Also returning this weekend, Miley Cyrus. New track Malibu brings with it a “gentle, sunny groove” Apple says, as the track marks Cyrus’ first new release since 2013‘s Bangerz. Meanwhile, alt-riser Amber Mark has dropped her debut recording: 3:33am. The S P A C E New Yorker provides a sonic melting pot that “reflects her childhood spent travelling multiple continents,” the iTunes editors note. Paul Weller is back with 29-track offering: A Kind Revolution. … and Imagine Dragons have announced new album Evolve. Apple TV Following a report last week from Re/code, which suggested Amazon and Apple had finally put their differences aside and inked that long-awaited deal to bring Prime Video to the Apple TV, Buzzfeed this week corroborated that the on-demand video service is in fact coming to Apple’s streaming box at WWDC, citing that Amazon is also expected to resume Apple TV sales upon its launch in the tvOS store. “As part of the arrangement between the two companies, Amazon — which stopped selling Apple TV devices two years ago, when it also banned Google’s Chromecast devices from its virtual shelves — will resume selling Apple’s set-top box,” the site wrote. Movies Several notable movies are getting their release this weekend, too.

Apple announced that it will pour another $1 billion into the data campus at the Reno Technology Park in the Truckee River canyon east of Sparks, bringing “hundreds of jobs in operations and construction,” according to Apple executive Mike Foulkes. In turn, Apple’s $89 million in state and property and sales tax abatements awarded in 2012 with its original $1 billion investment will increase — and that’s not all. Part of the addition will include a $4 million, 27,000 square-foot warehouse for shipping and receiving built on a vacant lot in downtown Reno, originally part of a tourism improvement district created in 2009. Because the Reno City Council voted on Wednesday to allow Apple to buy the land instead of leasing it, the company is now eligible to take advantage of a tourism tax break that will lower its sales tax rate to 0.5 percent from 8.265 percent, according to the Reno Gazette Journal. Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval said in a statement that the Reno facility was “the first major economic development success in northern Nevada and helped place this region on the technology and innovation map.” He continued, “Apple’s decision to increase their local investment by $1 billion is a testament to our successful partnership and a demonstration that the best companies in the world are coming to Nevada, creating hundreds of jobs, investing in our communities and making our state their permanent home.” See also: How Reno Became a Data Center Hub: A Timeline The Apple data center is not the only massive server farm that feels at home and appreciated in Nevada. Massive Switch SuperNap is in Reno with eBay as the anchor tenant, and news came out in April that Google had acquired 1,210 acres in Nevada’s Tahoe Reno Industrial Center that will house a future data center. In a show of support for creating more manufacturing jobs in the US, Apple announced  a new $1 billion fund last week to make its vital role known in the national economy. The company broke down employment by state, showing where its 80,000 employees work. As you might have figured, more than half are in Silicon Valley.

Maybe It’s More Like Apple Following Snap’s less than stellar earnings report, one analyst says: ‘Snap reminds us of Apple in its younger days.’ By Emily Bary May 12, 2017 10:25 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Snap is innovating more than other companies on the camera front, and one analyst says the company reminds him of a young Apple. Illustration: Getty Images Snap CEO Evan Spiegel thinks his company is like Google. Wall Street says Snap might be more like Twitter. Today, one bullish Snap analyst makes another comparison. Is Snap… Apple? “In an age of short-term thinking, imitation and a maniacal focus on the next quarterly earnings report, Snap is taking the road ‘less traveled’ and we believe this can make ‘all the difference’ in the long run,” Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White wrote in a note to clients. “In many ways, Snap reminds us of Apple in its younger days.” More from Barron’s Next Apple: It’s No Longer About the iPhone How Apple Is Trying to Fix This Weak Link Snap’s Disappearing Act Faces New Test With Investors Snap continues to focus on finding more uses for the camera and giving users more creative tools. Meanwhile, other companies, like Facebook, are just copying whatever Snap does. “We view Snap as an original in the camera app world and this authenticity will be tough for competitors to successfully replicate in the eyes of millennials,” White wrote. Snap has a long road ahead to become anything like Apple, the world’s largest company. Yes, Snap might be innovating more than anyone else on the smartphone camera front, but Facebook is aggressively pushing a camera-first strategy with its own in-app camera and a host of borrowed Snapchat features. Whatever Facebook tries is seen by most of its 1.3 billion daily users; Snap’s user base is just 166 million daily users. Then again, Apple once had behemoth Microsoft to deal with. And, after a rough stretch in the 1990s, Apple more than overcame that threat, even as Microsoft was trying to copy some of its best innovations. If Snap is Apple, maybe Facebook is Microsoft. Big Picture: Investors are down on Snap following its first earnings report, but one analyst says the company is thinking about the long term.

Apple recently updated its Apple Pay participating banks and card issuers in Asia-Pacific support document with a new image of Europe that has Italy highlighted. The change isn't visible on the United States or Europe versions of the page, suggesting that it may have been added to the Asia-Pacific page prematurely. MacRumors discovered a colored version of the image stored on Apple's servers that makes it easier to see Italy highlighted. Apple's regional Italian website has listed Apple Pay as "coming soon" since March, so it's only a matter of time—WWDC?—before the payments service launches in the country. At launch, Apple Pay will work with Visa and MasterCard in Italy through participating banks UniCredit, Boon, and Carrefour Banca. Meanwhile, German blog iPhone-Ticker reports that Apple Pay should launch in Germany in the fall or winter. As in some other countries, however, the negotiations between Apple and German banks allegedly continue to be challenging, likely as both sides struggle to reach an agreement over fees and control. Last October, Germany was similarly highlighted on the Apple Pay availability map, but only for a brief period of time. Apple Pay launched in the United States in October 2014, and it has since expanded to 14 other countries and regions: Australia, Canada, China, France, Hong Kong, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. There was also a rumor that Belgium could be added this month. Related Roundup: Apple Pay Tags: Italy, Germany 17 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) Glassed Silver 15 hours ago at 08:50 am Germany is a market with a lot of purchasing power and I expect Apple to try and establish a cut from the transactions as high as possible, meanwhile the banks have ZERO reason to rush an agreement as long as they are all very confident that Apple is asking too much I guess. I mean, once they negotiate a rate I'm sure it will be harder to move away from it for banks especially. Also, Germans are VERY reluctant to change banks, so their negotiation power in this is a lot higher than most other places. Comments like "I changed banks to have Apple Pay" would be rather rare here save for the diehard Apple fans who read about Apple Pay every month on MR et all... Meanwhile, a range of mobile payment options have long been available. Whilst less secure, less flexible or less convenient and integrated, many of them seem to cover that basic urge to pay with the phone just fine. Another hit to the negotiation power that Apple may have. Glassed Silver:mac Rating: 6 Votes MLVC 15 hours ago at 09:27 am It needs to get a (Western) European rollout to be really successful, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxemburg, Denmark, Austria e.g. need to be added as well. I understand that if you live in Berlin you don't travel abroad that easily but NRW e.g., they get around. People who live near borders easily shop in one country and have dinner in the other one these days. Rating: 2 Votes Daku93 15 hours ago at 09:13 am There are many Germans already using Apple Pay with a Boon Account from France or Ireland. If you have any trouble with it, you can even call the German Wirecard support and they are more than willing to help you. (You can even enter a German address when creating your account and you will get a German IBAN for your account there) So, technically Apple Pay is kind of available in Germany already. You just have to download the App from the British, French or Irish App Store.

Another hit to the negotiation power that Apple may have. Glassed Silver:mac The situation in Germany sounds a little like that in Australia, but to a greater extent in Germany. Here in Australia almost everyone has an NFC card and almost every were accepts NFC payments, but ApplePay is only available from one of the big four banks. It is my understanding that the issue in negotiation with three of the big banks is the transaction fee. In Australia the transaction fee is usually paid by the retailer and many retailer have a $10 minimum to pay by card or they charge the consumer 20c or 50c. Apple design ApplePay for the US where NFC payments were still new and "cool", the problem for them is that in many other parts of the world NFC is already implemented, so Apple is in a far weaker negotiating position in relation to transaction fees. Another issue that puts Apple is a weaker negotiating position in Germany, is the iPhone is far less popular there than US, UK or AU. source ('https://mspoweruser.com/here-are-the-kantar-smartphone-market-share-numbers-for-march-2017/').

Meanwhile people in all other countries start using them. 5 years later... all of a sudden... smartphones are great in Germany too... and nobody even remembers dismissing them. Same with tablets...

According to a 2016 survey by the Pew Research Center, 15 percent of Americans buy something online every week. As retailers look to personalize in-person shopping experiences through high-tech interaction, payment apps gain even greater pull with fashion connoisseurs.   Right now, PayPal is the biggest mobile payment company with widespread influence in fashion markets. Fashion merchants make up a hefty chunk of PayPal’s most active vendors, and PayPal communications manager Joe Gallo told International Business Times the fashion sector is also one of the top industries receiving small business loans from PayPal Working Capital. Shoppers can even use PayPal at major retailers like American Eagle and Nine West. But Apple Pay, which first debuted in 2014, is quickly catching up. Read: PayPal Sets Sights On Small Businesses, Offers New Toolkit for Business Owners Fortune magazine recently reported Apple Pay transactions rose 450 percent in the past year. The publically available figures still lack crucial context, like transaction types and volume. However, on the surface it looks like the payment app is more popular with brick-and-mortar stores than other competing apps. Research by Boston Retail Partners found Apple Pay is now accepted by 36 percent of U.S. merchants. Furthermore, 22 percent of surveyed retailers who don’t already, said they plan to start accepting Apple Pay within the year. This prospective growth with established retailers, combined with Apple’s reputation, puts Apple Pay in a much better position to conquer luxury fashion markets. Read: How To Use Apple Pay And Samsung Pay “Apple is a premium brand,” Stephan Schambach, the founder and chief executive officer of NewStore, told Digiday. “Since its customers have signaled they are willing to spend hundreds of dollars on devices, they are likely to do the same for other goods and experiences.” A recent study by retail commerce platform Branding Brand found that Apple Pay users tend to buy more “Apple Pay users overall are spending more than they do with PayPal,” Branding Brand CEO Chris Mason said in a press release. “On average, customers who checkout with Apple Pay spend 17 percent more than users who checkout with PayPal.” PayPal already has a few partnerships with luxury brands like Saks Fifth Avenue and Ralph Lauren. But Apple Pay is right on their heels with its own luxury partnerships, including Barneys New York and Sephora. Apple Pay also has a digital advantage compared to other mobile payment apps, a quicker login for online shoppers. Apple Pay is already available in France, home to the couture fashion capital Paris. And rumor has it that Italy, the luxury shoe motherland, may be next. All things considered, Apple Pay may earn the tech company more clout with fashion consumers than any of its previous watches and wearables.   Join the Discussion Most Read Newsletter Everything You Need To Know, Right Now Sign up for the newsletter.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 12, 2017 12:13pm   Comments Share: Related AAPL The Upside Of Apple Making Its First $1,000 Phone Momentum Investing As A Strategy Dow ETF Dips As Apple Lifts, GE Drags; This Sector Gets Slammed Again (Investor's Business Daily) Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has long been a formidable force in the technology space — and it still has room to grow. Bank of America Merrill Lynch considers Apple’s total adjustable market to be much larger than what’s presently perceived for existing products. According to a Friday note, the firm expects expansion into untapped or barely grazed markets, such as healthcare or automotive, to significantly bolster the company’s current 10-percent share of global consumer spending. And with $158 billion in net cash, mergers and acquisitions make adjacent market penetration entirely plausible. Current Trajectory Not considering Apple’s potential to tap into new markets, Merrill Lynch foresees revenue growth from $218 billion in 2016 to $283 billion in 2018. Between the second quarters of 2015 and 2017, Apple posted increasing revenue from its Services division and sales of iPhone, iPod, Apple Watch and accessories lines, even as iPad and Mac revenue declined. Apple generally seizes about 31 percent of consumer spending on computers, 42 percent on tablets, 35 percent on smartphones and 28 percent on wearables. Merrill Lynch thus perceives a $350 billion opportunity with market share expansion among existing businesses. However, yet unexplored products offer additional, long-term revenue opportunity upward of $100 billion. Unrealized Potential Total consumer IT spending partly comprises smartphones (43 percent), desktops and laptops (9 percent), tablets (4 percent) and wearables (2 percent) — product lines on which Apple already capitalizes. However, it has the technological capacity to branch into and control the other 42 percent. With strategic adjustments, it could tap television (26 percent), video game consoles (2 percent), cameras (3 percent) and video players (2 percent), as well as the booming business of virtual reality, which is expected to yield a $30 billion TAM in 2020. Apple can also permeate a $4.6 billion market for music streaming. Merrill Lynch identified an Apple Music market share of $1.2 billion in 2016, which leaves another $3.4 billion of TAM to seize. Meanwhile, the video and video game industries offer $10.3 billion and $12.6 billion, respectively. “In our opinion, Apple is well positioned to capture share in the video game market using its iOS platform, but also to leverage that more broadly over time to support an experience similar to console gaming,” Merrill Lynch wrote. “Further recent hires suggest that the capability of the Apple TV can incorporate console gaming and set-top box all integrated into a single product down the road.” Then there’s the $7.5 billion potential for Siri to rival Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN)’s Echo and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)’s Home, as well as to shift into the autonomous vehicle market. Merrill Lynch predicts that the latter could generate $1 billion in revenue by 2020 and $27 billion by 2025. Finally, the company’s wearables could yield additional opportunities in healthcare. With Apple Watch’s monitoring capabilities, the introduction of HealthKit and ResearchKit, and new partnerships with medical organizations, Apple is aligned for significant disruption in the health space. “We believe that Apple is on the cusp of playing a larger role in the healthcare industry as the company continues to set the groundwork by establishing stringent privacy controls, positioning itself to be a major contender in the battle to gain control over the mass aggregation of health-related data,” Merrill Lynch wrote. Considering long-term growth, the firm reiterated a Buy rating on Apple with a $180 price target. At the time of publication, shares were trading around $155.56, up 1.6 percent on the day.

But one thing that stood out among the various announcements by Microsoft was a renewed focus on the Windows Store, which is increasingly looking like a central piece of the future of Microsoft’s operating system. A renewed focus on the Windows Store When the Windows Store launched back in 2012 alongside Windows 8 and Windows RT, things were very different. Fueled by the massive success of Apple’s iOS App Store, tech companies were running to create storefronts of their own to keep up (including Apple, who released the far less successful Mac App Store in 2011), and Microsoft wasn’t going to get left out. But the Windows Store was a confusing mess in 2012. Windows 8 ran on Intel’s x86 / x64 architectures, while Windows RT ran on ARM, but the two shared a store, meaning that the apps on offer had to be ARM compatible since everything in Windows Store had to also run on RT. That meant that the Windows Store of old was essentially just Metro-ized, tablet-focused applications that were designed to compete with Apple’s iPad, instead of allowing the store to serve as a repository of traditional Windows programs. Additionally, software built with the popular .NET and Win32 frameworks wasn’t eligible for the store, making it virtually impossible for many popular programs to be available without fundamentally remaking things from scratch specifically for Windows 8 / 10. Microsoft has learned a lot since the initial lackluster launch of the Windows Store But Microsoft has learned a lot since the initial lackluster launch of the Windows Store. Windows 10 introduced the Universal Windows Platform, which made it easier for developers to create applications that would work on multiple platforms. And last year at Build 2016, Microsoft announced a Desktop Bridge Tool that would help port traditional .NET and Win32 Windows desktop applications to Windows Store-compatible versions. And of last year, all future first-party Xbox One games will be offered as cross-compatible Windows 10 options through the shared Windows Store as part of the Xbox Play Anywhere program, giving Microsoft a viable incentive for users to use the Windows Store over competitors like Steam. The recent news from Microsoft builds on that: Windows 10 for ARM — in essence, Microsoft’s second shot at RT — will be able to run almost any x86 application through emulation whether installed through the Windows Store or not, fixing one of RT’s biggest flaws. Microsoft seems so confident that it can get developers to put real desktop applications on the Windows Store that the new Windows 10 S operating system will only be able to run store apps. And the company is wasting no time on corralling some big names to the Windows Store, including iTunes, Spotify, and even several Linux distros. Instead of the store serving as the lowest common denominator of basic ARM apps, Microsoft is rebuilding it as the core of any Windows software experience. You may have to go farther afield to install something like Photoshop, but most of what you need should be right there on the store. Microsoft is rebuilding the store as the core of any Windows software experience If Microsoft can really convince users and developers alike to take another chance and embrace the Windows Store, it could change Windows as we know it. Installing and uninstalling software would be dramatically easier for users (rather than requiring a user to download an executable file, install it, and hope that the developer included some kind of uninstaller for when they want to get rid of it). A central store would also make software updates easier. Additionally, Microsoft recently added an option in the Windows 10 Creators Update to optionally block installing applications that aren’t from the Windows Store, similar to Apple’s Gatekeeper feature on OS X. In a world where the Windows Store is robust enough to offer all the programs you need, Windows then becomes significantly more secure for end users. Image via MSPoweruser Oh, and there are some big benefits for Microsoft if it can pull this off, too, given that the company gets a nice 30 percent cut of app purchases. (And if Apple’s iOS App Store revenue is anything to go by, this could translate into a pretty big windfall.) Microsoft is fighting an uphill battle Of course, Microsoft is fighting an uphill battle. Remember, Apple tried a similar tactic with the Mac App Store, which never had the problems of Microsoft’s multiplatform confusion. But between sandboxing restrictions that limit what apps can do, and the fact that it was tough to convince developers to fork over 30 percent of their profits when they could just as easily sell it on their own, the Mac App Store has yet to become an indispensable part of the operating system. Whether or not Microsoft and its more lenient policies can succeed where Apple failed is still up for debate, but taking all the recent news from the company together, it’s clear that the Windows Store is going to be a major focus point for Microsoft going forward. Now Microsoft has to get its developers and users to follow step.

Get a secure messaging app and worry no more. Read More for iOS and Mac users. Last year Apple paved the way for a richer iMessage experience, with the introduction of iMessage apps (or extensions) in iOS 10 for iPhone and iPad users. That means you can now do a lot more than simply send text, voice, picture, and video messages. Once you’ve mastered the basics How to Use All the New Messages Features in iOS 10 How to Use All the New Messages Features in iOS 10 With the arrival of iOS 10, Apple's Messages app received its single biggest update since its introduction. Read More , why not try out a few of the apps below? Install and Use iMessage Apps If your outgoing messages within a conversation are blue, then you’re using iMessage (if they’re green, then many of these apps won’t work). You can access iMessage apps by tapping the “>” arrow near the text input box on any iMessage conversation. From here, tap the App Store icon. You can hit the button in the bottom-left corner to access a list of available apps including the store. Hit Store to find apps by category or using the search feature in the top-left corner. You can hit Manage to turn apps on or off. Many regular apps (like Dropbox) have iMessage components, and you can enable or disable them from the Manage tab. This is especially handy for games that often include stickers you have no interest in seeing. Once an app is installed, head back to the menu and tap on it to launch it. And that’s really all there is to it! 1. Play Games This one’s pretty obvious, but there are many games that lend themselves well to the asynchronous nature of an iMessage conversation. These include favorites like Words With Friends, Four in a Row, and chess app Checkmate! ($0.99). Playing pool in iMessage belike: pic.twitter.com/tHXcKduQuG — …..

Here are nine great games you can play instead. Read More  and recommend your own in the comments below. 2. Share Your Location You can share your location easily with other iMessage users simply by tapping the i button in the top-right corner then hitting Send My Current Location. This is fine if you want to use Apple Maps Is Apple Maps a Reliable Navigator Yet? Is Apple Maps a Reliable Navigator Yet? After replacing Google's navigation, Apple Maps endured a rocky start, heaps of criticism and some very funny jokes – but has all been forgiven? Read More , but if you’d rather use a better mapping service, install Google Maps and enable the iMessage app. You can then hit Send to get an exact location fix and send a web link to the other party. 3. Send GIFs Despite the arrival of WebM video and high-speed internet, the world still loves GIFs — so why not liven up your conversations with some looping animations? Apple provides you with an app called #images for this task, which is a Bing-powered animated image search, and it does the job. If you’d like to step it up a bit, then Giphy is the best tool for the job. Don’t miss Giphy Cam either, which allows you to create your own GIFs to share with friends. 4. Go Crazy With Stickers The vast majority of iMessage apps are sticker packs, which allow you to send still images and animations to friends for a laugh. Stickers go a step further than regular old images as they can be picked up, dragged, and then placed over messages and images you’ve already sent. It’s not entirely a useful feature, but there are stickers out there that can brighten your everyday conversations. I’d recommend browsing for something that matches your taste, as there’s so much to pick from. I grabbed Apple’s Classic Mac and Microsoft’s Halo Stickers for free. Don’t miss Giphy Stickers for more animated fun or Bitmoji if you’d like to create your own sticker avatar. 5. Share Some Music Apple’s built-in Music app for iMessage lets you quickly share a song with a friend. Launch it, and you’ll find the last few songs you played, along with the currently playing item, which you can send with a tap. This will provide them with a “playable” iTunes link, which may or may not be useful depending on whether they have Apple Music or not Spotify vs. Apple Music vs. Amazon Music Unlimited: Which Is Best?

If you really want to share the song that’s playing right now (in the room), then Shazam lets you do that in record time. Launch it, hit Shazam, and as soon as the song is identified a Shazam link is added to the text box.

Send Private or Self-Destructing Text and Media You can already hide what you’re sending in iMessage with the aid of iOS 10’s new features How to Use All the New Messages Features in iOS 10 How to Use All the New Messages Features in iOS 10 With the arrival of iOS 10, Apple's Messages app received its single biggest update since its introduction. Read More . Simply type a message or choose a photo, then 3D Touch the Send button (squeeze it quickly Everything You Can Do With 3D Touch on Your iPhone Everything You Can Do With 3D Touch on Your iPhone 3D touch is really just a fancy name for a pressure-sensitive screen, but adds a whole array of extra input options to iOS. Read More ), then choose Invisible Ink. If you’re using an iPhone 6 or similar older device, you’ll need to tap and hold the Send button instead. The recipient will need to swipe across your message to reveal its contents, handy if you don’t want someone peeking over their shoulder. If you want to take things a step further, then try out the free app Confide, which allows for self-destructing text and photo messages. The app features end-to-end encryption just like iMessage, and though there are premium options available, core functionality is 100 percent free. 7. Talk About the Weather Being British, I can talk about the weather for hours, especially living in one of the most meteorologically changeable cities in the world (Melbourne, Australia). If you want to take things a step further, you can use an iMessage-friendly weather app to quickly check and share the forecast while chatting away. The Weather Channel provides basic free forecast sharing functionality, while CARROT Weather ($3.99) is probably the funniest weather app money can buy. Don’t miss Weathershot the next time you need to brag about the weather with a selfie, or MOON if you’re a werewolf. 8. Translate Your Conversation There are a lot of translation apps on the App Store, but not all of them play nicely with iMessage. It’s also worth keeping in mind that translation and language-learning services often require a premium contribution. So the best apps for the job aren’t necessarily free. Fortunately, the best tools come with a good free option. iTranslate is great, providing unhindered access to a huge number of languages while you’re connected to the web (offline translation requires an in-app purchase). Yandex Translate is a free option with offline support, but it isn’t quite as well-designed as iTranslate. It’s a huge shame that the excellent Google Translate app for iOS doesn’t have iMessage functionality. If the company expands the app to include this functionality in the future, then it could be the only translation tool you’d ever need. 9. Find a Film Planning a trip to the cinema with a group of friends? Thinking of an older film but want to convince someone to watch it with you? Enter IMDb and its iMessage extension, which provides you with a list of films showing nearby (provided you’ve granted location access) and a searchable IMDb database right from the Messages app. Once you’ve found something, simply tap it to send an IMDb link to the film. 10. Share Files in the Cloud iCloud isn’t so great when it comes to file sharing, and that’s why there’s no iMessage app for sharing items in your iCloud Drive. But both Dropbox and Microsoft OneDrive have added this functionality. If you already use either of these services, you likely already have the app installed. You can enable the iMessage extension from the Manage tab under the iMessage App Store. Once installed, each of these apps allows you to browse and share files directly to a conversation. OneDrive even allows you to open files quickly in Microsoft’s other apps, like Word and Excel. 11. Send a Quick Scan If you’re not already storing invoices and receipts digitally using a scanning app Scan & Manage Your Receipts, Save Space, Paper & Time Scan & Manage Your Receipts, Save Space, Paper & Time Paper receipts are easily lost and hard to find when you need them most. Thankfully, going digital solves both of these problems. Read More , do yourself a favor and make the switch to paperless. Owners of the premium Scanner Pro ($3.99) app can add an iMessage extension under the usual Manage tab. If you’re looking for a free iMessage-friendly scanner, give ScanBot a shot. Both of these apps handle the scanning, converting, and sending process without having to leave the Messages app. 12. Check a Math Formula Finally, if you’re a mathematics student who needs to bounce ideas of your classmates, then Vulcanize is the app for you. It allows you to convert LaTeX to beautiful mathematical formulas worthy of any printed textbook. Which iMessage Apps Do You Use? iMessage extensions may seem like a gimmick, but the right apps can really help speed up your workflow and brighten your everyday conversations. Whether you’re playing word games, sending dank memes to your friends, or saving a precious few seconds by optimizing your workflow, iMessage apps are worth a second look.

More like this The best fitness trackers at every price point Apple quietly acquires Beddit’s sleep-tracking monitor and iOS app Research shows the Apple Watch can detect an early sign of heart disease Video What happens to companies that depend on the iPhone? Over the past few decades, Apple has revolutionized the personal computer, the smartphone, and digital music, just to name a few. But the company’s next target might be its biggest yet: human health. That should hardly be a surprise at this point. Those who have been paying attention have seen Apple heading in this direction since before Tim Cook took over as CEO. Probably, not coincidentally, since around the time that Steve Jobs was first diagnosed with the illness that eventually took his life. Mortality confronts us all at some point. But, to paraphrase the old expression, nobody ever does anything about it. Apple, however, is using its broad expertise in a number of realms to push forward its health agenda. [ Further reading: The best Ultra-HD Blu-ray players ] Apple Watch and HealthKit The most obvious evidence of Apple’s push for a healthy lifestyle has come from its products, especially the Apple Watch. Health and fitness have been cornerstones of the watch since its incarnation and, I would argue, have also been its most successful applications. With features from those Activity rings to workout tracking to heart-rate monitoring, the Apple Watch seems positioned as almost a Trojan horse to get health into the lives of technophiles. (I’ve lost track of the number of friends with Apple Watches who have seized upon closing those rings every day as a personal challenge.) But the Apple Watch doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Apple’s Health app on iOS and the HealthKit framework that support it provide a central clearinghouse for health-related data, which other apps and accessories can access and use to provide us more insight about how we’re living our lives. This in turn can help us make better decisions about our health. And that doesn’t even dip into the work Apple is doing to try and bolster health studies with the development of ResearchKit. Over the last couple years, Apple has made health an integral part of its ecosystem for consumers, and by doing so has not only appealed to those who were already fitness conscious, but also to those who probably gave it little thought before. Apple’s taken a similar tack before: Time Machine for backing up your data comes to mind. As with Time Machine, the Apple Watch took a behavior we all knew we should do—backing up our computers, exercising more—and cut through the confusion and frustration to make it happen. What comes next? Nor does the company look to be stopping its health foray anytime soon. If anything, it’s intensifying its focus, if two recent developments are any indication. The first was a series of rumors about the company developing a way to monitor glucose levels in order to help diabetics manage their blood sugar levels. This is traditionally very difficult, if not impossible, to do in a non-invasive way, but reports claim that Apple has been at work on a method for years. Accuracy and reliability are essential, as people’s lives depend on it, but if the technology proves feasible it could truly change the lives of many folks with diabetes, and open the door to other types of monitoring, like blood oxygen levels. Also, Apple acquired Beddit, a company that makes a monitoring device that slips under your sheets and tracks how soundly you sleep. It’s been rumored that sleep-tracking could be a major feature of an upcoming watchOS 4, though it also seems that a Beddit-like accessory could be more useful, both in terms of how its sensors actually measure your sleep and in terms of practicality: wearing your Apple Watch all night while having it track your sleep is a good way to run down the battery. Tim Cook’s influence While Apple’s health-tracking initiatives might have started in the era of the late Steve Jobs, it’s impossible to overstate the importance of the company’s current CEO. Three years ago I suggested that Apple’s health push—then rumored to be called Healthbook—could be the first real product of Tim Cook’s Apple. That’s because, by all accounts, health and fitness seem to be as much a passion for Cook as music was for Jobs. And though a company as large as Apple is bigger than the proclivities of any one person, the person at the helm sets the direction. For Cook, that seems to be about health, generally, and also specifically about integrating it in a way that meshes with Apple’s mission of providing technology that not only delights users, but makes the world a better place. In contrast to Google, which at one point stated an avowed goal to solve death, Apple doesn’t seem to aspire to megalomaniacal ends. Instead, the company is focused on helping us make the most of the time that we do have by living healthy, active lives. And if that helps us keep going longer, well, that’s just a side benefit.

MobileHealthNews has learned that Raymann will serve as the company’s Vice President of Sleep Science and Scientific Affairs. Raymann’s LinkedIn profile states he helped develop the Night Shift and Bedtime features in iOS and Apple’s HealthKit and ResearchKit frameworks. Prior to joining Apple, Raymann led sleep research at Philips where he wrote papers on mild skin warming as a non-pharmacological method of altering sleep quality and alertness. His industry experience encompasses areas like specialized wearable devices, dedicated sleep-tracking sensors and non-pharmacological methods of improving sleep quality. When Apple hired him back in 2014, observes speculated that Apple Watch would include built-in functions to let users track how well they slept at night. The wearable gadget debuted without any sleep-tracking features, but App Store offers a bunch of specialized sleep-tracking apps, like Sleep++ [review], HeartWatch, AutoSleep and others. A joint venture between renowned surgeon and television host Dr. Oz, medical devices vendor ResMed and private equity firm Pegasus Capital Advisors, SleepScore Labs is a new San Diego-based company focused on helping people understand and improve their sleep. From the company’s About page: SleepScore Labs is currently in the process of examining how people sleep by compiling and analyzing the most comprehensive and accurate collection of consumer sleep data on the planet. SleepScore Labs will use this data to deliver ultra-personalized insights, coaching, and validated solutions that enable you to make informed decisions about the behavioral and environmental factors that affect your sleep. Our goal is to help you get the best sleep of your life. Raymann’s departure comes hot on the heels of Apple’s acquisition of Beddit, a sleep-tracking app available free on App Store. Beddit’s dedicated sleep-tracking accessory can be purchased via Apple Online Store for $150.

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Benjamin Geskin Apple’s iPhone 8 will be the most expensive iPhone the world has ever seen Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 12th, 2017 at 11:46 AM Share Tweet Everyone’s excited by the new form factor and advanced features the iPhone 8 will bring to the table, but a new research note from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs (obtained by Business Insider) relays that upgrading to Apple’s next-gen iPhone won’t come cheap. Amid conflicting reports regarding the iPhone 8 price point, Jankowski writes that the base level iPhone 8 will cost $1,000. Notably, this jibes with previous rumors we’ve seen regarding Apple’s pricing plans. Don't Miss: Reliable leaker claims to reveal iPhone 8 launch timing, and it’s not what we’re expecting The bump up in price might seem jarring at first glance, yet it doesn’t seem unreasonable given the device’s advanced new design, larger display, and slew of new features. Accordingly, the BOM for the iPhone 8 will be significantly higher than any iPhone model released to date. Specifically, the entry-level iPhone 8 with 128GB of storage is said to cost $1,000 while a model with 256GB will cost $1,099. This makes the entry-level iPhone 8 upwards of $130 more expensive than Apple’s top of the line iPhone 7 Plus. Breaking down the considerable increase in iPhone 8 components, Jankowski’s research note relays the 5.8-inch OLED display alone will add $35 to the asking price. 5.8″OLED screen (adds $35) No bezel, all screen 3D sensing (adds $20) Better, faster NAND/DRAM memory (adds $16 to $29) Capacity starting at 128GB A11 processor No home button Biometric authentication All in all, the price bump we’ll see with the iPhone 8 doesn’t seem too outrageous. As is typical from Apple, the iPhone 8 will be a premium device geared for consumers willing to pay more to get more. Further, the iPhone 8 price point isn’t that far removed from Apple’s top of the line iPhone 7 Plus, a device that proved to be far more popular with consumers than even Apple anticipated. To this point, Jankowski adds that Apple’s larger-screened iPhone models have become increasingly popular with each successive iPhone release, which is to say that demand for premium iPhone models is growing. As for the other two devices in Apple’s 2017 iPhone lineup — the iPhone 7s and the iPhone 7s Plus — Jankowski believes that the devices will be priced at $649 and $769, respectively. All of that said, if the iPhone 8 design features a Touch ID sensor embedded into the display itself, I’m sure that consumers will flock to the device in droves, the $1,000 sticker price notwithstanding. Further, seeing as how the current iPhone design has grown somewhat stale, the prospect of a brand new iPhone model with an edge to edge OLED display will undoubtedly attract current iPhone owners who might not otherwise have even been in the market for an upgrade. Of course, the looming question surrounding Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 is whether or not Apple can actually release the highly anticipated device by September.

The product is currently available in three flavors, Cherry Lemonade, Mango Pear Lime, and Apple Grape, all of which are package in 8 oz. sleeve wrapped cans. In a recent press release, the company stated that they are trying to offer something that is an alternative to the bevvy of unhealthy and uncool beverages that target this age demographic. However, what they are after and what they’ve brought to market do not, at least in our opinion, line up all that well. First, there’s the liquid. These products are made with water and juice concentrates (14-71 percent). There’s also evaporated cane juice (sugar) in the Cherry Limeade variety. This isn’t really a new concept or something that can’t be found in other beverage lines (particularly juice boxes for kids). Yes, the particular flavor blends are unique, but among the three flavors, we didn’t taste anything that really stood out. They are fine, but far from exceptional, and taste quite similar to what you’ll find in juice boxes that are currently on the market. This makes the key point of differentiation the packaging and the branding. That’s obviously something that can be, if done right, a reason for a brand to succeed. But in the case of Planet Fuel, we think they’ve missed the mark. For starters, the look and feel of the product leans towards an older demographic. It has a serious and technical vibe  due to both the name, which evokes a functional beverage, and the design of the label, which features fruit images, a “splash,” and an easy to miss animal image. It’s hard to see a consumer looking at this and saying “this is a drink for me.” In its current form, Planet Fuel feels like a product that’s generic and only on trend to the extent that it’s USDA Organic certified. It otherwise feels like it’s lacking meaningful points of differentiation in both flavor and branding. That said, we’re left feeling as though this product can play at a level where it might compete on price, but it’s going to have a difficult time finding a large base of loyal consumers.

By Tiernan Ray May 12, 2017 11:08 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Shares of glass maker Corning (GLW) are up 11 cents, or 0.4%, at $28.91, after Apple (AAPL) this morning said it would invest $200 million in the company as part of what it calls its "Advanced Manufacturing Fund” to promote “innovation” in American manufacturing. Apple’s chief operating officer, Jeff Williams, lauded Corning as a “great example” and referred to the company’s glass facility in Harrodsburg, Pennsylvania. Apple notes the partnership to develop “Gorilla Glass,” since the first iPhone was introduced in 2007, has led to 1,000 jobs for Corning in the U.S. Overall, Apple claims 2 million jobs in the U.S. created by its spending, including 450,000 jobs attributable to spending on suppliers. That has led to one price-target increase this morning, from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. Lubert reiterates a Market Perform rating, but bumps his target up to $29 from $27.50, writing that he sees "evidence fundamentals at Corning remain healthy and to reflect the rise in peer group multiples." "That said, with the stock already trading at 15X our above consensus C2018E EPS of $1.95 we think much of the good news is reflected in valuation,” writes Lubert, "and recommend waiting for a pullback before potentially considering adding to a position in the company’s shares."

According to Korea Economic Daily, the company has invested in a new facility worth 269.7 billion Won ($238.50 million) dedicated for Apple’s orders which had an initial deal size of an estimated 200 billion Won. Apple and LG Innotek partnered last year when the iPhone 7 and and iPhone 7 Plus were launched. Currently LG Innotek supplies the dual-lens camera module for the iPhone 7 Plus as well as the LG G6. The upcoming facial recognition camera module is expected to be smaller than the current generation which is one of the reasons why they will be made at a dedicated facility . Almost all Android smartphones come with facial recognition but those are mostly 2D based making them less secure. A 3D based facial recognition camera would definitely have better accuracy and be more reliable and suitable for security purposes. The deal with Apple could be a win-win situation for LG Innotek in the long-term. According to analysts the company’s camera module sales could go up to 1.5 trillion Won in the fourth quarter this year which would be a jump from 400 billion Won in the first quarter.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Apple’s first Advanced Manufacturing Fund investment goes to Corning Eric Abent - May 12, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Back at the beginning of the month, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that his company would set aside $1 billion for a new “Advanced Manufacturing Fund.” At the time, Cook didn’t say who would ultimately benefit from this fund, but today we’re learning that Corning will be the first company to get an investment from it. Corning, as many of you already know, is the company behind Gorilla Glass, which adorns many phones on the market today. With this investment, Corning will be receiving $200 million of the $1 billion in the Advanced Manufacturing Fund. Apple announced the fund to push money to US companies that perform advanced manufacturing, hopefully supporting job growth in the States. Corning has been an Apple supplier for 10 years now, making it a rather obvious target for investment from the fund. In its announcement today, Apple said that this $200 million will go toward “Corning’s R&D, capital equipment needs and state-of-the-art glass processing.” Corning’s Harrodburg facility is the focus of this investment, with Corning CEO Wendell P. Weeks saying that the investment will ensure the plant “remains a global center of excellence for glass technology.” Weeks also pointed out that Apple’s long-standing partnership has helped Corning create 1,000 jobs in US. Zooming out on that statistic a bit, Apple said that it supports 450,000 US jobs through spending and investment with suppliers – not a paltry number by any means. There’s still $800 million left to go with this investment fund, so we can look to Apple to spread a lot more money around. It may not stop at $1 billion either, as Apple has pledged “at least” that amount through the Advanced Manufacturing Fund. Apple certainly has hit the ground running, so we might just hear about the next investment recipient shortly.

As rumored, Goldman Sachs believes Apple will launch three new iPhones in September. "We expect the iPhone 8 to have 128GB and 256GB models priced at $999 and 1,099 respectively," analyst Simona Jankowski. Goldman predicts: ● iPhone 8 — $999 (£775) ● iPhone 7s Plus — $769 (£596) ● iPhone 7s — $649 (£503) Jankowski believes that Apple has now locked down the design of its new smartphone. "Apple usually explores multiple designs in parallel. However, with only 4 months left until launch, we believe Apple has now locked down the design." Here's the features Goldman expects: ● 5.8"OLED screen (adds $35) ● No bezel, all screen ● 3D sensing (adds $20) ● Better, faster NAND/DRAM memory (adds $16 to $29) ● Capacity starting at 128GB ● A11 processor ● No home button ● Biometric authentication Recent reports suggest that Apple suppliers may have solved component yield issues and that production is on schedule for a September unveiling and October launch.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing iTunes Is Coming to the Windows Store, but Still No Non-Edge Browsers iTunes Is Coming to the Windows Store, but Still No Non-Edge Browsers By Joel Hruska on May 12, 2017 at 7:30 am Comment Microsoft’s Terry Meyerson raised eyebrows on Thursday when he announced Apple would bring iTunes to the Windows Store. What’s less clear is whether those eyebrows went up in joy or horror — Apple’s iTunes isn’t technically required if you want to use an iPhone any longer, but it still enjoys widespread mindshare, and can be used for local backups, software updates, and playlist management. Bringing iTunes to the Windows Store is a significant feat for Microsoft, even if the actual need for the software isn’t what it once was. In the same way that Apple Macs gained market share once they were capable of running Windows (even if a majority of Mac owners don’t use it), being able to advertise iTunes support in the Windows Store is a way for Microsoft to talk up the compatibility options and strengthening ecosystem of Windows 10’s store, even if most people don’t use it, either. And Microsoft needs quite a few more of these wins if it ever wants to persuade people that a laptop running Windows 10 S is a viable replacement for standard Windows. I don’t use the word “persuade” by accident. I think Windows 10 S, which restricts users to apps that they can download from the Windows Store, has a valid role to play, particularly given how Google has turned Chromebooks into educational devices. Microsoft doesn’t want to see kids and teenagers using Chrome OS for their computing needs, and ceding the education market to Google in the K-18 segment is practically giving away the collegiate market later. Microsoft wants people on Windows, and it’s taking the steps necessary to keep them there. What’s more surprising is that Apple even agreed to such a move, given the company’s general lack of enthusiasm for supporting platforms other than its own. But Microsoft’s willingness to embrace other companies’ products clearly has its limits. According to Ed Bott, Chrome and other browsers definitively won’t be coming to the Windows Store, even though Microsoft has created tools that could simplify this process. The reason, according to a Microsoft representative: Desktop Browsers installed from the Store aren’t more secured by default. They are secure only if, like Edge, they’re true UWP apps, so they run in a sandbox environment and they don’t have access to the overall system. Converted apps, instead, have some components which are virtualized (like the registry or file system redirection) but, except for that, they have the “runFullTrust” capability, so [they] can go out from the sandbox and perform operations that can be malicious. There are, of course, good reasons to treat the browser like a special piece of software, given the hooks it has to the operating system and the manner in which browser security flaws can be exploited to give critical access to the rest of the OS. But it’s hard to ignore the fact that these same arguments are also being deployed by Microsoft as a reason not to allow third-party browsers on its own platform. One could argue, however, that any user anger over that limitation reflects an old way of looking at the situation — one in which Microsoft has unquestioned and absolute control over what operating system people use in the first place. If you view the PC world as being comprised of Macs and PCs, than this view makes sense. If you think of it as being made up of Android, iOS, Windows, and Chrome OS, then Microsoft no longer has anything like a monopoly, and its actions here aren’t necessarily those of an entrenched monopoly throwing its weight around — they’re more like those of an embattled competitor trying to carve out meaningful distinction for its own products.

After years of neck and neck rivalry over video, the Amazon Prime video app will be coming to Apple TV, according to a Buzzfeed report. Apple will break the news at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June, the report says, with the app ready for users as soon as this summer.  Popular Searches Microsoft Corp MSFT ▼ 68.38 -0.08 -0.12% Southern Co SO ▲ 49.87 +0.10 +0.20% Georgia Power Co GPEPRA ▲ 27.90 +0.15 +0.54% United Continental Holdings Inc UAL ▼ 76.41 -0.95 -1.23% So the rumors you might've heard last week may indeed be true. For Amazon Prime members, the one glaring strike against Apple TV has been its inability to stream Amazon video content. Apple's iOS mobile devices have long supported a stripped-down version of Amazon's video app that doesn't allow purchases. But the app, in any form, has never been available for Apple TV. Competing set-top boxes from Roku, meanwhile, support all the major streaming apps and allow for movie rentals and purchases directly through those apps. At the heart of the conflict is the fact that Amazon Video and Apple iTunes are rival services. In 2015, Amazon stopped selling Apple TV and Google Chromecast boxes because Amazon didn't want its customers returning boxes after they discovered Prime Video streaming wasn't supported. As part of the agreement between the two companies, Amazon will reportedly begin selling Apple's set-top box again, according to Buzzfeed. Neither Apple nor Amazon responded to a request for comment.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

(Photo: Karen Bleier, AFP/Getty Images) 20355 CONNECTTWEET 922 LINKEDIN 26 COMMENTEMAILMORE I’ve had big-time battery drain issues on my last three iPhones. I just figured it was my fault — maybe I’m too addicted to apps, take too many photos, or just use my phone too much? It’s an issue I’ve gone to Apple for help with many times. But the Genius’s — Apple's retail support — were flummoxed, too. After the typical troubleshooting: Update iOS? Check. Adjust screen brightness? Check. Use Wi-Fi when possible, turn off location services, and tone down notifications? Check, check, and check again. Nothing seems to solve the issues. Maybe I got the phone wet? It was time to kick things up to the next level. I enlisted experts like Scotty Loveless, a former Apple Genius and iOS tech who told me this would not be another, “turn off every useful feature of iOS posts…” because those “really grind my gears.” Finally, someone speaking my language! With that said, here’s how I finally beat the worst of my battery battles — and now you can, too. #1 Start with your own battery test Your battery should only be doing its heavy lifting when you’re actually using your iPhone, and the rest of the time it should be relaxing in standby mode. Sometimes an app prevents your phone from going into standby and wreaks havoc on your battery life. Here’s how to test it: Go into Settings > Battery. Scroll all the way down to the bottom and you’ll find two numbers, one for Standby and one for Usage. Your Usage number should be way, way lower than your Standby number. If it’s not, you might have a problem, and you can confirm it by jotting down your Standby and Usage times and then clicking the lock button on your phone. Let it sit for about five minutes and then check the numbers again. If your Standby time is five minutes higher, you’re in good shape, but if your Usage time has bumped up by a more than a minute it’s a sign that your phone isn’t resting like it should. On Android, you can get the same information under Settings > Device > Battery (or Settings > Battery if you have a newer version of Android). The information on this menu is essentially the same as it is on an iPhone, and lists “Device Idle” which is the same as standby mode. If you find that your phone isn’t “resting” when you’re not using it, there’s likely a very clear reason, which brings us to #2. #2 Don’t push me When an app is doing things even when you’re not using it, it could be malfunctioning, and stuck in an endless loop that’s draining all your power. That’s what happened to me, with, of all things, one of the email accounts I had connected to my phone. Loveless picked up on this right away. “This happens unbelievably often, especially with Exchange push email,” he said. “I knew when you told me your phone typically dies within six hours of being off the charger, and the Standby and Usage are the same. Sometimes, these times are not the same because the ‘firmware is bad or corrupted,’ but this time it’s because push email is keeping the phone from sleeping properly.” The fix was simple. Go into Settings > Mail > Accounts> Fetch New Data. Mine was automatically set to Push. Loveless recommended that I set it turn that off temporarily and set it to Fetch every 15 to 30 minutes instead. You can also use the Manual mode, which only scans for new messages when you actually open the email app. You can also tweak the push settings to fetch new emails only every hour or so, which is also a big help. You don’t sacrifice timely email updates either, though you’ll still save the most power by disabling push emails altogether. On an Android phone, you can manage the push notification settings for any apps that use it by heading into Settings > Apps and then picking an app and tweaking its individual settings. #3 When background apps are the killer There are other times too when an app is running when you’re not using it and that’s called “Background App Refresh.” There are lots of reasons apps update in the background, like the Music app fetching new playlists, Facebook updating your social feeds, and even Pokemon Go keeping an eye on your steps so you can hatch eggs. It’s all in the name of convenience, but it might also be leaving you with a dead battery halfway through the afternoon. To check out which apps are eating up valuable power in the background go to Settings > Battery and you’ll see a list of the apps taking up your battery life, with the topmost app being the biggest power hog. If you see an app listed with “Background Activity” below it, that’s when you know it’s using power even when you’re not using it. Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, and streaming apps like Apple Music can be real demons in this department, so head to your Settings > General > Background App Refresh page and toggle off any apps you don’t want working overtime to save some serious juice. #4 Multitasking is OK A 2013 file photo shows a person using an Apple iPhone 5c mobile phone at an Apple store in New York, NY.  (Photo: Justin Lane, EPA) Do you ever double-tap your home button and see all the apps your iPhone has suspended, waiting for you to go back to them? Whenever I do, I always close them out of instinct, thinking that they must be eating up battery life, right? Nope! In fact, Loveless says that closing apps from the multitasking menu can actually hurt the iPhone’s overall battery life, and for a totally logical reason. Just because you see an app sitting in the multitasking menu doesn’t mean it's actually using your battery life at all — it's just paused, sitting in the phone’s memory and not doing much of anything. When you close it, the phone shuts it down, but when you inevitably open the app back up, it forces your phone to load all that data back up again, and that means it’s using valuable power and ticking down your reserves. Just leave the apps alone and you’ll be doing yourself and your battery a favor. On Android, finding the apps that are running is as easy as pulling the top menu bar down, which brings up a list of the apps either running or paused. You can choose to close them, but again, the idea is that by leaving them on you’re actually saving more power, so just leave them be. #5 Low-power mode can add hours to your battery life Android and iOS both come with low-power features that let you turn off almost all of your phone’s extra features anytime and save tons of energy throughout the day. You can turn it on when the battery drops to 20% or much earlier — by going to Settings > Battery > Low Power Mode and switching it on. On Android, the battery saving feature kicks in automatically if you leave your settings as-is, but you can also manually turn it on by going to Settings > Battery then tap the menu icon and select “Battery Saver.” It can be a real life saver, and it has the bonus benefit of preventing even more battery stress by depleting a dying battery even further than it already is. There are other little things you can do, too, which many other writers have mentioned. But fixing the email and background activity issues on my own phone has already added more than FOUR HOURS of battery life back into my day. That’s nothing short of a miracle in my book.

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | May 12, 2017 -- 15:05 GMT (08:05 PDT) | Topic: iPhone Image: Sarah Tew/CNET While Apple likes to focus on making new iPhones lighter, thinner, and faster, I'd rather the iPhone 8 get these five features. cloud tv Cloud migration: Dipping in a toe before diving all in The Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine rebuilt its data warehouse on the Google Cloud Platform, taking advantage of pay-as-you-go pricing to make sure it was the right move.

There are plenty of high-end -- and not so high-end -- smartphones that can get a decent charge in a quarter of an hour, and it's time for Apple to add this to its premium smartphone. #2: Shatterproof screen There's no doubt that Gorilla Glass is tough, but it's still glass. Glass has a habit of shattering. And with rumors suggesting that Apple is putting glass on the back of the iPhone too -- to support wireless charging -- there will be twice as much glass to break. A sapphire display would be awesome, but a seriously toughened display such as that found on the Motorola Droid Turbo 2 would do fine. How to securely erase any hard drive, SSD,... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 8 NEXT PREV #3: microSD card slot Apple uses tiered storage as a way to ask big bucks for what is essentially a few dollars worth of extra storage. Also, the lack of an expansion slot means that if owners hit a storage wall, well, it's time to buy a new iPhone with even more storage. I mean, if the tenth-anniversary iPhone 8 is $1,000 or more, then Apple should be bold and stop nickel-and-diming buyers for more storage. Alternatively, you can add your own microSD card slot ... sort of. #4: Higher-resolution camera Twelve megapixels isn't really that much when it comes to a camera, and despite the fact that the Plus version of the iPhone has a twin-camera arrangement, it's time for Apple to push the megapixel envelope with the next release. I know that image quality isn't down to just the number of megapixels, but at the end of the day, the more detail captured by the camera, the more detail will be in the photo, and the more processing and refining that can be done. #5: More system RAM While 3 gigabytes of RAM as found in the latest iPhones isn't bad, more RAM would allow for better and smoother multitasking, as well as allowing the operating system to process higher megapixel photos and juggle bigger files with less of a performance hit. iOS 10.3: 'Power User' tips and tricks SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 14 NEXT PREV See also: iOS 10.3: 'Power User' tips and tricks Apple selling outdated 32-bit iOS apps that will soon stop working Is it time for high-end pros to dump the Mac?

And it's a big improvement over the staid iPhone 7. The renders originated at Gear India and were touted by the Twitter account of well-regarded leaker OnLeaks. Gear India bills the renders, reportedly based on a factory CAD schematic, as "our closest look at the iPhone 8 yet." And the drawing certainly matches a lot of the rumored features that have been tipped for the next iPhone.Credit: Gear India/@OnLeaks Credit: Gear India/@OnLeaksMore But there's a catch. In a follow-up tweet, OnLeaks noted that he can't confirm the renders are "100% accurate." Gear India also notes that Apple is reportedly considering several different designs for the iPhone 8 and that this render could be a prototype that ultimately doesn't make the cut. Still, the render does give us a good idea of what the iPhone might look like, should it adopt many of the features reportedly slated for the phone when it arrives later this year. The front of the phone includes a display that stretches from one edge of the device to the other, significantly trimming the bezels on the iPhone. You don't see a physical home button; reportedly, Apple will switch to a virtual button to accommodate the expanded display. MORE: Most Anticipated Phones Based on the render, it looks like there are two front cameras on the phone. One of them could be there to support facial recognition features that are reportedly in the works for the iPhone 8. Credit: Gear India/@OnLeaksOn the back of the phone, the render shows vertically stacked dual camera lenses. That's been a common theme in a lot of iPhone 8 schematics that have leaked as of late, as Apple is reportedly planning to build augmented reality features into the next iPhone. Stacking the lenses vertically would add distances between the lenses, making it easier for the camera to include some of the AR features rumored for the iPhone 8. Credit: Gear India/@OnLeaksMore iPhone 8 Render from GearIndia Another notable thing about this render is what isn't on the back of the phone: there's no fingerprint reader. Apple is reportedly working on fitting the Touch ID sensor under the front display, but if it's unable to do so, it could wind up moving the sensor to the back of the phone, as Samsung did with its Galaxy S8. This render would suggest Apple is resisting that design switch. Gear India says the phone that appears in the render measures 5.6 x 2.7 by 0.3 inches. That makes it slightly taller, wider and thicker than the iPhone 7 (5.4 x 2.6 x 0.28 inches). It's also thicker than the 0.29-inch thin iPhone 7 Plus, though it wouldn't be as tall and wide as Apple's current plus-sized phone.

Computers are complex and problems rarely have instant solutions. While you’d figure that Windows users are more susceptible to these shady programs, there’s one well-known Mac tool that has no right to enjoy its popularity.

But it’s especially bad when a company selling security software is the one hit. In December 2015, a security researcher found a huge pile of MacKeeper user data publicly available through a search engine. Some 13 million usernames, licenses, password hashes, and public IP addresses were available for anyone to find and abuse. The researcher didn’t own a Mac, and had no idea that MacKeeper is a big scam. He reported the vulnerability to the company and they fixed it quickly. Thankfully, no credit card information was stolen, but this highlights a bigger problem with MacKeeper. The “security” company behind it used a public server without authentication to store this information — definitely a terrible security practice Change Your Bad Habits & Your Data Will Be More Secure Change Your Bad Habits & Your Data Will Be More Secure Read More .

Cir. May 5, 2017 (Before Taranto, Chen, and Stoll, J.) (Opinion for the court, Chen, J.). Appellant Affinity Labs of Texas, LLC (“Affinity”) appealed from the inter partes reexamination of its patent filed by Apple Inc. (“Apple”). Apple requested reexamination after Affinity asserted the patent against Apple in district court. The parties settled their dispute and filed a joint stipulation of dismissal with the district court. Affinity’s infringement action was dismissed with prejudice and Apple’s invalidity counterclaims were dismissed without prejudice. Apple also filed a notice of non-participation in the reexamination. Affinity petitioned the USPTO to terminate the Apple reexamination pursuant to pre-America Invents Act (AIA) 35 U.S.C. § 317(b). The USPTO dismissed Affinity’s termination request because it did not view the district court’s dismissal of Apple’s invalidity counterclaims, without prejudice, as meeting the required condition for terminating the reexamination. The Examiner rejected all of the patent’s claims and Affinity appealed to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“Board”), which upheld the Examiner’s rejection. Affinity appealed to the Federal Circuit and argued that the USPTO improperly maintained the reexamination in view of § 317(b), and, on that basis the Board’s decision should be reversed. Additionally Affinity argues that the Board’s findings are premised upon an improper claim construction of the so-called “dual download” feature. The Federal Circuit found that the estoppel provision of section 317(b) is expressly conditioned upon the entry of a “final decision,” and specifically “that the party has not sustained its burden of proving the invalidity of any patent claim in suit.” Noting that Affinity presented no evidence of a final decision that Apple had not sustained its burden of proving invalidity, the Court rejected Affinity’s argument based upon section 317(b). Dismissal of Apple’s claims without prejudice, “neither reflects an assessment by the district court of Apple’s invalidity challenge nor a concession by Apple that it did not or could not meet its burden of proving the asserted claims’ invalidity.” Therefore, the estoppel provision of pre-AIA section 317(b) did not serve to bar the inter partes reexamination. The “Dual Download” feature at the center of Affinity’s second argument relates to an audio download method, specifically, where content is made available for download to different devices. Affinity argues that the key aspect of a “dual download” is the ability to make a single request to download content to first and second devices automatically. The Examiner found that the claim language did not require content to be sent to both devices, and therefore found all claims unpatentable as obvious over the prior art. The Board adopted the Examiner’s construction and affirmed the Examiner, similarly, concluded all claims unpatentable as obvious over the asserted prior art. The Court reviewed the Board’s ultimate construction de novo and the underlying factual determinations for substantial evidence. Microsoft Corp. v. Proxyconn, Inc., 789 F.3d 1292, 1297 (Fed. Cir. 2015). The Court found the open-ended nature of the claim limitations and Specification did not “command that the requested content must be simultaneously and automatically downloaded to all selected destination devices based on a single request, without any subsequent action by the user.” Therefore, the Court affirmed the Board’s decision that all claims of the patent-in-suit were unpatentable. The estoppel provision of Pre-AIA Section 317(b), as applied to Inter Partes Reexamination, requires a “Final Decision,” which must show that the estopped party has not sustained its burden of proving invalidity of any patent claim in suit. Thus, a joint stipulation and order of dismissal “without prejudice” did not bar the maintenance of the Inter Partes Reexamination.

Casey May 12, 2017, 5:50 AM Feuds between rival tech titans often hurt users, but the latest bad blood could be over. According to a new report, the Apple TV will finally get an Amazon Prime Video app as soon as this summer. That's not hell freezing over you're hearing, but the rumor of Amazon Prime Video coming to the Apple TV. Image: Jeremy Lips/Tom's Guide This rumor is courtesy of BuzzFeed News, which reports that the news will be announced on-stage during Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 5. A different source, one "familiar with the companies' thinking" noted that while the app is expected to go live this summer, that isn't set in stone and could still change. The addition of the long-missing Amazon Prime service fills a gaping void that forces Apple TV owners to use other streaming boxes to see Prime shows such as Man in the High Castle and Mozart in the Jungle. While Prime Video can be found on many devices, such as Amazon Fire TV sticks, Rokus and gaming consoles such as the Xbox One and PS4, moving that HDMI cable back and forth can get annoying fast. MORE: Best Streaming Devices: Chromecast, Roku, Apple TV & More Apple TVs gaining Amazon Prime Video seems to be only the first half of a deal, though, as the report also notes that Amazon will start selling Apple's set-top box again. No word as to the possibility of Amazon and Google burying the hatchet so that the Google Chromecast could also be sold from the online retail giant. Prime Video might not be the only new service joining the Apple TV family soon. Apple is currently working on its own original content, such as its app development reality show and Carpool Karaoke episodes.

I think the reasoning for those who want a set-top box experience is that they want to use a system that doesn't require a keyboard or mouse, but instead, a remote. 0 2 comments Comment Firstname Submit Most Popular A Critical iPhone 8 Feature Is Already in Production The iPhone 8 We've Been Waiting for Looks Like This Best Buy's Apple Watch Sale Is the Best We've Seen The Latest On Tom’s Guide Round-Up 6 hr Best Mobile Battery Apps Reference 8 hr What Is Ransomware and How Can I Protect Myself?

Corning makes Gorilla Glass which is used as the protective glass on iPhone, iPad and MacBook displays as well as for Apple Watch. The investment will support Corning’s R&D, capital equipment needs and state-of-the-art glass processing. Corning's 65-year-old Harrodsburg facility has been integral to the 10-year collaboration between these two innovative companies and will be the focus of Apple’s investment.  Apple has committed to investing at least $1 billion with US-based companies as part of the fund, which is designed to foster innovative production and highly skilled jobs that will help lay the foundation for a new era of technology-driven manufacturing in the US. “Corning is a great example of a supplier that has continued to innovate and they are one of Apple's long-standing suppliers,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “This partnership started 10 years ago with the very first iPhone, and today every customer that buys an iPhone or iPad anywhere in the world touches glass that was developed in America. We’re extremely proud of our collaboration over the years and we are investing further with Corning who has such a rich legacy of innovative manufacturing practices.” “Corning’s longstanding relationship with Apple has not only led to significant glass innovations that have enabled new capabilities for consumers, it has also helped create nearly 1,000 American jobs and allowed us to continue growing and expanding in the US,” said Wendell P. Weeks, Corning’s chairman, chief executive officer and president. “This investment will ensure our plant in Harrodsburg remains a global center of excellence for glass technology.” Since the inception of Gorilla Glass in 2007, the partnership between Apple and Corning has created and sustained nearly 1,000 US jobs across Corning’s R&D, manufacturing and commercial functions, including over 400 in Harrodsburg. Corning has procured enough renewable energy to cover all of its Apple manufacturing in the US.

Image: Apple Apple’s new Advanced Manufacturing Fund has made its first investment. Tech giant Apple is to invest $200m in Corning to support revolutionary glass production methods. Last week, it emerged that Apple had created a new $1bn Advanced Manufacturing Fund to foster innovation among American manufacturers. ‘This partnership started 10 years ago with the very first iPhone and today, every customer that buys an iPhone or iPad anywhere in the world touches glass that was developed in America’ – JEFF WILLIAMS Corning’s 65-year-old Harrodsburg facility will be the focus of Apple’s investment, which will support the former’s R&D, capital equipment needs and state-of-the-art glass processing. Apple has collaborated with Corning throughout the 10-year history of the iPhone. A glass act Workers at the Corning plant in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. Image: Apple Since the inception of Gorilla Glass in 2007, the partnership between Apple and Corning has created and sustained nearly 1,000 US jobs in R&D, manufacturing and commercial functions, including more than 400 in Harrodsburg alone. Corning said it has procured enough renewable energy to cover all of its Apple manufacturing in the US. “Corning is a great example of a supplier that has continued to innovate and they are one of Apple’s long-standing suppliers,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “This partnership started 10 years ago with the very first iPhone and today, every customer that buys an iPhone or iPad anywhere in the world touches glass that was developed in America. “We’re extremely proud of our collaboration over the years and we are investing further with Corning, who has such a rich legacy of innovative manufacturing practices.” Apple’s Advanced Manufacturing Fund is designed to foster innovative production and highly skilled jobs that will help lay the foundations for a new era of technology-driven manufacturing in the US. A glass worker at Corning in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. Image: Apple In the US, Apple now supports 2m jobs across all 50 states, including 450,000 jobs attributable to Apple’s spend and investment with US-based suppliers. Apple said it has spent more than $50bn in the past year, with more than 9,000 domestic suppliers and manufacturers. “Corning’s long-standing relationship with Apple has not only led to significant glass innovations that have enabled new capabilities for consumers, it has also helped create nearly 1,000 American jobs and allowed us to continue growing and expanding in the US,” said Wendell P Weeks, CEO at Corning. “This investment will ensure our plant in Harrodsburg remains a global centre of excellence for glass technology.” Related: manufacturing, Apple, iPhone 66 DAYS 4 HOURS 26 MINUTES Get your early bird tickets now!

Tech Search Search Daniel LoebHigh-Profile Snap Stakeholders Revealed in Filings MicrosoftMicrosoft’s Future Is About Much More Than PCs wannacry ransomwareWhy the Latest Global Cyber Attack Is So Worrisome Donald TrumpWatch Live: President Trump Gives Commencement Speech at Liberty University Phil Schiller, Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing at Apple Inc, discusses the camera on the iPhone7 during an Apple media event in San Francisco, California, U.S. September 7, 2016. REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach - RTX2OJJW Beck Diefenbach — Reuters Best Companies How to Be a Better iPhone Photographer—According to Apple Don Reisinger May 12, 2017 Apple really wants its iPhone owners to take better pictures. The tech giant on Thursday published a series of videos aimed at teaching its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus owners how to take better photographs with the handset's built-in cameras. The bite-sized videos, which were published to YouTube, are less than a minute long. They examine shooting panoramic photos, action shots, and snapping photos without flash. Apple (aapl) has long used its iPhone camera to promote its devices. Many of the company's recent commercials, in fact, have featured footage that was shot on an iPhone. Meanwhile, point-and-shoot and high-end cameras have taken a backseat to smartphones. According to photo-sharing site Flickr, which tracks its users' most commonly employed cameras, Apple's iPhones rank atop other smartphones, as well as traditional cameras, making them the most popular options for snapping photos. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter However, Flickr's data suggests the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s, which were released in 2015 and 2016, respectively, are the most popular cameras among its users. Apple's iPhone 7 is gaining ground, but still far behind. Despite its lead in usage, Apple is facing stiff competition in the smartphone market with devices that have high-end cameras and features Apple's own handset doesn't offer. Samsung's (ssnlf) new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ smartphones, for instance, earned rave reviews from owners and testers for their high-quality cameras. Last year's Google (googl) Pixel handset also came with a high-end camera that Google said, was the world's best smartphone camera. Apple's latest videos don't try to compare the iPhone's cameras to others. They do, however, make suggestions on how to get the most from the lenses. They also provide some basic instruction on how to snap photos, which might prove useful to novice photographers, regardless of the cameras they're using. In addition to its YouTube page, Apple has added a new instructional page to its website, where users can learn how to shoot photos on the iPhone 7.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 12, 2017 10:24am   Comments Share: Related AAPL Momentum Investing As A Strategy Analysts Say Apple's Future Is In Transportation, Not Just A Car But An 'Experience' Stock Futures Head For Mixed Start As Apple Hoists Dow (Investor's Business Daily) Goldman Sachs' Simona Jankowski maintains a Buy rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)'s stock with a price target boosted from $164 to $170 after taking a deep dive into what impact a $1,000 iPhone can have on the company's earnings and stock price. According to the analyst, Apple's soon-to-be-released iPhone 8 (rumored to be named iPhone X) will mark the most anticipated iPhone launch since September 2014. Jankowski believes two phones will be released, the first a 128GB model for $999 and a 256GB model for $1,099. Implications Jankowski believes Apple's full-year fiscal 2018 iPhone unit shipments will be 243 million, which is mostly in line with the consensus estimate of 242 million. The iPhone 8 will "drive well over" 50 percent of total new iPhone shipments in the coming four quarters versus 51 percent share of the iPhone 7 Plus in the calendar fourth quarter of 2017 and 34 percent for the iPhone 6s Plus in its first four quarters. Overall, Apple's blended iPhone average selling price will be $763 in the fiscal year, which is up 16 percent year-over-year and marks an acceleration from an 11 percent increase in the last "super cycle" in fiscal 2015. As such, the analyst felt it prudent to boost her fiscal 2018 earnings per share estimate from $11.00 to $11.50 versus a consensus estimate of $10.40. Jankowski also raised her 2019 earnings per share estimates from $11.30 to $11.75, which is also above the Street's $10.99 per share estimate. Finally, the higher average selling price will drive a "relatively modest" 40-basis-point headwind to iPhone gross margins in fiscal 2018.

Its 16 videos include "how to shoot a one-handed selfie" and "how to shoot during golden hour." Apple hasn't offered simple tutorials like this before. Todd Haselton | @robotodd 16 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Stephen Lam | Getty Images Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during a product launch event on Oct. 27, 2016, in Cupertino, Calif. Apple launched a new site Friday with 16 videos dedicated to teaching iPhone 7 owners how to take better photos. Apple has always marketed how great its phones are at taking photos, often showing off shots snapped by professional photographers, but it hasn't yet provided such useful and simple tutorials to users. The videos are simple, allowing everyone to better understand what they can do with the phones that are already in their pocket. The topics include "how to shoot a great portrait" and "how to shoot without a flash," which can actually be difficult if you're taking pictures in low light. Other tutorials teach you how to use functions you might not have known existed on an iPhone — like how to snap a photo while also filming, and how to set a selfie timer. To snap better photos from a unique angle, for example, Apple recommends tilting the iPhone 7, looking straight up, or getting low on a subject before snapping the picture. To shoot action photos, Apple says you should hold the shutter button down, allowing it to shoot multiple frames per second, and then view your gallery of burst photos and select the favorite one. The videos are about 30 seconds each and walk users through each step, making recommendations on how photographers might want to position themselves, or the subject, and what functions to use on the iPhone 7. The tutorial page is useful, but it's also another indication that Apple wants to continue to support the products its customers buy — something its competitors have yet to do. While the page is focused on the iPhone 7, owners of older iPhones should find plenty of value here, too. Here's the page.

Amazon also plans to start selling Apple’s entertainment device again once the app is available. Amazon Prime Video coming to Apple TV this summer News of Amazon Prime on Apple TV surfaced earlier this month, although at the time insider sources didn’t say when we’d get an official announcement. Now sources tell Buzzfeed it’ll happen at WWDC, but they aren’t saying exactly when the app will be available. WWDC is Apple’s annual conference for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS developers. The event always kicks off with a keynote presentation where Apple shows off the next major release for the operating systems, and often tosses in a few other announcements, too. This year it looks like one of those will be Amazon Prime on Apple TV. Amazon Prime Warms Up to Apple TV Amazon blocked Apple TV sales through its online store a couple years ago under the pretense of avoiding customer confusion since its app wasn’t on the device. Google Chromecast was blocked for the same reason. Now that Amazon is releasing Amazon Prime for Apple TV, it’ll allow sales again. Whatever the reason for staying off of Apple TV has been resolved. No one is saying what changed, but it’s easy to speculate that Apple agreed to special terms just for Amazon. That could mean in-app purchases on our TVs, or maybe some sort of data sharing. Adding Prime Video to Apple TV will make the device far more enticing to streaming video watchers because it’ll be the only set top box supporting all of the major services. To date, Amazon Prime has been the glaring hole in Apple TV’s offerings. Both Apple and Amazon are keeping quiet about the announcement, so we’ll have to wait until June 5th for the official word.

The agreement will allow users to access shows and movies on Amazon Prime on their Apple TV devices. The announcement is expected to be made during the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose on June 5th. It is believed the app will go life later this summer. Amazon and Apple have also agreed to start selling Apple TV devices on the site. Back in 2015, Amazon stopped offering Apple TV devices because of its incompatibility with Amazon Prime. Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos told The Verge last May that Amazon and Apple couldn’t come to a deal because Apple wasn’t willing to agree to “acceptable business terms.” Amazon Prime will be joining other video streaming services such as Crackle, HBO Now and Netflix which are already a part of Apple TV. In order to access Amazon Prime on your Apple TV, you will need a subscription to Amazon Prime. After downloading the app onto your device, you will sign in with your username and password and then have the ability to access all of your favorite television shows and movies. close Trending 1   Colonie police release names of driver, pedestrian in crash 2   Schenectady Police: Driver who fled traffic stop became dizzy, died following foot pursuit 3   FOUND: Miranda Bristol, 16 4   Troy woman sentenced in DWI crash that killed 18 year old teen 5   Schedule of events: Tulip Fest 2017 DON'T MISS OUT Stay Connected with WRGB Like Follow © 2016 Sinclair Broadcast Group TermsPrivacyFCC InfoEEO News In Pictures Colonie police release names of driver, pedestrian in crash Perp Patrol: Wanted gallery Warren County Sheriff: Bomb threat investigation for county buildings, school district.

Citing “sources in a position to know,” the report suggests that not only will Amazon Prime’s video app make its debut on the Apple TV at the June event, but that the set-top box will also see a return to Amazon’s virtual shelves — a logical move considering that Amazon’s rationale for banning sales of the device in 2015 were due to its lack of support for Amazon Prime. Although Apple had debuted an open tvOS App Store when the fourth-generation Apple TV arrived in late 2015, Amazon was the only major provider to not jump on board with its own Apple TV app, a decision that, according to Apple, was entirely Amazon’s choice. On the other side, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos went on record as saying simply that his goal was to get the Prime Video player “on the device with acceptable business terms,” implying that Amazon has been holding out for specific terms beyond those available to other tvOS developers. According to the report’s sources, the tvOS Amazon Prime app is expected to go live this summer, but that may still be subject to change. No date could be determined for when the Apple TV might make a return to Amazon’s storefronts.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) --  Apple will invest $200 million in the Harrodsburg, Kentucky factory that first developed the scratch-resistant glass for the original iPhone in 2007, the company said Friday. The Harrodsburg plant, owned by New York-based Corning Inc., first manufactured the Gorilla Glass ahead of the initial launch of the iPhone, and the glass is now used in some 4.5 billion electronic devices made by Apple and other manufacturers worldwide. “This partnership started 10 years ago with the very first iPhone, and today every customer that buys an iPhone or iPad anywhere in the world touches glass that was developed in America,” Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, said in a news release. The $200 million will help pay for Corning’s research and development, capital equipment needs and “state-of-the-art” glass processing at the Harrodsburg plant, according to the news release. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, is set to join Corning CEO Wendell Weeks and Apple’s Williams at a news conference at the plant Friday afternoon. It’s unclear how many jobs the investment will create at the plant, which employs about 400 people. Before the iPhone’s launch in 2007, the Harrodsburg factory turned on a dime from making LCD glass to making Gorilla Glass after the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs challenged Corning to come up with a more resilient glass for the smartphone, according to a 2012 story by this reporter in The Courier-Journal. By 2012, Corning made the majority of the glass for the iPhone and iPads at its plants in Taiwan and Japan, closer to Apple’s production of the devices in China. The $200 million is part of $1 billion Apple plans to spend “to foster innovation among American manufacturers” through the company’s Advanced Manufacturing Fund, according to the release.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: Shutterstock College student reimagines the Apple Music interface, and his mockups are stunning Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 12th, 2017 at 8:51 AM Share Tweet When the iPod was at the height of its popularity, bolstered of course by the iTunes Music Store, Steve Jobs repeatedly exclaimed that consumers and music lovers had absolutely no interest in a subscription music service. “Never say never, but customers don’t seem to be interested in it,” Jobs said back in a 2007 interview. “The subscription model has failed so far.” Eventually, though, the dynamics of the tech industry enabled streaming-only services to not only take off, but to flourish. Thanks to the proliferation of smartphones and the roll-out of 4G networks, the notion of being able to stream millions of songs right from your smartphone became less of a fantastical idea and more of a reality. And though Apple resisted for as long as it could, it eventually conceded that it was time to embrace a new reality, one which involved subscription music. Don't Miss: Reliable leaker claims to reveal iPhone 8 launch timing, and it’s not what we’re expecting And so, with a whole lot of fanfare, Apple in June of 2015 introduced Apple Music, a Spotify rival with a few decidedly Apple-esque components, including a streaming radio station dubbed Beats 1 and curated playlists. While Apple’s foray into the streaming music business was arguably long overdue, the early iterations of Apple Music — both on iOS and on the desktop — were fraught with a myriad of problems, not the least of which was an incredibly muddled, inconsistent and confusing interface. While Apple’s bread and butter typically centers on intuitive software that “just works”, using Apple Music was a maddening experience to say the least. Over the last two years or so, Apple has added some nice enhancements to Apple Music and has cleaned up a lot of the sloppy UI that plagued early incarnations of the software. Still, as someone who listens to a ton of music throughout the course of a week, I still can’t help but find Spotify’s UI much more intuitive and appealing, Apple Music’s curated playlists notwithstanding. That said, a visual design student from Northwestern named Jason Yuan recently put together an Apple Music concept and redesign that, truth be told, Apple might want to take a look at. Interestingly, Yuan notes that he actually interviewed for a graphic design internship at Apple Music but didn’t land the position. At first, I was frustrated — Northwestern University doesn’t offer any sort of undergraduate graphic design program, so whatever growth they were looking for would have to be self taught… …but as soon as I came to this realization, I became inspired to embark on what became a a three-month long journey to the holy grail — the iOS app that Apple Music deserves. Some of Yuan’s solutions address a few of Apple Music’s shortcomings, and he even tosses in some original ideas that Apple Music would strongly benefit from having. Without question, one of the more interesting idea put forth by Yuan is something he calls My Sampler. My Sampler is a new experience made to bridge the gap between Hoarders and Nomads, replacing the current “New Music Mix.” It was born out of the understanding that users who are picky about what goes into their library would also be more reluctant to sit through an entire playlist full of new music. A better experience would be presenting snippets — or samples — of curations that gives the user just enough information to decide whether or not to add it into their library and weekly playlist. Upon entering the Sampler, the user is presented with a series of artist headshots that correspond to a curated song. The user can tap and hold to preview 15 seconds of each song, before swiping up to reject the song or swiping down to add the song to their library. The Sampler UI that Yuan came up with looks pretty sweet and would definitely help improve the entirety of the Apple Music user experience. One of the more interesting modifications to the Apple Music UI involves replacing the dedicated “Radio” option with a “Watch” option. I’m sure Apple wants people to have easy access to Beats 1, but with Apple continually trying to roll out more video content under the Apple Music umbrella, a “Watch” option on the bottom menu pane is a pretty thoughtful idea. All in all, Yuan has completely rethought and re-imagined what a compelling Apple Music UI should look and feel like. And believe it or not, what we’ve highlighted so far is just the tip of the iceberg. Make sure to check out Yuan’s full design mockups over here at Medium. If you’re an Apple Music fan or even a Spotify fan who wishes that Apple Music was a little bit better, it’ll be well worth the read.

The iPhone maker announced on Friday that it will invest $200 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund into Corning's research-and-development, capital equipment, and glass processing efforts. The majority of the funds will go to Corning's Harrodsburg, Ky. facility, where much of the company's glass processing is done. Apple (aapl) announced the Advanced Manufacturing Fund last week alongside its fiscal second quarter earnings. Apple said that it would put $1 billion into the fund, and use that cash to fund a variety of manufacturing activities. The company also anticipates using some of the fund's assets to boost the number of highly skilled jobs that will be required in an advanced manufacturing setting. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter Corning has in the last decade become a prominent figure in the ever-growing smartphone industry. The company's Gorilla Glass technology, which was unveiled in 2007, is designed to bolster the strength of regular glass, reducing chances of damage to smartphone, tablet, and smartwatch screens. Corning has released new Gorilla Glass iterations over the years that enhance its strength. Several prominent companies, including Apple, use Corning's technology. Apple noted in its statement on Friday that it's been a longstanding Corning partner. The companies first collaborated on glass in 2007. Since then, Apple has relied upon Corning's glass in all of its iPhones and iPads. It's unclear from the statement exactly what Corning (glw) will use the investment on, and what Apple stands to gain in the process. However, Apple noted that the Corning investment will be the "focus" of its fund. Corning chairman and CEO Wendell Weeks said in a statement that the investment will be used in part to enhance the Harrodsburg glass facility.

Tae Kim | @firstadopter 17 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters How high can Apple shares rise?    Tuesday, 9 May 2017 | 3:34 PM ET | 03:59 Investors should buy Apple shares because the more expensive iPhone 8 launching later this year will drive earnings above expectations, according to Goldman Sachs, which reiterated its buy rating. "The first $1,000 iPhone can drive meaningful upside," analyst Simona Jankowski wrote in a note to clients Thursday. "The bottom line is that we are raising our FY18/19 EPS estimates further above consensus. … While our FY18 iPhone unit estimate is relatively in-line (GSe 243mn vs. consensus at 242mn), we see significant upside in iPhone ASPs [average selling prices]." She raised her Apple price target to $170 from $164, representing 10 percent upside from Thursday's close. Jankowski expects the new iPhone 8 will offer premium features such as a 5.8-inch OLED display and 3-D sensing augmented reality technology. She predicts Apple will sell the 128 GB and 256 GB storage iPhone 8 models for $999 and $1,099, respectively, compared with the $749 price of the current 128 GB iPhone 7. As a result, Jankowski estimates fiscal 2018 iPhone average selling prices will rise 16 percent year over year to $763 versus the $675 Wall Street consensus. She raised her Apple fiscal 2018 earnings-per-share forecast to $11.50 from $11.00 versus the Street average of $10.40. "We think the higher demand for the larger (5.8") form factor will be supported by the fact that the iPhone 8 will have compelling new features not available in the smaller form factors," she wrote.

Apple should consider using the Apple TV as a more robust gaming console. Apple should also enter the smart home assistant market to take on Amazon Echo, Google Home. Todd Haselton | @robotodd 18 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters This tech giant has room to get even bigger    15 Hours Ago | 00:49 Bank of America Merrill Lynch said Friday that Apple has a huge opportunity to increase its revenues by $100 billion in the long term by entering new product areas, including expanding its presence in health care, exploring the console gaming market and launching a Siri smart home assistant. "In our opinion, Apple is well positioned to capture share in the video game market using its iOS platform, but also to leverage that more broadly over time to support an experience similar to console gaming," BofAML said in a note to clients. "Further recent hires suggest that the capability of the Apple TV can incorporate console gaming and set-top box all integrated into a single product down the road." Analyst Wamsi Mohan raised his 12-month price target on Apple to $180 a share from $155. The shares, which are up more than 30 percent this year, closed at $153.95 on Thursday, sporting a market value of more than $800 billion. Reports have long suggested Apple wants to launch its own streaming TV service. Its Apple TV already offers iOS gaming, though it is considered more casual than gaming consoles such as the Sony PlayStation 4, Microsoft Xbox One and the recent Nintendo Switch. BofAML also sees a big market for a smart home assistant powered by Siri that could compete with the Amazon Echo and Google Home. "We estimate the potential market at $7.5 billion. To size this, we factor a 5% penetration (attach) into the iPhone installed base of 600 million units. Assuming a sell price of $250 per device, we estimate a $7.5 billion potential market for Apple." Rumors suggest Apple may announce such a device as early as next month's WWDC event. BofAML addresses the potential for an Apple Car, too, suggesting that Apple has a $1 billion revenue opportunity by 2020 and a $27 billion revenue opportunity by 2025 if it develops and starts selling an autonomous car by 2020 with an average selling price 10 percent greater than that of Tesla's Model S. By 2020, Apple would also need to grab twice the market share that Tesla had in 2012 for this to work. Despite the firm's predictions, rumors that Apple is actually building a car, versus helping partners to do so, seem to be dying down. The BofAML also sees an upside in virtual reality, which it says will have a total addressable market value of $30 billion in 2020. Apple doesn't necessarily need to enter the markets, though our guess is that it will dip its toes into new areas at some point. BofAML said that, even if Apple sits still, the markets Apple currently addresses (smartphones, tablets, wearables and desktops/laptops) can generate $550 billion in revenue by 2020.

 Goldman Sachs: iPhone 8 will cost $1,000 Jim Edwards May 12, 2017, 9:16 AM 22,275 facebook linkedin twitter email print Unbox Therapy's Lew Hilsenteger holding a custom gold iPhone 7.Unbox Therapy Apple will launch three new phones in September and the best one, the all-new iPhone 8, will cost $1,000 (£776), according to Goldman Sachs. "We expect the iPhone 8 to have 128 GB and 256 GB models priced at $999 and $1,099, respectively," analyst Simona Jankowski and her team told their clients in a note seen by Business Insider. That would be $130 (£100) more than the most expensive current iPhone. Goldman predicts the new phones launched at Apple's event later this year will start at these prices: iPhone 8 — $999 (£775) iPhone 7S Plus — $769 (£596) iPhone 7S — $649 (£503) This chart shows that the $1,000 price would be a continuation of an existing trend: Goldman Sachs Sources in the media, inside Apple, and within Apple's supply chain have thus far given contradictory information about whether Apple will launch an "iPhone 8" this year. But Jankowski says she believes the iPhone 8 is happening: "Apple usually explores multiple designs in parallel. However, with only four months left until launch, we believe Apple has now locked down the design." A couple of factors are driving that intimidating price point. First, the new technology inside the phone could increase the "bill of materials" cost of manufacturing. Goldman expects these features and costs: 5.8-inch OLED screen (adds $35). No bezel, all screen. 3D sensing (adds $20). Better, faster NAND/DRAM memory (adds $16 to $29). Capacity starting at 128 GB. A11 processor. No home button. Biometric authentication. The second issue is that consumers have favoured the bigger, more expensive iPhone models over their smaller alternatives. With iPhone 7 Plus, the large-screen, premium-priced versions of the iPhone for the first time became the majority of Apple's iPhone sales, Goldman estimates. Goldman Sachs The idea of a brand-new, redesigned iPhone is exciting, but it's unclear whether Apple will launch one. Analysts at KGI and Deutsche Bank have published notes saying the iPhone 8 may not be ready for launch this year. That sets up the possibility that CEO Tim Cook will unveil the iPhone 8 at the September event but release it for sale sometime in 2018. That's what happened with Apple Watch, which was announced in September 2014 but went on sale in April 2015.

While there is still uncertainty about its release date, Apple suppliers are gearing up to start mass production of key components. A new report coming out of South Korea claims that LG Innotek has bagged the order to supply 3D facial recognition cameras for the iPhone 8. Image Credit: MySmartPrice.com / OnLeaks / YouTube video (screenshot) LG Innotek receives $177 million order for 3D sensors Citing the Korean Economic Daily, The Investor reports that LG Innotek has set up a new facility to produce 3D facial recognition cameras. The Korean company has invested $238.5 million in the new facility. Inside sources told the Korean Economic Daily that Apple’s initial order was worth $177 million. LG Innotek is the components arm of the LG Electronics. The Korean company already supplies the dual-lens camera modules for the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus. But LG Innotek reportedly needed to set up a new facility for the face recognition modules because it will be front-facing and smaller. The Investor points out that the 3D version of facial recognition offers much better accuracy than devices using the 2D technology. That’s why the Galaxy S8’s facial recognition system can easily be fooled. The 3D modules can sense depth, making the process of unlocking the device more secure. Rumors of the iPhone 8 featuring facial recognition have been doing rounds since Apple acquired Israeli startup RealFace in February this year. RealFace claims its algorithms can recognize faces with 99.67% success rate. By comparison, the human eyes have a success rate of 97.5%. According to the report, LG Innotek has either started supplying the 3D facial recognition modules or is on the verge of shipping the first batch of sensors. Since these modules will be placed on the front of the iPhone 8, they may require special attention as the device is said to feature an edge-to-edge OLED display. The 10th anniversary iPhone is also rumored to sport iris scanning for authentication and security. iPhone 8 could be the first phone with 3D facial recognition According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the “revolutionary” 3D cameras will offer facial recognition as well as a combination of augmented reality, virtual reality, and mixed reality. The iPhone 8 won’t be the first device to come with facial recognition, but it will likely be the first to use 3D sensors for facial recognition. Japanese blog Mac Otakara explains what lenses will be used to support facial recognition. According to the publication, Apple could pair the 32mm FaceTime camera with a wide-angle lens of 24mm or a 28mm camera to enable facial recognition. If Apple uses a single camera, it could be fooled with a photo of the phone’s owner. Using at least two cameras will help create a better mathematical model of the face. If it turns out to be true, the setup will be similar to that of the LG V20 Pro and Oppo F3 Plus, reports Apple Insider. Mac Otakara has accurately predicted the features of many Apple products before their official launch in the past. Where will the fingerprint scanner sit? According to the recently leaked CAD drawings, the iPhone 8 will measure 143.5 x 70.9 x 7.7mm. It means the 10th anniversary iPhone will be thicker than both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which were 7.1mm and 7.3mm thick, respectively. The drawings also revealed that the dual cameras will be placed vertically on the iPhone 8, most likely to facilitate augmented reality applications. It is still unclear what Apple will do with the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. Since the company has opted for an edge-to-edge OLED display, it has replaced the physical home button with virtual ones. The tech giant is facing technical difficulties placing the Touch ID under the OLED display. If Apple resolves the issues, the iPhone 8 would be the first smartphone to come with an in-display fingerprint sensor. Otherwise, the Touch ID could be relocated to the rear panel. A separate report coming out of Asia claimed that Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC has started mass production of Apple’s custom A11 chips. The A11 SoC is said to run all three iPhones coming this year, including the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus. TSMC, the sole supplier of A11 chips, had originally planned to start production in April with a view to supplying 50 million units by July. But production was delayed by a few weeks due to problems with the 10nm manufacturing process. iPhone 8 on track for September launch There have been contradictory reports regarding the iPhone 8 release date. Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, one of the most reliable Apple analysts, said in his latest report that the iPhone 8 production would ramp up in October-November rather than the usual ramp-up cycle of August-September. The analyst said Apple will still announce the iPhone 8 in September, but the phone will be out of stock in most stores several weeks after launch. On the other hand, Twitter tipster @OnLeaks has learned from his sources that the iPhone 8 is on track for September launch without any delay. Production will ramp up in August for September debut. The tipster added that Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn had started hiring and training employees to prepare for the iPhone 8 production. According to my sources: DVT started last month. PVT will start between June and July. Final mass production in August for September launch. https://t.co/2M2YyMjyi8 — OnLeaks (@OnLeaks) May 11, 2017 Tags: Apple iPhone 8 LG Innotek realface Load Comments Send us your tips at tips(at)valuewalk.com Latest News From ValueWalk Mental Time Travel: Your Brain Is Literally a Time Machine | Dean Buonamano Inflation Props Up Gold; Ontario’s Massive Debt Load Selected Retirement Start Dates (Examples Age 35 to Death) And More Should A Robot Run Your Retirement Portfolio?

Corning is best known for its incredibly durable Gorilla Glass displays, which are featured on numerous high-end smartphones, including the iPhone. Apple is investing $200 million in the company to “support Corning’s R&D, capital equipment needs, and state-of-the-art glass processing.” The glass company is a logical choice as a recipient of Apple’s investment, which is meant to promote increased US-based manufacturing. Given that Corning is a longtime Apple partner that’s both headquartered out of New York and has a major production plant in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, it’s an easy win for Apple in both furthering technology for a major supplier and fostering local manufacturing. The glass company is a logical choice for a recipient of Apple’s investment According to Corning’s CEO, Wendell Weeks, the company’s partnership with Apple over the last 10 years has already led to creation of nearly 1,000 jobs in the United States. Apple has already dabbled in US-based manufacturing itself with the Mac Pro, and the company has been rumored in the past months to be considering exploring further options for expanding its domestic production as well. That move — along with the creation of the Advanced Manufacturing Fund — is likely influenced, at least in part, by President Donald Trump, who has expressed numerous times his desire to have Apple move iPhone production to the United States.

Written by Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: May 12, 2017 6:33 pm Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 8 later this year, probably in September. A new report from Digitimes has claimed that the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has begun production of Apple’s A11 chipset that will power the iPhone 8. TSMC had initially targeted to produce the chipset much earlier, but due to issues ‘involving stacking components in the backend integrated fan-out packaging process’, it had been delayed – but they have already been solved. The report corroborates the rumor that Apple’s suppliers are gearing up to launch the OLED-based iPhone 8, which could be introduced in September along with the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. A separate report from the Chinese-language Economic Daily News earlier this month, which was shared by Digitimes, also suggested that Apple would stick to the original plan. Sources had claimed that Apple’s suppliers including TSMC, SLP (substrate-like PCB) makers like Zhen Ding Technology, Kinsus Interconnect Technology, and battery supplier Simplo Technology, have managed to improve the yield rates which will allow for volume production of materials in June. It was also supported that iPhone suppliers Foxconn, Winstron and Pegatron had begun recruiting and training process of new workers in China before the mass production of the new iPhone. Although the iPhone 8 may be released on time, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo now claims that there’s a “rising probability” of the “worst scenario” for production and shipments of the iPhone 8. Kuo claims that Apple is still facing production delays with the iPhone 8 due to the “major hardware upgrades”. The analyst has lowered what he had predicted in shipments, 100 to 110 million units down to 80 to 90 million units. Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 8 later this year, probably in September. The world’s most valuable tech company is believed to launch at least three iPhone models, including a special edition iPhone 8 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of iPhone and successors to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.

The investment will support the 65-year-old Corning plant’s research and development, equipment needs and glass process. While officials indicated the investment had the potential to bring more jobs to the 400-person factory, they did not say how many. “It warms my heart that in the middle of beautiful horse country, the most advanced technology in glass in the world is happening right here,” Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, told a group of Corning employees on the plant floor Friday. The money will come from Apple’s new Advanced Manufacturing Fund, which the company says will invest $1 billion with U.S.-based companies to develop innovative production and skilled jobs. Corning is the fund’s first investment, Apple said. The company spent $50 billion last year with more than 9,000 U.S. suppliers and manufacturers. “I’m looking forward to the next round of innovations,” said Corning CEO Wendell Weeks. The iPhone originally had plastic on the surface, according to Williams, but when Steve Jobs kept it in his pocket, by the end of the day the surface was covered with scratches. Jobs, who was famous for demanding focus on design, quickly decided the surface needed to be glass instead of plastic for the first release of the phone. With the deadline for the release rapidly approaching, Apple had a problem, Williams said. Every time Apple had tested the iPhone with glass, the glass broke when they dropped it. Corning’s Gorilla Glass came to the rescue and the Harrodsburg plant has been making the glass for iPhones ever since. That partnership is not lost on U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said he had nothing to do with Apple’s investment but came to the plant for the announcement to congratulate the company. “The last thing I look at at night and the first thing I look at in the morning is my iPhone,” McConnell said. “And unlike most people, I think of Harrodsburg, Kentucky.” Talk of the investment had bubbled on Facebook profiles and local businesses in Harrodsburg, according to Mayor Eddie Long. “It means a lot to everybody,” Long said. “Corning has been such a part of this community for years.” Daniel Desrochers: 502-875-3793, @drdesrochers, @BGPolitics LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Suggested for you   Comments   Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 20 days ago John Soper on Woodford County's success 0:59 20 days ago John Soper on Woodford County's success 2:15 4 months ago Soccer Center closing doors 0:16 4 months ago Painting party for Chocolate Holler View More Video Business Gov.

These reasons were, in brief: It’s a proprietary product, and Apple prefers open web standards [sometimes] An increasing number of websites are switching to better video formats Flash has poor security, reliability and performance Flash decreases battery life Flash was designed for desktop, not touch It’s an additional layer that holds back innovation Most of those reasons are just as valid today, security not least among them … NordVPN Flash notches up scores of security vulnerabilities every year. Many of these are critical ones, that allow an attacker to ‘execute arbitrary code’ in security terminology – aka take control of your machine. And nor does Adobe seem in any great hurry to fix them. Last year, it took the company 62 days to patch 80% of the vulnerabilities discovered. And that’s not allowing for how long it takes the typical user to actually apply the update once it is finally available. Apple discouraged use of Flash on Macs with Safari 10, disabling it by default while allowing users to enable it when needed. I wanted to go further and keep it switched off in Safari’s preferences, so I conducted a couple of experiments. The first was to set it to Off for all websites (Safari > Preferences > Security > Internet plug-ins > Plug-in settings > Adobe Flash Player). With this setting, my browser would simply refuse to run Flash no matter which website I visited. I was expecting this to be relatively painless, as I assumed that by now most websites would be using HTML5 to display video content. Boy was I wrong! The number of mainstream sites that would not display video without Flash was incredible – with news sites the worst offenders. I then decided to switch from Off to Ask, so that Safari would ask whether I wanted to allow Flash to run, on a site-by-site basis. I persisted with this for several weeks, but have finally had to admit defeat: it just became too tiresome to continually get the prompt, okay it where required and then have the page refresh with the Flash content. So I’m back to living with Flash by default. I know of some who’ve been more successful with the same experiment, simply boycotting sites that aren’t usable without Flash. But as a tech writer who needs to visit a wide range of both mainstream and tech media sites each day, that just isn’t an option for me. We here aren’t 100% innocent here at 9to5mac. If there’s a video that adds a lot to a story but is only available in Flash form, we’ve sometimes chosen to embed it. But that’s becoming incredibly rare. It’s time for websites to take the initiative and finally put this inefficient, power-sapping, bug-ridden protocol out of its – and our – misery. Have you been more successful than me in banishing Flash from your machine? Which sites have you found the worst offenders when it comes to being unusable without Flash?

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Software Microsoft unveils Windows 10 Fall Creators Update Software Microsoft unveils Windows 10 Fall Creators Update By Bindu Nair - May 12, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Microsoft’s making a big push towards cross-platform productivity at its Build 2017 conference, embracing iOS, Android, and even iTunes. That’s all part of its next Windows 10 Fall Creators Update which will push out to 500 million Windows 10 devices later this year. Microsoft’s embrace of platforms other than itself is in stark contrast to what went down at its last event. That occasion saw the launch of Windows 10 S, a walled-up OS where only apps from the Windows Store can be downloaded. Perhaps that’s why it’s planning to bring iTunes on board as an app by the end of 2017. iTunes for Windows 10 will include support for Apple Music, the iTunes Store, iPhones, and any other Apple device. The Fall Creators Update is additionally set to introduce a new Microsoft Graph tool for seamless hopping between iOS, Android and Windows. Microsoft Graph’s Timeline feature visually shows users what they were doing last, letting them go back to files, apps and websites which they were previously working on. Cortana integration means they can utilize a new Pick Up Where You Left Off ability to resume their activity across Windows, iOS and Android. There’s also a new Clipboard tool to copy something on a PC and then paste it in a smartphone. Even OneDrive has gotten updated with a Files on Demand skill which allows people to view their files without having to actually download them. All-in-all, it sounds pretty similar to Apple’s Continuity feature. Also See: Microsoft ‘confirms’ Surface Phone, to launch Surface Pro 5 on May 23 On the technical side of things, the Fall Creators Update includes a new Fluent Design System that is meant to help developers build cross-device apps that are intuitive, harmonious, responsive, 3D-ready, and touch-optimized. Microsoft has uploaded an intriguing video of this sleek new style, and it looks to be a huge departure from its current Metro UI aesthetic. Microsoft’s looking to add a dash of AI to video editing with a new application called Windows Story Remix. The app takes advantage of deep learning to organize images and clips into stories, complete with a soundtrack and transitions. Finally, the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update is going to introduce Microsoft’s mixed reality platform in a big way. The company needs apps for this to work, which is why it’s announced Acer and HP-made Windows Mixed Reality Headset Developer Edition units priced at $299 and $329, respectively. The two are now up for pre-orders on the company’s site with a summer release date in mind. Microsoft’s also looking to make headway into the retail space with its first-ever Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers. These accessories will work in tandem with Windows Mixed Reality headsets to precisely track movement without having to install hardware markers in the surrounding space. Acer’s going to bundle both devices together at $399 and sell it this holiday season.

The added bells and whistles will roll out later this year as part of “Fall Creators Update” that will be provided for free to 500 million personal computers, smartphones and tablets powered by Windows 10. Microsoft previewed the update Thursday in Seattle during its annual conference for applications developers. The company didn’t specify when it will be available; a preview for early testers was released Thursday. The latest changes come on the heels of a free update that began to roll out last month. “We are building Windows to be the platform that empowers everyone to create,” Terry Myerson, Microsoft’s top Windows executive, wrote in a blog post . Some of the upcoming tools represent another step in Microsoft’s attempt to catch up with two of its biggest rivals, Apple and Google. Along that vein, a new feature called Story Remix will automatically identify the best photos and videos to help people create highlights of their experiences. Microsoft also is opening up Windows 10 so it works better with the smartphones and tablets running on Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android software. A growing dependence on those mobile devices has reduced the role that Windows-powered PCs play in people’s lives. That shift to smartphones and tablets also is one of the reasons the next Windows 10 update will include a multi-faceted clipboard to let you copy text, images and other content on a PC and paste it on a phone, even iPhones and Android, as though the PC and phone were one. The tool is similar to what Apple already offers with Universal Clipboard in iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. Another upcoming feature will let you start working on a document on a Windows 10 PC and pick up where you left off on a rival phone. In another concession to the popularity of Apple’s products, iTunes software will be added to the Windows Store – an announcement that evoked some of the loudest cheers in Thursday’s crowd. That development will be particularly helpful for students using a streamlined version of Windows designed for classrooms. That recently introduced version, Windows 10 S, can’t get apps directly from third parties such as Apple, as regular Windows 10 users can. Meanwhile, Microsoft is vying to be more of a trailblazer by expanding its exploration of a new technological frontier that allows people to blend the real world with three-dimensional projections of life-like images. The Redmond, Washington, company calls the emerging field “mixed reality” because it melds the artificial with things that are actually happening around us. The concept is more commonly known as augmented reality. Another format that immerses people in completely fabricated situations is known as virtual reality. Microsoft plans to introduce a new headset and motion controller in time for the holiday season. The equipment, to be made by Acer, will sell as a package for $399, far less than the $3,000 to $5,000 Microsoft charges for another mixed reality headset called HoloLens.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     IPhone 8 To Come With World's First 3D Facial Recognition Camera Posted: May 12 2017, 5:09am CDT | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Apple   Rumors have it that the iPhone 8 will feature a 3D Face Recognition Camera   Rumors have it that the iPhone 8 will feature a 3D Face Recognition Camera iPhone 8’s camera may get a three dimensional makeover. Apple is working in synch with LG Innotek to manufacture electronic parts that will supply the world’s first 3D facial recognition camera for the iPhone 8, according to Korea Economic Daily via The Investor. Don't Miss: The hottest Apple Rumors for 2017 This facility would lend the camera the ability to sense depth. Thus all that you would need to unlock the iPhone would be your face.   The facial recognition system on the Samsung Galaxy S8 is not foolproof. You can bamboozle its electronic circuitry by using a photograph instead of a face. The iPhone 8 was going to get this technology once Apple bought RealFace. As for LG Innotek, it is not supplying products to Apple for the first time.  According to CNet, LG supposedly invested $238.5 million in a novel facility to make camera modules for Apple. This is due to the fact that the 3D cameras will be smaller than the iPhone 7 Plus cameras.   According to Mac Observer, Apple’s starting order from Innotek is for about $177 million. The iPhone 8 3D camera was supposed to have iris scanning technology on board. Yet now reports say that infrared sensors will be used to make way for 3D facial maps. Avatars and 3D selfies will be possible too thanks to this piece of sophisticated technology. This feature has already captured the interest of and garnered curiosity from the avid consumer base. The iPhone 8 will have an OLED display screen. Also a Home Button and Touch ID Sensors will figure among some of the cool features of this iPhone. When September of this year comes along, the iPhone 8 will be unveiled and it may surprise many a consumer with some of the stuff it carries in its slim case.   According to BGR, the 3D facial recognition system is one of the hottest of the iPhone 8 features. Mere mention of this facility has made it to the front page of many a newspaper. The iPhone 8 will be radically redesigned for futuristic times. Where Samsung which used 2D technology failed, Apple is going to show the world what success looks and feels like.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) who is the primary manufacturer of Apple’s chipset has now reportedly received a mass production order from the US-based firm for the A11 chip. The upcoming iPhone 7S and 7S Plus along with the much hyped iPhone 8 (10th-anniversary edition) are likely to be powered by the new A11 chip. Last year’ Apple’s A10 chip outgunned Snapdragon 820 and 821 and the story is likely to continue this year as well. Apple A11 chip is expected to be more powerful than Snapdragon 835 or even Samsung’s Exynos 8895 chip.   As for the A11 chip mass production, Digitimes quoted that - "TSMC has begun 10nm chip production for Apple's next-generation iPhone 8 series. Production was once affected by issues involving stacking components in the backend integrated fan-out packaging process, but they have already been solved,"   A more powerful chip coupled with a pretty well-optimised software will yet again make the next iPhone rule the performance battle. Else, the real story will come out only when we have the device out in the world for grabs.   Meanwhile, Apple is also likely to begin production of iPhones in India soon. The Cupertino-based giant has set up a facility in Peenya, Bengaluru and Foxconn (Apple’s primary manufacturer for its various components) is taking care of it. Interestingly, the production is set to begin soon as OnLeaks has now reported that Apple has started hiring the team which will work on the initial phase of production. Note that, some reports suggests that this team will actually work on the new iPhones and the production for the same is likely to begin by August. Apple is likely to launch three iPhones this year, of which the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus are likely to be announced sometime in September while iPhone 8 might take some while due to some issues with the procurement of some of the components. Further, the US-based manufacturers is also said to be facing difficulties with the fingerprint scanner and wireless charging.

The company’s shares plunged the most in seven years on Thursday after Gotham questioned its unusually high profit margins and undisclosed transactions with related parties that may have violated Apple’s labour standards. Shenzhen-based AAC later denied all the accusations. “It makes sense for an industry leader to have a higher profit margin. I believe our engineers and management are capable of increasing it further,” managing director Richard Mok told reporters in a press conference on Friday. It makes sense for an industry leader to have a higher profit margin. I believe our engineers and management are capable of increasing it further Richard Mok, managing director, AAC The short-seller’s attack came just one day before the manufacturer of miniaturised speakers and receivers for clients like Apple, Huawei and Xiaomi posted the financial result of its “most profitable first quarter ever.” Net profit for the three months ended March 31 surged 72 per cent to 1.06 billion yuan, boosted by demand from Chinese clients for higher-end waterproof and stereo speakers, according to the company’s filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. Helped by the phenomenal success of Apple’s iPhones, AAC has seen its share price soar nearly twelvefold over the last decade with steady revenue growth. It is one of the best performing stocks in Hong Kong so far this year, gaining 36 per cent over the last five months. Investors had also piled into the stock for its hefty gross margin, which it managed to lift to a staggering 41.6 per cent for the first quarter from 40.5 per cent booked a year earlier. Apple supplier AAC denies short-seller’s accusation of ‘dubious accounting’ as shares plunge The Gotham report alleged that AAC’s higher margin versus peers is due to its transactions with 20-odd undisclosed related parties owned by the chief executive’s families or employees. The New York-based researcher went on to accuse the electronic component producer of hiding these entities so as to get around Apple’s labour standards. It is the first time Gotham, which has gained recognition among hedge fund managers for its stellar campaign returns, has launched an attack on an Asian company. Its 2014 short-selling report on Spanish company Gowex saw the Wifi provider file for insolvency while another European tech firm Quindell plunged 39 per cent straight after its attack in 2014. But Mok dismissed all the claims, stressing on Friday that “the company has achieved a 40 per cent profit margin thanks to our automatic production lines and economics of scale, among other factors.” “All of our clients speak highly of us regarding our standards for suppliers,”he said. “We don’t have any undisclosed transactions with related parties.” Jefferies analyst Rex Wu wrote in a note released on Friday that his channel check confirmed the existence of Lian Tai Precision in China’s southeast Jiangsu province, the case raised in the Gotham report as a “related party.” But his note suggested the factory mainly produces metal casings for firms such as Huawei and Xiaomi, but not Apple.

The Guy Who Saved Your iPhone From Hackers Is Stuck in a UAE Jail 'Million dollar dissident' Ahmed Mansoor’s actions protected millions of iPhone users from sophisticated spyware. If you care about your privacy and security, you should be fighting for his release. This article was authored by Amnesty International and published on Motherboard with permission. When most of the tech world first heard his name, activist Ahmed Mansoor had already spent more than a decade fighting against human rights abuses in his native United Arab Emirates (UAE). But it was a series of suspicious text messages he received last year that briefly shone turned the tech world's attention to Mansoor, a poet and blogger who campaigns for freedom of expression and civil and political rights. The messages, delivered to his iPhone 6 on 10 and 11 August, promised to reveal "new secrets" about detainees tortured in UAE prisons, and contained a hyperlink to an unfamiliar website. It would have been easy to click. But Mansoor was hyper vigilant—he had to be. He'd already been hacked twice by the Emirati authorities, and the suffocating surveillance he knew he was under had in the past led to a beating, a spell in prison and the imposition of a travel ban. Anyone who cares about privacy; anyone who is uncomfortable with the way that surveillance technology creates a one-way window for governments to look into, should be shouting from the rooftops about Ahmed Mansoor. Sensing something wasn't right, he passed the messages on to security researchers, who alerted Apple to a series of software flaws in the iPhone which made users vulnerable to hacking. Apple corrected the problem quickly, and Ahmed was credited for a discovery which had helped improve security for millions of iPhone users worldwide. "While updating your software, you should pause for a moment to thank human rights activist, Ahmed Mansoor," said Ronald Deibert, the director of Citizen Lab. The spyware which Mansoor had been targeted with was so sophisticated and expensive that Citizen Lab researchers dubbed him the "million dollar dissident". But life as a dissident in the UAE is bleak. Fast forward to 2017 and Ahmed Mansoor is in solitary confinement in a UAE jail. In the six weeks since he was seized in the middle of the night from his apartment, he has effectively been denied access to a lawyer. To make matters worse, he has been allowed just one face-to-face visit with his wife and has not seen his children since his arrest. Meanwhile, the UAE continues its ascent as the bright new star of the tech world, the destination of choice for start-ups seeking access to emerging markets across the Middle East, Africa and Asia. The same authorities who have harassed and pursued Ahmed Mansoor for his peaceful activism are increasingly successful in their efforts to rebrand the country as a 'Silicon Oasis'. Twitter, Facebook and even Apple have headquartered their Middle East operations in Dubai's impressive high rises, and the emirate's ruler, Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, has called the UAE an "incubator of innovation and future technology". But the million dollar dissident gets no part in these dreams for the future, and the tech community has moved on while he languishes in jail. The charges against Mansoor are spurious. He is accused of using social media websites to: "publish false information and rumours;" promote a "sectarian and hate-incited agenda;" and "publish false and misleading information" that harms national unity and damages the country's reputation. It is deeply ironic that the UAE, a state which claims to be so excited about the opportunities technology brings, is so intent on throttling freedom of expression online. We must not be fooled by the glittering façade of the 'Silicon Oasis'. Behind it is a tightening noose of repression and fear, and while the lights may be on, voices of dissent have been switched off one by one. No matter where we live, we all have something to learn from Mansoor's experience. It is emblematic of the risks we are all facing in an age of increased state surveillance, when new technology helps the most ruthless governments crack down on citizens who dare to disrupt the status quo. His vigilance last August disarmed them of one of these new tools, and we owe him a great debt. Anyone who cares about privacy; anyone who is uncomfortable with the way that surveillance technology creates a one-way window for governments to look into, should be shouting from the rooftops about Ahmed Mansoor. Companies rushing to grab a piece of the UAE should remember that, while their presence flatters the image of the Emirati authorities, their operations are subject to the same laws that are systematically stamping out all signs of dissent in the country. Companies also need to be mindful of human rights abuses in the UAE, and ensure that their presence there does not facilitate online censorship or surveillance. For example they must think carefully about how they would respond to requests by the authorities for content removal or user data. We should also remember that we are not impotent when it comes to this kind of injustice. The UAE cares about its reputation, its 'brand'. If it wants to continue projecting the image of a tech-savvy country open to innovation and investment, the UAE needs the buy-in of major technology companies and their employees. The complaints of the human rights community may fall on deaf ears, but the UAE will listen if – and when - the tech community speaks up. There are things that can be done. Sign this petition by NGOs from the tech community calling for Ahmed's release. Use every platform you have to speak out, to keep Ahmed on the agenda. If you are doing business in the UAE, consider the human rights risks and make plans to mitigate against them. The imprisonment of Ahmed Mansoor was a warning to human rights defenders by a government determined to crush dissent at any cost. But it should also serve as a warning to the tech world: not to be blinded by the bright lights, and to remember that it is the Ahmed Mansoors of this world who defend our human rights and make technology safer for us all.

The investment will support the Kentucky-based company’s R&D, capital equipment needs and “state-of-the-art glass processing,” Apple said Friday. For over a decade, Corning employees have helped create the protective glass found on iOS devices, with its 65-year-old Harrodsburg facility having been integral to the collaboration between the two companies. Since the inception of Gorilla Glass in 2007, the Apple-Corning partnership has created and sustained nearly 1,000 US jobs across Corning’s R&D, manufacturing and commercial functions, including over 400 in Harrodsburg, said the iPhone maker. Corning’s procured enough renewable energy to cover all of its Apple manufacturing in US. Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, said: Corning is a great example of a supplier that has continued to innovate and they are one of Apple’s long-standing suppliers. This partnership started 10 years ago with the very first iPhone, and today every customer that buys an iPhone or iPad anywhere in the world touches glass that was developed in America. We’re extremely proud of our collaboration over the years and we are investing further with Corning who has such a rich legacy of innovative manufacturing practices. Corning recaptures glass material for use in the production process and to help reduce waste. Corning developed its durable type of glass back in the 1960s. Aptly dubbed Gorilla Glass, it was a financial flop at the time so the company stopped making it. Fast forward to 2005, when Corning CEO Wendell Weeks gave Steve Jobs a demonstration of his company’s glass material. Jobs was impressed and decided to use Corning’s glass protection for the original iPhone, as explained in Walter Isaacson’s authorized biography of the late Apple co-founder: Jobs said he wanted as much Gorilla Glass as Corning could make within six months. ‘We don’t have the capacity,’ Weeks replied. ‘None of our plants make the glass now.’ ‘Don’t be afraid,’ Jobs replied. This stunned Weeks, who was good-humored and confident but not used to Jobs’ reality distortion field. He tried to explain that a false sense of confidence would not overcome engineering challenges, but that was a premise that Jobs had repeatedly shown he didn’t accept. He stared at Weeks unblinking. ‘Yes, you can do it,’ he said. ‘Get your mind around it. You can do it.” As Weeks retold this story, he shook his head in astonishment. ‘We did it in under six months,’ he said. ‘We produced a glass that had never been made.’ Corning’s facility in Harrisburg, Kentucky, which had been making LCD displays, was converted almost overnight to make Gorilla Glass full-time. ‘We put our best scientists and engineers on it, and we just made it work.’ In his airy office, Weeks has just one framed memento on display. It’s a message Jobs sent the day the iPhone came out: ‘We couldn’t have done it without you.’ In the US, Apple now supports two million jobs across all 50 states. This includes 450,000 jobs attributable to the firm’s spend and investment with US-based suppliers. In 2016, the Cupertino firm spent over $50 billion with more than 9,000 domestic suppliers and manufacturers.

See Offers Business Posted May 11 Updated May 11 increase font size Microsoft previews new features A Windows 10 update will help sort the best photos. By MICHAEL LIEDTKEAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article Terry Myerson, executive vice president of the Windows and Devices Group, speaks at the Microsoft Build 2017 developers conference Thursday in Seattle. Associated Press/Elaine Thompson SAN FRANCISCO — An upcoming feature in Microsoft’s Windows 10 system will automatically identify the best photos and videos to help people create highlights of their experiences. The tool, called Story Remix, will be part of a “Fall Creators Update” to roll out later this year to 500 million personal computers, smartphones and tablets powered by Windows 10. Microsoft previewed the update Thursday at a conference in Seattle for applications developers. Microsoft will also make a Story Remix app for devices running Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android to help people share images from their children’s soccer games and other events. Apple and Google already offer similar tools to manage images. Both those companies have helped undercut the popularity of PCs running on Windows. Other features in the Fall Creators Update will include: • A multi-device clipboard to let you copy text, images and other content on a laptop and paste it on a phone, as though the two devices were one. It’s similar to what Apple already offers with Universal Clipboard in iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. • With Timeline, you’ll be able to pick a time, say last Wednesday morning, and see what files, apps and sites you had opened, allowing you to easily jump back to what you were doing. A companion Pick Up Where You Left Off feature will let you continue what you’re doing on another device, much like Apple’s Handoff feature. • Changes to the OneDrive online storage service will make it easier to work with files without having to download everything and take up storage space on a device. Microsoft didn’t say when Fall Creators Update will come out. A preview for early testers was released Thursday. As with other Windows 10 updates, this will be free for existing Windows 10 users. The company is also expanding its exploration of a new technological frontier that allows people to mix the real world with three-dimensional projections of life-like images. The fall Windows 10 update will include features for playing games and watching video in the realm of “mixed reality,” the melding of the artificial with things that are actually happening around us. Microsoft also plans to introduce a new mixed reality headset and motion controller in time for the holiday season. The equipment, to be made by Acer, will sell as a package for $399. That is far less than the $3,000 to $5,000 Microsoft has been charging for another mixed reality headset called HoloLens. Apple’s iTunes software is coming to its Windows Store, a development that will help students using a streamlined version of Windows designed for classrooms. That version, Windows 10 S, can only get apps through the store, not directly from third parties such as Apple. Regular Windows 10 users can already get iTunes from Apple.

The Supermarket Could Look Like In 2065 Advertising Doc Portrait PDF Landscape PDF Doc EMail Share Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Available to Premium & Purple Members In the lead-up to our conference, Studio Industries CEO Mike Lee teleported me in a time machine to the grocery store of the future, where experiences will reign over products Emily Wasik 11 may 2017 When you think about how much the digital age has transformed the world around us—how Netflix has disrupted the film industry, Spotify the music industry, Apple the telecommunications industry—the one industry that seems to be left in the dust while everyone else is riding off into the sunset is the food industry. Just think: computers have evolved at supersonic speed over the last few decades – from being the size of a room during the Apollo space race to being literally the size of a speck of moon dust. Step into any grocery store today, however, and as you take out your iPhone to check your shopping list and listen to your Spotify weekly playlist, the food aisles you’re browsing haven’t changed that much at all. The physical products themselves are still distributed, laid out and sold in a familiar fashion—for customers to manually pick up and put in their shopping cart, scan at a checkout and pay for at a cash register. We’re used to going to places like the Apple store to interact with products and be inspired by them, but very little of our trips to the grocery store result in some sort of learning or mind-stimulating experience. Studio Industries and Food Market founder Mike Lee, however, believes the future of food is finally having its a-ha moment. In his words, the food industry looks just like Silicon Valley, except it’s 10 years behind and twice as slow. Why? Because food is a tangible physical thing and not just pixels, and therefore, is more capital intensive. I got Mike to teleport me in a time machine to 2065 to show me his predictions on what the future supermarket will look like and that the key to the food industry of tomorrow is to offer an experience over products. Emily: When people hear the name “Studio Industries”, it’s hard to pinpoint what exactly the company does. Could you walk us through it? Mike: We do food design, which is applying design thinking to the food industry. In other words, we focus on designing new products and new experiences for large multinational corporations, startups, and everything in between. We’re trying to really just raise the bar for the level of quality of food products out there. I started doing this years ago when I was at Chobani, working on their innovations group doing essentially the same thing—doing food design and thinking about what are the new products and what are the new platforms that the company should go to. That’s what we do. When did you first get sparkly-eyed over the future of food? The future of food really was sparked shortly after we started Studio Industries about four years ago. We realized that, as an agency starting out, we were going to be only as good as some of the briefs that we would get. We wanted a space for us to think really aggressively about what food could be. That really lends itself to thinking about what could happen deep into the future, deeper than most people were thinking. Most of the time, it’s people that are designing products are looking at maximum a two or three-year timeline, if that. More times, it’s like a one-year timeline. That’s fine. We do that during most of our work. We created this project called the Future Market as a way to imagine what could happen 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years out in terms of human behavior and in terms of technology, and how would that impact the way the food system works? We took a page out of the auto industry, creating concept cars as our inspiration. We produced these concept products that really illustrate what could happen in the future the same way that Ford or GM produces a concept car every year that shows what could be the thing that we’re driving 10 years from now. We apply that to what we could be eating in 10 to 20 years time. That’s really where the passion for the future of food stemmed from. Teleport us in a time machine to your vision of what the grocery experience could look like in 2065. What are your predictions? There’s a lot of predictions, but I think a few of the ones that are most interesting to me are the idea that grocery stores in general are going to completely be redefined. For one thing, if you think of a grocery store today, it’s really just a site of distribution. It’s really just a place where stuff was made somewhere else and then you pick it up at the grocery store. That’s essentially what it does. I see, in the future, that changing to the point where grocery stores are not just sites of distribution, but they’re sites of production. It’s essentially looking at the farming system and shattering it into tiny little pieces all over the country. You look at something like Whole Foods in Brooklyn, and they’ve got the Gotham Greens rooftop garden farm over there, where they’re making basil that literally goes downstairs and is sold and consumed by people. That is a first really big sign of saying, “Hey, grocery stores aren’t just places to pick stuff up. You can produce things there too.” For fresh produce, I think that’s going to happen in less than 50 years. It’s already happening and it’s going to be more and more common. If you look on the other side of what else can we grow in a small amount of space, you look at things like cellular agriculture, where people are taking meat cells, culturing them and duplicating them in clean labs. Hopefully one day you can do that in a grocery store where maybe you don’t need a cattle farm to supply the meat for the butcher counter at a Whole Foods or some other grocery store. You can literally just culture it in the same way you could ferment beer on-site. I think that’s a big macro trend that’s happening because the places in which we’re able to produce food are shrinking. I think more and more of it can happen on-site. Over the last decade, grocery store center aisles have shrunk, leading people to think they will soon be extinct like the dinosaurs. What is your opinion on this? I think the center aisles are definitely shrinking. There’s objective data that proves that. Fresh is definitely taking over. I don’t think the center aisles are completely going away, though. I think what the center aisles are doing is that they’re shedding their skin. Older legacy brands like Heinz is slowly being chipped away at by companies like Sir Kensington’s. In every single category of product, even with Kraft Mac and Cheese and Annie’s Macaroni and Cheese, there’s better versions coming up. I see a lot of that food metamorphosing into better, cleaner versions of themselves in the future. Not all of the categories are going to survive. There’s going to be some things that we’re just not going to have any more in the center aisles, maybe. I think, for the most part, all that stuff is going to get a lot cleaner and a lot more sustainable. That’ll keep it strong. What are some of the biggest ideas and shifts that we’ll be seeing in the food industry in 2017 and beyond? I think the big theme around that is that we can have healthy, sustainable food that’s accessible to everybody. I think that’s some of the biggest idea and shift of how we can change in the future. It’s an aspirational dream of mine, but I think that’s where the industry is trying to get to. What are the important consumer attitudes/behaviors around food that you see shaping the marketplace? A lot of times, when you talk about the future of food, you only fixate on the technology, because it’s a little easier to say there’s this new gadget or new thing that is taking us into the future. I think it’s equally important to pay attention to consumer behavior and attitudes, because you can only really innovate when consumer attitudes or technology move in lockstep. I think people are in this predicament where they want their cake, and they want to eat it, too. We know that the mass meat industry, for instance, is really resource intensive. Feed lots are not really good things for animals or the planet, but yet we still eat 80 percent of our plate is meat, as an American on average. This is also not just an American thing, but it’s happening with rising cultures like China. As China is becoming richer and richer, they’re adopting a Western diet. That’s problematic if a billion people come online and start eating like they do in Texas. For as much as technology and cellular agriculture can change us, we have to get away from these very resource intensive, environmentally challenging types of foods. Not stop them, but have a more mindful attitude about them, reduce the amount of meat you’re eating, increase the amount of vegetables you’re eating and so on. It feels soft, but consumer behaviors add up. That’s what makes the food producers produce what they want to produce. There are now more places and ways than ever for consumers to buy speciality foods. How can retailers compete with this proliferation of competitors? There’s so much competition to get food. I think it’s becoming to the point where, if it’s a commodity that you don’t need any experience around…If I just need to buy a box of salt, I don’t need any experience for that. I can just deliver that online. If I want to explore cheeses, or I want to explore vegetables, or I want to do something like that, I’m open to having an experience around that. I think that’s the thing that’s going to be very hard to disrupt with digital, fresh direct food type things. There’s still room for, I think, stores to become Murray’s Cheese Shop or Chelsea Market, where it’s a destination and an experience, and not just a place where you go pick stuff up. I say a lot that grocery stores need to start thinking more like the Apple Store. People spend an afternoon in an Apple Store, check their email, and write. People have written novels on the computer there. How do you get it to a point where people want to linger around in your grocery store and just loiter? That’s when you know you’ve created a good experience. Think, there’s not a lot of places you can real life food education without having to sign up for a cooking class or something like that, yet the grocery store is a place that we go all the time. Very little of our trips to the grocery store result in some sort of learning experience. You’ve said in a former interview that in 10 years every retailer will have some sort of vehicle to identify and cultivate new start-ups. Why is this partnership with startups so important for retailers? And what are some of these vehicles you have in mind? I think there’s a lot of examples of different accelerators and incubators out there. Chobani Food Incubator is one of them. That’s an example of a big brand looking for little brands that are innovating faster. Chobani’s not even as big as some of the other big ones, like General Mills and stuff like that. The truth of the matter is, I think right now, large brands have forgotten how to innovate a little bit. They maybe haven’t forgotten, but they’ve stalled a little bit on their engine on innovation. They’ve focused much more on saying, “Hey, there’s thousands of startups out there. Let’s just wait and see which one is doing the best, and then we can acquire them, or we can invest in them.” You’re seeing literally, General Mills is a great example, actually. They acquired Annie’s a couple years ago which was a huge acquisition. They have a brand incubator called 301, which is essentially their vehicle to source little brands, give them support, and give them to tutelage to the point of, “You guys are all grown up now. We want to acquire you.” That’s the way of innovation right now. I still think retailers and brands in 10 years will start to do that. They’ll keep doing that in 10 years. I also think they’re going to have to start thinking of how they innovate internally. There’s only so many times you can pay $800 million for a macaroni and cheese company before it becomes really cash intensive. What about the biggest thing you’ve learnt about the industry since you’ve started out? I always say that the food industry looks just like Silicon Valley, except 10 years behind and twice as slow (laughs). The same disruption that I think happened to Netflix disrupting movies, iTunes disrupting music, Spotify disrupting music, all of the digital media, social media disrupting news organizations, that’s happening right now with small startups with big companies. It’s just happening at more of a glacial pace, for the simple fact that food is not pixels. It’s harder to innovate, and it’s much more capital intensive. I think the patterns of innovation repeat themselves. You’ve got a lot of big companies that are losing market share to small groups of people. Then on the same side, you’re getting a lot of small companies getting tons of investment capital, not always in the most sober way. It’s the same thing that happened in the early 2000s with the tech boom is happening with companies like Juicero right now, getting hundreds of millions of dollars, $80 million to create a juice machine that you can just recreate with your hands. It’s crazy. That’s what I’ve learned, is that the pattern is not terribly unique when it comes to innovation. I think as an innovator, and when you’re making new things, it’s really smart to always, if you’re introducing something new, is you need to always anchor it to something that they’re familiar with. I think people freak out when everything about your idea is completely new and exciting. It just becomes this amorphous thing, where there’s no anchor to what it all means. If you can introduce the newness a little bit more, and little bit more, it does wonders for how you can sell an idea or get an idea across. I have this thing that I say that it’s the reason that they rate cars in horsepower, because before a car, the horse is all you knew. Saying, “No, this thing has 100 horsepower,” that instantly gives people a frame of reference for what this new invention could be. I always try to keep that in mind. It’s very useful, because there’s a lot of institutional knowledge in the food industry. You have to meet people in the middle. That’s why with the future market, we still talk about it as an actual grocery store, even though in the future, grocery stores might be completely distributed. We still think that people have a visceral response and understanding when they step into a grocery store. They know what to do. It’s a great tool to communicate new ideas with. What can we expect next from Studio Industries? Are there any new projects in progress? On the future market, I can’t say too much about this, but we’re going to have a very big installation happening in late June in New York City. There’s something very physical coming in that respect that is going to be very exciting, and we’ll be announcing that pretty soon. We should be able to announce it at the conference. Then a lot of our energy is also focused to a new business called Alpha Food Labs. It is not a new business. Essentially, it’s a new moniker that my wife and I are putting our company underneath. My wife runs the website Food+Tech Connect. It’s basically like PSFK, but only for food. We just soft launched a company called Alpha Food Labs. What Alpha Food Labs is is it’s an innovation platform for food companies. We support startups, and we support large corporations. For startups, we give them mentorship and tutelage. We give them access to resources to help them scale up. For larger companies, we introduce them to startups. We also help them with their internal innovation projects. That can range anywhere from doing workshops to training staff on design, to doing an actual fast prototyping project, where we’re taking some idea that they have and making them real very quickly. That’s what Alpha Food Labs is. We’ll be building that a physical space in Brooklyn later this year. We’ve already started doing projects behind the scenes with a number of large companies, and we have some startups in the queue. Work is happening on it, but it’s open to the public. Thanks for the glimpse into the supermarket 50 years from now! Come see Tom take the stage to talk about the future of the grocery retail experience at our PSFK 2017 conference on May 19.

Video Can the iPhone make better AR than Facebook and Snapchat? | The iPhone Show Apple’s iOS and Mac app stores revolutionized software distribution. They provide one-stop shops for apps from vendors around the world, allowing software developers to offer their products without worrying about setting up distribution contracts. They also take care of the fulfillment (billing and downloads), saving developers time and hassle. In exchange, Apple takes a 30 percent cut of sales, which is fair for the service they provide. But there’s one thing you can’t do in Apple’s app stores: you cannot provide a new version of your apps to existing customers at a discount. You can’t offer upgrade pricing. Upgrade pricing makes a lot of sense for software. It helps developers retain customers and it rewards loyalty. Upgrades are generally very similar to existing versions, with a few new features and perhaps a refreshed interface, so it’s not fair to expect users to pay full price. If you do, many users won’t opt for the new versions, and developers generally prefer if most of their users run the latest versions of their software. But Apple has shied away from offering upgrades in their app stores, and Phil Schiller, in a recent interview given in India, has doubled down on this. The reason we haven’t done it is that it’s much more complex than people know […] And the upgrade model, which I know very well from my days of running many large software programmes, is a model from the shrink-wrapped software days that for some developers is still very important, for most, it’s not really a part of the future we are going. I think for many developers, subscription model is a better way to, go than try to come up with a list of features, and different pricing for upgrade, versus for new customers. I am not saying it doesn’t have value for some developers but for most it doesn’t, so that’s the challenge. And if you look at the App Store it would take a lot of engineering to do that and so would be at the expense of other features we can deliver. Schiller has made it clear that upgrades are off the table. Apple has too many other things to do; it’s too difficult to implement; it’s “not really a part of the future.” Apple doesn’t generally use the excuse that something is too hard. But Schiller makes it clear hear that this process is complex. Let’s think about this. When you visit one of Apple’s app stores and view an app you own, Apple knows you have already purchased it. If it’s not on your Mac or iOS device, you see a cloud button allowing you to download the app. But Schiller says: For example, the App Store has one price for an app, when you see it, you see if there’s a price on it, that’s the price. It doesn’t have multiple prices for multiple tiers of customers so to engineer that in, it’s not impossible, but a lot of work for a small segment of software… I can’t imagine it’s that difficult to link that purchase information to a new version of an app in order to offer a discounted upgrade price to eligible users. Apple knows when you bought an app, and what price you paid; it doesn’t seem like an additional variable is complicated. Kirk McElhearn/IDG I bought The Dead Kennedys’ Holiday in Cambodia years ago; I can get $0.99 off if I buy the rest of the album. Apple already knows how to do this in the iTunes Store; it’s called Complete My Album, for music, or Complete My Season, for TV shows. If you buy a song or two, or an episode of a TV series, you can buy the rest of the album or series at a lower price. This is what Schiller describes as “multiple prices for multiple tiers of customers.” I don’t know about you, but I find app subscriptions annoying. They work fine for, say, Office 365 or Adobe Creative Cloud, which are expensive app suites, but I’m not going to buy a subscription to a $5 or $10 app that gets upgraded every couple of years. Developers who can’t or don’t want to offer subscriptions are stuck in the middle of this issue, and they’ll be the losers. It’s not that Apple can’t offer upgrade pricing, it’s simply that they don’t want to. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Read More One service that Apple desperately needs to expand to Windows and Android is iMessage. While the service is awesome if you exist purely in the Apple ecosystem, for those of us who revolve in mixed environments the limitation feels artificial, punitive, and annoying. Given the myriad of ways that people can choose to communicate with each other these days, and the fact that little separates the platforms in terms of performance and usability, Apple is risking alienating users because it wants to punish those who dare to work outside the Apple ecosystem, and making them look elsewhere for a platform that doesn't have artificial boundaries. Keeping iMessage locked to iOS and macOS is akin to Apple's initial decision to make the iPod only compatible with Macs (fun fact, the iPod only became a big hit when Apple opened it up to Windows users). At a time when there are 500 million PCs running Windows 10, and over 80 percent of smartphones running Android, Apple is not only missing on a chance to cement the dominance of iMessage over the competition, but also making life needlessly difficult for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users that also have to use Windows and Android. As someone who does exist in that limbo between platforms, I'm increasingly finding myself moving away from iMessage because it's just not convenient to carry on a conversation using a Mac or iPhone when I'm working with another platform. So Apple, learn to love Android and Windows and make iMessage a truly universal messaging platform.

The company has hundreds of engineers working on improving the camera abilities of its flagship products, and with each generation, the iPhone becomes an even better photography device. In addition to upgrading the iPhone camera, it looks like Apple wants to teach its users how to take gorgeous photos with the iPhone, with a particular emphasis on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Don't Miss: This $22 under-bed LED lighting system is our new favorite thing in the world Rather than releasing new “shot on iPhone” ads, Apple this week posted on YouTube five clips that can teach you a few basic tricks for capturing better photos with the iPhone. The iPhone 7 series comes with the best iPhone camera experience to date, but the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus aren’t equals. The 5.5-inch model ships with a dual lens camera that comes with an exclusive portrait mode that’s not available on any other iPhone. That means out of the five clips Apple posted on YouTube, one of them will only help you if you own the iPhone 7 Plus, or plan on buying it later this year — the iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s Plus will also have dual cameras. All of Apple’s lessons are very short, at around 40 seconds each, and teach you exactly what you need to know to improve a single skill. Just follow the instructions on screen, preferably with an iPhone close by, and start shooting. Combine the tips for even better results — here are Apple’s iPhone camera tutorials: How to shoot action on iPhone 7 How to shoot without a flash on iPhone 7 How to shoot a vertical Pano on iPhone 7 How to shoot a close-up on iPhone 7 How to shoot a great portrait on iPhone 7 Plus Tags: Apple, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus View Comments Trending 1 Tech Apple’s iPhone 8 will be the most expensive iPhone the world has ever seen 2 Tech New Google Pixel 2 leak shows raw power that comes with stock Android O 3 Deals The one accessory every Nintendo Switch owner needs is on sale for $6 on Amazon 4 Tech New report backs up rumors that the Galaxy Note 8 will feature a dual camera 5 Tech T-Mobile’s latest smartphone deal is one of the best yet Picked For You T-Mobile’s latest smartphone deal is one of the best yet By Chris Mills May 12th at 3:42 PM New Google Pixel 2 leak shows raw power that comes with stock Android O By Zach Epstein May 12th at 10:06 AM A gigantic, bloody dead thing just washed up in Indonesia and nobody knows what it is By Mike Wehner May 12th at 1:01 PM Advertise About Contact Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLC Powered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use ad

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS Apple invests $200M in Corning from manufacturing fund to develop new glass for future products Chris O'Brien@obrien May 12, 2017 4:59 AM On the heels of its commitment to pump $1 billion into American manufacturing projects, Apple today announced that it had selected long-time partner Corning to receive the first $200 million investment from the new fund. The money comes from Apple’s Advanced Manufacturing Fund that CEO Tim Cook revealed recently. The company said the money will “support Corning’s R&D, capital equipment needs, and state-of-the-art glass processing.” Corning makes the Gorilla Glass that was essential to making the iPhone’s touchscreen technology work. “Corning is a great example of a supplier that has continued to innovate, and they are one of Apple’s long-standing suppliers,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, in a statement. “This partnership started 10 years ago with the very first iPhone, and today every customer that buys an iPhone or iPad anywhere in the world touches glass that was developed in America. We’re extremely proud of our collaboration over the years and we are investing further with Corning, who has such a rich legacy of innovative manufacturing practices.” The new fund and the Corning announcement come after a year in which Apple and others were criticized by President Trump, who called them out during his campaign for outsourcing manufacturing overseas. In the wake of Trump’s unexpected victory, numerous companies have been searching for ways to respond to his often random and blistering threats about forcing companies to pay higher import taxes. At first glance, Corning does not seem in desperate need for additional resources. According to securities filings, Corning generated $2.5 billion in cash last year from operations and another $3.7 billion from investments, so it’s not exactly lacking in resources to fund its own R&D. In an email, Corning spokesman Daniel Collins explained that the companies couldn’t offer many details of the arrangement. However, he did say: “We are collaborating with Apple to develop new glass production capabilities to meet the requirements of their next-generation mobile devices.” “Corning’s longstanding relationship with Apple has not only led to significant glass innovations that have enabled new capabilities for consumers, it has also helped create nearly 1,000 American jobs and allowed us to continue growing and expanding in the U.S.,” said Wendell P. Weeks, Corning’s chairman, chief executive officer, and president, in the Apple press release. “This investment will ensure our plant in Harrodsburg remains a global center of excellence for glass technology.” Apple claims it “supports 2 million jobs” in the U.S., including 450,000 at companies that supply it with components. The company says it spent more than $50 billion on 9,000 domestic suppliers.
