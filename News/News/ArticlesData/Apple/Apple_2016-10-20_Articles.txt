Are Intel's modems to blame for poor iPhone 7 Plus network reception? by Joe Roberts 21 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments New York-based research firm Cellular Insights, has blamed Intel modems for poor data connections on the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple used Intel's modems in iPhone 7 Plus models sold outside of China, Japan and the US, while phones sold in those countries come with modems made by Qualcomm. Cellular Insights conducted tests using networking equipment which showed iPhone 7 Plus models with both Qualcomm and Intel modems provided similar network performance under ideal conditions. Related: iPhone 7 But, as network conditions deteriorated, iPhone 7 models with Intel modems performed poorer than their Qualcomm-powered counterparts. As the research states: "In all tests, the iPhone 7 Plus with the Qualcomm modem had a significant performance edge over the iPhone 7 Plus with the Intel modem." This is the first time in five years that Apple has used a supplier other than Qualcomm for its handsets' modems, with Intel gaining a big client for its cellular modem business at a crucial time. The report continues: "We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple's decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone. "Considering that the iPhone with the Qualcomm modem is being sold in China, Japan and in the US only, we cannot imagine that modem performance was a deciding factor." In the tests, the Intel-based iPhone 7 Plus models yielded results that were at least 30% worse than the Qualcomm models, and in some cases there was a gap as large as 75%. The upshot is that the Intel phones will have poorer 4G reception than the Qualcomm versions, as well as slower download and upload speeds. For those interested in the technical details, here's Cellular Insight's wording: "At -96dBm the Intel variant needed to have Transport Block Size adjusted as BLER well exceeded the 2% threshold. At -105dBm the gap widened to 20%, and at -108dBm to a whopping 75%. "As a result of such a huge performance delta between the Intel and Qualcomm powered devices, we purchased another A1784 (AT&T) iPhone 7 Plus, in order to eliminate any possibility of a faulty device. The end result was virtually identical." If nothing else, the research is a reminder that, as the report puts it "OEM's implementation of baseband, RF front-end and the antenna design could play its role" in poor network reception, and network providers aren't always to blame.

So far we've seen a Halloween costume, a GTA V prank and an iPhone case depicting the discontinued handset. Now, even US President Barack Obama, who's been slyly upping his comedy game these last few months, has taken a shot at the Note 7. On Thursday, while speaking in Miami, he suddenly skewed off course to make an analogy about phones when discussing the Affordable Care Act (ie, ObamaCare).

They fix it. They upgrade it," Obama begins the explanation. Then, with a trademark giggle, he added: "Unless it catches fire. Then you pull it off the market." Damn, somebody out there apply cold water to the searing burn Samsung just received, please. Obama continued by saying: "But you don't go back to using a rotary phone. You don't say, 'Well, we're repealing smartphones. We're just gonna do the dial-up thing.' That's not what you do." It's not yet clear if Samsung will or won't release a rotary phone as a result of the Note 7 saga, with rumours actually indicating at this stage that the Galaxy S8 will steal certain features from the failed smartphone. Oh, and don't expect any more Note-related mishaps next year for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton to join in on, with Samsung reportedly set to only release one flagship in 2017.

A deal, which could happen as early as this weekend, would unite AT&T’s wireless, broadband and satellite TV brands with Time Warner’s entertainment empire, which includes cable networks such as TNT, TBS, CNN, the prized HBO channel, and the Warner Bros. film and TV studio. Talks toward a cash-and-stock purchase have come together quickly and could stall or fall through, said people familiar with the matter. Time Warner is seeking a deal that values it north of $100 a share, or about $80 billion, one of the people said.

Apple Inc. approached Time Warner about a merger a few months ago and while those talks are no longer active, Apple continues to monitor the situation, a person familiar with the situation said. If a Time Warner sale occurs that could encourage other telecom and media companies to pursue their own combinations. Time Warner shares rose 8 percentto $89.48 after The Wall Street Journal reported a deal could be imminent, while AT&T fell 3 percent to $37.49, both at 4 p.m. on Friday. An AT&T-Time Warner merger would be the most ambitious marriage of content and distribution since Comcast Corp.’s 2011 purchase of NBCUniversal and would create a behemoth that rivals that cable giant. Its value potentially would stand as the biggest media deal in recent years: Time Warner has a market capitalization of $72 billion and AT&T’s is $226 billion. A deal of its size would get intense regulatory scrutiny. U.S. regulatory officials have showed misgivings about conditions on the Comcast-NBCU deal—in particular, whether merger obligations on Comcast were enforceable—so it is unclear if they will be willing to bless another such merger. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes struck up talks in recent weeks, with support from internal teams, the people familiar with the matter said. Veteran entertainment executive Peter Chernin, who has an online video joint venture with AT&T, has informally advised AT&T on its bid, one of the people said. A sale of Time Warner to AT&T would have echoes of the blockbuster 2000 AOL-Time Warner merger — then the largest deal of all time. That was a different bet on a converged media future, one in which AOL’s internet service would have complemented and boosted Time Warner’s content. But the merger ultimately proved a failure, hurt by the unraveling of the dot-com boom, a clash of cultures and poor assumptions about the way each business could help the other. Dallas-based AT&T has been reshaping its strategy in recent years, as the U.S. cellular business became saturated and years of consolidation in that sector left no room for major deals. AT&T’s attempt to buy T-Mobile was killed by regulators in 2011. AT&T has turned to video, with the nearly $50 billion acquisition of DirecTV last year, instantly making it the biggest player in pay television. That pay TV business faces headwinds as more consumers cut the cord or look to trim their monthly bills, with streaming services providing new competition in the marketplace. Owning Time Warner’s content — including HBO’s “Game of Thrones” and professional sports games—could bring AT&T new growth and assets that would help its streaming media ambitions. With AT&T’s $117.3 billion in long-term debt at the end of June, a Time Warner deal could give the telecom company a balance sheet with debt hitting almost $200 billion, according to analysts at New Street Research. Bloomberg reported on Thursday that senior executives of AT&T and Time Warner had met in recent weeks to hold preliminary discussions on various business strategies, including a possible merger. Since the AOL-Time Warner deal, much has changed, and the mashup of mobile, broadband and TV that has long been anticipated has been taking shape quickly. Consumers are streaming shows on phones and tablets, signing up for TV services without a connection from a traditional cable or satellite provider, and doing much of their media consumption on social media platforms such as Facebook. Time Warner’s Bewkes has positioned his company as a pure content player in recent years, spinning off AOL as well as the Time Warner Cable pay-TV unit and the Time Inc. magazine-publishing division. In 2014, Bewkes fought off an unsolicited takeover bid from 21st Century Fox, indicating Time Warner wanted a far higher price than the initial roughly $80 billion offer that was on the table. (21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal-owner News Corp share common ownership.) Bewkes since has sought to persuade Wall Street he can run Time Warner effectively as a stand-alone outfit in a media world where a few distribution giants are achieving enormous scale. To answer the concern that Netflix and other streaming services are appealing to cord-cutters and people who never sign up for cable in the first place, he launched the HBO Now streaming service, which had nearly a million subscribers as of March. Time Warner also carried out cost cuts and layoffs and continued big content investments. Among media players, Time Warner is attractive because it doesn’t have a big shareholder with effective control and because it is relatively well-positioned for a media world where cable TV distributors want to carry skinnier bundles of channels. Time Warner has only a few major networks — some of which, like TNT and TBS, carry high-value sports content — compared with companies that have a host of channels with small audiences. Acquiring Time Warner also would get AT&T further into the streaming business with Hulu. Time Warner bought a 10 percent stake in Hulu in August, joining Walt Disney Co., 21st Century Fox and NBCUniversal as an owner in the $5.8 billion video service. AT&T also is launching a DirecTV online service aimed at selling a robust package of TV channels.

(Randi Lynn Beach/Bloomberg News) By Matt Schudel October 21 David Bunnell, who founded a series of innovative magazines in the 1980s chronicling the emerging world of computers, including PC Magazine, PC World and Macworld, and who played a large role in making computers accessible to the general public, died Oct. 18 at his home in Berkeley, Calif. He was 69. The cause was pancreatic cancer, his wife, Jacqueline Poitier, told the San Francisco Chronicle. Mr. Bunnell, a onetime student radical and teacher on a Native American reservation, became a magazine publisher almost by accident. He was working in Albuquerque in the 1970s as a technical writer for a start-up electronics company named Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, or MITS. In 1975, the company introduced the first commercially succesful microcomputer, the Altair 8800, which launched the beginning of the personal computer revolution. Mr. Bunnell began to edit a company newsletter about the computer and helped coordinate a convention for enthusiasts of the Altair. Two young programmers he knew at MITS, Bill Gates and Paul Allen, went on to found Microsoft. Mr. Bunnell stayed in Albuquerque and developed his first general-interest magazine for computer users, Personal Computing, in the late 1970s. “The idea I had when I created Personal Computing,” he said in 1984, “was that the personal computer market needed a consumer magazine that was for nontechnical people who wanted to get something out of the computer without knowing how to program it.” When the magazine’s publisher refused to give Mr. Bunnell an ownership stake, he quit and moved to San Francisco. He found a job as a word processor while conceiving the idea for another magazine built around the newly launched IBM personal computer. Working from a spare bedroom in his house, Mr. Bunnell and a small staff put together the first issue of PC Magazine, which debuted in January 1982. He was publisher and editor in chief. It was an immediate success, combining technical articles with cheeky, opinionated writing, glossy photography, colorful graphics and profiles of rising stars in the world of technology. “He produced his magazines in the language of the man on the street,” Samir Husni, director of the Magazine Innovation Center at the University of Mississippi, said in an interview. “He was an artist in terms of humanizing the machine. He destroyed the wall between the computer and the consumer.” Mr. Bunnell had an agreement in place in late 1982 to sell PC Magazine to International Data Group, a publisher of other high-tech publications. Before the deal was completed, the principal investor in PC Magazine sold it to a different company without informing Mr. Bunnell. Furious at what he considered a betrayal, Mr. Bunnell obtained financial backing from IDG to launch a competing magazine and took 48 of his 52 staff members with him. When the new publication, PC World, appeared in January 1983, it set industry records for advertising. Mr. Bunnell was sued for copyright infringement and other issues, but he prevailed in court, winning a settlement of $9 million. Flush with the success of PC World, Mr. Bunnell premiered yet another magazine, Macworld, which was designed to appeal to users of the new Apple Macintosh computer. The first issue came out on Jan. 24, 1984, the same day Apple’s Steve Jobs publicly introduced the Mac. In 1985, Mr. Bunnell was a principal force behind Macworld Expo, one of the first high-tech conferences aimed at consumers instead of people within the computer industry. The Macworld Expo became the prototype for countless other consumer electronics gatherings and, for years, was Jobs’s preferred showcase for launching Apple products. Even as he became a publishing wunderkind and high-tech millionaire, Mr. Bunnell ­remained an activist at heart. In a PC World editorial in 1986, he lambasted Georgia’s anti-sodomy laws as a form of discrimination that would undermine the state’s goal of becoming the Silicon Valley of the South. “The PC promise is to preserve and enhance the power of the individual,” he wrote. The Georgia law “conflicts with the vision of personal freedom that compelled the growth of personal computers.” David Hugh Bunnell was born July 25, 1947, in Alliance, Neb., where his father was editor of the local newspaper. Mr. Bunnell joined his father at work at an early age and became the paper’s sports editor at 16. At the University of Nebraska, from which he graduated in 1969, Mr. Bunnell was president of the campus chapter of the activist group Students for a Democratic Society. He organized antiwar protests and led a march of 4,000 people to protest housing discrimination in Lincoln, Neb. After college, Mr. Bunnell taught school in Chicago and later on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. During a 1973 armed standoff between Native Americans and federal officials at Wounded Knee, S.D., Mr. Bunnell smuggled food to members of the American Indian Movement. In addition to his computer magazines, Mr. Bunnell launched other publications and online ventures that had limited success, including New Media, BioWorld, Upside Today, ­Content.com and ELDR, aimed at aging baby boomers. In 2000, Mr. Bunnell’s 26-year-old son, Aaron, who worked for his father as chief of content at Upside Today, a fledgling Internet news site, died from what medical examiners determined to be an overdose of alcohol, Valium and heroin. His death was considered a cautionary tale that exemplified the hard-charging, hard-partying life of young high-tech workers. “I believe my son was a victim of the dot-com boom,” Mr. Bunnell said. He struggled with drug and alcohol himself, overcoming his addictions through therapy and treatment. In later years, Mr. Bunnell became an advocate of healthy foods and dietary supplements. He was the co-author of “Count Down Your Age: Look, Feel, and Live Better Than You Ever Have Before” (2007). His first marriage, to the former Linda Essay, ended in divorce. Survivors include Poitier, his wife of 35 years and an original staff member of PC World; a daughter from his first marriage; two stepdaughters; and a brother. Shortly before his death, Mr. Bunnell completed a memoir, “Good Friday on the Rez: A Pine Ridge Odyssey,” about his experiences on the South Dakota Indian reservation and at Wounded Knee. It is expected to be published next year. Even as he was hailed as a visionary who recognized the early promise of the computer age, Mr. Bunnell harbored doubts about the benefits of the online revolution. “The overwhelming thrust of the personal computer is that it can liberate and empower people,” he told the Los Angeles Times in 1987. “Unfortunately, so far it has largely been a white males’ revolution. Rather than decentralizing society, it has perpetuated the powers that be.” Read more Washington Post obituaries Thom Jones, onetime janitor who shone as a literary star in the 1990s, dies at 71 Jack Fuller, Chicago Tribune editor, publisher and president, dies at 69 Michael Elliott, who held top positions at three newsweeklies, dies at 65  Share on FacebookShare   Share on TwitterTweet Share via Email Most Read 1 Trump just laid out a pretty radical student debt plan 2 Yale professor: My students aren’t snowflakes, and they don’t melt 3 In libel suit, Melania Trump says Maryland blogger held ‘reckless disregard for the truth’ 4 Spider crickets: The bugs you don’t want in your house this fall 5 No, Finland isn’t ditching traditional school subjects.

Time Warner owns the Warner Bros. studio, CNN, HBO and the Cartoon Network, is home to Harry Potter and Batman films, TV powerhouses The Big Bang Theory and Gotham and DC Comics. Apple sees two-thirds of its revenues from the iPhone, but the fastest growing division within Apple is the Services category, which includes iTunes and Apple Music. USA TODAY Time Warner shares soar on AT&T's interest Wireless provider AT&T looks to be Time Warner's major suitor. Shares of the company rose more than 8% Friday after reports from Bloomberg and the Journal said AT&T is in advanced talks to be acquired by telecom giant AT&T. Beyond wireless plans, AT&T is now also a major player in both broadband distribution, via its U-Verse network, and owns satellite provider DirecTV. There were reports in 2015 that Apple was looking to get into original programming, a la Netflix and Amazon, to feed iTunes, which offers movies, TV shows and music from the major studios and labels. Instead, a production company announced a TV show, Planet of the Apps, produced in association with Apple, that will be an American Idol of sorts for the app world. Actresses and digital mavens Jessica Alba and Gwyneth Paltrow have signed as "mentors." Apple had no comment.

The idea is that you tap your phone against the terminal, it registers the transaction, and you’re done, all without having to take out your wallet. However let’s not forget that Apple Pay can also be used to make in-app purchases, and more recently it seems that the most expensive Apple Pay in-app purchase has been registered at a whopping $1 million. So what on earth could be worth that much that can be bought within an app? Try a a 1964 Aston Martin DB5 (also known as the James Bond car). Yup, it seems that someone (the buyer has chosen to remain anonymous) decided to purchase a 1964 Aston Martin DB5 using Apple Pay via British automobile auction house Coys of Kensington through the Vero social networking app. According to Chris Routledge, the CEO of COYS, “This is an exciting achievement for COYS digital presence, which signals a new era for classic car sales.” He adds, “The ‘Buy Now’ feature on Vero will give informed and savvy collectors a crucial head start in a highly competitive market place. Collectors worldwide fight fiercely amongst themselves to obtain the best machines and we certainly feel that Coys presence on Vero will give our clients that essential edge.” It looks like if Apple ever needed a way to show the legitimacy of Apple Pay as a payment platform, this could be it.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Qualcomm could buy NXP, which supplies iPhones with NFC and motion-tracking chips By Christian Zibreg, Oct 21, 2016 Tweet 3 Comments Bloomberg’s Alex Sherman and Ian King reported yesterday that fabless chip designer and Apple supplier Qualcomm could be buying NXP Semiconductors, a global semiconductor and analog circuitry manufacturer headquartered in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. NXP employs approximately 45,000 people in more than 35 countries and provides chips that give Apple devices features like power-efficient motion tracking and NFC for Apple Pay. Qualcomm’s market valuation sits at around $100 billion versus a market cap of approximately $36 billion for NXP. The two chipmakers may announce an all-cash deal for $110 to $120 per share as early as next week, Bloomberg learned. The news gathering organization says the potential deal would represent the largest acquisition in the history of the semiconductor industry. The deal could be announced at NXP’s October 26 earnings or at Qualcomm’s earnings, due on November 2, according to Bloomberg. In May 2015, NXP announced that its NFC and embedded secure element technology was going to be used across Qualcomm’s Snapdragon-based chips. Why should you care? For starters, NXP is an important Apple supplier, just like Qualcomm. Every iPhone since the iPhone 5s has used at least two components from NXP. The iPhone 5s was the first major design win for the Dutch chip maker. That phone marked both Apple’s first 64-bit mobile chip with the A7 and a dedicated motion coprocessor in the form of the M7. The M7 is basically a customized NXP part. The chip calibrates and captures data from the onboard sensors like the gyroscope, accelerometer and compass—without needing to constantly engage the main A-series chip and while managing to consume only a tiny fraction of the power that the A7 chip requires. The M7 is outstandingly power efficient: it barely takes up any battery power even though it’s constantly running in the background and even continues tracking movement after the phone’s battery is long dead. The M7 in the iPhone 5s and the M8 in the iPhone 6 were discreet chips that NXP had manufactured itself. The iPhone 6s’s M9 and the M10 in the iPhone 7 are embedded into the mail Apple-designed processor for additional power savings. The M10 also monitors other sensors, such as the barometer, microphone, proximity sensor and ambient light sensor. That’s why you need an iPhone with an embedded M-series chip for features like always-listening “Hey Siri” and Raise to Wake, neither of which could be realized through the main A-series processor as that would draw too much power. Capabilities of the M-series chips are available to apps through the Core Motion API, which was introduced in iOS 7. Starting with the iPhone 6, NXP also became a supplier of near field communication (NFC) chips that make Apple Pay possible. By the way, NXP is the co-inventor of NFC technology along with Sony. IHS Technology analyst Don Tait pegged NXP’s share of the market for NFC chips at fifty percent in 2013. Its current market share is likely even higher, especially after design wins such as the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone 7. Here are some of the NXP devices found in iPhones: iPhone 5s/5c—Buried beneath a neoprene-looking cover of the Apple-branded M7 motion coprocessor is a label that identifies the chip as an NXP-made LPC18A1 device. The LPC18A1 integrates a Cortex-M3 CPU core from ARM and sports a customized packaging and naming scheme, indicating an Apple customized part. Another NXP chip, the 1610A1, is used as an interface integrated circuit for the display. iPhone 6—The M8 motion coprocessor is NXP’s LPC18B1UK ARM Cortex-M3 Microcontroller and the NFC module is an NXP-made 65V10 NFC chip with an NXP PN548 NFC controller inside, which is a previously unannounced variant of the PN544 and PN547 devices from NXP. The accompanying Secure Element (not to be confused with the Secure Enclave embedded in A-series chips) is on a second die packaged with the PN548 and labeled as “008”. iPhone 6s/SE—NFC is handled by an NXP PN66V10 NFC controller. It contains two die, the Secure Element labeled “008” and the NXP PN549. The handset also uses NXP’s 1610A3 chip (likely an iteration of the 1610A1 found in the iPhone 5s/5c) as an interface integrated circuit for the display, plus an NXP-branded M9 motion co-processor embedded in the main Apple-designed A9 chip. iPhone 7—An NFC controller in the iPhone 7 with package markings 67V04 confirms this is another NXP-supplied chip, likely the PN67V. The same NFC controller is also in the Apple Watch Series 2. Another NXP part labeled “610A38” can be seen on the back of the iPhone 7’s logic board. The M10 motion coprocessor, also an NXP part, is embedded in the main A10 Fusion chip. For the most part, Apple rebranded and customized NXP’s chips that provide iPhones with NFC features and power-efficient motion tracking capability. But good luck finding some of the LPC rage of semiconductors used in iPhones and iPads listed on the NXP website. Some off-the-shelf NXP parts used in iPhones and iPads are detailed on the company’s website, but many are not because they were likely built specifically for Apple. Many other Apple products use discreet chips from NXP. Apple’s Lightning cable, for instance, packs in NXP’s NX20P3 chip on the connector board with one huge transistor occupying over 75 percent of the die area. Apple Watches also contain Secure Elements as well as NFC controllers and radios from NXP. Apple, of course, is not the only company to source parts from NXP. Google’s latest Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, for example, incorporate an NXP-built NFC controller. It is labeled as “55102 1807 S0622” and highlighted in purple on iFixit’s photo seen below. The Pixel XL also uses a smart audio amplifier from NXP: the off-the-shelf TFA9891 part framed in green on the image included below. Samsung’s ill-fated Note 7 used NXP’s 67T05 NFC controller which provides NFC functions in the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge series, too. Founded in 1953, NXP was originally known as Philips Semiconductors. After selling itself to a consortium of private equity investors in 2006, Philips Semiconductors established a new name for itself: NXP. In December 2015, NXP merged with chip designer and manufacturer Freescale Semiconductor in a $40 billion dollar deal. The company trades on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol NXPI and currently owns more than 9,000 issued or pending patents. It has manufacturing and development facilities in Nijmegen, Netherland. Even if Qualcomm does acquire NXP, both companies are official Apple suppliers, meaning the Cupertino firm is probably going to continue licensing NXP technology directly from Qualcomm. The deal is probably a matter of “when”, not “if”. 2015 was the highest-volume year for semiconductor mergers and acquisitions: Avago bought Broadcom in a record-setting $37 billion deal and Intel coughed up $16.7 billion to snap up Altera.

The combination of a premium build, unmatched system performance, and tightly integrated software and services delivers what’s considered to be the gold standard in smartphone user experience. Over the past five years, Apple’s modem supplier was Qualcomm, but this year, Apple has taken a different approach with the decision to source two instead of one baseband chipset suppliers: Qualcomm and Intel. This created two distinct RF SKUs, one limited to GSM/WCDMA/LTE support (A1778, A1784), powered by Intel’s modem, and one with GSM/CDMA/WCDMA/TD-SCDMA/LTE support (A1660, A1661) powered by Qualcomm’s modem.  On the one hand, most high-end flagship devices launched this year are powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820, with X12 Category 12 integrated modem (MDM9645M discrete part). The X12 modem is capable of up to 600Mbps peak downlink speeds, 3-Way Carrier Aggregation with 256 QAM, and also 4×4 MIMO on a single component carrier. Note that it is up to the smartphone manufacturers to decide which of these powerful capabilities will be integrated into their final product. The Verizon, Sprint and SIM Unlocked iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus variants are powered by Qualcomm’s MDM9645M modem, accompanied by two transceivers: WTR3925 and WTR4905. Out of all supported features by Qualcomm’s solution, Apple has chosen to implement 3-Way Carrier Aggregation on the downlink and 2-Way Carrier Aggregation on the uplink for contiguous Band 7 or Band 41. Higher Order Modulation (DL-256QAM, UL-64QAM), and Higher Order MIMO (4×4 MIMO) have not been implemented. Therefore, the peak theoretical downlink speeds are limited to 450Mbps when aggregating three 20MHz wide LTE component carriers. We have achieved the maximum 450Mbps by aggregating 20MHz wide Band 20, Band 1, and Band 7. EVS (Enhanced Voice Services), also known as Ultra HD Voice, offers significantly improved audio quality, numerous efficiencies at the physical and IP layer, and is fully supported by Qualcomm’s modem. However, Apple has made a decision to disable this feature likely to level the playing field between the Qualcomm, and Intel varaints. On the other hand, the iPhone 7 represents Intel’s first major design win in a long time. In many ways this iPhone appears to be Intel’s make or break it in the cellular modem business. Similar to Samsung’s in house Shannon LTE modem found in Exynos based devices, Intel has decided to license CEVA DSP cores for the XMM7360 modem coupled with in-house SMARTi 5 RF Transceivers and X-PMU 736 RF Power Management. The Intel XMM7360 modem also supports 3-Way Carrier Aggregation on the downlink and 2-Way Carrier Aggregation on the uplink, but lacks support for EVS, DL-256QAM/UL-64QAM, 4×4 MIMO. Ironically, mobile operators such as T-Mobile USA and Telstra which have been offering these advanced LTE features, are being supplied with the iPhone 7 with the Intel modem. While there haven’t been a shortage of iPhone 7 unboxing videos, subjective camera reviews, and more, we have been hard pressed to find any meaningful mention of cellular performance. This goes for any other flagship device on the market. In this day and age with mobile internet consumption at the all time high, we believe that a mobile device is only as good as its ability to seamlessly connect and maintain its connectivity with the mobile network. Most of the time mobile operators get blamed for dropped calls or session timeouts, but it’s often forgotten that the phone OEMs implementation of baseband, RF Front-End (RFFE), and the antenna design could play its role. We have been using the Rohde & Schwarz (R&S) CMWflexx setup containing two R&S CMW500 and one R&S CMWC controller, as well as the R&S TS7124 RF Shielded Box with four Vivaldi antennas. This study has been done entirely independently, and Cellular Insights takes full responsibility for the analysis and opinions in this report. We have self-funded the procurement of iPhone 7 Plus units through commercial retail channels. All units have been preloaded with the latest version of iOS (10.0.3) Consistent with our previous reviews, our focus has been on measuring the highest achievable LTE throughput in clean channel state, starting at RSRP value of -85dBm, and incrementally reducing radiated power level while maintaining Block Error Rate (BLER) under 2%. This allows us to measure RF sensitivity of the device under test while eliminating inter-cell interference and fully controlling the radiated environment. This also allows for high reproducibility and consistency of our tests, and takes into account the performance of the entire RFFE subsystem.  We’ve tested three unique LTE frequency bands, Band 12 (10MHz), Band 4 (20MHz), and Band 7 (20MHz) in 4×2 MIMO configuration using Transmission Mode 4. While both devices achieved the maximum sustained data rates at the cell center, simulating edge of cell scenarios by reducing power level did cause each iPhone to display two very different personalities. As the device attaches to eNodeB, it reports its LTE capability. To get this out of the way, 4×4 MIMO and 256QAM features are not supported on the iPhone 7 Plus. FDD LTE Band 12 is part of the lower 700MHz band plan, covering 15 MHz of contiguous spectrum across three blocks (A, B, C). Most LTE Band 12 deployments are either 5 MHz or 10 MHz wide even though Band 12 can theoretically be deployed up to 15 MHz widths. Coincidentally, LTE Band 12 capable devices are only certified to support up to 10 MHz operation. As opposed to mid and high band spectrum, low frequency such as 700MHz Band 12 can propagate further, penetrate the concrete structure better, and often times is the only LTE layer reaching the device. For this particular reason, high sensitivity of a smartphone receiver is extremely important in challenging signal conditions, and it could make a difference between completing and dropping a VoLTE call. Both iPhone 7 Plus variants perform similarly in ideal conditions. At -96dBm the Intel variant needed to have Transport Block Size adjusted as BLER well exceeded the 2% threshold. At -105dBm the gap widened to 20%, and at -108dBm to a whopping 75%. As a result of such a huge performance delta between the Intel and Qualcomm powered devices, we purchased another A1784 (AT&T) iPhone 7 Plus, in order to eliminate any possibility of a faulty device. The end result was virtually identical. We are hoping that this sudden dip in performance at a specific RSRP value will be further investigated by the engineering and hopefully resolved. At -121dBm, the Intel variant performed more in line with its Qualcomm counterpart. Overall, the average performance delta between the two is in the 30% range in favor of the Qualcomm variant.  Band 4 is the most commonly deployed LTE spectrum band in North America, while Band 7 deployments are spread across the rest of the globe. Mid and high spectrum bands are used to densify LTE networks and provide incremental capacity. Just like during our Band 12 tests, the iPhone 7 Plus with the Intel modem continues to struggle even at relatively higher RSRP values with unexplainable sharp dips in performance. The gap between the two variants is consistent and north of 30% again in favor of the Qualcomm variant. To put this into perspective, we have compared the edge of cell performance of a few other flagship devices to see how these iPhones compare in less than favorable conditions In all tests, the iPhone 7 Plus with the Qualcomm modem had a significant performance edge over the iPhone 7 Plus with the Intel modem. We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple’s decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone. Considering that the iPhone with the Qualcomm modem is being sold in China, Japan and in the United States only, we can not imagine that modem performance was a deciding factor. When all said and done, the iPhone 7 Plus is a beautifully designed smartphone, with arguably the best-in-class camera and system performance. It’s also the best iPhone ever. We hope that next year’s iPhone delivers best-in-class LTE performance.  banner 25 prev postSamsung Galaxy S7, the first 4×4 MIMO smartphone Milan M.P. view all post Leave a comment Comments (72) Reviewer • 4 weeks ago This is a great article. Could you please review the goole pixel cellular performance as well? reply brodie7838 • 4 weeks ago Agreed, great article - I too would love to see this updated with the Pixel (and others!). reply David Bannington • 4 weeks ago Could there be a connection between Intel modems and widespread reports of broken GPS/location services on some iPhone 7 and Pluses? https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7677433 reply Jon Dagle • 3 weeks ago David, the majority of problems in US seem to be on Verizon, so that's Qualcomm chip. I know of reports on AT&T and Sprint, and some European carriers--in UK I think. Many, but not all, report 10.0.3 or 10.1 fixed this. reply alex logvin • 4 weeks ago Excellent article, Milan! Love the charts. reply Georgi Dimitrov • 3 weeks ago It would have been an excellent one, if power measurements have been conducted too. Without it, it's nothing more than politics. reply Travis • 4 weeks ago Yes please review the Pixel radio compared to other phones. Out of all the reviews I have seen online for the Pixel no one actually reviewed the "phone". After all we demand these devices work well when no WiFi is around. reply Thomas Anderson • 4 weeks ago Please do not review Google Pixel. I don't care the result of it. Thank you. reply Dazza • 4 weeks ago Please dont read the article on the Pixel. Thank you reply John • 4 weeks ago Any way to determine which variant is in my personal iPhone 7 plus? reply Steven H. • 4 weeks ago Yes, easily. The article noted which carriers are selling the one with the Qualcomm modem. If you bought it outright, was it for use on one of those carriers? reply Holger • 4 weeks ago The model number of your iPhone is printed on the back of the device. reply Brian B. • 3 weeks ago You can also find the model number by going to Settings > General > Regulatory. reply ilikemyprivacy • 4 weeks ago A few thoughts: 1. Thanks for doing this, so little information available on RF performance of phones which is so critical for performance, battery life, etc. 2. I would be interested to see you rerun this test with the iOS 10 Beta. The latest beta includes modem firmware 1.25.00 on the Qualcomm version which seems to help significantly with a variety of issues 3. If possible, it'd be great to look at a comparison for other RF front end features like envelope tracking, antenna tuning, etc. between the Intel and Qualcomm models as we.. reply Walt French • 4 weeks ago Great article; thanks. Maybe I missed it, but I didn't see in the article what features in the new Intel modem differed from the 6S's MDM9635M. As the comparison chart makes the two parts look very similar, what appears is that the 9645's new features are (today) a year ahead of the 9635 and the Intel part. reply Marcus • 4 weeks ago My question is the one with the Qualacom modem vs Intel was there any correlation between battery life too? If the qualacom works better does it use more battery power based on tests than the Intel. Just trying to gage it if i do decide to purchase a iPhone 7 reply Flash • 4 weeks ago Thanks for sharing. Was this test conducted using the latest update iOS 10.0.3 which includes a fix for a bug that could cause issues with cellular connectivity, a problem that only affected the new iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus? Thanks. reply Dazza • 4 weeks ago Yes. It says so in the article reply Tom • 4 weeks ago Great article, I really liked your introduction paragraph! reply Maxwell • 4 weeks ago Can you do a review on the ZTE Axon 7 signal strength and LTE performance please and thank you reply Prasad • 4 weeks ago Marcus, Assume you are downloading a file that is 70MB in size. If your iPhone with Qualcomm chip downloads this in half the time, it will be able to go to sleep that much faster. It is not necessary that the performance is obtained at the cost of power. reply VP • 4 weeks ago So if this is the case my iPhone 7 Plus purchased thru T-Mobile should not have any Verizon or Sprint connectivity. However when accessing carrier in settings it scans for available networks & finds T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon & Sprint. It should not be possible due to hardware limitations. I couldn't get mine on release day even with pre-order. Could the demand & backlog have prompted Apple to add Qualcomm modems to all models? reply WiWavelength • 4 weeks ago VP, the available network scan on your 3GPP only baseband is detecting the LTE networks for VZW and Sprint, not their CDMA2000 networks. The latter use PRL based network selection, not user initiated network selection. AJ reply Eric • 4 weeks ago It would be great if you could provide a picture of the test setup. reply Yang • 4 weeks ago Without testing environment and setup specified, this type of comparison is less meaningful reply Jupiter Antunes • 4 weeks ago One important point must be kept in the picture, not only the modems makes the differences but the Antenna with the Modems. One significant information should be the Return Loss of the antenna scanning the channels in a Band. If a LAB is reading this could do it for us... thanks. reply Ehsan • 4 weeks ago Qualcomm should ask Apple for "Qualcomm Inside" sticker on the phones with Q chip. reply no • 3 weeks ago no reply Joe • 4 weeks ago If you swapped an Intel variant iPhone out at the Apple Store under warranty, would they supply you with another Intel or do they use the Qualcomm version for warranty replacements? reply Justin • 3 weeks ago Whenever you turn in a warranty claim, most likely you will receive a refurbished unit. Not a brand new one when you first buy/order. I would return it under the 30 day window and purchase another one personally. Although the phone is new, you could still potentially get a refurb reply Robert • 4 weeks ago It wold be interesting to see how the two different transceiver (RF + modem) compare in case of carrier aggregation that are in harmonic relationship, such as B12 as the primary carrier transmitting at 710 MHz and B4 as the secondary carrier with receive frequency at 2130. In this case the 3rd harmonic of the B12 transmitter lands right in B4 receiver thus potentially de-sensing it and degrading the throughput when the B12 TX power is high (cell-edge scenario). reply Ed • 4 weeks ago I am still waiting for Anandtech to do their digging. And offering some explanation to why. The Intel Modem is based on TSMC 28nm. Qualcomm X12 is on 20nm. ( Only the X16 is on 14nm FinET I believe ). X12 is / could be even better then the coming Intel offering 7480, which is STILL manufactured by TSMC. Why did Apple decide to use the newer X12 when they know the older MDM9635 was enough compared to Intel's 7360? Not supporting 4x4 MIMO in X12 was a rather simple decision because less then 10% of the network in the world support it, and no phone has yet to manage 4x4 MIMO inside. A some other details like X12 wasn't a true 4x4 MIMO and require separate chip to do so, while X16 is a true 4x4 MIMO. And I am pretty sure an Software update could make EVS possible. Whether or not they will do it is entirely different matter. What cost / patent issues are involved? reply Luka • 4 weeks ago How it could be achived more than 150M for SGS7edge on one carrier Band4? reply PD • 3 weeks ago 4X4 MIMO reply R • 3 weeks ago 2X2 MiMo single carrier using 64QAM is 75Mbps x 2... 150Mbps and 3CA with same config is 150Mbps x 3 giving 450Mbps peak.... too bad Apple did not use 256QAM! reply Luka • 3 weeks ago Then I would expect more than 180Mbps reply Bjoern • 4 weeks ago Nice rewiew, and measurements on the poewer drawn by both modules when performing differently? reply Mark • 3 weeks ago This is a great article. I happen to live in an area that gets marginal reception but I never knew it because I had a Nokia 928 from Verizon. When i finally had to trade it in after a couple of years, I tried the iphone 6S and found the reception to be horrible. I traded it in for a Galaxy S6 and was told "no more trades" so I was forced to keep it. That also had horrible reception at my house. My signal varies from -105 to -115 and calls constantly get dropped. My girlfriends Galaxy S5 worked great at my house and I took that as a sign as the antenna design changing in the Galaxies between the S5 and the S6...which I found to be true. When her phone was ready for replacement I searched around and found no bad things were said about the HTC10 reception. At my encouragement, she got the HTC 10 and gets great reception at my house. I have been searching for some sort of articles on antenna testing and this report is just what I was looking for. I would, however, like to see a wider range of phones tested. It would be interesting to see how that HTC10 does against the iphone and galaxy. And, I would also like to see how the new Droid Z and the Pixel fare. thank you again reply Alexander • 3 weeks ago Thank you for your effort, Milan. It would be nice to see the error bars on the graphs and the statistical comparison for the low signal LTE examples. Given the low average current networks speed limits (9-40 Gbs) it would be crucial to magnify graphs accordingly. I am going to use my phone mostly on the European GSM networks, so having A1661 with CDMA capability would not grant automatic CDMA network switch with European sim or ...?And of course after all it would be nice to prove the efficiency of your 30% discrepancy in real world or close to real world situation...What would be battery impact? reply John • 3 weeks ago The disabling of HD Voice - is it permanently disabled or is that a function that Apple could enable in the future? reply Adam • 3 weeks ago Lab test isn't field test. If you do field test,the results are almost same. reply Darrell Brand • 3 weeks ago Just called Apple and mentioned my concerns- I bought my iPhone 7 unlocked and no plan Apple has no response. reply landoncube • 3 weeks ago The SIM unlocked version is the Qualcomm modem, according to the article. reply JohnL • 3 weeks ago Only Qualcomm in the US and a couple of other places, it's Intel in Europe (1778 model is supplied as the unlocked one). reply JohnL • 3 weeks ago What was the modem firmware used in the tests please? Also IMHO worth repeating in 3-4 months to see if Intel have made significant improvements to a young product.. reply JohnL • 3 weeks ago I note 10.1 updates the modem firmware (Intel model) from 10.0.3's version 1.00.05 to 1.01..13, which seems like quite a bit. I don't know what was in 10.0.2 I'm afraid. reply JohnL • 1 week ago 10.1.1 takes it to 1.1.15 reply Jacq • 3 weeks ago This article made for great reading. A couple of things I would be interested in seeing in the future articles. 1. Testing this on Google's Pixel device along with every major flagship release. This is information that would influence a purchase decision. I also from daily use between the 5x and 6p felt the 5x was horrible and which you tested the 6p's signal as well, 2, Was there a measure of power consumption at the different signal strength between the two chipsets? Wondering if this affected the performance as well. Thanks - JSH reply Alessia Campoli • 3 weeks ago Good to see that iPhone 7 will be IP67 waterproof! When concerning about the waterproof function of mobile, I found an very interesting video about it. On this video, they drop VKworld T1 Plus, a budget 6.0-inch smartphone to the mud and clean it directly with water for long time, that is unbelivalble. reply VG • 3 weeks ago Even if you leave apart the intel vs qualcomm modem differences, the article clearly tells that SD 820 based devices will have far better connectivity as compared to any iPhone7 reply AP • 3 weeks ago If I'm on the AT&T network, is there anyway to check if I'm getting a Qualcomm version before I purchase/open the box? reply Alexis • 3 weeks ago the model number is written on the outside of the box. You could read it without breaking the seal or opening the box. The ATT model uses the Intel modem. If you want the qualcomm then buy a unlocked version reply landoncube • 3 weeks ago My research indicates that there is no AT&T Qualcomm phone available. I am looking into the SIM unlocked Qualcomm version for use on AT&T. reply Doug Lerner • 3 weeks ago I live in Tokyo and use KDDI Au. I can't find out which model they are using. AU shops say "it might be either, but you can't tell until purchasing and opening the box to look." All the floor models I've seen have the model number with the Intel chip though. I'm wondering how much of an issue this is and if I should upgrade my iPhone 6 Plus now. reply karyn • 3 weeks ago the model number is written on the outside of the box. You could read it without breaking the seal or opening the box. reply Doug Lerner • 3 weeks ago You're right! I can see that on the back of my iPhone 6 Plus box. That precludes being able to upgrade online, but perhaps I can do that in a store. Assuming there is even more than one model sold here in Japan for AU. I still haven't been able to confirm that yet. reply Kari • 3 weeks ago Let's wait a little and see what's Apple's response is, before jumping into conclusions. reply Doug Lerner • 3 weeks ago Actually, it turns out that the model sold here in Japan is neither the A1784 nor the A1661. For the iPhone 7 Plus it is the A1785. The details are at http://www.apple.com/jp/iphone-7/specs/ but the modem supports the following: FDD-LTE（バンド1、2、3、4、5、7、8、11、12、13、17、18、19、20、21、25、26、27、28、29、30） TD-LTE（バンド38、39、40、41） TD-SCDMA 1,900（F）、2,000（A） CDMA EV-DO Rev. A（800、1,900、2,100MHz） UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA（850、900、1,700/2,100、1,900、2,100MHz） GSM/EDGE（850、900、1,800、1,900MHz） I don't know if that means it's Qualcomm or Intel. The Japan model also supports FeliCa, which allows people to use it like Suica/Pasmo cards to ride the trains and subways. reply Pei • 3 weeks ago it's a qualcomm variant, not intel. reply Pei • 3 weeks ago this article has been seen in China. Only Qualcomm variants are sold here. Many apple users are not satisfied with APPLE because iPhone is expensive while Apple used a bad modem. reply JohnD • 3 weeks ago All devices with qualcomm have issues in the field. Lab vs field tests are completely different. The mobility tells how feasible a device is. Not speaking about the fact that in real NW the eNB will never give yous such a bandwidth. I really don't understand why you people struggle to have in the pocket the newest devices on the market... reply ElmCha • 2 weeks ago All Qualcomm devices have problems in the field? How so? Kindly elaborate. reply Alexhander • 3 weeks ago Great article! Very nicely detailed and accurate information based on the currently released iPhones. reply salman Khan • 3 weeks ago Both intel and Qualcomm modems are capable of supporting more than 400Mbps.if LTE network give them enough resources. and channel conditions are good. This means that performance of the intel modem may not be limitation here. It depends on test conditions, transport protocol parameters, both mobiles (Qualcomm and Intel) exact locations and many other factors. As a user, I dont care much if my downloading speed is 150Mpbs or 140Mpbs because I rarely run any application on my mobile phone that requires this much high data rate on my mobile(HD video stream needs few Mpbs speed). But I would be more interested in power comparison and battery life with these two modems. reply Bob H • 3 weeks ago My burning question is whether the inferior Intel modem I would get in my AT&T 7 Plus would also have inferior receptivity to my AT&T iPhone 6. If so, I will wait to upgrade until the 8. I already have spotty reception at home with my 6 and I can't afford to make it worse. Is there already a way to compare this or does it require a new test? Thanks. reply Bob H • 3 weeks ago I posted a question here that was held up for curation and then disappeared. It seemed perfectly harmless. What happened? reply Bob H • 3 weeks ago I had a chance to answer my question by doing a field test on my 6 at home and learning I was getting a reading of -114 in most places, and then bringing home a 7 Plus (with the inferior Intel modem) and getting readings between -108 and -112. Glad to learn that "inferior" doesn't mean worse than a 6, in my location at least, so I'll keep the 7 Plus. reply landoncube • 3 weeks ago Could you repeat the testing now that iOS 10.1 has been released? I have an A1784 iPhone 7 plus. reply JohnL • 3 weeks ago It is depressing how much my 1778 is slower than my 5s for LTE. A quick 4G test (or few) this evening gives 65.7MB/s down/14.1 up for the 5s and 60.0/6.5 for the 7... Plus I only tested it as I'd seen a trend so this wasn't a one-off. A bigger concern is the 5s holds onto a 4G signal much better, the 7 does like to be on 3G (iOS 10.1). reply Jos • 1 week ago There is a very interesting article about phone reception quality. Its writen by professor Gert Frølund Pedersen, from Denmark's Aalborg University. The direct link to the PDF: http://www.pts.se/upload/Rapporter/Tele/2016/MobilephoneTest2016-augusti-2016.pdf I ran some tests myself on the 3 Belgian providers. Reception quality inside my house is very bad where I live (bad coverage) with signal levels between -95 and -113 dBm. By the way, I'm an engineer and have quite some RF knowledge. Tested with a brand new iPhone 7 (Intel modem), iPhone SE, Nexus 5, Lumia 925 and Lumia 800 (both Lumia's are still Nokia design, not Microsoft). Tests are pure subjective, on different places in my house with all the phones and swapping SIM cards every time. With a signal of -95 dBm, the iPhone 7 often doesn't receive or can't make calls and text messages can't be send. More or less the same story with the iPhone SE. The Lumia's perform the best, the Nexus 5 sits between them. The Lumia's always have a better signal then the other phones. I don't care about LTE performance (I only get 3G at best over here) since I have Wifi in house. Don't understand why reviewers talk about all the gadgets of the phones, while the basic functionality (making phone calls) isn't even decently tested in an area with bad reception. Of course it's much more interesting to compare stuff like camera functionality, screen colours, quality of the Gorilla glass, bending phones etc, but it's all non-essential. I'd love to have a phone that bends when you sit on it, but at least has a good reception and can be used to make a call. Just want a phone with the best receiver sensivity. For each 3 dB decrease in level, the singal power is reduced by about one half. So a more sensitive phone just works better in environments with weak signals. That also includes using it in your car, a bad environment for a mobile phone (metal cage). And most of the time, the receiver in the phone is not the problem, but the antenna plays a much bigger role... As professor Pedersen suggests in his article, it becomes time manufacturers are open about this in the specs of the phone. reply Massi • 4 days ago What process node is the Intel modem? Would be very interesting to see power comparison between Intel and Qualcomm reply Psymon • 1 day ago Great article.. I found it just in time! Having just purchased an iphone 7 plus, 32GB on contract in the UK for use on the Three network. Without any hesitation I have now returned the device and will wait until the i8 appears. Here's why... I live in a network fringe area of Cornwall and also trunk travel quite a bit. The fringe signal at home for the i7 displayed a significant decrease on the previous i5 and i5s signals. 4G has been incredibly sporadic everywhere had appeared to offer no performance increase over 3g. Another immediate issue was a very sharp spike in data usage, I have been using the Three, All You Can Eat Data plans for years, peaking at 25gb in the heaviest usage months... In just five operational days of the i7 the daily use started to top 3gb when streaming music, using google maps and general browsing, close to 50% more than I had ever seen before. I spoke with Three technical for a few hours, explaining everything in great detail, in an attempt to overcome the issues or at least gain a good explanation. Three almost immediately admitted that the 4g was not working on the i7 properly and a solution was being sought between Apple and Three (Apple deny this) Three technical suggested turning off the 4g until being advised of an update that resolves the issue. There was no explanation as to why the signal was poorer on the i7 compared to all previous devices, but now I am starting to understand why, your article makes perfect sense. The Data usage increase was also not met with a good explanation but was dismissed by pointing out that I already have All You Can Eat Data, so why worry.. point taken... but be aware if you are paying for capped data limits! By the way the upgrade to iOS 10.1.1 has made no observable difference.! I also ran a performance test on the i7 using a little app "Performance Test" just to see whether the phone performed as advertised.. A friend also purchased an i7 with 256gb at the same time as me giving me the opportunity to compare both. What was remarkably disappointing was the write speeds... the read speeds were very similar but the write speed was significantly slower on my 32gb i7. Close to 50% less capable slowing the device down by 50% when writing to its memory. This was also observable when browsing images on both phone with maximum signal strength. (My friend has also retuned his iPhone 7 for the same reasons) As a final pass before returning the i7, with your article in hand, I made an appointment with Apple to see if they were prepared to shine some light on the issues. To be fair, they were not really interested, they did however offer me a replacement but with the Intel Model numbers. They confirmed that the Models with the Qualcomm component installed were not available in the UK. If you have an iPhone 7 with the model numbers A1778 or A1784 or are considering buying a new phone.. DON'T it really isn't worth the grief and they will be virtually worthless once the issues are widely known.. These phones WILL give you trouble, perhaps not so much in the city but rural and travelling they simply do not meet a price tag of £50.00 for a phone let alone £780.00 , they really are no more than just a very expensive camera/ipods. reply Cancel Reply Please be polite.

A WSJ report this morning upgraded the urgency, saying that a deal could happen as soon as this weekend. But according to other WSJ sources, Apple is also interested in Time Warner, and is "monitoring the situation." DON'T MISS: Everything we know about Apple’s exciting next-gen MacBook Pro Apple's interest in Time Warner, one of the biggest content creators out there, is not new. Reports surfaced back in January that Apple was one of a number of "possible suitors" to buy Time Warner. AT&T was also named as a potential bidder, so at least the rumors are consistent. With cable TV revenues faltering and Netflix making a bundle of cash producing and delivery video online, a number of companies are circling Time Warner as an easy way to get into the media business. AT&T, which is one of the largest cable and internet providers, would buy Time Warner to make distributing its content easier. Buying the content creators is also a good hedge against traditional cable TV, which is dying an increasingly quick death. https://twitter.com/shalini/status/789557346867507200 On the other hand, Apple is looking at subscription content services like Netflix, Spotify and Amazon. The latter's recent roll-out of Amazon Prime Music means that Amazon now offers a complete package of subscription services, while Apple is stuck with just Apple Music. It's unclear exactly what Apple would do with Time Warner, but it's in a good position to bundle popular content and channels into a web TV service. In the same way that it used its ownership of iOS to convert millions of people to Apple Music, something similar could happen with TVs and movies. In any case, Apple only said to be "monitoring the situation," not actively bidding. If AT&T is desperate enough for media to overpay, Apple is less likely to enter a bidding war. But if a good price isn't reached, or AT&T's acquisition is blocked by regulators, I'm sure Apple will be waiting in the wings.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple recently approached Time Warner about takeover bid, now “monitoring” AT&T talks By Christian Zibreg, Oct 21, 2016 Tweet 7 Comments AT&T, the second-largest carrier in the United States, is in advanced talks with media giant Time Warner about a possible merger and Apple “is now monitoring the situation”, people familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal. The Cupertino-based gadget maker was first mentioned as a possible suitor for a Time Warner takeover back in January of this year. According to WSJ, Apple a few months ago approached Time Warner “about pursuing a combination”, but the discussions didn’t progress “beyond a preliminary stage.” Time Warner shares were up seven percent in afternoon trading. WSJ writes: From Apple’s end, executives under Chief Executive Tim Cook were involved in the earlier talks. Apple has pursued plans to build an online TV service and has begun creating original programming of its own. Before its most recent approach, Eddy Cue, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services, brought up a potential combination in a meeting with Time Warner’s head of corporate strategy Olaf Olafsson last year, the people said, though the talks never went further than that. Time Warner owns premium content brands like HBO, CNN and Warner Bros. The media giant doesn’t have a controlling shareholder. It reported $28 billion in 2015 revenue and had a market capitalization of $68 billion before WSJ reported on the deal. “The media giant’s advanced talks with the telecom company could set off a deal frenzy,” speculates the article, adding that a deal between AT&T and Time Warner could come together within days. Still, a host of other contenders could jump into the fray for Time Warner and scuttle the planned deal, media executives and analysts said. Google, however, doesn’t appear interested in making a Time Warner offer, a person familiar with the situation said. 21st Century Fox and Walt Disney Co. are also unlikely to join the fray. “There has been along list of companies speculated to be interested in acquiring Time Warner, starting with the almighty Apple. So if AT&T wants this deal, it is in their best interest to move as fast as possible,” said Todd Juenger of Bernstein Research. Good! Let them buy Time Warner, I say. We all know too well that those kinds of mega mergers between huge companies with corporate cultures that are polar opposites to one another collapse sooner than later. I don’t want Apple to buy a huge media company. I want them to focus on making great products, software and services and partner with media companies, not become one.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple discovers that selling smartwatches for $15,000 doesn’t work Chris Mills BGR NewsOctober 21, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share It feels like 1,000 years since Tim Cook stood on stage an announced that Apple was selling a gold-plated smartwatch for $15,000. At the time, it was difficult to say if this was a sensible move or just one involving "courage," because no one had tried to sell a small wrist computer for that much before. Two years later, the normal-human Apple Watch is doing surprisingly well, exceeding expectations by being the best-selling smartwatch in its category. The $15,000 gold Apple Watch Edition? Well, it's been discontinued, and now its fancy Paris flagship store is closing. DON'T MISS: Everything we expect Apple to announce next week that isn’t a Mac As Mac4Ever discovered, the dedicated Apple Watch boutique in Galeries Lafayette, a famous shopping center in Paris, is going to be closed down. The report cites dwindling sales figures and a "change in focus" as the reasons for killing off the picture-perfect store. The boutique is expected to close in January next year. There's two similar boutiques in Tokyo and London, and the future of those is said to be undecided. You can also see the shift in focus from the current Apple Watch lineup. When Apple debuted the Watch Series 2 last month, they Apple Watch Edition underwent a conspicuous change. The $15,000 gold-plated version isn't sold any more, and instead the Apple Watch Edition is wrapped in ceramic, and costs a much more palatable $2,000. Now, $2,000 is what you should spend on a laptop, not a smartwatch. But it put the top-end Apple wearable far closer to the rest of the company's lineup. It's possible to see someone who owns several $10,000 watches splurging on a ceramic Apple Watch Edition. It's far harder to see many people making their most expensive watch a gadget that will be out of date in a few years' time.

Our commitment to installing solar panels on 500 stores and distribution centers by 2020 is evidence of that progress," John Leisen, vice president of property management at Target, said in the SEIA statement. Walmart had held the top spot for the previous four years and still claims second place with 145MW of solar power installed on 364 buildings, according to the SEIA, which has been tracking corporate solar deployments for the past five years. This year, real estate developer Prologis came in third with 107.8MW of solar. Apple, which is in fourth place with 93.9MW of installed solar power, is a likely contender for first place sometime next year. Last year, Apple announced it was investing $850 million in a solar power plant through a partnership with First Solar, one of the nation's largest photovoltaic (PV) manufacturers and provider of utility-scale PV plants. Through a 25-year purchasing agreement, Apple will get 130MW from the new California Flats Solar Project. The project is currently under construction and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Other Top 10 companies recognized in the SEIA's report include Costco (50.7 MW), Kohl's (50.2 MW), IKEA (44 MW), Macy's (38.9 MW), General Growth Properties (30.2 MW) and Hartz Mountain Industries (22.7 MW). While IKEA is in seventh place, it powers 91% of its retail locations through solar, according to the SEIA. Overall, U.S. corporations have doubled their solar installations year over year and are expected to close out 2016 with nearly 280MW of solar power -- compared to 130MW in 2015. The SEIA's report covers corporate solar installations in 38 states plus Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico; it tracks almost 1,100MW of solar installations at 2,000 U.S. companies. "To put that in context, that's enough electricity to power the equivalent of 193,000 homes every year," the report stated. "Also noteworthy, in just the first three quarters of 2016, the report found 142MW of corporate solar was added in the U.S., more than was installed in all of 2015 (129 MW)." In 2014, frustrated by a lack of renewable energy and a purchasing system that's too complicated, major U.S. companies joined an initiative to force the government and utilities to change. Along with the World Wildlife Fund and the World Resources Institute, the corporations signed a pact supporting six principles to clearly identify what's needed when purchasing renewable energy. The initial companies included Bloomberg, Facebook, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, Mars, Novelis, Procter and Gamble, REI, Sprint and Walmart. The companies called for six specific changes they wanted the energy industry to adopt to increase renewable energy use: Greater choice in procurement options More access to cost competitive options Longer- and variable-term contracts Access to new projects that reduce emissions Streamlined third-party financing Increased purchasing options with utilities "Solar plays a vital role within our renewable energy portfolio," Mark Vanderhelm, vice president of energy for Walmart, said in a statement. "This is evident by our 2020 commitment of doubling solar energy projects at our Walmart stores, Sam's Clubs and distribution centers across the nation. Our focus is on finding those solar projects that are right for the business."

We merely had a cameo of Pepe,’ Treadstone continued. ‘We get banned because it’s a pro-Trump app, but you can have an app only about Pepe and that’s not offensive,'” Nash reports. “In July, Apple’s App Store also rejected a satirical game based on the Hillary Clinton email servers scandal. Apple branded the game as ‘offensive’ and ‘objectionable’ before reversing their decision following a report at Breitbart.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Poor Pepe.

You cannot use the argument that other apps currently in the app store more flagrantly abuse the same copyright. The official response I received was, it doesn’t matter if 1000 similar apps in the app store break , YOUR app appears to use similar imagery to “” and so is rejected. The decision was upheld upon multiple appeals.

First, let’s correct the absolutes (where I will grant you are correct, and will correct myself): He has never been able to proveide a smart answer to anything POSTED IN THIS FORUM. Better now? It’s not absolute anymore. It’s constrained to the current forum. Speaking of absolutes: “an excuse no believes”…. makes you too a grammar champion. Shouldn’t that be “and excuse no one believes”? Oh, also, wouldn’t that also be an absolute? Because, if no one believes it, that sounds like there are no exceptions, or no cases where someone would believe it. That looks like an absolute to me. Man, who’s more clueless? The clueless guy, or the clueless guy who calls another guy that he’s clueless? Let’s leave it there. This is not worth my time. And I’n sure it’s not worth yours.

I think everything he writes… oh, excuse me, I will allow absolutes… everything Ihe wrote that I’ve read is nothing but pure garbage. I see no intelligence there. Now, one man’s opinion doesn’t make the man smarter. Maybe I’m the stupid one and you are the smart one. Because you see it that way, and I see it another way.

That is why the Wall Street-, multinational-, and Soros-owned Hillary Clinton is getting massive assistance from the mainstream media (also owned by the establishment) – they want their carried interest deductions to continue.

Derek Currie Friday, October 21, 2016 - 8:15 pm · Reply I Guess We Need To Talk About Pepe The Frog …Later, observers began noticing an increase in white supremacist themes in Pepe images — or a rise in Pepe usage by white supremacist accounts. Either way, an association was building. This May, an “anonymous white nationalist” told The Daily Beast that the shift was intentional: a dedicated campaign to “reclaim Pepe from normies,” or members of the mainstream, by making Pepe so culturally unacceptable that only the fringe Internet would dare to use him. Donald Trump had earlier tweeted an image of Pepe-as-Trump, and then his son posted an image on Instagram that included Pepe.

Trump will singlehandly turn red states blue after this. The party of stupid has to make a wide turn or die off with all the party senile elderly it clings to as it’s base.

October 21 AAPL: 116.60 -0.46 WSJ: Apple has approached Time Warner in recent months, closely monitoring AT&T’s acquisition talks Zac Hall - 3 weeks ago @apollozac Apple TV Apple Time Warner View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Apple isn’t totally ruling out a Time Warner acquisition as talks between the network and AT&T appear to be moving forward. Yesterday it was reported that AT&T is looking at the possibility of a merger with Time Warner, then today it was separately reported that the talks could be much further along than previously reported. Now the WSJ is adding that Apple is once again monitoring the situation closely and has even approached the company in the last few months… Apple Inc. a few months ago approached Time Warner Inc. about pursuing a combination, but the discussions didn’t progress beyond a preliminary stage and none are currently under way, people familiar with the matter said Friday. […] From Apple’s end, executives under Chief Executive Tim Cookwere involved in the earlier talks, and now Apple is monitoring the current situation, one of the people said. If Apple is indeed not closing the door to a Time Warner acquisition, this wouldn’t make the first time in recent history. Back in January it was reported that Apple may want to acquire the media company to bolster its streaming TV service plans, but those plans have since been put on the shelf. Over the summer it was again said that Apple indeed considering buying Time Warner but focused instead on investing in original content of its own. In a Hollywood Reporter profile back in July, Apple TV head Eddy Cue actually cooled the flames on rumors of Apple providing a TV service when asked about the rumored interest in Time Warner: Whether we’re providing it or somebody else is, it really doesn’t matter to us. What we’re trying to do is build the platform that allows anybody to get content to consumers. If a Time Warner [Cable] or a DirecTV wants to offer a bundle themselves, they should do it through Apple TV and iPad and iPhone. As a matter of fact, I’m not a big fan of the skinny bundle. But last month Apple hired a former VP of Time Warner to work on cloud services at Apple under Eddy Cue. For its part, Apple has been rumored to be working on a number of things in the TV space including an actual TV of its own and a streaming TV service similar to Sling TV or PS Vue although both of these projects have been put on hold indefinitely. Apple’s latest venture is said to be a universal TV guide that pulls in content from various streaming services to present a traditional TV browsing experience. Features like universal search on the new Apple TV go half-way by searching for content across multiple channels. Apple has also promised a new single sign-on feature that unlocks multiple channels from a single content provider on iOS and tvOS, although this feature is billed as coming soon. Apple has continued to speak openly about the broken experience of TV currently, however, even after shipping the new Apple TV with the tvOS platform. As recently as yesterday at Vanity Fair‘s annual summit of media execs, Eddy Cue has talked about the TV experience being stuck in the past. As for the Time Warner situation, Apple’s interest is especially fascinating as reports have continuously described Apple watching the situation from a somewhat distant position. Guides Apple TV Apple TV is Apple's set-top box offering that allows users to stream content from services like Netflix, Hulu, and many more via the tvOS App Store.

We merely had a cameo of Pepe,’ Treadstone continued. ‘We get banned because it’s a pro-Trump app, but you can have an app only about Pepe and that’s not offensive,'” Nash reports. “In July, Apple’s App Store also rejected a satirical game based on the Hillary Clinton email servers scandal. Apple branded the game as ‘offensive’ and ‘objectionable’ before reversing their decision following a report at Breitbart.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Poor Pepe.

You cannot use the argument that other apps currently in the app store more flagrantly abuse the same copyright. The official response I received was, it doesn’t matter if 1000 similar apps in the app store break , YOUR app appears to use similar imagery to “” and so is rejected.

First, let’s correct the absolutes (where I will grant you are correct, and will correct myself): He has never been able to proveide a smart answer to anything POSTED IN THIS FORUM. Better now? It’s not absolute anymore. It’s constrained to the current forum. Speaking of absolutes: “an excuse no believes”…. makes you too a grammar champion. Shouldn’t that be “and excuse no one believes”? Oh, also, wouldn’t that also be an absolute? Because, if no one believes it, that sounds like there are no exceptions, or no cases where someone would believe it. That looks like an absolute to me. Man, who’s more clueless? The clueless guy, or the clueless guy who calls another guy that he’s clueless? Let’s leave it there. This is not worth my time. And I’n sure it’s not worth yours.

I think everything he writes… oh, excuse me, I will allow absolutes… everything Ihe wrote that I’ve read is nothing but pure garbage. I see no intelligence there. Now, one man’s opinion doesn’t make the man smarter. Maybe I’m the stupid one and you are the smart one. Because you see it that way, and I see it another way.

Carried interest will be taxed as ordinary income. That is why the Wall Street-, multinational-, and Soros-owned Hillary Clinton is getting massive assistance from the mainstream media (also owned by the establishment) – they want their carried interest deductions to continue.

Drumpf is likely to get his ass whipped and the GOP is likely to lose the Senate. Thanks to Republican Gerrymandering they are likely to retain the House, but with a narrower margin. If voter turnout is high it will be better for Democrats and if it is lower it will be better for the Republicans.

It’s about time you realised that your candidate is that bad. The GOP only needed to put someone electable up and this election was theirs for the taking.

And we all know the media, Hollywood, teachers and unions are working overtime in the Dems corner. So if they sadly win, it’s not because they are pure as the driven snow.

DavGreg Friday, October 21, 2016 - 8:01 pm · Reply Pepe the Frog is well known to have been adopted as a symbol by the alt-right. The alt-right organized around precepts and values that are against the broad multi-cultural view that is widely accepted and in the mainstream through most of the US and developed world. The inclusion of that symbol in a thinly dusguised game to promote the Drumpf Campaign. Apple was right in rejecting it. If you do not like Apple’s decision, do the free market thing and go buy an Android or Windows phone. Apple is a private sector company and nobody is making you buy their stuff. Derek Currie Friday, October 21, 2016 - 8:15 pm · Reply I Guess We Need To Talk About Pepe The Frog …Later, observers began noticing an increase in white supremacist themes in Pepe images — or a rise in Pepe usage by white supremacist accounts. Either way, an association was building. This May, an “anonymous white nationalist” told The Daily Beast that the shift was intentional: a dedicated campaign to “reclaim Pepe from normies,” or members of the mainstream, by making Pepe so culturally unacceptable that only the fringe Internet would dare to use him. Donald Trump had earlier tweeted an image of Pepe-as-Trump, and then his son posted an image on Instagram that included Pepe. Homeandmantel Friday, October 21, 2016 - 11:30 pm · Reply Can’t wait until the election is over and the landslide Hillary captured that the GOP will finally cut ties with the ignorant and racist constituency it has built up over the past decade and a half. Trump will singlehandly turn red states blue after this. The party of stupid has to make a wide turn or die off with all the party senile elderly it clings to as it’s base.

We merely had a cameo of Pepe,’ Treadstone continued. ‘We get banned because it’s a pro-Trump app, but you can have an app only about Pepe and that’s not offensive,'” Nash reports. “In July, Apple’s App Store also rejected a satirical game based on the Hillary Clinton email servers scandal. Apple branded the game as ‘offensive’ and ‘objectionable’ before reversing their decision following a report at Breitbart.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Poor Pepe.

You cannot use the argument that other apps currently in the app store more flagrantly abuse the same copyright. The official response I received was, it doesn’t matter if 1000 similar apps in the app store break , YOUR app appears to use similar imagery to “” and so is rejected. The decision was upheld upon multiple appeals.

First, let’s correct the absolutes (where I will grant you are correct, and will correct myself): He has never been able to proveide a smart answer to anything POSTED IN THIS FORUM. Better now? It’s not absolute anymore. It’s constrained to the current forum. Speaking of absolutes: “an excuse no believes”…. makes you too a grammar champion. Shouldn’t that be “and excuse no one believes”? Oh, also, wouldn’t that also be an absolute? Because, if no one believes it, that sounds like there are no exceptions, or no cases where someone would believe it. That looks like an absolute to me. Man, who’s more clueless? The clueless guy, or the clueless guy who calls another guy that he’s clueless? Let’s leave it there. This is not worth my time. And I’n sure it’s not worth yours.

It’s like talking to a rock. Do you want to believe I’m dumb? Please do. I don’t know Botty in person. I think everything he writes… oh, excuse me, I will allow absolutes… everything Ihe wrote that I’ve read is nothing but pure garbage. I see no intelligence there. Now, one man’s opinion doesn’t make the man smarter. Maybe I’m the stupid one and you are the smart one. Because you see it that way, and I see it another way.

Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for and has been for decades. The Trump Plan will retain the existing capital gains rate structure (maximum rate of 20 percent) with tax brackets shown above. Carried interest will be taxed as ordinary income. That is why the Wall Street-, multinational-, and Soros-owned Hillary Clinton is getting massive assistance from the mainstream media (also owned by the establishment) – they want their carried interest deductions to continue.

Our culture is soaked and consumed with progressive leftism, it’s not possible for a “right wing echo chamber” to exist. Those on the right are exposed to both sides of the spectrum. Those on the left are living in the mass-media-wide echo chamber, unless they take the effort to see things from another perspective.

Drumpf is likely to get his ass whipped and the GOP is likely to lose the Senate. Thanks to Republican Gerrymandering they are likely to retain the House, but with a narrower margin.

It’s about time you realised that your candidate is that bad. The GOP only needed to put someone electable up and this election was theirs for the taking.

DavGreg Friday, October 21, 2016 - 8:01 pm · Reply Pepe the Frog is well known to have been adopted as a symbol by the alt-right. The alt-right organized around precepts and values that are against the broad multi-cultural view that is widely accepted and in the mainstream through most of the US and developed world. The inclusion of that symbol in a thinly dusguised game to promote the Drumpf Campaign. Apple was right in rejecting it. If you do not like Apple’s decision, do the free market thing and go buy an Android or Windows phone. Apple is a private sector company and nobody is making you buy their stuff. Derek Currie Friday, October 21, 2016 - 8:15 pm · Reply I Guess We Need To Talk About Pepe The Frog …Later, observers began noticing an increase in white supremacist themes in Pepe images — or a rise in Pepe usage by white supremacist accounts. Either way, an association was building. This May, an “anonymous white nationalist” told The Daily Beast that the shift was intentional: a dedicated campaign to “reclaim Pepe from normies,” or members of the mainstream, by making Pepe so culturally unacceptable that only the fringe Internet would dare to use him. Donald Trump had earlier tweeted an image of Pepe-as-Trump, and then his son posted an image on Instagram that included Pepe. Homeandmantel Friday, October 21, 2016 - 11:30 pm · Reply Can’t wait until the election is over and the landslide Hillary captured that the GOP will finally cut ties with the ignorant and racist constituency it has built up over the past decade and a half.

We merely had a cameo of Pepe,’ Treadstone continued. ‘We get banned because it’s a pro-Trump app, but you can have an app only about Pepe and that’s not offensive,'” Nash reports. “In July, Apple’s App Store also rejected a satirical game based on the Hillary Clinton email servers scandal. Apple branded the game as ‘offensive’ and ‘objectionable’ before reversing their decision following a report at Breitbart.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Poor Pepe.

You cannot use the argument that other apps currently in the app store more flagrantly abuse the same copyright. The official response I received was, it doesn’t matter if 1000 similar apps in the app store break , YOUR app appears to use similar imagery to “” and so is rejected. The decision was upheld upon multiple appeals.

First, let’s correct the absolutes (where I will grant you are correct, and will correct myself): He has never been able to proveide a smart answer to anything POSTED IN THIS FORUM. Better now? It’s not absolute anymore. It’s constrained to the current forum. Speaking of absolutes: “an excuse no believes”…. makes you too a grammar champion. Shouldn’t that be “and excuse no one believes”? Oh, also, wouldn’t that also be an absolute? Because, if no one believes it, that sounds like there are no exceptions, or no cases where someone would believe it. That looks like an absolute to me. Man, who’s more clueless? The clueless guy, or the clueless guy who calls another guy that he’s clueless? Let’s leave it there. This is not worth my time. And I’n sure it’s not worth yours.

I think everything he writes… oh, excuse me, I will allow absolutes… everything Ihe wrote that I’ve read is nothing but pure garbage. I see no intelligence there. Now, one man’s opinion doesn’t make the man smarter. Maybe I’m the stupid one and you are the smart one. Because you see it that way, and I see it another way.

Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for and has been for decades. The Trump Plan will retain the existing capital gains rate structure (maximum rate of 20 percent) with tax brackets shown above. Carried interest will be taxed as ordinary income. That is why the Wall Street-, multinational-, and Soros-owned Hillary Clinton is getting massive assistance from the mainstream media (also owned by the establishment) – they want their carried interest deductions to continue.

Our culture is soaked and consumed with progressive leftism, it’s not possible for a “right wing echo chamber” to exist. Those on the right are exposed to both sides of the spectrum. Those on the left are living in the mass-media-wide echo chamber, unless they take the effort to see things from another perspective.

If voter turnout is high it will be better for Democrats and if it is lower it will be better for the Republicans. Dave H Friday, October 21, 2016 - 5:46 pm · Reply It’s about time you changed your name again. Next time go for years when the Republicans might put forward someone electable. If you can count that high. YOU GOT THAT RIGHT! Friday, October 21, 2016 - 10:04 pm · Reply Aww… What’s a matter Fisty? Feeling low? Downtrodden? Beleaguered? GOOD. You, and your kind will never win. YOU BUILT THIS. Live in it. Me2Sense Saturday, October 22, 2016 - 5:01 am · Reply So you are supporting the most corrupt pay to play candidate EVER to run for POTUS — and your proud of it? Wow. We are in trouble. Dave H Saturday, October 22, 2016 - 6:53 am · Reply Of course he is. Because Hillary is the better of the two options on offer despite her many many faults. It’s about time you realised that your candidate is that bad. The GOP only needed to put someone electable up and this election was theirs for the taking. Instead the Tea Party types who have infested (yes, infested) the Republicans have put Hillary into the Oval Office. Well done them eh? Me2Sense Sunday, October 23, 2016 - 2:56 pm · Reply What a stupid reply. Nobody’s freedom on this forum requires your permission or approval. Cook needs to go or be reassigned duties, the magic and “it just works” is long gone. Me2Sense Sunday, October 23, 2016 - 3:14 pm · Reply Response meant for @Grifterus. Me2Sense Sunday, October 23, 2016 - 3:09 pm · Reply Dave H is a sycophant for the dumb and corrupt Dems. Nuff said. Dave H Sunday, October 23, 2016 - 4:20 pm · Reply It looks like those “dumb and corrupt Dems” only need to sit back now and watch the GOP suffer a major self-inflicted electoral kicking. You might want to think about the reasons for that. Me2Sense Sunday, October 23, 2016 - 5:26 pm · Reply Well, if the corrupt Dems win they have gamed the system. And we all know the media, Hollywood, teachers and unions are working overtime in the Dems corner. So if they sadly win, it’s not because they are pure as the driven snow. Right now, the party of people at one time is the party of the CORRUPT and CONNECTED (Clinton Foundation). Make American Great Again — DT! Look at My Hands Saturday, October 22, 2016 - 11:00 am · Reply What’s going to happen to your moniker after the election? First bullshit, then more bullshit. Your side might go down in historic flames because even the deplorables think you’re wrong. DavGreg Friday, October 21, 2016 - 8:01 pm · Reply Pepe the Frog is well known to have been adopted as a symbol by the alt-right. The alt-right organized around precepts and values that are against the broad multi-cultural view that is widely accepted and in the mainstream through most of the US and developed world. The inclusion of that symbol in a thinly dusguised game to promote the Drumpf Campaign. Apple was right in rejecting it. If you do not like Apple’s decision, do the free market thing and go buy an Android or Windows phone. Apple is a private sector company and nobody is making you buy their stuff. Derek Currie Friday, October 21, 2016 - 8:15 pm · Reply I Guess We Need To Talk About Pepe The Frog …Later, observers began noticing an increase in white supremacist themes in Pepe images — or a rise in Pepe usage by white supremacist accounts. Either way, an association was building. This May, an “anonymous white nationalist” told The Daily Beast that the shift was intentional: a dedicated campaign to “reclaim Pepe from normies,” or members of the mainstream, by making Pepe so culturally unacceptable that only the fringe Internet would dare to use him. Donald Trump had earlier tweeted an image of Pepe-as-Trump, and then his son posted an image on Instagram that included Pepe. Homeandmantel Friday, October 21, 2016 - 11:30 pm · Reply Can’t wait until the election is over and the landslide Hillary captured that the GOP will finally cut ties with the ignorant and racist constituency it has built up over the past decade and a half. Trump will singlehandly turn red states blue after this. The party of stupid has to make a wide turn or die off with all the party senile elderly it clings to as it’s base.

It burned furniture, floors, cars and even a house,” Zach Epstein reports for BGR. “The phone has officially been recalled and discontinued, with Samsung warning all owners that they should power down the device immediately and return it to a local retailer at once,” Epstein reports. “There has never been a more serious problem with a smartphone in the history of the industry, and yet many people refuse to turn in their handsets and insist on putting themselves and those around them at risk.” Epstein reports, “More than 1 million people have yet to return their potentially dangerous Galaxy Note 7 phones, according to [Korea JoongAng Daily]’s sources.” Read more in the full article here.

Amaturo More On: new york giants Victor Cruz won't play — and rookie gets his big chance Giants rookie out of Clemson should prep for more reps on 'D' The history lesson that has the Giants 'D' trying to join greats A chance for Giants prime-time revenge — with legends watching The Giants’ Josh Brown problem has metastasized into such an unsavory mess it prompted the mother of their rookie cornerback to blast the Big Blue brass — and divulge that she, too, is a survivor of domestic abuse. Annie Apple, the outspoken mother of Eli Apple, had some harsh words for John Mara after his comments on the latest disturbing revelations about their kicker’s domestic violence history. “He admitted to us that he’s abused his wife in the past,” Mara — seemingly making the problem worse — told WFAN on Thursday. “And I think what’s a little unclear is the extent of that.” Mara’s suggestion there are varying degrees of domestic violence was particularly upsetting to the 42-year-old mother of four. “The are no levels of domestic violence. It’s all bad. And it’s all wrong. It’s a crime,” an emotional Apple told The Post from London. “I don’t tweet for the NFL, I don’t tweet for the Giants. I tweet what’s in my heart. Whether the NFL knew, I don’t know, but domestic violence is not a just an NFL issues, it’s a society issue. And we have to attack the mentality of deliberate ignorance.” Her tweets drew both applause and criticism and sent a jolt through the football world. As a domestic violence survivor, reading these Mara comments makes me sad, angry and completely baffled. He just doesn't get it. This is sad — Annie Apple (@SurvivinAmerica) October 20, 2016 While she didn’t offer any details on her own ordeal, she called domestic violence a “terror” and said Brown’s disturbingly detailed account of his criminal behavior dredged up her own painful memories. “When you read about another woman’s nightmare; it makes yours real again,” she wrote. Apple — who rose to prominence during the NFL draft, when numerous outlets crowned her the greatest sports mom because of her candor and humor — said the last 24 hours have been difficult. “Nobody wants to be the poster girl for domestic violence, but I would have felt like a hypocrite to myself,” she said. “I needed to speak out and let all the Molly Browns and Annie Apples, the other victims, know that they are not alone.” She also refused to back down from her critics. Because someone signs your check, doesn't mean he or she owns your soul. The day you put that up for sale, your humanity ceases to exist. — Annie Apple (@SurvivinAmerica) October 21, 2016 Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under annie apple ,  domestic abuse ,  eli apple ,  josh brown ,  new york giants Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Josh Brown put on NFL hiatus, likely setting up Giants exi...

David Faber | Andrew Ross Sorkin | Anita Balakrishnan Friday, 21 Oct 2016 | 5:57 PM ETBreaking News SHARES show chapters <p>AT&amp;T, Time Warner deal could come shortly: Sources</p> <p>CNBC&#039;s David Faber reports the latest details surrounding merger talks between AT&amp;T and Time Warner.</p> AT&T, Time Warner deal could come shortly: Sources    Friday, 21 Oct 2016 | 1:01 PM ET | 04:40 AT&T is in advanced talks to acquire Time Warner, sources told CNBC on Friday. The companies have now reached agreement on most terms of the deal, according to Reuters. An announcement could come as soon as Monday before the opening bell, as the boards are expected to meet over the weekend, CNBC has learned. Time Warner could be seeking more than $100 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported. That's about in line with $110 a share, reported by Bloomberg. Sources also told CNBC that AT&T could pay well north of $90 a share for Time Warner, and speculated it could be up to $110 a share. Alan Gould, an analyst at Brean Capital, wrote in a research note that such a deal could hit the $110 to $125 a share range. News of the possible value of the deal sent Time Warner shares surging 4.6 percent after hours. The stock closed 8 percent higher in the regular Friday session, briefly breaking a 15-year high after a temporary trading halt earlier in the day. AT&T shares fell 3 percent in the regular session and fell 1 percent after hours. The move would merge AT&T with the entertainment giant whose holdings include Warner Bros. and cable networks including TBS, TNT and CNN. Such a tie-up could be a blockbuster deal, as AT&T has a market capitalization of around $231 billion, and Time Warner has a market capitalization of close to $70 billion, as of Friday. Time Warner and AT&T have declined to comment. Twenty-First Century Fox said it has no plans to bid for Time Warner. Bloomberg initially reported Thursday that executives of both companies had discussed a possible merger. The two companies had also discussed a number of alternatives, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. The talks have since accelerated, Bloomberg added Friday, out of concerns that other potential bidders such as Alphabet and Apple could jump in. The Wall Street Journal also intially reported details of the timing of the talks. While Bloomberg reported an Apple bid is unlikely, the Journal said Apple is "monitoring the situation" and that Apple had approached Time Warner a few months ago. Apple declined to comment. Alphabet did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but is apparently not interested in a deal. It's unclear whether a provision for other companies to "shop" would be included in the deal at this point. Word of the imminent deal comes amid consolidation in the media industry, as more customers "cut the cord" on their cable subscriptions, providing a challenge to TV companies. For example, nearly 6 percent of subscribers told Magid Advisors they were "extremely likely" to cancel their service in the next year, from just under 2 percent in 2011. Time Warner owns HBO, which has a popular streaming offering. "When you think about how content is being consumed today, more and more of millennials are consuming content over tablets, over their smartphones," Amir Rozwadowski, head of telecom services research at Barclays, told CNBC's "Power Lunch" on Friday. "When you think about that opportunity set, there's a tremendous opportunity to push content to those subscribers." Taking into account DirectTV and wireless customers, AT&T has grown to become one of the largest distributors of video content nationwide, Rozwadowski said. "We have always believed that the combination of content and distribution makes sense and over the long term [Time Warner] has been the greatest content factory for films and TV," Gould of Brean Capital wrote. CNBC had previously reported that AT&T wanted to buy a media company, including potentially Time Warner, as rivals such as Verizon and Comcast have made moves in the media business, with ownership of properties like AOL and NBCUniversal, respectively. Owning a media company can be a powerful advertising play, leveraging data on telecommunications customers. "The challenge a company like AT&T has ... is that they're landlocked to the relationships they have with consumers," Greg Portell, partner in A.T. Kearney's consumer products and retail and communications, media & technology practices, said earlier this fall. "What content gets them is economic opportunities beyond their consumer base." But Barry Diller, chairman of IAC, told CNBC this week that Time Warner faces the challenge to figure out the course from "old media" company to thinking digitally. But AT&T's base of wireless customers may not be the answer. "Those are huge challenges," Diller said in an interview that aired Friday on "Squawk Alley." "If you can't figure something out, you get bought. I like very much Time Warner. Its management I think are really good, and there's every reason they will figure it out. I don't think AT&T helps them." Other media companies also saw volatile trading Friday. Viacom shares rose nearly 3 percent, Verizon fell nearly 2 percent and CBS gained almost 2 percent. — Reuters and CNBC's Mariam Amini, Josh Lipton and Michelle Castillo contributed to this report. Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com. Barclay's received non-investment-banking related compensation including compensation for brokerage services, if applicable) from AT&T and/or Time Warner.

Target has installed 147 megawatts (million watts or MW) of solar capacity on 300 stores, according to the 2016 Solar Means Business Report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). "We're incredibly proud of the progress we've made in improving building efficiencies and reducing environmental impact. Our commitment to installing solar panels on 500 stores and distribution centers by 2020 is evidence of that progress," John Leisen, vice president of property management at Target, said in the SEIA statement. Walmart had held the top spot for the previous four years and still claims second place with 145MW of solar power installed on 364 buildings, according to the SEIA, which has been tracking corporate solar deployments for the past five years. This year, real estate developer Prologis came in third with 107.8MW of solar. Apple, which is in fourth place with 93.9MW of installed solar power, is a likely contender for first place sometime next year. Last year, Apple announced it was investing $850 million in a solar power plant through a partnership with First Solar, one of the nation's largest photovoltaic (PV) manufacturers and provider of utility-scale PV plants. Through a 25-year purchasing agreement, Apple will get 130MW from the new California Flats Solar Project. The project is currently under construction and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Other Top 10 companies recognized in the SEIA's report include Costco (50.7 MW), Kohl's (50.2 MW), IKEA (44 MW), Macy's (38.9 MW), General Growth Properties (30.2 MW) and Hartz Mountain Industries (22.7 MW). While IKEA is in seventh place, it powers 91% of its retail locations through solar, according to the SEIA. Overall, U.S. corporations have doubled their solar installations year over year and are expected to close out 2016 with nearly 280MW of solar power -- compared to 130MW in 2015. The SEIA's report covers corporate solar installations in 38 states plus Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico; it tracks almost 1,100MW of solar installations at 2,000 U.S. companies. "To put that in context, that's enough electricity to power the equivalent of 193,000 homes every year," the report stated. "Also noteworthy, in just the first three quarters of 2016, the report found 142MW of corporate solar was added in the U.S., more than was installed in all of 2015 (129 MW)." In 2014, frustrated by a lack of renewable energy and a purchasing system that's too complicated, major U.S. companies joined an initiative to force the government and utilities to change. Along with the World Wildlife Fund and the World Resources Institute, the corporations signed a pact supporting six principles to clearly identify what's needed when purchasing renewable energy. The initial companies included Bloomberg, Facebook, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, Mars, Novelis, Procter and Gamble, REI, Sprint and Walmart. The companies called for six specific changes they wanted the energy industry to adopt to increase renewable energy use: Greater choice in procurement options More access to cost competitive options Longer- and variable-term contracts Access to new projects that reduce emissions Streamlined third-party financing Increased purchasing options with utilities "Solar plays a vital role within our renewable energy portfolio," Mark Vanderhelm, vice president of energy for Walmart, said in a statement. "This is evident by our 2020 commitment of doubling solar energy projects at our Walmart stores, Sam's Clubs and distribution centers across the nation. Our focus is on finding those solar projects that are right for the business."

We merely had a cameo of Pepe,’ Treadstone continued. ‘We get banned because it’s a pro-Trump app, but you can have an app only about Pepe and that’s not offensive,'” Nash reports. “In July, Apple’s App Store also rejected a satirical game based on the Hillary Clinton email servers scandal. Apple branded the game as ‘offensive’ and ‘objectionable’ before reversing their decision following a report at Breitbart.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Poor Pepe.

You cannot use the argument that other apps currently in the app store more flagrantly abuse the same copyright. The official response I received was, it doesn’t matter if 1000 similar apps in the app store break , YOUR app appears to use similar imagery to “” and so is rejected. The decision was upheld upon multiple appeals.

Either way, an association was building. This May, an “anonymous white nationalist” told The Daily Beast that the shift was intentional: a dedicated campaign to “reclaim Pepe from normies,” or members of the mainstream, by making Pepe so culturally unacceptable that only the fringe Internet would dare to use him. Donald Trump had earlier tweeted an image of Pepe-as-Trump, and then his son posted an image on Instagram that included Pepe.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Examining reports of slow write speeds on the 32GB iPhone 7 by Jeff Kampman  2:20 PM on October 21, 2016 Reports are going around of late that the 32GB iPhone 7 has demonstrably slower write performance than its larger siblings. Under the provocative title "iPhone 7 - What Apple Doesn't Want You To Know," YouTuber Unbox Therapy has shown that the 32GB version of the phone has much slower write performance than the 128GB version. He concludes that Apple "probably went a little bit chintzier on the lower-capacity models in terms of the quality or caliber" of the devices' storage, leading to the performance difference. When I saw these results, I immediately surmised that the write performance of the storage subsystem in the iPhone 7 is limited by the number of dies hooked up to the device's storage controller. In general, we know that the more flash devices one can hook up to a controller, the more performance one can extract from solid-state storage, at least to a point. It appears that hunch could be correct. Thanks to the fearless folks at iFixit and Chipworks, we know some of the details of the iPhone's storage subsystem. At least some iPhone 7s use a 32GB SK Hynix H23QEG8VG2ACS storage chip. According to SK Hynix's data sheet, that chip contains four flash devices inside one package, for a total of 256Gb—or 32GB—of raw storage space. At least some 128GB versions of the iPhone 7 use the SK Hynix H23Q1T8QK2MYS chip, according to Chipworks, and that part has eight dies in a package. Chipworks also says the 256GB iPhone 7 uses an eight-die package with Toshiba 3D NAND inside. We know next to nothing about Apple's storage controller in the iPhone 7, but it seems possible the controller isn't able to saturate all of its channels when it's paired with the 32GB SK Hynix chip. If that's true, the drop in write performance is regrettable, and it has unfortunate implications for moving data onto the device. Still, the difference seems to be a result of well-understood limitations in flash storage architectures, not because Apple "went a little bit chintzier in terms of the quality or caliber" of the 32GB phone's storage.

Our commitment to installing solar panels on 500 stores and distribution centers by 2020 is evidence of that progress," John Leisen, vice president of property management at Target, said in the SEIA statement. Walmart had held the top spot for the previous four years and still claims second place with 145MW of solar power installed on 364 buildings, according to the SEIA, which has been tracking corporate solar deployments for the past five years. This year, real estate developer Prologis came in third with 107.8MW of solar. Apple, which is in fourth place with 93.9MW of installed solar power, is a likely contender for first place sometime next year. Last year, Apple announced it was investing $850 million in a solar power plant through a partnership with First Solar, one of the nation's largest photovoltaic (PV) manufacturers and provider of utility-scale PV plants. Through a 25-year purchasing agreement, Apple will get 130MW from the new California Flats Solar Project. The project is currently under construction and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Other Top 10 companies recognized in the SEIA's report include Costco (50.7 MW), Kohl's (50.2 MW), IKEA (44 MW), Macy's (38.9 MW), General Growth Properties (30.2 MW) and Hartz Mountain Industries (22.7 MW). While IKEA is in seventh place, it powers 91% of its retail locations through solar, according to the SEIA. Overall, U.S. corporations have doubled their solar installations year over year and are expected to close out 2016 with nearly 280MW of solar power -- compared to 130MW in 2015. The SEIA's report covers corporate solar installations in 38 states plus Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico; it tracks almost 1,100MW of solar installations at 2,000 U.S. companies. "To put that in context, that's enough electricity to power the equivalent of 193,000 homes every year," the report stated. "Also noteworthy, in just the first three quarters of 2016, the report found 142MW of corporate solar was added in the U.S., more than was installed in all of 2015 (129 MW)." In 2014, frustrated by a lack of renewable energy and a purchasing system that's too complicated, major U.S. companies joined an initiative to force the government and utilities to change. Along with the World Wildlife Fund and the World Resources Institute, the corporations signed a pact supporting six principles to clearly identify what's needed when purchasing renewable energy. The initial companies included Bloomberg, Facebook, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, Mars, Novelis, Procter and Gamble, REI, Sprint and Walmart. The companies called for six specific changes they wanted the energy industry to adopt to increase renewable energy use: Greater choice in procurement options More access to cost competitive options Longer- and variable-term contracts Access to new projects that reduce emissions Streamlined third-party financing Increased purchasing options with utilities "Solar plays a vital role within our renewable energy portfolio," Mark Vanderhelm, vice president of energy for Walmart, said in a statement. "This is evident by our 2020 commitment of doubling solar energy projects at our Walmart stores, Sam's Clubs and distribution centers across the nation. Our focus is on finding those solar projects that are right for the business."

Cynthia Littleton Managing Editor: Television @Variety_Cynthia 2 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Print Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of AT&T and Time Warner October 21, 2016 | 12:40PM PT As AT&T and Time Warner executives hunker down in merger talks, the most significant questions swirling around the deal revolve around the price tag and the timing of the courtship for AT&T. Speculation is growing that the talks are focused on setting a cash and stock transaction. The floor price was set two years ago when Time Warner rejected an unsolicited offer valued at $85 a share from 21st Century Fox. Analysts are suggesting the deal would have to be in the $105-$110 per share range (although some say higher) to offer a roughly 30% premium over the Time Warner’s trading price earlier this week, before shares began to spike Thursday on news of the AT&T talks. TW shares were up as much as 12% in trading Friday, soaring to the $93 range before settling back down to close at $89.48, up 8%. That’s still a huge leap from trading in the $79 range during the past few months. From AT&T’s perspective, the timing of the deal is puzzling, leading observers to speculate that the telco giant was afraid of another suitor beating them to the acquisition of Time Warner. Apple is known to have flirted – but not much more than that — with acquiring Time Warner in the recent past. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Apple is “monitoring the situation closely” as AT&T and Time Warner talks progress. Apple and Time Warner’s HBO partnered early last year on distribution of the standalone HBO Now service, which had helped strengthen ties between the companies. Apple content guru Eddy Cue and HBO CEO Richard Plepler shared the stage on Thursday at Vanity Fair’s New Establishment Summit, talking up the success they’ve seen in tying their two brands together. Related AT&T + Time Warner: 3 Reasons a Merger Makes Sense and 3 Hurdles Google has been mentioned as another potential suitor as it moves to beef up its video businesses under the YouTube umbrella. There’s also the potential of a deep-pocketed player from overseas, such as China’s Dalian Wanda Group, although that would surely be a much harder sell to investors and regulators. Fox is not in the mix this time around, a source said. Apple and Google have the financial wherewithal to easily scoop up Time Warner, if they were so inclined. The same cannot be said for AT&T at present. The company closed its $48 billion acquisition of satellite giant DirecTV last year. It already has about $126 billion in debt on its books, a load that would balloon to nearly $200 billion with a Time Warner transaction, according to an analysis by New State Research’s Jonathan Chaplin. AT&T reports its third quarter earnings on Tuesday, which is likely another factor in the rush to get an agreement in hand. The lack of overlapping assets between AT&T and Time Warner would limit the amount of cost savings that could be immediately squeezed out of the combination. AT&T chairman-CEO Randall Stephenson has made no secret of his interest in expanding the telco’s reach in the content arena. But AT&T observers expected Stephenson to wait at least another year to take on an acquisition of this magnitude. Peter Chernin, the former News Corp. COO who launched a digital content venture with AT&T in 2014, is understood to be advising Stephenson on the Time Warner talks amid speculation he could play a larger role if the deal comes together. The timing of setting a cash-and-stock deal is less than idea for AT&T as its shares have been in a slump since mid-August, dropping nearly 17% during the past two months. The stock closed at $38.65 on Thursday. It took another 3% hit on Friday as the reports of the acquisition talks gained steam. Reaction to the prospect of a deal was mixed among Wall Street observers. Some were skeptical of the value of marrying Time Warner’s content with AT&T’s satellite TV and high-speed Internet services. Others suggest that adding Time Warner’s high-end content would help AT&T position DirecTV to compete with Comcast and other large MVPDs and help AT&T enhance its wireless offerings on the telco side of the equation. DirecTV is about to embark on the ambitious launch of an Internet-delivered channel package, DirecTV Now, in the hopes of making a more attractive offer to subscribers for bundling video and high-speed data services. “The price paid for any deal could be overkill as (1) licensing content has become more pervasive than it was a few years ago and (2) exclusivity is not necessary and in fact may not be a good use of Time Warner’s valuable content,” Cowen & Co. analyst Colby Synesael. “It is not clear how 1+1 in this case equals something greater than 2 despite AT&T’s success with other large acquisitions.” Chaplin, who covers AT&T for New Street Research, sees AT&T’s interest in acquiring a significant content portfolio as a “defensive” play against competition on the video and wireless services front coming from Comcast and other cable giants. “We are very skeptical of there being synergies between owning both content and distribution assets, but both AT&T and Verizon appear to have a different view,” he wrote. The specter of the disastrous AOL-Time Warner merger, completed in early 2001, hangs over any transaction involving Time Warner. Under the leadership of Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes, the company has pursued a clearly defined strategy to pare down its holdings to focus squarely on content. In 2009, the company divested Time Warner Cable, the nation’s second-largest operator, under the rationale that Time Warner would be better served by plowing resources into content creation and distribution, not the capital-intensive needs of an MVPD. AT&T’s desire to grow may wind up reversing that course with an offer too good to refuse, or an aggressive bid that brings other players out onto the field. Whatever the outside, the flurry of activity around Time Warner in the past 48 hours will be good for other media stocks and likely ignite the consolidation that analysts have been predicting for the past two years or so. “This final thesis is playing out quicker than we expected, but it demonstrates the embedded value of media content in distribution platforms,” RBC Capital Markets Steven Cahall wrote.

Stan Lee Says Doctor Doom Is Not A Villain AT&T Looking To Buy Warner Bros & DC Entertainment Parent Company Matthew Mueller - 10/21/2016 4 comments share Newsletter Share on Facebook Tweet This Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Pin to Pinterest Time Warner is the belle of the ball at the moment, as the prominent company has multiple suitors in addition to the previously revealed courting of AT&T. AT&T is well aware of the increasing interest in the company, and according to a source close to the situation (via Bloomberg Markets) is attempting to head off other possible bidders at the pass and close the deal as soon as possible. The source, who wishes to be unidentified, has also said the conversations between the companies has intensified. The last thing they want to do is lose Time Warner to other companies like Google or Apple. The renewed interest has had a significantly positive effect on Time Waner's stock, which has risen 14% to $94.44 and has increased the company's market value to over $70 billion. Both Apple and Google are staying quiet on their plans or interest, but a source within Apple says they aren't planning on bidding, at least at the moment. The rumor of their involvement stems a discussion between Eddy Cue, Apple's services and content chief, and Olaf Olafsson, who is Time Warner's corporate strategy head. Still, it's unlikely that they will enter the fray. Regardless of who puts in a bid for Time Warner, the bid itself will need to start at $100 a share according to Brean Capital analyst Alan Gould, who values the shares at $123 currently. “We have always believed that the combination of content and distribution makes sense,” Gould said in the note. Time Warner “has been the greatest content factory for films and TV. Given the rapidly evolving distribution universe, we believe content ownership could be beneficial.” AT&T is still the predominant favorite to absorb Time Warner, and it would definitely have positive effects for the company. Time Warner owns HBO, CNN, Justice League studio Warner Bros., and of course DC Comics, all assets that would definitely be worth coveting. The only problem is that if they do absorb the company, they will also take on at least another 24 billion in long-term debt, adding to their current debut of $120 billion. While Time Warner's stock went up, AT&T's went down 4%. If the deal does go through, many will be interested to see how things shake out at AT&T in the long term, and how they adjust to their sizable new addition. As for Warner Bros. and DC Entertainment, it's doubtful that any significant changes would occur, at least in the short term.

The rumor comes from noted Japanese publisher Macotakara which was among the first to predict the iPhone 7 is killing the headphone jack. New York, meet the world’s tech scene 5,000 Tech leaders are coming to NYC this November to learn and do business. This is your chance to join them. Check it out The website claims that along with the USB port, Apple may also get rid of the MagSafe 2 and Thunderbolt 2 ports. Instead, the new MacBook Pro will support Thunderbolt 3. This means you’ll likely have to charge the laptop through the USB-C port or Thunderbolt 3. Of course, you’ll still need to resort to some sort of USB 3.0 adapter since the majority of peripheral devices still use the traditional standard. Macotakara’s report further suggests the tech titan will unveil the new MacBook Pro at an event sometime this month. According to the rumor, it will arrive in 15.4-inch and 13.3-inch models. The Japanese publisher also speculates Apple will release a next-gen 13.3-inch MacBook Air, but will likely discontinue its current 11-inch model. Previous reports around the the company’s new lineup of laptops hinted that – much like the iPhone 7 – Apple might also be considering killing the standard headphone jack on the MacBook Pros. So in case the reports turn out to be true: Apple fan boys and girls better prepare to spend a boatload of cash on auxiliary adapters and docks. At present, Apple sells its own USB Type C dock with ports for USB 3.0, USB-C for charging as well as HDMI. Still, it’s a bit pricey at $79. via Engadget on Macotakara Read next: This digital frame streams beautiful, curated art to any wall AppleGearMacBookMacBook Pro Share on Facebook (870) Share on Twitter (351) Mix is a reporter from Amsterdam.

Used to be, you paid more for an Apple computer, but, in exchange, you got hardware that would last and an operating system that was superior, even if you did have to give up on a lot of software options because many developers only made their products for Windows or, showing my age here, MS-DOS. I speak, obviously, of the Steve Job days, so I concede there was an exception for some years in the 90s (although we stayed loyal, even then). I went for Apple -- which means the National Center for Public Policy Research went Apple -- in 1985, and we never looked back, despite some concern for the company's politics, and a well-covered contretemps with Tim Cook after we submitted a shareholder proposal examining the company's actual record on environmental issues versus the one the public hears about. But last week, one of our laptops, purchased in 2015, wouldn't start up. We took it to an authorized Mac repair shop in Severna Park, MD. Bad logic board. Apple sent a replacement. It was bad also. Ever since, we've been trying to get Apple to ship a second replacement logic board to the repair shop. It won't. It says it will, or so we're told, but, every day, it doesn't. I even called Apple myself to try to find out why it wouldn't ship the part, but got nowhere, because the person at Apple, while cordial, had no idea how to tell if Apple would ship the part and he told me he had no idea how to transfer me to someone at Apple who would know -- even though the repair facility gave me the order number so Apple could pull the record up on its computer system and trace the request. The guy I'm speaking with at the repair shop tells me he worked for Apple itself for a decade, and he swears Apple has these orders on a computer (of course it does!), but the guy at Apple had no idea how to find us in the system, even with all our data on hand. Once upon a time, when I needed Apple repairs (rarely) or upgrades (more likely), I actually would go to the back of the shop and watch them work, to learn how to do it myself. The company in those days seemed organized and well-run, even though everyone swore it couldn't last. This version of Apple seems to be in chaos. Logic boards really should last longer than a year, but let's set that aside, and just say this: One ought to be able to get a replacement if it does go out. Apple's not claiming it has a shortage, or a backlog, of logic boards for late-model laptops. It just isn't sending the part after saying it will. Day after day. How long will this go on?

Apple Investigating Report Of iPhone 7 Catching Fire Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple Investigating Report Of iPhone 7 Catching Fire Image courtesy of Australia's 7 News October 21, 2016 1:44 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler Another hot device samsung apple iphone fires iPhone 7 damage investigation australia report While we’ve heard numerous reports of Samsung smartphones and tablets overheating and catching fire — sometimes destroying property and injuring customers — now Apple is on the receiving end of at least one similar report.  Apple says it has opened an investigating into the alleged fire of an iPhone 7 device in Australia, Business Insider reports. The incident, which happened last week, reportedly occurred when the owner of the week-old phone left it in his pants’ pocket inside his car while he went surfing. Australia’s 7 News reports that when the man returned to his car it was filled with smoke and its interior was destroyed. The man says that he hadn’t dropped the phone or used a foreign charger. Photos taken by the man show the phone destroyed: broken in two pieces and charred from the fire. A spokesperson for Apple told Business Insider that it is aware of the incident and has opened an investigation. A search of the Consumer Product Safety Commissions’ SaferProducts.gov database shows several reports of customers experiencing fires with their iPhones, however, most were related to the device’s charging cable or an older version of the phone. In a report from 2013, the owner of a iPhone 3GS tells the CPSC that his device was working fine when he noticed the battery had exploded. “The phone is now useless,” the report states. “This could have caused serious harm if I had been holding the device to my head and talking on it.” The Australian incident comes after dozens of customers reported similar fires or smoking of Samsung devices. The issues eventually led the tech company to recall and discontinue production of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone.

Finally. We've been waiting for this MacBook Pro overhaul for years. The event will be taking place at 1pm ET and we'll be covering it as it happens. As always, Apple will be livestreaming the presentation on its website. You can watch with Safari for macOS, Safari on iOS, the Apple TV, or Microsoft Edge on Windows 10. As always, a lot of what we're expecting to see has been leaked out. Here's what to expect. A totally redesigned MacBook Pro Image: Martin Hajek - This is a design concept of what Apple's new MacBook Pro with OLED touchscreen could look like. This is the big one. Apple is expected totally overhaul its 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro notebooks. This is a big deal because the actual MacBook Pro design hasn't been changed since 2012, when Apple rolled models with Retina displays. Since then, we've begged and pleaded with Apple to release something worthy of replacing the 2012 MacBook Pro with Retina display. Back in May, analyst Ming Chi-Kuo from KGI Securities reported that Apple was going to overhaul the MacBook Pro, making it thinner and offering an OLED touchscreen above the keyboard. The touchscreen will sit where your function keys sit on the MacBook Pro now, and will dynamically change, based on what apps you're using and what is on your screen. Cult of Mac later obtained "spy photos" of the chassis, showing off where the OLED touchscreen will sit. Image: Cult of Mac The MacBook Pro is also expected to add USB-C ports and Thunderbolt 3 ports for faster connectivity. In fact, a recent Macotakara report suggests Apple will only have USB-C ports on the MacBook Pro. Apple could even get rid of MagSafe, its long-patented (and very useful) power adaptor, and use just USB-C. When it comes to internals, Bloomberg reported back in August that the new MacBook Pro would use AMD graphics. As for processors, Apple could go with Intel's sixth-generation Core Skylake chipset or it could update to the new Kaby Lake processors. We'd love to see Kaby Lake MacBook Pros, especially after waiting this long, but it might come down to yields. Updated MacBook Air Image: Apple Although the MacBook Pro is expected to be the big star of the event, Apple is also expected to update the MacBook Air. Though it might have lost its thin and light crown to the MacBook, it's still Apple's best-selling notebook. It's also Apple's most affordable. Both Bloomberg and Macotakara report that the MacBook Air will be updated with USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 support. The actual hardware design, which Apple has used since 2010, is expected to be the same. The screen is not expected to get an upgrade, so if you want Retina, you need to pony up for a MacBook or MacBook Pro. Macotakara also reports that Apple will be getting rid of the 11-inch MacBook Air, leaving only the 13-inch model in the lineup. Updated iMac Bloomberg reports that Apple will update its 4K and 5K iMacs with faster processors. This makes sense, since Apple did the same thing last year. It's possible the iMac could also get USB-C ports, though we are really hoping to see some Thunderbolt 3 love. Graphics on the iMac are also expected to get a boost, thanks to newer chips from AMD. 5K External Display Back in June, Apple discontinued its beautiful Thunderbolt Display. The discontinuation was notable because there wasn't another product in Apple's lineup to replace it. For years, professional users who use 4K displays have asked where Apple's first-party solution might is. The problem is that in order to successfully drive a 5K display, you need powerful graphics, something a lot of MacBooks just don't have. Back in June, 9to5Mac reported on rumors that Apple was working on a 5K display with an external GPU, in order to drive that needed performance. We just might see it this week. If Apple does roll-out Thunderbolt 3 across its laptop line, that could pave the way for a 5K display with built-in GPU. No Mac mini and Mac Pro updates Image: Apple Apple hasn't updated the Mac Pro since its release three years ago. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like the Pro machine will get an update, even thought the addition of USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 would be very welcome to pro users. Similarly, the Mac mini hasn't had an update since October 2014. The Mac mini is a low-volume seller, but plenty of users rely on it for an inexpensive Mac; it's also often used as a server. Sadly, the Mac mini isn't expected to get an update this time.

The alleged counterfeit products "haven't been safety certified or properly constructed," Apple said in the suit. TagsCrime Items sold on Amazon by Mobile Star LLC, a New Jersey company that makes Apple chargers and lightning cables, are counterfeit and "pose a risk to the public," Apple has alleged in a federal trademark infringement lawsuit. Reviews of the products on Amazon detail fire risks posed by the cables, Apple said. Furthermore, Apple has alleged that Mobile Star is illegally using its trademark. "Consumers, relying on Amazon.com's reputation, have no reason to suspect the power products they purchased from Amazon.com are anything but genuine," Apple alleged.  Almost 90% of #iPhone chargers sold as official products on #Amazon are fake, #Apple says in lawsuit against one counterfeit producer pic.twitter.com/DmGEYh3XTt— CCTVNEWS (@cctvnews) October 20, 2016 "This is particularly true where, as here, the products are sold directly 'by Amazon.com' as genuine Apple products using Apple's own product marketing images. Consumers are likewise unaware that the counterfeit Apple products that Amazon.com sourced from Mobile Star have not been safety certified or properly constructed, lack adequate insulation and/or have inadequate spacing between low voltage and high voltage circuits, and pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock."  Amazon is not named in the lawsuit, though it directly sold the products. Amazon said in a statement to 9to5Mac that it "has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits on our site. We work closely with manufacturers and brands, and pursue wrongdoers aggressively."  The products were bought by Apple as part of the company's regular efforts to analyze items sold on Amazon that are labeled as Apple products. In the last nine months, Apple has "purchased well over 100 iPhone devices" and other products "sold as genuine by sellers on Amazon.com," the company said.

Getting right down to it, the new A10 Fusion chip that powers Apple's iPhone 7 is an absolute beast. While new iPhone models are always faster than their predecessors, Apple really outdid itself with the A10, both in terms of overall performance and power efficiency; as we were reminded in a new showdown on Friday, the iPhone 7 crushes leading Android phones. DON'T MISS: iPhone 7 Plus vs Google Pixel speed tests: Closer, but Android was still crushed in the end When Apple introduced the iPhone 7, it boasted that the A10 Fusion is the "most powerful chip ever in a smartphone" and, truth be told, it's hard to disagree. As a quick point of reference, consider this: the A10 chip is 40% faster than the A9 chip Apple used in the iPhone 6s. That's a tremendous year-over-year improvement no matter how you look at it. Since the iPhone 7's release, a variety of testing has confirmed that Apple's A10 Fusion processor is best in class. Most recently, microprocessor analyst Linley Gwennap of Mobile Chip Report recently said that the A10 "blows away the competition." Apple’s investment in custom CPU design continues to pay off, as the new iPhone 7 delivers better performance than any other flagship smartphone and outscores even some low-end PCs. The phone uses a new processor chip, the A10 Fusion, that contains not one but two custom CPU designs, representing Apple’s first foray into the Big.Little approach that many other mobile processors employ. The massive Hurricane CPU improves performance by 35% over the previous-generation Twister, boosting both the clock speed and the per-clock performance. The smaller Zephyr CPU helps the iPhone 7 extend battery life compared with its predecessor. You might also remember that Anandtech had similar praise for the iPhone 7's hardware, calling it "unparalleled and a cut above anything else in the industry." Putting the iPhone 7 through any number of tests, the results speak for themselves.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple Your iPhone has a secret one-handed keyboard Apple Your iPhone has a secret one-handed keyboard By Bindu Nair - Oct 21, 2016 The advent of huge phablets in the market has necessitated the need for a one-handed mode in keyboards so people can type without stretching their fingers to uncomfortable lengths. While a number of manufacturers ship their handsets with such a feature in-built, Apple isn’t one of them. As it turns out, Apple has been hiding a secret one-handed keyboard for years. Developer Steve Troughton-Smith uncovered the code for this buried ability while tinkering about iOS Simulater, a tool which lets people test apps for bugs. Surprisingly, the mode has been around since at least iOS 8 which came out in 2014. Why Apple has been sitting on a one-handed keyboard for so long is a mystery. Owners of the bigger iPhone 6/6S/7 Plus would probably love to have a more convenient option when typing up a storm. According to Troughton-Smith, the feature can be activated by swiping either left or right from the edge of the normal keyboard. Also Read: The iPhone 7 has a hidden virtual home button While the area of the keyboard remains the same, the one-handed mode automatically squeezes the keys closer together and introduces three big buttons for cutting, copying and pasting. Unfortunately, there’s no easy way for iPhone users to start using the secret skill straight away. Troughton-Smith’s made the code for the one-handed mode publicly available in case someone wants to try it out. However, they’ll have to be in possession of a jailbroken iPhone to do so. Apple will hopefully get going and release the keyboard in a future iOS release for people who don’t happen to have one ready.

Most Popular AT&T is pushing to clinch a deal to buy Time Warner by Monday, aiming to close the door on other potential bidders, according to a person familiar with the matter. Talks between the companies have accelerated since it was first reported Thursday that executives had met in recent weeks to discuss potential business combinations, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing private discussions. Part of AT&T's concern is that other suitors such as Google or Apple could jump in, the person said. Shares of Time Warner, the owner of CNN, HBO and the Warner Bros. studio, surged in trading Friday, advancing as much as 14% to $94.44. That gives the company a market value in excess of $70 billion and pushes the stock beyond the $85-a-share Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox unsuccessfully offered in 2014. AT&T, the largest U.S. pay-TV company through its ownership of DirecTV, fell as much as 4.4%. Apple is unlikely to bid for Time Warner, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Apple's services and content chief Eddy Cue brought up the idea of a possible deal with Time Warner's corporate strategy head Olaf Olafsson late last year and said in a podium discussion on Thursday that he was a huge fan of the company's Home Box Office. Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. AT&T and Time Warner declined to comment. A deal for Time Warner would have to begin at a "bare minimum" of $100 a share, Alan Gould, an analyst at Brean Capital, said in a note Friday. His private market value for the company is $123. "We have always believed that the combination of content and distribution makes sense," Mr. Gould said in the note. Time Warner "has been the greatest content factory for films and TV. Given the rapidly evolving distribution universe, we believe content ownership could be beneficial." Time Warner Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bewkes is a willing seller if he gets an offer he thinks is fair, said one of the people. AT&T has transformed itself over the past decade from a regional phone company to a national telecommunications powerhouse. Its plan to focus on media and entertainment targets include companies worth $2 billion to $50 billion, people familiar with the plans said earlier this month. ~~ Bloomberg News In this article: Media Mobile News TV Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2016 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17 x Scroll to Continue

The New York pop-up shop will be open through the end of this year, and let people get their hands on new Google devices such as Pixel smartphones which began shipping Thursday in a direct challenge to Apple's latest iPhones. "This is not even a testing ground, just an extension of the launch," Google spokeswoman Chrissy Persico said at the showroom opening event. "We want people to come in and experience the products." Google early this month took on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into hardware, launching the in-house designed Pixel smartphone and a slew of other devices showcasing artificial intelligence prowess. By producing both the phone hardware and its Android software, Google is making a more direct assault on Apple and its tightly controlled ecosystem. The pop-up shop also displayed Google's freshly unveiled Daydream View virtual reality headset, a modular wi-fi system, and a Home virtual assistant that will challenge the Amazon Echo device. Nothing is sold at the Google shop, but the staff directs potential customers to the company's online store or telephone operators who can take orders for products. A wall in the shop is decorated with an artful arrangement of blue, red, yellow and green blocks, arranged to display the internet company's trademark colors. Only 30 or so visitors ventured into the pop-up store for its opening morning, a lean showing in comparison to mobs typically drawn to new Apple stores.

(Matthew Emmons/USA TODAY Sports) 1. Do you have any faith anymore that, when faced with a crisis, Roger Goodell will do the right thing? As a football fan, you want to feel good about the state of the game, and you want to have some confidence that those who are running the show have the best interest of the game at heart. When presented with a challenge, they’ll figure it out. The NFL has survived for almost 100 years and gone from dirt fields and leather helmets to a billion-dollar industry because there have been smart, talented people at the helm who all find a way to make it work. But over the last dozen years, watching Goodell and his team bungle things like domestic violence policy, player safety, or the wildly inconsistent disciplinary process — all against the backdrop of declining TV ratings and the #boycottNFL hashtag — it’s clear that, to paraphrase veteran receiver Steve Smith, “the system is broken.” The latest example? The ghastly Josh Brown case. It’s hard to imagine an investigation being mishandled worse than what the league and the Giants did when it came to their kicker and the charges against him. Make no mistake: This is not some New Englander viewing Goodell through a local prism. There’s no Deflategate-related axe to grind, although Smith did adroitly note that when it comes to comparing Tom Brady’s four-game ban and Brown’s situation, the league has “valued the amount of air in a ball but yet devalued when a person or persons may have been harmed and fail to put forth necessary actions of energy and time in which far less important things have taken precedent!” The bottom line? I can’t recall a time where so many fans and players — no matter their background — have had so little confidence in a sitting commissioner. Never is this more aptly shown than when, on the few occasions where Goodell comes down from his ivory tower to address the media — hat’s when social media turns into an episode of “Mystery Science Theatre” where players gleefully take their shots at the commissioner. I wasn’t around for much of his reign, but from talking to people who were involved in the NFL during his tenure, you had faith that Pete Rozelle would always find a way to do the right thing. There were missteps, but no one did a better job growing the game than Rozelle. There was almost always some measure of faith in Paul Tagliabue and his decision-making process. There’s none of that anymore. Zero. Of course, you can argue that Goodell has never had that sort of backing from the public to begin with. But even if he did have it at some point, after his decisions over the last decade or so, it’s gone, and never coming back. At the end of the day, the commissioner doesn’t need the approval of the fans. He doesn’t need a thumbs up from the NFLPA. The only people he needs to keep happy are the 32 NFL owners. And as long as the money keeps flowing, they probably won’t be making a change anytime soon. But like Smith said, the system is broken. Whether or not the league makes the fix could ultimately end up determining the course of the game for the next 100 years. 2. Annie Apple, the mother of New York Giants rookie corner Eli Apple, became a minor celebrity after her son was drafted, developing an affiliation with ESPN while offering a unique opinion on the state of the NFL. Good for her for speaking he mind when it came to the Brown situation this week. In a series of Tweets, she attacked New York co-owner John Mara for his stance on the Brown issue. “As a domestic violence survivor, reading these Mara comments makes me sad, angry and completely baffled. He just doesn’t get it. This is sad,” she wrote. “Don’t know why it’s difficult [for] folks to realize there’s nothing remotely acceptable bout violence against women. No excuse no justification.” Apple has apparently taken a lot of heat from Giants fans for her Tweets, and while it couldn’t have been easy for her, it was the right thing to do in this instance. 3. We’ve written about the “GTFB” mantra that’s been preached by the New England defense over the last dozen or so years, and while there are worrisome elements to the defense through the first six games (third-down, red-zone), their work on limiting explosive plays is certainly worth noting. Through six weeks, the Patriots are the only team in the league not to allow a pas splay of 40 yards or more. (For some perspective, the Raiders lead the league with nine.) New England is 11th in the league when it comes to yielding pass plays of 20 yards or more with 20. (The Raiders are also tops in this department, having given up 28.) It’s probably no shock that the Minnesota defense is one of the best in the league in both departments, having allowed just one pass play of 40 yards or more (second to New England) and 11 pass plays of 20 yards or more (best in the NFL). The other thing worth noting? From the outside it’s tough to tell what sort of job he’s doing, but you have to give some credit to new safeties coach Steve Belichick. The Patriots took some grief when the son of the head coach was named as the new safeties coach, but whether it’s been coaching, execution, good matchups or all three, the younger Belichick deserves some acknowledgement for the good numbers put up by the defensive backs. 4. As expected, quarterback Tom Brady was really deferential to the Pittsburgh defense this week, saying that while the names and faces have changed over the years, the overall hard-nosed philosophy has never been altered. “They play the game the right way,” Brady said of the Steelers. But it’s worth noting that when it comes to the Steelers, Brady has almost always posted phenomenal numbers. In eight career games against Pittsburgh, Brady is 6-2, and has completed 69 percent of his passes, to go along with 2,604 passing yards, 22 touchdowns, just three interceptions and a passer rating of 113.4. In his last five starts against Pittsburgh, Brady has 17 touchdowns and no interceptions, with a 127.9 passer rating. Two more notes when it comes to touchdown passes — with six in his first two games, Brady has more passing touchdowns this season than four of the quarterbacks who have started every game so far. And the Patriots’ quarterbacks have not thrown an interception in their first six games of the season. In New England’s last nine games (including the 2015 postseason), Patriots quarterbacks have just two picks, both of which came via Brady in the AFC title game. In his last nine starts, New York’s Ryan Fitzpatrick has thrown 15 interceptions. 5. With all the talk about Stephen Gostkowski’s recent run of inconsistency, thought it was worth noting that the Patriots did not bring in any kickers for tryouts this week. From this viewpoint, the steady veteran has earned enough currency with the team; he’ll figure it out sooner rather than later. When it comes to the level of faith his teammates have in him, this is a good look from colleague Ryan Hannable about the confidence level many have in Gostkowski, even though he’s gotten off to arguably the worst start of his professional career. 6. While the Patriots are one of seven or eight teams that aren’t simply crossing days off the calendar and waiting until draft season at this point, it’s never too early to at least start thinking about draft season. The current draft order will change from week to week, but at this point, New England holds the 31st overall selection, one spot from the bottom of the first round. A lot has to play out between now and then — including free agency — but it’s reasonable to speculate that the Patriots would be in the market for some tackle depth, as well as edge rushers and/or linebackers. (As everyone knows, much of their priority list could depend on their ability to re-sign the likes of Dont’a Hightower, Jamie Collins, Jabaal Sheard and perhaps Martellus Bennett, among others.) For what it’s worth, this site has the Patriots going after inside linebacker Raekwon McMillion out of Ohio State. CBS Sports has them chasing Derek Barnett, a defensive end/outside linebacker out of Tennessee. And Walter Football has New England landing Stanford running back/wide receiver Christian McCaffrey out of Stanford at the end of the first round. 7. With all the talk about the future of Jimmy Garoppolo and what he might be able to draw on the open market, the same question could surround the quarterback the Patriots are facing this weekend, Pittsburgh’s Landry Jones. The 27-year-old, who is in the last year of a four-year deal he signed as a rookie, will be able to use Sunday’s game against the Patriots (and however long Roethlisberger will be out) as an audition for the 2017 season. He’s done well in limited action — the third-year backup out of Oklahoma has made two starts as a professional, both in 2015. In his career, the 6-foot-4, 225-pounder is 32-for-56 (57 percent) for 513 yards, three touchdowns, four interceptions and a passer rating of 76. How he performs could also potentially impact the trade value of someone like Garoppolo, if the Patriots do decide to explore those options. Regardless, it certainly adds another layer of intrigue to Sunday’s matchup. 8. I’ve always been a big fan of the work of Chase Stuart, and have utilized his information on several occasions in the past. This week, he produced a look at the strength of schedule left for all 32 NFL teams. The teams that might be in the best situation over the second half? The Titans, Texans, Chiefs, Chargers and Bills, all of who have the easiest schedules the rest of the way. At the other end of the spectrum, there are the Eagles, Redskins, Seahawks, Cowboys and Ravens. Locally, the Patriots are in the middle of the pack with the 16th easiest schedule the rest of the way. 9. When it comes to winners, this week, I’ve picked Green Bay, New York Giants, Kansas City, Tennessee, Minnesota, Cincinnati, Detroit, Oakland, Buffalo, Baltimore, Tampa Bay, Atlanta, New England, Seattle and Denver. Make your picks with us over at the WEEI Pro Football Pick ‘Em Challenge. 10. We’ve got “NFL Sunday” coming your way from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m., getting you prepped for Patriots-Steelers.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley defends newsletter article on ballot measures amid scrutiny Friday Oct 21, 2016 at 10:38 AM Oct 21, 2016 at 10:52 AM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — A half-page article published in the Town of Apple Valley's October-December edition of the “Our Town” newsletter has come under scrutiny for its portrayal of the voter-initiated, Liberty-funded Measure V. In a post on the Flash Report, Sacramento-based political blogger Katy Grimes wrote that the article in the town’s newsletter constitutes an illegal use of taxpayer funds that “undermines” Measure V and advocates for the town-sponsored Measure W. “This newsletter misrepresents and provides the voters of Apple Valley with a false comparison of the Town Council’s Measure W, and the People’s Voter-Approval Measure V,” Grimes wrote. “... While the Newsletter lists a number of alleged ‘public concerns’ regarding the provision of water services to the citizens of Apple Valley, the striking difference between Measures V and W is that the Apple Valley Town Council measure is nothing more than an attempt to undermine the initiative qualified by the 4,000 Apple Valley residents.” Measures V and W are competing measures and are both on the Nov. 8 ballot. Measure V would require voter approval of any project in Apple Valley valued at more than $10 million. Measure W, supported by the Town Council, would require voter approval of any project valued at more than $5 million, except the town's attempted takeover of the water system owned by Liberty Utilities. It also would eliminate the need for a vote as long as the Town Council met four key criteria. Apple Valley resident Pat Hanson, along with her late husband Chuck, submitted more than 5,300 signatures to the town clerk in May, and 3,873 of those signatures — about 12 percent of voters in the town — were found to be valid in June, according to a previous Daily Press report. That percentage has been used by both sides leading up to the election in attempts to sway voters. While proponents of Measure V say that the citizenry has effectively spoken by providing their signatures, Measure W backers reiterate the sentiment of Councilman Larry Cusack: “Only about 12 percent of the town’s voting population signed the petition, and signature gatherers were out there for a long time.” While Grimes argues the “Our Town” article “is neither impartial nor merely informational,” town officials say they were not contacted for comment before the post's publication on Oct. 18. Town spokeswoman Kathie Martin told the Daily Press the town is allowed by state law to provide “neutral, factual information” about the ballot measures. “We are confident the ‘Our Town’ newsletter article meets these standards,” Martin said. Despite the town’s stance, Sacramento-based attorney Thomas Hiltachk — who drafted Measure V — sent a letter to Town Attorney John Brown on Sept. 28 that objected to the “Our Town” publication, which he referred to as a taxpayer-funded “political newsletter.” “Clearly and undeniably,” Hiltachk wrote, “the newsletter content is the Town’s campaign rhetoric without facts critical to a fair and impartial description for voters.” To illustrate that “impartial description,” Hiltachk included in his letter a side-by-side comparison of the legal text in both Measures V and W, saying, “The very essence of the two measures is described completely differently, though the exact same language (Hiltachk’s emphasis) is used in each of the two proposed ordinances.” Hiltachk concluded: “... The expenditures made for this mailing (or at least a portion thereof) are clearly unlawful and fully reportable as a campaign expenditure under the Political Reform Act.” Hiltachk told the Daily Press on Thursday he never received a response from Brown on the letter. Brown did respond, however, to a letter sent earlier in September in which Hiltachk cautioned against what Brown called “the use of public funds for the purpose of educating and informing (town) residents and taxpayers.” In the response letter, Brown said he regularly advises Councilors and town staff on their obligations under California law with regard to public expenditures in relation to elections. “The Town Council is very familiar with the general rule against advocacy outlined in your letter,” Brown wrote. “Although not mentioned in your letter, I know that you are very familiar with the Town’s right to continue expending public resources on informational activities which fairly present the facts.” Brown added that the town “has very different opinions about these initiative measures.” “Most importantly,” he wrote, “what you characterize as a citizen initiative measure has been publicly acknowledged to have been funded by Liberty Utilities ... In accordance with the Town’s long-standing practice of community outreach, I anticipate the Town will continue to provide its public with information on these initiative measures which I am sure you would agree could have profound consequences for the residents and taxpayers of the Town of Apple Valley.” Brown’s letter is dated Sept. 8. The “Our Town” newsletter was released on Sept. 16, according to town spokeswoman Charlene Engeron, and included in mailboxes over the next few days. Engeron said every residential address receives the newsletter. On Thursday, Fair Political Practices Commission spokesman Jay Wierenga said the commission would not “comment on or get involved in an election in terms of weighing in on whether something is or isn’t in violation,” but he provided the “Do’s & Don’ts” on campaign-related communications at public expense from the FPPC website. While there are certain instances when it may be appropriate for a government agency to issue communications related to a campaign, there are prohibitions against mass public mailings, including those that are campaign related, according to the FPPC. “The determination of whether a communication ‘expressly advocates’ is relatively straightforward,” the FPPC web page shows, “and is based on whether it contains so called ‘magic words.’” Examples of those words include: “Vote For,” “Elect,” “Support,” “Cast Your Ballot,” “Vote Against,” “Defeat,” “Reject,” or “Sign Petitions For,” according to the FPPC. The document continues: “A mailing ‘unambiguously urges a particular result in an election’ if it: (1) can be reasonably characterized as campaign material or activity, and (2) is not a fair presentation of facts serving only an informational purpose when taking into account the style, tenor, and timing of the communication.” Meanwhile, Hiltachk said the town's newsletter is not only in violation of the Political Reform Act, but “it's actually a violation of our state constitution, which contemplates the government staying out of politics.” “There’s a whole range of legal options available to the taxpayers,” Hiltachk said. “I won’t say this is unique to the Town of Apple Valley. It’s come up before. That’s why we have rules about it. But it’s really up to the people of Apple Valley to decide what they want to do about it. It's their money.” Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254. Follow him on Twitter @DP_MatthewCabe.

It burned furniture, floors, cars and even a house,” Zach Epstein reports for BGR. “The phone has officially been recalled and discontinued, with Samsung warning all owners that they should power down the device immediately and return it to a local retailer at once,” Epstein reports. “There has never been a more serious problem with a smartphone in the history of the industry, and yet many people refuse to turn in their handsets and insist on putting themselves and those around them at risk.” Epstein reports, “More than 1 million people have yet to return their potentially dangerous Galaxy Note 7 phones, according to [Korea JoongAng Daily]’s sources.” Read more in the full article here.

Apple investigating car fire caused by its latest flagship It looks like the year of exploding smartphones. Sami Khan   October 21, 2016 21:14 IST 10 Shares 10 Shares Apple iPhone 7 catches fireReuters Samsung suffered a multi-billion-dollar loss due to the Galaxy Note 7's explosion fiasco. But it seems its biggest rival Apple is falling on the same lines. Following a recent report of an iPhone 7 Plus catching fire, Apple has been hit by another incident involving an iPhone 7 being the cause of a car fire. According to 7 News, a south coast surfer identified as Mat Jones found his car filled with smoke after his one-week-old iPhone 7 ignited and damaged his car. Why advertise with us? Related Samsung Galaxy Note 7 explosion: Samsung's loss is potentially Apple's gain Galaxy Note 7: AirAsia joins other carriers to ban Samsung smartphone "Ash was just coming from inside the pants which then, once you unwrapped the pants, the phone was just melting inside of it," Jones told 7 News. Jones said that he never dropped his new iPhone nor he used a third-party, unauthorised charger, which may have caused the malfunction. According to Tech First Post, Apple is aware of the incident and it is investigating the cause of the phone's ignition. Samsung Galaxy Note 7 explosions have put mobile users on the edge. The South Korean tech giant issued a formal statement to switch off the phones and recalled all units of the much-hyped flagship. The extent of the Galaxy Note 7 was so huge that the devices were banned from airplanes. It is too soon to tell if Apple's latest flagships, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, are at similar risk, but if the reports continue to pour in then Apple would need to consider a thorough check-up. As of this moment, the iPhone 7 series hasn't reached to the level where the company must recall its units, which would not only harm the business, but also tarnish Apple's reputation.

Comments Computerworld | Oct 21, 2016 8:17 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Apple Mac Operating Systems Windows PCs Apple MacBook Pro Comments The word “hello” means something in the Apple universe. It was the first word on the first Mac, the first word on the iMac, and was part of the company’s WWDC invitation, where it announced adoption of the name “macOS” to replace OS X. Now it is the buzz word on its invitation to the latest news from the company. Hello to what? That Apple is saying “Hello” must be significant, especially with some Mac models having seen no upgrade for almost three years (1,000 days). We won’t know how significant until next week, but with claims it plans to enhance touch in Macs with is new ‘Magic Keyboard’ and ‘Magic Touchbar’ and reports claiming the A10 series processor used inside current iPhones is equally as powerful as a low end MacBook (and the A10X easily competes), there are plenty of tongues turning speculation of all types. There is even renewed speculation about what kind of processor the company wants to adopt and whether it will dump the audio jack from Macs. “Star of the show looks set to be a major revamp of the MacBook Pro line-up, with an OLED touch-bar replacing physical function keys,” writes 9-5Mac. “Also rumored to see a refresh is the 13-inch MacBook Air,” says AppleInsider. ABOVE: Does anyone remember Apple's big iPhone hello in 2007? Inflection point We’ve reached a critical point. IBM this week told us all that Macs are a much better deal for enterprise deployments than Windows PCs, and while some enterprise users may delay upgrading to Apple’s superior technology for a while, the move to standards-compliant, platform-agnostic cloud services is mandatory and means the technology lock-ins that once blocked Mac adoption are rapidly disappearing among those enterprises that hope to remain in business in five years time. (Though some resistance will emerge from incumbents in the tech support teams). The time is now and Apple knows it has a huge opportunity and is trying to embrace it. The impact of mobile on its market is also clear. The move to adopt iOS among enterprise users could become a stalking horse for Mac sales in the sector. What can Apple do to its platforms to entice enterprise purchasers to climb aboard the Mac? One thing that makes a lot of sense is to make it as easy to manage Macs in the enterprise as it is to manage an iPhone, and solutions to achieve this are now available from Jamf. Coming soon Apple is not about to give the rest of the PC industry an easy ride. The three-year wait to launch new Macs will turn out not to have been based on any lack of interest in a platform. Think about it: has Apple not updated the OS each year? Has its move to adopt modern languages and to strip the OS (again) of legacy code escaped your notice? Does its determination to adopt a new filing system in the next 12-months mean nothing? Think a little and it seems highly probable the wait has been by design, presumably while the Mac manufacturer developed a range of new technologies – such as the Magic Touchstrip – that it can then safely manufacture in the kind of quantities it takes to bring these to the mass-market. If this is true (and I think it is) then speculation of all kinds is completely reasonable and some or all of the most way out rumors may turn out top be a little truer than we originally thought. That could mean new processors, new iPad/Mac hybrids and radical redesigns (is it time the Mac Pro became the hideously powerful A10X Cube, for example?) Might Apple choose to retire the hardware completely in favor of macOS support on mobile devices? (No). I'm not expecting changes as big as these -- yet -- but never say never with Cupertino. Whatever the company does it will do in full knowledge that: The future is now Following a long break Apple is going to be eager to tell Mac users and the wider PC industry what it sees as the future of the ailing PC market. I do think some of the new Macs it tells us about won’t ship until next year. I also expect the critics to continue their sad and lonely existences inside their tiny reality distortion field bubbles, peddling pusillanimous and predictable criticism of whatever it is the company does announce. All the same, I do not expect Apple’s news will be trivial. The company will webcast its announcement starting at 10 a.m. PT (1 p.m. ET) on October 27. I’ll keep you posted during the event. Google+?

Updated October 21, 2016 9:39AM SHARE ALSO SEE Amazon Amazon Echo Streaming Music Fire TV Amazon Prime Alexa Apple TV Netflix Hulu Amazon's own video store will no longer have the starring role on the company's Fire TV streaming devices. Software updates coming this year will give movies and TV shows from Netflix, HBO and other competitors equal prominence on the devices' home screen. The approach is similar to one Apple took when it refreshed its Apple TV device last year. Amazon's Fire TV has offered solid performance at reasonable prices, but its home screen has been cluttered with Amazon products -- whether to rent or buy, or offered at no extra charge through Amazon's $99-a-year Prime program. That's made it tough to find video from competing providers without turning to a voice-search feature that, until recently, excluded Netflix. For the most part, finding video typically required opening a service's app first. Now, competing services will be offered space on the home screen. Netflix, for instance, could choose to highlight its original series "Stranger Things" alongside personalized recommendations. Netflix can also include a short video trailer that plays on the home screen. And while Amazon has long had a watch list for viewers to keep track of what they want to watch, choosing a title has directed the viewer back to Amazon's store. Now, Amazon will offer viewers a choice of providers. If a video is available for free through Netflix, for instance, that will be the most prominent option, even if Amazon's own store is selling the same title. The development comes as leading video services make major investments in original shows, making it difficult for any single service to fulfill all of a viewer's needs. An Amazon-centric approach winds up penalizing viewers looking for not just Amazon's "Transparent" but also Netflix's "Luke Cage" and Hulu's "The Mindy Project." The refreshed Fire TV Stick, which begins shipping Thursday for $40, will get the free software update first, followed by the standard $100 Fire TV device released last year. Both will get the updates by the end of the year. Amazon says older devices will get the updates, too, but no timetable was given. © 2016 Associated Press syndicated under contract with NewsEdge.

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech Reviews Titan Juxt Pro review: There is nothing smart about this watch Titan Juxt Pro review: There is nothing smart about this watch The biggest thing favouring Titan is its watchmaker tag but can it hold its ground against Android Wear, Tizen and now cheaper Apple Watch? Read on to find out Rating: 2.5 out of 5 Written by Karthekayan Iyer | Updated: November 10, 2016 3:06 pm Titan Juxt Pro is the second smartwatch from India’s leading traditional watch maker For wearables as an industry, September was a really constructive month. Fitbit unveiled Charge 2, the successor to best selling Charge HR fitness tracker. Samsung then upped the ante with two new Tizen powered Gear S3 smartwatch while Apple re-engineered its Watch with new fitness tracking and swimproof body. There has never been a better time to buy a new wearable. On the other hand, Android brigade is playing down the hype until the release of Android Wear 2.0 while traditional watchmakers continue joining search giant’s wearable platform. Tag Heuer, Michael Kors, Fossil have their own smartwatch running Android Wear. In India, Titan is reimagining traditional watches into smart wearable. Titan Juxt Pro Early this year, Titan surprised the watch industry with its HP collaboration to create an analog smartwatch. The onus with that watch was on the word analog, enough to tempt a watch buyer or watch collector away from a regular watch. At Rs 15,990, Titan also made sure the price was justified. Six months later, Titan is going the exact opposite way with its next smartwatch. Titan Juxt Pro is not made in collaboration with HP but takes cues from Android and Tizen counterparts for a real smartwatch. It has digital display in place of analog dial and the mechanical movement of watch hands are replaced by digital ones. The biggest thing favouring Titan is its watchmaker tag but can it hold its ground against Android Wear, Tizen and now cheaper Apple Watch?

At maximum brightness, it becomes extremely bright and at minimum, there is barely anything to see If there is one thing to like about this watch then it has to be its build quality. This watch is built like a tank but that also translates into bulky dimensions. There is elaborate use of stainless steel infused with plastic, which gives it a distinguishing look in the overly crowded smartwatch market. Another thing to like about the watch is its strap. Our review unit came with a black leather strap which is one of the finest I have ever wrapped around my wrist. The leather feels nice to touch and even endured the sweat glands. Since Titan Juxt Pro is a smartwatch and not analog smartwatch like it’s predecessor, the display used here is top notch. At maximum brightness, it becomes extremely bright and at minimum, there is barely anything to see – so setting a medium brightness worked for me most of the time. If your basic needs are knowing your step count from a Titan watch – Juxt Pro does quantify that need well. Titan Juxt Pro tracks steps, and count calories. Most trackers come close to being accurate but it’s very difficult to get the perfect reading. Titan Juxt Pro is definitely not accurate but it came very close to the reading I found on my other fitness tracker. If your basic needs are knowing your step count from a Titan watch – Juxt Pro does quantify that need well. What is not good? Tt’s almost impossible to wear the bulky Titan Juxt Pro and take a nap. I tried wearing the watch during sleep and often found it irritating or being cautious about that hefty watch on my wrist in the middle of the sleep. For comparison, Withings’ Activate Steel is super light and you don’t really feel like you are wearing one. The biggest problem with Titan Juxt Pro’s software is the sync time and gesture UI. Titan collaborated with HP for the software of its first smartwatch and this time, it has gone solo with its efforts. Titan Juxt Pro’s neat software elements like converter and phone finder are quite useful but the entire experience pales in front of the competition. For Rs 22,999, I expect a software that goes beyond the watch – which is exactly the promise of Android Wear 2.0 – coming to many smartwatches later this year. Titan Juxt Pro’s software is designed to be like Android but fails to do so. The biggest problem with Titan Juxt Pro’s software is the sync time and gesture UI. I found the app taking forever to sync with the watch to get the data and the UI lagged to reproduce my actions. I found the swipe up and swipe down gestures work but they are slow. The software seems to be in beta but without that label. After using Titan Juxt Pro for nearly three weeks, I found the battery to last one day for my brightness setting An important metric while getting a smartwatch or fitness tracker has to be battery life. After using Titan Juxt Pro for nearly three weeks, I found the battery to last one day for my brightness setting. There were days when the battery died in the middle of the night and failed to track sleep. Should you buy? The answer is a straight no. If you are using an iOS device then go ahead and buy the first generation Apple Watch and for Android users, Huawei Watch is definitely the best option right now. If you are serious about fitness, then look at Fitbit Blaze or Garmin’s Forerunner. For the time being, I would advise waiting for the next Titan smartwatch or getting one of the above mentioned gadgets. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaChill sets in early: Oppn moves to corner Govt, PM Modi hits back, says his decision troubles them IndiaKadak like my chai, rich don’t like it: PM Modi on demonetisation IndiaNo regrets, but govt addressing inconvenience, says Venkaiah Naidu IndiaPakistan says seven of its troops killed in Indian fire at LoC IndiaPanama Papers: 415 Indians under scanner as probe widens EntertainmentIn Bigg Boss 10, Bani is the most selfish contestant: Navin Prakash opens up after eviction EntertainmentKoffee With Karan 5: Twinkle Khanna's shocking revelations on the KJo's show EntertainmentITA Awards 2016: Mouni Roy, Shabbir Ahluwalia emerge big winners, see pics, video EntertainmentSalman Khan is spoiling nephew Ahil and Arpita Khan Sharma has proof, see pics Must Read SportsIndia vs England: Slow to adopt, now learning on the job SportsBCCI gets Lodha approval to pay Rajasthan players SportsRanji Trophy 2016: More brain than brawn TechnologyDemonetisation: Now, a tool to find ATMs with money across India TechnologySamsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8 model numbers leaked TechnologyDemonetisation effect: Here's how to sign-up for Paytm, Mobikwik and use the e-wallets  Guru Nanak Jayanti 2016: India celebrates Gurpurab with great fanfare Nov 15: Latest News Punjabis react to Trump’s decision to deport illegal immigrants: ‘May affect economy, hit unscrupulous travel agents’ Securities and Exchange Commission Chair leaving at end of Obama administration INLD hits out at Congress, BJP for ‘doublespeak’ Punjab, Haryana should resolve SYL issue amicably: BJP union minister Narendra Singh Tomar Ahead of special session, Speaker Charanjit Singh Atwal yet to accept Cong MLAs’ resignation Karthekayan IyerEngineer by training, tech journalist by passion.... read more Dell Inspiron 11 Review: The fun Windows 10 notebook Titan Juxt Pro review: There is nothing smart about this watch Offline will be a gamechanger, exploring space keenly: LeEco India head                           The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

Tuesday 15 Nov 2016 / Tehran - 03:59 / GMT - 00:29 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories Technology Fri Oct 21, 2016 1:24 iPhone 7s with Intel Modems Struggle Badly in Low-Signal Areas Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- Apple has a reputation for tight supply chain management and demanding rigorous quality control, but the company may have a modem problem on its hands. Previously, Apple has tapped both Samsung and TSMC to build its SoCs, but stuck with the same Qualcomm modem for all its hardware. With the iPhone 7, Apple adopted an Intel modem for its AT&T and T-Mobile variants, while the factory-unlocked devices, Sprint, and Verizon hardware all use Qualcomm’s modem silicon (MDM9645M if you want to get technical). According to an analysis performed by Cellular Insights, both devices perform equally well if you have a strong signal, but the Intel modem (XMM7360, pictured at top) drops off significantly as signal strength weakens. Cellular Insights tested multiple LTE bands (Band 4, 7, and 12) in a 4×2 MIMO configuration. The graph here is from Band 4, which Cellular Insights describes as the most common band for North America LTE deployments. RSRP is a measure of LTE signal strength and is expected to range from ~-75dBm when measured directly on top of a cellular base site to -120dBm at the edge of coverage. What we see here is that the Intel modem can’t sustain the same throughput as the Qualcomm device, particularly at the -105dBm threshold. At -115dBm, the gap between the Intel and Qualcomm modems is roughly 2x — meaning the Qualcomm device is sustaining about twice the network throughput on the same signal strength. Cellular Insights also compared the two devices against the Galaxy S7 Edge, the iPhone 6s, the LG G5, and the Nexus 5X. First of all, kudos to Samsung; the S7 Edge does extremely well in all cases. The Intel XMM7360, in contrast, is the worst overall performer of the lot — though the 6s doesn’t exactly distinguish itself well, either. That might explain why Apple was willing to work with Intel in the first place, but the Intel XMM7360 doesn’t keep up with Qualcomm’s MDM9645M. It would be interesting to see a battery life comparison between Intel and Qualcomm devices and it’s possible that Apple could improve the Intel modem’s performance via a software update. If you really care about LTE performance on an iPhone or live in an area with marginal LTE coverage, the factory-unlocked version of the device is definitely your best bet — right now, the Intel modem isn’t performing where it ought to be. Winning the iPhone 7 was a huge victory for Intel’s beleaguered modem division, but that victory was predicated on the idea that the Intel and Qualcomm modems would offer equal performance. So far, that doesn’t seem to be the case. It’s not clear how much this impacts the iPhone 7’s range, network timeouts, or other issues that might arise in areas where cellular connectivity is weak, but the general implication is that the Qualcomm modem offers better performance and possibly better range when operating in low-signal areas.         LATEST STORIES (4) Aerial Footage Shows Syrian Army Advances in Southwestern Damascus Syrian Army Missile Hits Militants' Gathering in Southern Aleppo Hashd Al-Shaabi Kicks Off 3rd Phase of Military Operations West of Mosul Anti-Trump Protests Continue across US Cities Spokesman: Iran's Missile Power Not Negotiable Tasting Justice: ISIL Being Driven Away in Iraq and Syria Iran, Russia Stress Boosting Mutual Cooperation Spokesman: AEOI Not Concerned About Trump Aides' Remarks Hashd Al-Shaabi Rescues 300 Sunni Families Battle for Mosul Day 28: Hashd Al-Sha'abi Kicks Off 3rd Phase of Mosul Operation Russia, Iran Plan $10bln Arms Deal Report: Russian Strategic Bombers Prepare to Strike Terrorists in Syria Samples Taken in Syria's Aleppo Prove Militants Used Chlorine Gas Syria: Jeish Al-Fatah Declares State of Emergency in Aleppo Iran Urges Unity Among Muslim Nations Aerial Footage Shows Syrian Army Advances in Southwestern Damascus TEHRAN (FNA)- The Syrian army troops continued to hit the terrorist groups' defense lines and gatherings and seized back new regions in Western Ghouta, tightening the siege of the militant-held town of Khan al-Sheih.

By Alicia Adejobi October 21, 2016 10:19 BST Lady Gaga's Joanne soared to number one on iTunes in at least 18 countries just hours after release on 21 OctoberInterscope Lady Gaga has hit the ground running with her new album, Joanne, which has debuted at number one worldwide on the iTunes chart. The 11-track album, which was released on 21 October, features Gaga's latest single Perfect Illusion and also a song written in tribute to Trayvon Martin, the African-American teen shot and killed by George Zimmerman in 2012. With Gaga's fan base, known as Little Monsters, forced to wait three years to hear fresh music from the pop star, it is no surprise that Joanne topped the charts in at least 18 countries within hours of release. Joanne is available to buy on Apple Music and stream on services such as Spotify. Joanne reached number one in the US, UK, Brazil, Canada, Italy, Australia and India, while it reached number two in South Africa, Japan and Norway. The record has received glowing reviews from fans, including Arrow actor Colton Haynes, who tweeted: "Honestly, @ladygaga 's new album #Joanne is easily my favorite album of the year & I just listened to it. So heartfelt/raw. So happy for her." The album sees Gaga, 30, address the police brutality and gun control issue in the US with the song Angel Down dedicated particularly to Trayvon Martin. Martin, 18, was unarmed at the time he got into an altercation with neighbourhood watch member George Zimmerman, who gunned the youngster down. Explaining her decision to dedicate the song to Martin, Gaga told Zane Lowe on Apple's Beats 1 radio show: "I was overwhelmed by the fact that people just stood around and didn't do anything about it, and that the justice system continues to, over and over again, not seek justice for these families." She added of African-American men: "They tell me they drive in their cars, and if they hear a siren, there is a paranoia that runs through their body, that they freeze up, that they can't think. This is a tremendous anxiety. This is something that I care about. This is something that has to stop, something that we all need to heal from. How can I not say something? How could I possibly make an album about twerking my a*s in the club?... In my mind, I can't reckon it. It feels empty. It feels irrelevant." Angel Down lyrics include: "Doesn't everyone belong in the arms of the sacred/ Why do we pretend we're wrong has our young courage faded / Shots were fired down the street by the church where we used to meet/ Angel down, angel down, why do people just stand around?" Gaga has also responded to the long-running comparisons between herself and queen of pop Madonna. Listing the differences she sees between the two, the Bad Romance singer told Lowe: "Madonna and I are very different. Just saying. We're very different. I wouldn't make that comparison at all and I don't mean to disrespect Madonna, she's a nice lady, and she's had a fantastic huge career, biggest pop star of all time. Lady Gaga will bring her Joanne album songs to the Super Bowl in 2017Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images "I play a lot of instruments. I write all my own music. I spend hours and hours a day in the studio. I'm a producer. I'm a writer. What I do is different. There is spontaneity to my work. I allow myself to fail. I allow myself to break. I'm not afraid of my flaws." Clearly annoyed by Lowe's analysis that Gaga and Madonna, 58, have similar relationships with their fathers, the pop star continued: "I don't mean that in a disrespectful way.

Services Web App Development JavaScript Support Workshops Blog About Us Contact Login Hub Login Support Login PhoneGap, Palm Pre, and the State of Mobile Apps By Jason Cline on January 12, 2009 11:24 pm With their announcement of the Pre last week, Palm has placed their bet that great mobile applications can be built using the same open web technologies that drive the desktop environment today. Web applications that run on modern desktop browsers are constantly pushing the envelope of the types of applications that no longer require a proprietary platform-specific SDK. When Apple first launched the iPhone in 2007 their first answer to developers was similar to Palm’s new OS. Apple gave a long talks at its 2007 Worldwide Developers Conference about how you can build great applications using standard web technologies. Unlike Palm’s webOS the iPhone web SDK was severely lacking in many areas. Apple has corrected some of these shortcomings in the subsequent releases of their mobile browser. Mobile Safari now supports multi-touch gestures, basic rotation tracking, and hardware accelerated CSS animations. Unfortunately, Apple’s open web SDK still lacks many of the most critical features that would allow developers to build applications that take full advantage of the mobile environment. By contrast, Palm’s webOS appears to treat web applications as first class citizens by providing direct access to the GPS location, acceleration, camera, and messaging functions of the phone. Adding these features to your existing mobile-ready web application should be trivial once Palm releases its SDK to the public. If you want to attempt the same feat on the iPhone, you have to download the 1.5GB iPhone SDK, learn Objective-C, and rewrite your application using Xcode. And if you want to test your app on real hardware you have to pay Apple a licensing fee of $99 (or $299 for enterprise development) and wait for approval. Google’s Android platform had taken a similar, but more open, approach to application development. They have an excellent WebKit-based web browser that has the same sandbox limitations as the iPhone. They have a proprietary native SDK based on the Java SDK which makes it accessible to a wider group of developers than Apple’s SDK, but it still requires web application developers to rewrite their application and display logic in yet another proprietary environment. Where Apple has failed to provide easy solutions for web developers, others have stepped in to fill the gap. The appropriately named PhoneGap project aims to make it easier for web developers to create native applications while still using their existing web development expertise. The project is attempting to create a single JavaScript API for use on the Android and Blackberry platforms as well as the iPhone. PhoneGap does this by creating a skeleton application using the native API for each target platform. The application creates a mobile browser that lacks the usual browser chrome and loads a remote url into the browser or displays a web page that is embedded in the application itself. PhoneGap injects a JavaScript API into the browser that gives the web application access to the native functions on the phone. Currently, the PhoneGap project provides access to the phone’s location, camera, accelerometer, and vibration functions. PhoneGap also supports offline web applications by allowing the application’s HTML and JavaScript to be loaded from local resources stored on the phone. This feature allows for much more JavaScript code to be loaded than would normally be feasible in a mobile web application. The existing SQLite database built into WebKit give the application the ability to download and store data locally and increases application performance and allows access to data when network coverage is spotty. Although it is incredibly powerful, PhoneGap is far from a perfect solution. PhoneGap builds native applications that must be dowloaded through either Apple’s App Store or Google’s Android Market. With this approach, you lose the benefit of a zero-install web application; however, it can also a great way to distribute and sell mobile apps. Palm has yet to release many details about how their applications are build and deployed. We will have to wait and see if Palm can improve upon this process when they release their SDK. If the Pre proves to be successful and popular with developers perhaps we will see similar functionality for web applications from Apple and Google in the near future. Windows Mobile, by comparison, has seen little innovation since the iPhone’s release. Rumor has it that Microsoft’s mobile operating system may be getting a major refresh soon. Will Microsoft follow the lead of Palm, Google, and Apple and create a first class platform for mobile web development? Native mobile application development can be difficult and costly, especially when attempting to support multiple platforms. Palm is attempting to reinvent itself with the Pre and looks to be creating a truly innovative environment for mobile application development. For those developers who already have major investments in their desktop web applications, the idea of reusing that code base is compelling. Time-to-market and ROI have to be considered when deciding to support the mobile environment. Using open web technologies that reuse existing application code and in-house developer experience could save considerable time and money for anyone looking to expand their product offering into the mobile environment. ajax Dojo mobile ShareTweet this articlePost this article to FacebookShare this article on Google+ Shane O’Sullivan What almost all articles comparing the iPhone and Pre development models seem to leave out is that, to develop for the iPhone, you need a Mac!! For the 95% of people who use Windows or Linux, this is a massive blocker. I’d love to write some iPhone apps, and even have nothing against downloading the iPhone SDK and learning Objective-C. But dropping over a thousand euros just to play around and see if I can come up with something interesting? Not going to happen. So, congrats to Palm. Another small thing to note is that it seems that Palm’s Mojo framework for the Pre is based on Dojo, which is always nice :-) Ken Law We have just launched a product called MotherApp (http://motherapp.com/) that allows people to create iPhone apps without learning Objective-C or even owning a Mac. Just create a website based on MotherApp HTML specification. Then, MotherApp is a converter that takes your website as input and generates the native iPhone app as output. Finally, we will then send you the native app through email. Instead of creating an app by embedding a web browser inside, MotherApp actually builds the app using the iPhone SDK. This means: – Professional UI: All the UI widgets (such as buttons, tabs) are based on the iPhone SDK instead of emulated by web techniques. – Camera: Use camera to upload images to server. – Cache: Use cache to improve the performance and allow people to use the app offline. Our product is still very new and your comments are most welcome. Steven If they offer a custom API to access the phone features, they aren’t really using web technologies any more, are they? HTML means “write once, run anywhere!”. Using advanced CSS, SVG, and HTML5 database API a lot can be done with current web technologies. Sadly, hardware-specific features will always require some sort of … hack. It would be nice if there was a nice, standard way to request the user’s location – much like the iPhone’s “XYZ wants to use your location” feature of their native apps. Dylan @Steven: the only way to really get effective standards is to have something to standardize on. Let them experiment and extend this round, and then standardize in a year or two after they’ve figured out what works and makes sense. I imagine this argument (lack of standards) is why Apple has not exposed these features, but I’d rather see extensions that can later be standardized, than no option at all. HM Sathish Good and valuable information. Mobile app development is not an easy task, there are many mobile app development companies are doing itself perfectly. Here in India we are on of them.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 21 October 2016 | MYT 3:38 PM Apple Watch Series 2: Getting better all the time by tan kit hoong Better, faster: A dual-core processor and the addition of GPS makes the Apple Watch Series 2 much better than before.— Photos: TAN KIT HOONG/The Star Version 2 of any product is always the one to go for, or so they say, especially when it comes to technology. Such is the case with the latest incarnation of the Apple Watch, now called the Apple Watch Series 2 – although the changes are modest, they do make the watch a whole lot more useful than the first version. This time, Apple has kept the design mostly the same – in fact, at first glance you’d probably not be able to tell it apart from the original Apple Watch. However, there are changes, and it’s mostly on the inside. The 38mm Apple Watch Series 2 looks the same and uses the same straps despite being a hair thicker than the original. Watch me Although the aesthetic design of the Apple Watch Series 2 is the same as the original Apple Watch and even accepts the same straps as before, there are actually a couple of differences if you look closely. For one thing, the watch is 0.9mm thicker than the original – it’s a minimal difference and you really can’t tell unless you put the original right next to new one. The other difference is that there is an additional hole on the side of the Series 2 – apparently, the new improved waterproofing requires one additional opening so that the barometric sensor can work properly. Yes, that’s right, in case you don’t already know, Apple has improved the waterproofing on the Series 2 and now instead of being splashproof like the original model, it’s now water-resistant down to 50 metres, so you really can take it swimming. For the Series 2, Apple has retained the three different variants – namely the aluminium and ion-X glass model, the stainless steel and sapphire crystal model and the luxury Apple Watch Edition which now features a ceramic case and sapphire crystal instead of the solid gold from the first generation. Apart from the price (the ceramic one costs a whopping RM5,699), the different models feature the same 50m water resistance no matter what material – interestingly the aluminium model, which used to feature a composite back (a fancy word for plastic), has now got the same scratch-resistant ceramic back as the other more expensive models. The ceramic back which houses the heart rate sensor is now standard on all models. The one we got is the black stainless steel and sapphire crystal model with a black sports band – I personally still think a watch is more likely to get banged up and scratched than a smartphone is (especially when you stick your hand through the gate and accidentally knock it) so having the added scratch-resistance of the sapphire crystal is always welcome. More importantly, though, inside is where you’ll find all the most significant changes to the Series 2 – the watch now features a dual-core S2 processor, a slightly bigger battery and a GPS chipset. The GPS chipset is used to track your outdoor sport activities like swimming or running and have it more accurately track your distance and speed traveled while also using the data to overlay your track on a map in the Activity app. Yes, if you carried your iPhone around with you, it would also have recorded your location using the iPhone’s GPS, but now you can at least leave your phone at home and still have the advantage of accurate location tracking. Talking about GPS, Apple automatically turns it on during specific activities only and you have no option to control or to manually turn it on. On the upside, the GPS starts up much faster than any GPS sports tracker I’ve ever tried – apparently, the watch periodically downloads GPS satellite data from your iPhone and stores that information in the watch so that it can achieve a location lock as fast as possible whenever you start an activity. The speaker enclosure expels water by producing a beeping sound when you unlock the Series 2 after a swim. Waterproofing Thanks to the new waterproofing measures, Apple has added pool swimming and open water swimming to the list of activities it can track – in case you're wondering, the GPS isn’t used for pool swims but it is on for open water swimming, although it can only accurately track you when your arm is above water. One thing Apple has done for the pool swim option is to let you enter the length of the pool so it can use the accelerometer to track your calorie burn. Since water interferes with the touchscreen, when you engage pool swim or open water swimming, the screen is also locked – you unlock the screen by turning the digital crown. You can also lock the screen manually by swiping up on the main watch screen to bring up Control Centre and tapping the little water droplet icon – useful if you’re say, running in the rain and want to prevent accidentally activating the screen. Unlocking the screen when in screen lock mode also does something quite interesting – it makes the watch beep loudly a few times. This loud beeping vibrates the speaker and expels water from the speaker enclosure – if you have a lot of water in there, you really can see it being expelled when you turn the Digital Crown. Oh yes, the OLED screen on the Series 2 is two times brighter than on the original Apple Watch – you probably won’t notice it indoors, since the watch automatically adjusts brightness, but outside in bright sunlight, it’s actually a little more readable. watchOS 3.0 offers more watch faces, like this cool one that shows your activity rings, integrated into an analogue display. Battery life and performance Thanks to the slightly larger casing, Apple has managed to fit in a slightly larger battery into the Apple Watch Series 2 as well. While it’s probably meant to compensate for the increased power draw from the GPS chipset, it also seems to increase battery life slightly for day to day use – I’ve noticed that at the end of the day I’d end up with about 20% more battery life left than with the original Apple Watch. On the 38mm version, this extra battery life will probably take you quite easily to about 1.5 days without charging or just barely till evening of the second day if you don’t engage the sport activity tracking at all. The 42mm will probably do much better since it has an even bigger battery. What you'll notice however, is that with the new dual-core S2 processor, apps are actually a lot snappier, especially when starting up certain apps and when doing dictation using Siri. WatchOS 3.0 No review would be complete without some mention of watchOS 3.0, since I think it’s actually a very significant part of the whole Apple Watch experience. Not only does installing watchOS 3.0 significantly improve the speed of launching apps on the original Apple Watch, but there are a number of enhancements that make the Apple Watch in general a much better smartwatch. For one thing, Apple has finally added a way to input text by directly writing on the screen with your finger with the Scribble option. Before watchOS 3.0, the only way you could input text was to have Siri transcribe your voice – while transcription was actually surprisingly good, if you use any special words or colloquialisms it will struggle to transcribe what you’ve just said. In fact, before watchOS 3.0 I had learned to speak in short, clear sentences if I wanted the Apple Watch to transcribe my speech but finally, with the Scribble option, I can now write out exactly what I want to say. The other significant change that watchOS 3.0 introduces is the Dock – you can now store up to 10 apps in the Dock so they launch faster and can be accessed quicker. To get to the Dock, Apple has repurposed the side button (formerly used to bring up a quick contact list) to show you a scrollable list of apps resident in the Dock. If you're interested in more watchOS 3.0 tips, check out our story here. Final word I’m one of the early converts to a smartwatch and besides the Apple Watch I’ve also owned various smart activity trackers before that. Sure, a device like the Apple Watch doesn’t do much beyond what your smartphone already does, but believe me, it’s a lot more useful than you think to just lift your wrist during a run to check and respond to messages and other notifications. With the Apple Watch Series 2, Apple has made the activity tracking parts even better by adding GPS and beefed up the water resistance so it’s now a very competent device to track your calorie burn when engaging in sporting activities. At the same time, though, there’s little that has changed that justifies upgrading to the Series 2 if you already have the original Apple Watch, especially since you already get many of the benefits by upgrading the Apple Watch to watchOS 3.0. If you haven’t already got one though, then the Series 2 is worth a serious look – if you're an iPhone user, Apple's combination of hardware and software improvements in the Apple Watch Series 2 means it's hard to beat, except maybe in price. Pros: Brighter screen; better battery life; GPS built in; watchOS 3.0 Cons: Battery life could be better.

By Alistair Charlton October 21, 2016 09:43 BST Apple executive Eddy Cue says current TV interfaces are 'brain dead'Reuters Just when we thought the rumours of Apple making a television has finally been laid to rest, company executive Eddy Cue believes TV needs to be "reinvented". Head of Apple's internet software and sales division, Cue also leads the company's television efforts with the Apple TV set-top box. His comments come after years of speculation and rumours that Apple was planning to produce a television; with regard to how the system would work, the late Steve Jobs said he had "cracked it" shortly before his death in 2011. During an interview at Vanity Fair's annual New Establishment Summit, Cue said: "I do think television needs to be reinvented. Today, you live with a glorified VCR. The problem is the interface," reports Business Insider. Echoing thoughts held by Jobs, Cue added: "It's really hard to use [a cable or satellite TV service]. Setting something to record, if you didn't watch something last night, if you didn't set it to record, it's hard to find, it may not be available. There may be some rights issues." Cue sees a future where viewers decide what they want to watch and the TV service finds it for them. Instead of searching through channels and subscribing to the right service or package, the content is just there on an a-la-carte basis. "It's great to be able to tell you device 'I want to watch the Duke basketball game, I don't care what channel it's on'... Today you got to bring in the TV, go through the guide, find which sports programmes or whatever – it's just hard to do." The senior vice president added: "The problem is the interface. The ways you interact with it are pretty brain dead." Apple has been in discussions with TV content producers since at least 2009, but has struggled to come to an agreement with enough of them to make a service worthwhile to consumers. The company sees a future where every programme, series and sports fixture is available to everyone through a single user interface, but complex rights agreements currently make this impossible. But Cue sees the situation gradually improving every year as rights holders become less protective over their content. "It's moving rapidly... Look, it's going to get better every year." Rumours that Apple is building its own television have all but disappeared, but only after the well-known analyst Gene Munster claimed the new product was happening in 2011, early 2012, late 2012, twice in 2013 and again in 2014. The Apple TV set-top box was being sold (and improved upon) throughout this time, but the mythical television never arrived. In 2015 Munster finally accepted defeat, saying: "It's hard to accept the reality of no Apple television."

Yeah, they're fake By Vlad Dudau News Editor Neowin LLC @avladd · Oct 21, 2016 with 24 comments Apple is warning users about buying counterfeit merchandise on Amazon. The company is also suing one of the big suppliers that was presenting its hardware as “original” or “genuine”, which was then sold by Amazon itself. According to documents from the suit, posted by Patently Apple, the Cupertino-based company has been ordering and testing hundreds of Lightning cables and chargers that were being sold on Amazon as genuine Apple products. To nobody’s surprise the company found that nearly 90% of the items tested were in fact counterfeit, despite being sold and shipped directly by Amazon. Besides the obvious infringement upon copyrights and trademarks, Apple is also warning that the fake merchandise can also pose serious risks because it doesn’t go through consumer safety testing. And there’s ample anecdotal evidence to go with Apple’s assertion, considering the number of devices that have caught fire due to faulty chargers. Apple is now suing Mobile Star LLC, one of the companies that supplied counterfeit chargers and cables to Amazon. Apple is asking the court to issue an injunction against all the products developed by Mobile Star that infringe on its IP, to have the items destroyed, to have all the money that Mobile Star earned afforded to Apple, and to receive damages on the order of many millions of dollars. Meanwhile Amazon said it had “zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits” and that it was working with partners to ensure this doesn’t happen.

Cabral/Dubai Filed on October 21, 2016 Share More > Vote Apple's iPhone has been a dominant force in the smartphone world for years, and Google is determined to challenge that with its new Pixel. Is the Mountain View team indeed ready to challenge the dominance of Cupertino? Google just declared war on everyone, and they just have the right amount of resources to do so. Veering away from its Nexus line, the Internet giant finally decided that it was time for them to start giving others a run for their money with its own smartphone, the Pixel. And with Samsung charred from the Galaxy Note 7 mess, it's a perfect opportunity for the rest of the Android mob to take their shots at Apple - and Google is just raring to go. Let's see how Apple's signature flagship and Google's new toy stack up against each other. At the end of each parameter, we'll have a scoreboard (in an iPhone 7-Pixel format) to see where we're clawing towards to. Front camera: The iPhone 7 has a wider aperture, but the Pixel has a higher resolution. The tie-breaker would then be the iPhone 7's Retina flash. 1-0. Audio: A dual-speaker stereo system on the iPhone 7 versus the Pixel's single downward-firing one? Easy. 2-0. Memory: While the Pixel edges out the iPhone 7 in RAM (4GB to 3GB), the latter has more storage options; the 32/128GB choices on both cancel each other out, leaving the iPhone 7's massive 256GB on top. But since you may not require that much space on your phone, let's give RAM some preference here. 2-1. Display: The Pixel has a larger five-inch screen compared to the iPhone 7's standard-issue 4.7 inches, and it also uses AMOLED, brighter than the latter's LCD. Google's device also has a higher resolution and pixel density, though Apple has its own 3D Touch for added functionality (if you actually use it). Make no mistake, the iPhone 7 has a great display, but the numbers point to the Pixel tying things up. 2-2. Platform: It's iOS versus Android. 10 against 7.1 Nougat. Each system has its own crowd and functionalities, so we'll leave it at that. Digital assistant: Siri, meet your new rival, Google Assistant. And it seems that you're about to get a run for your money if the latter's demonstration at the Pixel launch event was any indication, in which it flaunted some really interactive "dialogues". 2-3. Fingerprint scanner: The iPhone 7 retains this on its home button up front, while the Pixel has its own on the rear. Normally, most of us hold our phones with our thumb and index finger on those positions, respectively, so it's really a matter of what suits you better. So let's move on. Main camera: While both practically have 12MP shooters, the iPhone has a wider aperture and optical image stabilisation, while also outshining (pun intended) the Pixel's dual-LED flash with its quad-LED flash. And most importantly, the iPhone 7's snapper has proven that it is really better in low-light conditions compared to its predecessors. 3-3. Chipset: Let's see... the Apple A10 Fusion chip gives 40 per cent faster performance at one-fifth the power and 50 per cent better graphics thanks to an M10 motion coprocessor, while the Snapdragon 821 blurts out a 10 per cent faster performance than the 820. Oh well. 4-3. Build: Apple was wise to bring out the Jet Black colour. With design mostly another user-preference judgment, let's take this one to durability: the iPhone 7 is dust- and water-resistant - as we proved ourselves just to get a kick out of it - while the Pixel can, well, take just sprays of water. And it helps when Jony Ive is on your bench. 5-3. Battery: The Pixel's 2770mAh power pack clobbers the iPhone 7's 1960mAh. But note to both: seriously, can't you stick in larger batteries? (It should be noted, though, that the iPhone 7 lasts longer - up to two hours, Apple says - than the 6s.) 5-4. Connectivity: Not a few people were ticked off when Apple removed the 3.5mm audio jack, leaving the iPhone 7 with only one port for connecting an audio device or charger. Apple may have viewed it as some sort of future-proofing (obviously not everyone agreed), but Google did a better thing at it by slapping in a USB Type-C on the Pixel... and retaining good ol' jack on top. 5-5. Well, that was a close, tense one. We may have ended up tied in our mano-y-mano, but the real winner is for you to decide. (Why not get one of each to spare you the trouble?) If ever you disagree on something, feel free to let us know (no NSFW or swear words, please). - alvin@khaleejtimes.com Share More > Vote MORE FROM Technology Technology Massive web attack disrupts Twitter, Amazon among ...

What To Expect At Apple's 'Hello Again' Mac 2016 Event iDigitalTimes 21/10/2016 Cammy Harbison © Apple "Magic Toolbar" could be the name of the 2016 MacBook Pro's new OLED panel according to a recent trademark filing. Fund out everything to expect at Apple's "Hello Again" Mac event October 27, here. On Wednesday, Apple announced it’s upcoming Mac event, dubbed “Hello Again,” which is expected to showcase the new MacBook Pro 2016 model. All throughout the year, rumors and leaks concerning the new MacBook Pro have emerged and this week is no exception. The new MacBook Pro is expected to see a revamp to its physical form, arriving thinner and lighter than earlier models It is also rumored to feature a larger trackpad and flatter keyboard. But the feature that has us most excited is the OLED display touch panel that is expected to replace the function keys found at the top of the keyboard. The new touch pane is rumored to incorporate a Touch ID function that allows unlocking the device via fingerprint, which could be integrated into the power button slot. The touchpad is also rumored to be contextual in nature, meaning the controls do different things depending on which app or program is active on the screen. © Martin Hajek Macbook Pro 2016 concept design by Martin Hajek featuring his interpretation of the new OLED touch pane. The new MacBook Pro touchpad has thus far been referred to as a “Dynamic Function Row,” but a new trademark filing suggests that Apple’s official name for the new feature may be the “Magic Toolbar.” The trademark filing, which was expertly hunted down by Brian Conroy at The Trademark Ninja seems to be fitting for Apple’s new OLED touch panel as it would fall right in line with other magically named MacBook features like the Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard. Of course, there’s no sure way of knowing if this will be Apple’s new name for the touchpad, but we wouldn’t be surprised if we heard the “Magic Toolbar” introduced at Apple’s “Hello Again” event next week. What To Expect From Apple’s “Hello Again” Mac Event © Apple On Wednesday, Apple sent invitations to its upcoming "Hello Again" Mac event, scheduled for October 27. After two years without any kind of MacBook Pro updates, Apple may have finally decided to release an updated model as invitations for the “Hello Again” Mac event made their way to invitees Wednesday. The event, which will be live streamed online, Thursday, October 27 will begin at 10AM PT / 1PM ET and should hopefully bring the Macbook Pro update we’ve all been waiting for. Here are a few of the things Apple is rumored to showcase at the Hello Again event: MacBook Pro 2016 – The new MacBook is rumored to feature: - OLED Touch Control Bar - Bigger Trackpad - Move to all USB-C ports (will replace both classic USBs and MagSafe power cords for a simple all-in-one port) - Thinner, lighter body - Touch ID support MacBook Air - Apple rumored to discontinue 11-inch model - I2016 model not expected, but if announced may see conversion to USB-C only like MacBook Pro - Price reduction for 13-inch model iMac - Revamped design with improved graphics performance. New options for AMD graphics processing units may be announced. - 5K resolution (5120 x 2880) display could be announced, which features built-in GPU. As more is learned about what may be ahead for Apple’s “Hello Again” Mac event, we’ll be sure to update this post.  Go to MSN Home More in News Dilapidated military bases 'need £8.5bn to ensure they can react to threats' The Guardian Briton will be extradited to US over hacking charges Sky News Farage: Marine Le Pen has done a good job Huffington Post UK Trial hears Jo Cox was murdered 'by gunman repeating "Britain First"' The Guardian Mosul: Snipers, car bombs and trapped families Sky News Nazi memorabilia on offer at school car boot sale The Guardian Up Next MiG-29 fighter jet crashes into sea Sky News More in News IVF mum marries donor after tracking him down and falling in love Mirror Tracking an elusive diary from Hitler's inner circle The New York Times £1bn Madonna becomes highest-grossing solo touring artist ever Evening Standard AdChoices AdChoices More from iDigitalTimes iPhone 7 more powerful than iPad Pro, reveals Geekbench score iDigitalTimes What to expect from Google Pixel and Pixel XL iDigitalTimes 4 of the weirdest objects made into Pokemon iDigitalTimes Samsung Galaxy Note 7: The story behind blue coral and dual-edge design iDigitalTimes Home News Weather Entertainment Sport Money Lifestyle Horoscopes Health & Fitness Food & Drink Cars Travel Dating © 2016 Microsoft Privacy & Cookies Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Anti-Spam Newsletter

Police probe doctor’s death Coalition youths split Home / World / Samsung kills off Galaxy Note 7 smartphone Samsung kills off Galaxy Note 7 smartphone By The Post Tweet Pin It Updated: October 14, 2016 By CHOE SANG-HUN ­SEOUL, South Korea — Samsung Electronics is killing its troubled Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, a humbling about-face for the South Korean giant and its global brand. In an unprecedented move, the company will no longer produce or market the smartphones. The demise of the Galaxy Note 7 is a major setback for Samsung, the world’s largest maker of smartphones. The premium device — with a 5.7-inch screen, curved contours and comparatively high price — won praise from consumers and reviewers, and was the company’s most ambitious effort yet to take on Apple for the high-end market. But Samsung has struggled to address reports that the Galaxy Note 7 could overheat and catch fire because of a manufacturing flaw. Last month, the company said it would recall 2.5 million phones to fix the problem. But in recent days, Galaxy Note 7 users emerged with reports that some devices that had supposedly been repaired were overheating, smoking and even bursting into flames. And on Monday, Samsung asked Note 7 customers to power off the phones while it worked on the problem. In a statement filed with the South Korean stock exchange late Tuesday, Samsung said it had made a “final decision” to stop production. The company will no longer make or market the phones, said a person familiar with the decision, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because Samsung did not publicly disclose details. Samsung has a strong position in modestly priced smartphones and has made progress in challenging the Apple iPhone for the high end of the market. Samsung showed its confidence in the new Galaxy Note 7 by skipping a sixth version in the series and offering the new phone beginning in August, before Apple’s introduction of its iPhone 7. It was unclear where the Galaxy Note 7’s problem began. But Samsung’s fight to catch up with Apple by cramming increasingly sophisticated features into the device may have been the phone’s undoing. Industry experts are scrutinizing Samsung’s supply chain to see whether the rush to market caused technical problems or led to corners being cut. “With the Note 7, Samsung strengthened its power as a speedy competitor,” said Lee Seung-woo, an analyst with IBK Investment & Securities. “But one wonders whether it hasn’t raced ahead alone, without helping its component suppliers to catch up.” The company is facing an immediate, and substantial, financial blow. On Tuesday, even before Samsung had announced it was killing the Galaxy Note 7, its South Korea-traded shares fell more than eight percent, its biggest daily drop since 2008, knocking US$17 billion off the company’s market value. Strategy Analytics, a research firm, had earlier estimated that Samsung could lose more than US$10 billion from the phone’s troubles. Samsung’s smartphone business also helps its other divisions by buying their computer chips and panel screens. Tougher to predict is how badly the Samsung brand itself will suffer. “It’s difficult to estimate now the damage it has caused to Samsung’s mid- and long-term brand value,” Mr. Lee said, “as well as its impact on Samsung’s smartphone sales in the future.” An editorial in South Korea’s largest newspaper, the Chosun Ilbo, said: “You cannot really calculate the loss of consumer trust in money.’’ It said that Samsung must realize that it “didn’t take many years for Nokia to tumble from its position as the world’s top cellphone maker.” No major manufacturer has killed off such a high-profile smartphone at the height of its popularity. But the person familiar with Samsung’s decision to terminate production said that the company had determined that simply removing the Galaxy Note 7 from the market would be the quickest way to stem further confusion and anxiety about the phone, albeit a costly one. It is an embarrassing moment for Samsung, whose name has come to be synonymous among South Koreans with cutting-edge technology and manufacturing prowess. The Galaxy Note 7 was one of the most ambitious products Samsung had begun marketing under the leadership of Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong, who took the helm of the country’s largest family controlled conglomerate, or chaebol, after his father, Chairman Lee Kun-hee, became ill in 2014. The senior Mr. Lee, who has not been seen in public since, famously burned a pile of 150 000 defective Samsung phones 21 years ago to demonstrate the company’s commitment to quality. Initially, Samsung watchers credited Lee Jae-yong — also known as Jay Y. Lee — with acting with similar decisiveness when Samsung first recalled the 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 devices. But as the phone’s problems lingered, scrutiny intensified. The troubling part for many is that Samsung recalled the devices, but then had to try to fix the problem a second time. “Maybe they should look harder and closer at what is happening at the management level,” said Roberta Cozza, a research director with Gartner Research, who cited the damage to Samsung’s credibility with customers and with telecommunications carriers. Earlier on Tuesday, the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards, a government organization, recommended that Samsung stop selling the device, saying that it had enough reason to believe the replacement model also had a “possible defect.” The agency did not provide details. The government also ordered South Korean airlines not to accept Galaxy Note 7 phones in luggage and to ensure that those who carry them on board powered them down. Just hours before the Galaxy Note 7’s demise, Samsung said it would stop selling the model around the world, essentially pulling it from the market as it sought to determine what had caused the fires. It said it had asked telecom carriers and retailers globally to stop sales and exchanges of the device. Samsung had also asked all consumers with original Galaxy Note 7s or replacement models to power them down and to stop using them while the company worked with regulators to solve the problem. Just a few hours before that, Samsung said it had temporarily halted production of the Galaxy Note 7 to try to fix the problem. In South Korea, the company apologized to consumers and business partners, while mobile carriers offered refunds to owners of the phones or allowed them switch to other Samsung models. The decision to end production came on the same day that the recall spread to China. Samsung had said earlier that models sold in China contained batteries that were different from those that had caught fire. But on Tuesday, before it announced the end of the Galaxy Note 7, Samsung said it was recalling nearly 191 000 of the devices in China. That did not go over well with many Chinese consumers. “Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 explodes, and they recall their phones in every other country except for China. They really look down on us,” wrote one user on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform.  – New York Times ← Previous Story Saudi Arabia admits defeat Next Story → The problem with referendums Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Home Industry Tech Google Pixel XL: Real, direct competition to the Apple iPhone 7 Google Pixel XL: Real, direct competition to the Apple iPhone 7 When Google launched artificial intelligence (AI)-powered premium devices Pixel and Pixel XL earlier this month, the message was clear: The device with the personal Google Assistant built right in sounded the threat bugle for Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. By: IANS | New Delhi | Published: October 21, 2016 12:45 PM The comparison is natural, especially in the absence of another flagship device, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which leaves Google and Apple fighting for the premium segment. (Reuters) When Google launched artificial intelligence (AI)-powered premium devices Pixel and Pixel XL earlier this month, the message was clear: The device with the personal Google Assistant built right in sounded the threat bugle for Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The comparison is natural, especially in the absence of another flagship device, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which leaves Google and Apple fighting for the premium segment. Google has been synonymous with innovation. This time, with a brand new Android OS Nougat and Google Assistant, Pixel devices are set to counter Apple’s iOS 10 and intelligent assistant Siri. Let us see what the 5.5-inch Pixel XL (32GB, black colour) has for Indian consumers who are searching for a premium smartphone. The aluminum and glass-built device looks elegant and fits comfortably in the palm. Unlike Nexus 6P, which had a thin glass strip at the top, Pixel XL’s back panel has almost one-third glass covering. Putting an end to Android users’ long wait, the Google Assistant in Pixel XL definitely has an edge over Apple’s Siri. See for yourself. When asked, :Are you a man or a woman?”, Google Assistant responded with answers like “I’m all inclusive :D” and “Does it really matter?” while Siri staidly replied: “I was not assigned a gender.” To “Who will win the US presidential election?” Google Assistant displayed poll results by the New York Times, The Telegraph and Independent while Siri returned Wikipedia and Quora with an iOS 10-powered iPhone. While searching restaurants near our office, Google Assistant displayed food joints as close as 300 metres while Siri said that the nearest restaurant is 600 metres away. To further test its intelligence, Google Assistant was asked, “Who is Siri?” It explained, “Siri is Apple’s intelligent assistant. She is very witty.” Siri, however, was more informative than Google Assistant when asked “Who is the Prime Minister of India?”. While Siri threw up results like when Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister and how long has he been serving, Google Assistant came back only with his name. Google Assistant can tell jokes, remember your passwords and even set the alarm for you in a clear voice. The “Pixel Imprint” fingerprint scanner is located at the back and is extremely responsive. It not only unlocked the device in a split second but also accepted (authorised) half a fingerprint for unlocking. While lock and volume up/down buttons are on the right of the Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protected AMOLED display, a nano-SIM slot sits at the left bumper of the device. Google has retained Type-C charging port that charged the 3,450 mAh battery in a flat 48 minutes. The device with Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 821 Quad core processor and 4GB DDR4 RAM will get first updates and free unlimited cloud space is not to be missed. Google has put in a lot of accessories inside the box, including a two-way Type-C port cable ensuring OTG device (also included) support. With this cable, one can charge Pixel XL with another phone having a Type-C port. The smartphone runs like a charm on Android Nougat 7.1 — the only device till date to have it. The apps explorer icon is replaced by a pull-up App Drawer which is more convenient. A swipe right on the screen brings the notable search results in line with browsing history. When we swiped right, information about the FC Barcelona vs Manchester City football match; updates about the Indian Soccer League tournament; and scores for the India vs New Zealand One-Day cricket match popped up. Pixel’s 12.3MP rear camera with f/2.0 has been rated the highest ever 89 DxOMark Mobile score. It is very fast, responsive and has a video stabilising mode. As expected, the photos in broad daylight were stunning. Even in “very low light conditions”, the camera did not disappoint. Under natural light at 7 pm, the photos clicked without flash had clarity and little grains while the photo taken with flash were sharper. As compared to shooting video in normal mode, we noticed a remarkable difference when we shot the same video with “Video Stabilisation” on. There were low or no jerks and no picture distortion. The 8MP camera works fine and while using it with Google’s video calling app Duo, the receiver gets a sharper image (as compared to the Nexus 6P). One can even try new gestures, relish the audio output and save unlimited data online in original quality for free. What doesn’t work? Pixel devices are not waterproof. At a time when Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (and the now discontinued Galaxy Note 7) and Apple are offering IP68 rating (waterproof ratings), Pixel smartphones fall behind in this category. The camera does not have an optical image stabilisation feature and the Type-C to Type-C charging is slow. Conclusion: If you think about shelling out Rs 72,000 for the 32GB variant of iPhone 7 Plus, consider Google Pixel XL for Rs 67,000 as your date with Google Assistant will floor you without any doubt.

The comparison is natural, especially in the absence of another flagship device, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which leaves Google and Apple fighting for the premium segment. Google has been synonymous with innovation. This time, with a brand new Android OS Nougat and Google Assistant, Pixel devices are set to counter Apple's iOS 10 and intelligent assistant Siri. Let us see what the 5.5-inch Pixel XL (32GB, black colour) has for Indian consumers who are searching for a premium smartphone. The aluminum and glass-built device looks elegant and fits comfortably in the palm. Unlike Nexus 6P, which had a thin glass strip at the top, Pixel XL's back panel has almost one-third glass covering. Putting an end to Android users' long wait, the Google Assistant in Pixel XL definitely has an edge over Apple's Siri. See for yourself. When asked, :Are you a man or a woman?", Google Assistant responded with answers like "I'm all inclusive :D" and "Does it really matter?" while Siri staidly replied: "I was not assigned a gender." Caption: The newly launched Rs 67,000 Google Pixel XL has Google Assistant built in. The device runs on Android Nougat 7.1 OS. To "Who will win the US presidential election?" Google Assistant displayed poll results by the New York Times, The Telegraph and Independent while Siri returned Wikipedia and Quora with an iOS 10-powered iPhone. While searching restaurants near our office, Google Assistant displayed food joints as close as 300 metres while Siri said that the nearest restaurant is 600 metres away. To further test its intelligence, Google Assistant was asked, "Who is Siri?" It explained, "Siri is Apple's intelligent assistant. She is very witty." Siri, however, was more informative than Google Assistant when asked "Who is the Prime Minister of India?". While Siri threw up results like when Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister and how long has he been serving, Google Assistant came back only with his name. Google Assistant can tell jokes, remember your passwords and even set the alarm for you in a clear voice. The "Pixel Imprint" fingerprint scanner is located at the back and is extremely responsive. It not only unlocked the device in a split second but also accepted (authorised) half a fingerprint for unlocking. While lock and volume up/down buttons are on the right of the Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protected AMOLED display, a nano-SIM slot sits at the left bumper of the device. Google has retained Type-C charging port that charged the 3450 mAh battery in a flat 48 minutes. The device with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 821 Quad core processor and 4GB DDR4 RAM will get first updates and free unlimited cloud space is not to be missed. Google has put in a lot of accessories inside the box, including a two-way Type-C port cable ensuring OTG device (also included) support. With this cable, one can charge Pixel XL with another phone having a Type-C port. The smartphone runs like a charm on Android Nougat 7.1 - the only device till date to have it. The apps explorer icon is replaced by a pull-up App Drawer which is more convenient. Caption: Google Pixel XL has the best camera rating ever. The photos were taken in the night and are displayed without any editing. A swipe right on the screen brings the notable search results in line with browsing history. When we swiped right, information about the FC Barcelona vs Manchester City football match; updates about the Indian Soccer League tournament; and scores for the India vs New Zealand One-Day cricket match popped up. Pixel's 12.3MP rear camera with f/2.0 has been rated the highest ever 89 DxOMark Mobile score. It is very fast, responsive and has a video stabilising mode. As expected, the photos in broad daylight were stunning. Even in "very low light conditions", the camera did not disappoint. Under natural light at 7 pm, the photos clicked without flash had clarity and little grains while the photo taken with flash were sharper. As compared to shooting video in normal mode, we noticed a remarkable difference when we shot the same video with "Video Stabilisation" on. There were low or no jerks and no picture distortion. The 8MP camera works fine and while using it with Google's video calling app Duo, the receiver gets a sharper image (as compared to the Nexus 6P). One can even try new gestures, relish the audio output and save unlimited data online in original quality for free. What doesn't work? Pixel devices are not waterproof. At a time when Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (and the now discontinued Galaxy Note 7) and Apple are offering IP68 rating (waterproof ratings), Pixel smartphones fall behind in this category. The camera does not have an optical image stabilisation feature and the Type-C to Type-C charging is slow. Conclusion: If you think about shelling out Rs 72000 for the 32GB variant of iPhone 7 Plus, consider Google Pixel XL for Rs 67000 as your date with Google Assistant will floor you without any doubt.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Prep Boys Volleyball: Warriors wrap up season sweep of Knights Thursday Oct 20, 2016 at 12:01 AM Oct 20, 2016 at 11:07 PM Matthew Peters Staff Writer @DP_MattPeters APPLE VALLEY — Life as the lone boys volleyball team in the High Desert was, well, lonely for Apple Valley Christian. That’s not a problem anymore. With Academy for Academic Excellence adding a program this season the short trips were nice. And getting three wins was even nicer. Apple Valley Christian (10-5) finished the season sweep against AAE with a three-set victory (25-20, 25-20, 25-23) on Thursday evening at the James Wood Community Center. Apple Valley Christian dropped just one set to AAE all year. Both teams begin the Inland Coast League post-season tournament on Tuesday. Apple Valley Christian finished the year in third place in the league while AAE is fifth. Apple Valley Christian coach John Richart said almost all road trips required a minimum drive of an hour and 15 minutes before AAE arrived. Now they have a team just across town to play. “I’ve been coaching off and on for like 16 years and we’ve never had a local team,” Richart said. “It was great to have an away game that was just across town. “They improved a lot as well. They are a scrappy team. They are going to have a great future in the league, I can see that. They work hard. A lot of improvement.” AAE coach Emily Gruver, just one year removed from playing volleyball on the AAE girls team, took a bunch of basketball and baseball players and helped the team get better along the way, finishing 5-15. “It’s been fun,” Gruver said. “There was a lot that I had to learn that I didn’t know, but teaching wise it’s the same.” Although they were swept Thursday, the Knights made it a difficult match for the Warriors at times. AAE had leads late in the both the second and third sets only to watch those slip away. AAE had a 17-12 lead in the second set and then a 22-20 lead late the third set before dropping both. Richart said Thursday’s match wasn’t his squad’s most focused effort, and that can sometimes be a trend with his Warriors. “The blessing and the curse of my team is a lot of these guys have been with each other since kindergarten, from a very young age,” Richart said. “They are like a bunch of brothers. So they goof around and play loose, and that’s great. But then they goof around and play loose and that’s not great. So that all depends.” Josh Berry led Apple Valley Christian with 11 kills, 15 blocks and two aces; Khahn Messner had eight kills and four aces; Noah Leslie added four kills and 12 assists; and Alex Richart had three kills, five assists and two block. Richart said the team had aspirations for a second-place finish in league but will now try to take the title in the league’s post-season tournament. With five seniors this is one of the best Apple Valley Christian squads in recent history, Richart said. “It will be a tough road but I think the guys will be up for the challenge,” Richart said.

Sounds like a dream but don’t be fooled Gaby Hinsliff The head of Apple, Tim Cook, says all payments could soon be via smartphone apps. But there’s a sinister side to this vision, that would lead to us losing our freedom ‘Even for those who no longer believe in fairies, there’s something oddly magical about money.’ Photograph: JGI/Jamie Grill/Getty Images/Blend Images Friday 21 October 2016 01.30 EDT Last modified on Friday 21 October 2016 03.24 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger The tooth fairy is dying. Soon, there will be no more scrabbling under pillows in the middle of the night; no more wondering what to do with a tiny molar, swapped for the traditional pound. (Chucking it in the bin seems heartless, keeping it faintly grisly.) But although my nine-year-old is reaching the limits of belief in fairies, it’s not just the magic that’s fading. It’s the habit of carrying cash. By 2025, three quarters of payments in Britain are expected to be made without notes or coins. We’re not quite Sweden – where even street beggars are starting to take plastic, via card-readers handed out by charities – but we’re moving in the same direction, towards a world of tapping contactless card to reader and paying by app, and who knows what else besides. Why cash isn't king any more Read more This week the former Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins predicted the end of banks as we know them within two decades. What’s the point of these antiquated vaults, he suggested, when all that’s really needed to underpin the movement of wealth around the globe is a vast electronic ledger tracking who’s worth what, and some nifty apps for shunting it between us? So by the time my son grows up perhaps pound coins will be for ceremonial uses only, like silver sixpences stuffed in a Christmas pudding, and kids with gappy smiles will simply swipe left on the tooth fairy app. But I can’t help feeling we’ll miss real money when it’s gone. For if cash is, as the saying goes, cold and hard then life without it may be more so. The under-30s increasingly seem to regard forking out actual coins as akin to bartering with seashells No more saving coppers in jars, dropping spare coins in charity boxes; no cash means no change, the end of that faint illusion of getting something back on the transaction. And the mind boggles at how men will mark their domestic territory, once they can’t leave small slagheaps of coins on every recently cleared surface in the house. But the bigger question here is who exactly a cashless society is designed to serve. Last week in Japan, Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, once again spelled out the company’s aim to wean the world off cash, preferably in favour of using the Apple Pay app to buy everything via their smartphones. And while his airy insistence that “we don’t think the consumer particularly likes cash” might be true for the under-30s, who increasingly seem to regard forking out actual coins as akin to bartering with seashells, it should set alarm bells ringing for the rest of us. It’s not just that people tend to spend more freely when the money feels abstract, just numbers on a screen. Turn a phone into a virtual wallet, the one thing nobody leaves home without, and you’re shackled to it for ever. What was once an expensive toy becomes a necessity, a contract you can’t cancel if times get tough – but also, perhaps, a tracking device. As any cheating spouse ever caught out by their credit card bill knows, paying with anything other than cash creates a trail, a record of transactions from which behaviour can be deduced. You don’t have to be a deranged conspiracy theorist to worry about the uses to which that information could one day be put, if not by authoritarian governments here or abroad, then by hackers. The freedom of cash isn’t something to be surrendered meekly or without thinking. But even if we don’t abandon the folding stuff altogether, the drift away from it has costs. The tooth fairy is not the only one at risk of redundancy. This summer, the last remaining bank branch in our nearest small market town closed down, which in retrospect was hardly surprising; every time I went in, invariably lugging bagfuls of change from school PTA fundraisers, there seemed to be fewer customers. In the last financial year more than 600 high street bank branches closed, which is bad news for the elderly and those who can’t travel, but even worse news for people working in them. Jobs in banking will go and they won’t be the kind of bankers everyone loves to hate but modestly paid counter and back-office staff, holding down what would once have been considered steady careers. Why we should fear a cashless world | Dominic Frisby Read more Automation has been eating away for years at one end of cash transaction, replacing shop assistants with machines, but is now coming for the other end: the places where cash is moved and managed. It’s not robots coming for these jobs, but apps that link buyer and seller or lender and borrower more directly, blowing up established professions in the middle. And while this world of fintech – the point where finance meets technology, almost certainly to the bafflement of most of us – should ultimately create jobs, they may not be the kind into which redundant bank cashiers can move seamlessly. Ah, say the prophets of plastic, but think of the problems a cash-free society solves: no more black markets in drugs or guns; fewer street muggers and cash-in-hand traders dodging tax. Really? This is surely not the end of crime, just the beginning of new ones, where hackers and fraudsters replace bank robbers and thieves, and new black markets emerge, using either virtual currencies such as bitcoin or whatever else comes to hand. (A few years ago a craze for shoplifting Tide detergent in the US was blamed, somewhat surreally, on addicts bartering the stuff for crack.) And for every would-be illegal immigrant deterred by the practical difficulties of surviving in a cash-free world, there will be homeless or otherwise marginalised Britons struggling to get by without smartphones and bank records. If we’re headed for a society where only the poor or the suspiciously shifty carry cash, it’s not hard to guess which outlets will carry on accepting their money and which will shut them out. You don’t have to pine for the days of bringing wages home in a brown paper packet to worry about whether a cashless future serves corporate interests rather better than social ones. Besides, even for those who no longer believe in fairies, there’s something oddly magical about money. Small enough to be slipped under a pillow or dropped in a busker’s hat, strong enough to be universally trusted, and foolproof enough to work even when your phone battery’s flat. Hang on to your cash. You never know when a rainy day is coming.

However, after 7 consecutive quarters of declining tablet sales, it is hard to see how Apple’s second best product, the iPad will soon see a slow death despite the fact that it outdid Micrsoft’s Surface tablet PCs as per the last IDC report. The Apple iPhone may be the company’s hero product, but with falling smartphone and tablet sales, Apple now seems to be focussing on a forgotten line of products that started it all, the Mac. Apple’s Mac lineup has been ignored for quite some time now. The only Mac product that Apple sells with an up to date chipset is its recently announced 2016 MacBook. There’s the Mac Pro that stuck with an Intel Ivy Bridge-E CPU, which was last updated in 2013, the MacBook Pro 15-inch which features an Intel Haswell CPU and was updated in 2014 and finally the MacBook Air with an Intel Broadwell CPU. Steve Jobs unveiled the Macbook Air from an envelope and it still looks the same 8 years later. The MacBook Air despite being on of the best value for money buys in Apple’s Mac lineup has yet to see a redesign or an update. It packs in an old TN display with non Retina resolution and a fifth-generation chipset, while Asus, Dell offer the latest for roughly the same price. While I would love to sit and admire Apple’s marketing team (since people are still buying these old systems) it is easy to tell, that Apple’s focus in the past two years was on its iPad. Apple iPad Pro 9.7 inch Apple launched the powerful iPad Pro models last year (November 2015), and it was clear that the company was looking to get PC users under its fold with the same. Soon enough Apple added another Pro variant with the 9.7-inch model with the hopes that those who found the 12-inch too-big would be happy to go in for this one. But that turned out to be a flop show as well. The company lost out because not only were the Pro models priced too high, but they ran the same iOS as its smartphones, which is not something a power user who usually pays for an ultra-book would be interested in. Adding to the mess was Apple’s idea to ape Microsoft with a soft keyboard, that somehow did not cover up for its lacking software productivity. With the tablet sales still declining Apple seems to have woken up and is now for once actually holding an event for its updated Mac lineup. Think of it as a Plan B where the Plan A with the iPad seems to have failed, despite repeated efforts. Apple MacBook 2016 So wit the iPad out fizzing out (they are still planning three new models next year), the next mobile device in line would have to be the old and neglected laptop lineup. So why is the Apple iPad failing? As Digital Trends points out, it is the upgrade cycle. Tablet users simply do not feel the need to upgrade to a new or the latest model, as they are often used for secondary tasks. With smartphones screen sizes getting bigger, more can be accomplished with the device that is in your hand, rather than the one in your bag, that well… needs two hands. Why would one need an iPad Pro (Rs 93,000 256GB) when you have MacBook (Rs 1,00,000 512GB, 8GB RAM) that is equally light, priced the same and can do so much more? Microsoft’s Windows 10 and its manufacturers have moved ahead of Apple when it comes to hardware and software, let’s hope Plan B works out as smartphones and tablets are just not cutting it, while Plan C with the Apple Car just got shelved.

X Apple fears for €850m Athenry data centre after residents’ court bid Locals apply for judicial review following green-light from An Bord Pleanála Fri, Oct 21, 2016, 06:10 Mark Paul Apple’s concern: The tech giant announced its intention to build the data centre in Athenry in February 2015, the same day that it also announced a similar investment in Denmark. Work is already underway on the Danish facility. Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters         Apple is understood to have expressed serious concerns to Irish officials about the potential implications for its proposed €850 million new data centre in Co Galway, after local residents launch a High Court bid to stop it. The company is concerned the go-ahead for the proposed project in Athenry could be delayed by a further 18 months if the High Court grants a full review of the recent decision by An Bord Pleanála to give scheme the go-ahead. Local residents Allan Daly and Sinéad Fitzpatrick, who were named among the objectors to the project in the board’s report on the application, have launched an ex-parte (one side only) application for a judicial review. The High Court has granted leave for a full hearing on their application, which is due for mention on November 8th. It has not yet been decided if the matter will proceed to a full judicial review, but if Mr Daly and Ms Fitzpatrick are successful with their application, any delay is sure to be lengthy. Apple was unavailable for comment last night. But the company is known to be worried about the future of the project if a judicial review is granted, and it is believed to have made its fears known to State enterprise officials. Irish firms more worried about Brexit than British counterparts Investors focus on Trump’s infrastructure spending plans Cantillon: To spend or not to spend – FF seem to want it both ways Apple announced its intention to build the data centre in Athenry in February 2015, the same day that it also announced a similar investment in Denmark. Work is already underway on the Danish facility while the proposed Galway investment remains mired in the planning process. Conditions Apple wants to build the Athenry facility on a 500-acre site at Derrydonnell, which it was expected would be operational by 2017 with the creation of about 150 jobs. Galway County Council granted approval, subject to certain conditions such as the hours during which construction work can take place. ADVERTISEMENT Several objectors then appealed it to An Bord Pleanála, which gave the green-light in August. Some of the objectors are now challenging that decision. Despite environmental concerns over the project raised by objectors, the board decided it “would not seriously injure the amenities of the area or of property in the vicinity”. In his submissions to the board, Mr Daly raised a number of issues including concern over the power consumption of the data centre, as well as fears about the release of greenhouse gases, and the scale of the site. Ms Fitzpatrick objected to the project in submissions to the board on behalf of a local group, Concerned Residents of Lisheenkyle. The Lisheenkyle residents argued the project “shows disregard for regional and local planning policy . . . The development is not of strategic importance and is not supported by regional policy,” they said. The residents also claimed the potential employment was “overstated” by the company, and suggested the project should be moved to an alternative site in Co Wicklow.

X Margrethe Vestager not afraid to take on Europe’s taxing issues EU competition commissioner is adamant Apple tax ruling is not political issue Fri, Oct 21, 2016, 06:00 Suzanne Lynch European Correspondent European Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager: “We look at state aid from any possible angle to see if tools are being used that shouldn’t be use to give a selective advantage.” Photograph: Eric Vidal/Reuters         There are not many European Union commissioners who can boast of high popularity ratings. But in the two years since her appointment as Europe’s competition chief Margrethe Vestager has succeeded in pulling off the unimaginable: becoming a much-loved Brussels “Eurocrat”. During a debate on the Apple judgment in the European Parliament last month, MEPs fell over themselves to applaud the Danish commissioner on her record ruling against Ireland. “I want to clone you,” said Belgian MEP Philippe Lamberts. Others complimented her on her “bravery” and “courage” in taking on Ireland and Apple. Long-time tax campaigner Sven Giegold said she “deserved a medal”. The love-bombing was unrelentless, leaving Irish MEPs Seán Kelly and Brian Hayes to put forward the case valiantly for Ireland. The exercise ultimately proved fruitless as MEPs from across the continent appeared to unleash decades of pent-up frustration at Ireland’s corporate tax policy. Seven weeks after the Apple judgment, the Danish commissioner and former deputy prime minister sits in her 10th floor office in the European Commission’s headquarters in Brussels. Confident and smiling, wearing killer heels and a leather skirt, she looks every inch the fictional politician she is believed to have inspired in the hit Danish political drama Borgen. The room itself is a nod to Scandinavian minimalism: all clean lines and monochrome surfaces. A friendly aide brings in two trendy handle-less coffee cups. The office is somewhere between an Ikea catalogue and a manifestation of “hygge”, the new Danish lifestyle craze that translates roughly as “cosiness” and is taking the design world by storm. That Margrethe Vestager has managed to bring her own idiosyncratic style to the drab world of EU bureaucratic decor is not surprising. This is a woman who is very much putting her stamp on things. Though she inherited many of the most high-profile anti-trust cases from her predecessor Joaquín Almunia, Vestager has taken up the mantle and gone further than many had expected. ADVERTISEMENT Apple judgment Quite apart from the Apple judgment, Vestager’s in-tray is full. There are three open cases against Google; there are also suggestions she may open a fourth front over “scraping”, the process of copying content from websites without payment, while an assessment of the Microsoft-LinkedIn merger awaits. Russian energy giant Gazprom has also been in the commissioner’s sights, while the 800 or so staff employed by the EU’s competition directorate-general located a kilometre down the road in Merode are busy sifting through thousands of tax rulings, including a trawl of documents unveiled by the Luxembourg Leaks scandal. But the last few months have been dominated by the Apple case. The order by the European Commission that Ireland collect up to €13 billion in unpaid taxes broke new ground. Though the EU’s anti-trust division had previously dabbled in state aid, the record for a state aid case had been €1.3 billion in 2014. Competition experts will be watching eagerly how this plays out in the courts. With the Government expected to refer the case to the European Court of Justice by early November, is she confident that the commission will win its case? “We knew this was coming. We knew there would be an appeal so we are very prepared,” she says. “It’s important that we get to set out our reasons, our argument. All that is set out in the full judgment, of course, but it’s a key part of the EU competition procedure.” The finding by the commission that Apple benefitted from €13 billion in illegal tax aid from Ireland has spooked the Government here, raising serious questions about Ireland’s economic model of attracting foreign direct investment. Next week the European Commission’s commissioner responsible for taxation, Pierre Moscovici, is expected to come forward with a revised proposal for a common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB). French prime minister Manuel Valls said last week he wanted to move towards a common corporate tax rate in Europe. Vestager insists the Apple decision was rooted in state aid and not tax concerns. “We do not do tax, we do state aid,” she says. “We look at state aid through all the tools you can use to give state aid, be it, in this issue, as a tax ruling, be it a cheap piece of land as in one of the Spanish football cases, maybe a favourable loan as in the French EDF case, or as cash . . . we look at state aid from any possible angle to see if tools are being used that shouldn’t be use to give a selective advantage.” Political concerns However, as critics of the Apple decision have been quick to point out, how can the EU’s competition division claim not to be motivated by political concerns when European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has vowed to make his commission the most political European Commission in history? It’s an issue that raises broader questions about whether the EU’s competition division – by far the most powerful arm of the European Commission with semi-judicial powers – should come under the umbrella of the commission or should instead be a stand-alone institution. “I don’t think our work is political,” says Vestager in response. “We have safeguards so we can take independent decisions. It is true that our decisions are fact-based, based on the evidence of the case, our case law, our case practice. If you are looking for politics, it is in a much deeper sense. “Of course, our founding fathers put political values into the EU treaty. It’s not a neutral document. They made choices, and they said we want a level playing field, we want equal treatment, and we want us all to have a fair chance in the market . . . These values I and my team are obliged to protect.” ADVERTISEMENT Others point out that there is a contradiction at the heart of the Apple ruling which, on the one hand, ordered Ireland to recoup unpaid taxes by the US company, while on the other said that other countries could be entitled to some of the spoils. Vestager disputes that there is any problem here. “These are two separate issues. The decision itself is about how Apple organised itself and how Irish tax legislation sits with tax rulings. In that instance, we found that the Irish should recover unpaid taxes. As a side issue, there is a question about how Apple organised itself to distribute its hardware to the African, Middle East, Indian market, etc.” She says that, while typically value is not created at these “selling points” as contractually people are still buying their phone from Cork, Ireland, “sometimes the distributional arrangements evolve into something that actually does create value on site”. She says it may now be relevant for national authorities to consider if this distribution arrangement has changed and make a claim to some of the money, though the European Commission has no role in this. “The way tax is organised in Europe, it is for all intents and purposes, a national competence, apart from recent legislation on automatic exchange of information, etc. Tax authorities don’t operate on a European level,” Vestager says. Legal challenge However, while the intricacies of competition law will be combed through in the forthcoming legal challenge, there are also questions about the way the commission handled the communication of the ruling. While Irish officials and EU commissioner Phil Hogan were told of the €13 billion figure on the morning of the announcement on August 30th, it is understood that the Government and Minister for Finance Michael Noonan were informed that the figure would be “billions” towards the end of the previous week. “It’s always very difficult to say, well, what you should exchange. Of course, we’d been working with the Irish Government, because it’s always the government that you deal with as the counterpart,” she says. “We have treated it as we have every other case and have been working with the Government in giving the warnings as we have done in every other case. Of course, it’s up to everyone to consider how they will prepare themselves when they know something is coming, just as well as we do.” In terms of future cases, Vestager does not rule out further investigations into Ireland’s tax arrangements with companies. “I cannot say that there won’t be more cases, but I cannot say that there will be more cases. I stay neutral until we figure out there is something we really have to look into,” she says. “We have a sample of 1,000 tax rulings overall. The majority of them are the rulings from ‘Lux Leaks’, but we have 10, 12 tax rulings from all the member states who do tax rulings. We’ve been going through these and what we’ve found is that a number of them are absolutely fine.” Because Ireland issues far fewer tax agreements than the other 22 member states which issue tax rulings – Germany, for example, issues tens of thousands of tax rulings – Irish authorities are understood to have submitted virtually all Ireland’s tax letters which number a few hundred. Further, these were submitted before the European Commission extended its request for information to all EU member states in December 2014. Vestager plays down any suggestion that Ireland can therefore be expected to be at the front of the queue for forthcoming judgments. “That’s not the way we work” she said. ADVERTISEMENT Tense exchanges While the commission is still trawling through the cache of documents uncovered by the Luxembourg Leaks scandal, does it present Vestager with a difficulty that her boss, Jean-Claude Juncker, was prime minister of Luxembourg when most of these tax deals were struck? “I don’t feel it like that,” she says. “Juncker was very clear with me, from the very early days to say, ‘You have completely free hands to do what you believe is the right thing to do’ and that is how we’re working.” While the Apple ruling has strained relations between Dublin and Brussels, it has also compounded tensions between Brussels and Washington amid accusations that Europe is unfairly targeting US companies. When US treasury secretary Jack Lew visited Vestager in July, officials reported that the Danish commissioner gave him short shrift during tense exchanges. Vestager declines to comment on the meeting, but she does expand on the transatlantic relationship . Following her trip to Washington last month in the wake of the Apple judgment, she tweeted as she sat on the runway that visiting the United States “makes me feel more European than ever”, adding that she was looking forward to going back home. For countries such as Ireland, which in many ways see themselves closer to Boston than Berlin, is this not a concern? “I really did see the differences. There is a different tradition of competition policy in Europe and America. From the beginning, the European Union chose to put a ban on taxpayers’ money being put into supporting businesses selectively. On the contrary, it seems to be absolutely normal for businesses in the US to directly negotiate how much taxes they are going to pay with the state where they place their business. It’s a discussion about two very different ways of doing things,” she says. As for the future of transatlantic relations, there are no plans for further visits to the US until the spring, she says. The imminent change in the US administration means that diplomatic engagement is likely to be minimal from Washington’s end. Major concern While she insists on the independence of the EU’s competition arm, Vestager believes taxation has become a major public concern across the world, and she supports, though is not directly involved with, her colleague Pierre Moscovici’s CCCTB proposal. “I remember when Denmark held the presidency of the council in 2012 and I was at the table as finance minister, we were trying to secure agreement on automatic exchange of information on a wider range of personal income, with very little luck I have to say. A few years later, it passed,” she says. She believes there has been a sea change in public perceptions around tax. “To a large degree, it has come from the financial and sovereign debt crisis. People have seen their governments do unthinkable things to get in control of their spending . They have seen public salaries, benefits, pensions go down, taxes go up. They feel that they all contribute to make ends meet, and then they see that not all businesses contribute. It is unfair,” she says. As for her own future, Vestager’s huge public profile, which was enhanced by hundreds of media appearances and interviews during the Apple controversy, has sparked speculation in Brussels that she could be lining up for a senior international position when her term as commissioner ends in 2019. Asked whether she would return to Danish politics or consider going further afield, she remains coy. “I don’t envision my future. I have never really planned because, to me, having a plan is like when a horse wears blinkers. If you put them on, you don’t see what’s happening out there, but sometimes the best things are happening out of the corner of your eye,” she says. ADVERTISEMENT For her, it’s not about “climbing the ladder, or thinking of the next phase”. She adds with a smile: “I work from the hypothesis that I have one try at this life so better do something that you find worthwhile.” Watch this space.

The revelation comes in a federal lawsuit filed by Apple against a New Jersey company on Monday over what Apple says are counterfeit products that were sold on Amazon. In the lawsuit, Apple says Mobile Star imprinted Apple logos on cables and chargers that "pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock." It says the chargers and cables were being sold on Amazon as genuine Apple products. Apple says it purchased the products on Amazon and later told the online retailer that they were fake. Amazon then identified Mobile Star as the source. Amazon isn't named in the suit, but said in a statement that it has "zero tolerance" for counterfeiters on its site and that it pursues "wrongdoers" aggressively. Mobile Star didn't return a voicemail seeking comment. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

But its dominance has proved fleeting because consumers have moved upmarket. ― Reuters picBEIJING, Oct 21 — On a recent afternoon in northern Beijing, Chinese 20-somethings lean over a long blond-wood table in a retail store, examining colourful smartphones and fitness bands. The white walls and spare space recall an Apple Store, but on display is a wider, and more curious, range of products: “smart” rice-cookers, hoverboards, robot vacuum cleaners, bathroom scales and air purifiers. A tall salesman in a bright blue T-shirt says they are planning to soon cordon off an area to demo Xiaomi drones. The brightly lit store is one of 36 locations across Greater China operated by Xiaomi Corp, a Beijing-based smartphone-maker that has been frequently touted as the “Apple of China.” But Xiaomi has a very different strategy: Instead of meticulously designing products in-house, guided by the technical and aesthetic vision of a Steve Jobs-like figure, Xiaomi is investing in dozens of Chinese hardware startups, branding the devices with the Xiaomi label, and selling them in stores and through its website. The gadgets can be operated from a Xiaomi smartphone — a classic Internet of Things play — and are typically priced near the low range of competing products. The rice cooker costs about US$150 (RM600), more expensive than traditional electronic cookers, but far below top-end products from Philips and Toshiba, which can run to US$450. The Mi Band 2 fitness-tracker costs US$22, about a fifth the price of Fitbit Alta. The strategy is familiar enough: Hook customers on an operating system — MIUI, a heavily customised version of Android–so they’ll stay loyal to the brand and keep buying more products. Liu De, who runs Xiaomi’s new ecosystems products division, says the business will pull in 10 billion yuan this year — splitting profits with Xiaomi’s hardware partners — and double that in 2017. He accepts that this is a “very ambitious goal.” Xiaomi badly needs a second act. A couple of years ago, the company was China’s top smartphone seller and for a time the world’s largest unicorn after Uber. But its dominance has proved fleeting because consumers have moved upmarket. “They want to get more premium phones and are willing to pay more,” says Jessie Ding, a China market analyst at Canalys. “However, Xiaomi’s specs have not changed much over past two years.” Meanwhile, competition from domestic phone makers has intensified, knocking Xiaomi into fourth place. The company is trying to claw its way back. Led by Vice President of Global Operations Hugo Barra, Xiaomi is pushing into other developing markets. India is a particular focus because, like China five years ago, most consumers want value for money, says Tarun Pathak, a market analyst at Counterpoint Research. But he says it won’t be long before Indians, too, will want better phones. Later this month, Xiaomi will launch a premium smartphone with a screen that curves around the side like a Samsung Edge, according to people familiar with the plan. A smart watch is also expected to debut later this year. If the new phone doesn’t jumpstart sales, Xiaomi’s growth prospects may rest with Liu and his ecosystems division. To date, Liu says his team has invested in more than 60 startups, largely founded in the last three years, and remains a minority shareholder in most of them. Xiaomi also offers input on product design and marketing. “We target big markets, big demands,” he says, explaining that the aim is to maintain a steady pace of innovation so consumers will want to replace or upgrade every few years. Chief among the startups is Huami, the fitness band maker, which was founded in 2014 by serial entrepreneur Wang Huang. It has raised money from Sequoia, Morningside Venture and Banyan Capital. Headquartered in Beijing, the company also has a Silicon Valley engineering office and more than 300 employees. In the US, it has launched the pricier Amazfit fitness tracker. It resembles a wristwatch adorned with a jade-pendant-like sensor — evoking traditional Chinese jade jewellery — while tracking steps and calculating calories burned. Huami declined to comment. Most of the products in the Xiaomi ecosystem have a similar modern aesthetic, with simple colours, rounded edges and minimally fussy dials or buttons. Part of the sales strategy involves persuading consumers to buy things they don’t know they need. Unveiling the smart rice-cooker this spring in Beijing, Liu De displayed a chart with two coloured lines indicating, respectively, optimal stickiness-sweetness and optimal texture-colour; where they cross, he explained, is perfect rice. Customers using Xiaomi’s cooker can scan the bar code on rice packages to detect grain variety and other information, and select from literally thousands of combined heating options to cook peak rice. Xiaomi’s sleek white bathroom scale has an LED dial that’s not visible until you step on the scale; it also uploads your weight to a smartphone app, allowing you to track weight gain or loss over time. “China is set to embrace a consumption boom over the next 10 to 20 years, we see that crystal clear,” Liu says. “What Xiaomi aims to do is to feed these surging demands by introducing products with good quality at a relatively cheap price.” The company’s focus, he adds, is on consumers in China’s second- and third-tier cities, especially those between ages 17 and 35. Clay Shirky, author of the 2015 book, Little Rice: Smartphones, Xiaomi, and the Chinese Dream and one of Xiaomi’s most vocal admirers, is sceptical. “It’s not clear that there’s a business-to-consumer model that works for the so-called Internet of Things,” he says. “What do you want your fitness band to say to your rice cooker? Why does your television need to be in communication with your Segway? No one has gotten that right, not even Amazon.” To date, Huami is the most obviously successful device company in which Xiaomi holds a minority stake. Huami’s Mi is the top-selling fitness band in China, according to Canalys, and No. 2 globally after Fitbit. However, Ding says, supply-chain hiccups hurt Mi band shipments earlier this year and it will take time for Xiaomi to get its other startup partners shipping products reliably. What’s more, they’ve yet to deliver many appealing hardware innovations, according to IDC analyst Jean Xiao. She says Xiaomi’s drone didn’t offer any more features that market leader DJI’s model. “Then DJI lowered its price, so it was actually cheaper than Xiaomi.” Don’t count Xiaomi out, Liu says. The company isn’t aiming to compete on the high-end with DJI or anyone else. “Our primary goal remains to serve the growing middle class in China.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Facebook accidentally declares some users dead, including founder Zuckerberg Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Sony seeks to patent method for measuring journalists' accuracy The best action cams for winter sports Consumer drone business stumbles, but commercial markets beckon Apple now sells refurbished iPhones Robotic dinosaur replicas stomp in Tokyo hotel (VIDEO) Best smartphones for holiday 2016 Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Malaysian gaming content exports soar 75pc to RM80m Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Models with Down Syndrome team up with celebrities Reuters Video: Reflection ‘healthy’ for Democratic party, says Obama 'Beauty and the Beast' first full-length trailer Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Reuters Video: Duchess meets movie-star cat, animals go wild Related Articles Xiaomi unveils Starck-designed smartphone and VR headset New-gen Android handsets and smartwatches in store for IFA 2016 Three smartphones with high-end specs priced under US$400 Xiaomi suits up for debut on Apple’s US home turf Digerati50: Making and losing a billion, at 37 Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Today, range anxiety is far more ubiquitous due to our pocket supercomputers. Not only are we worried about our smartphone’s battery lasting the day, but also whether its memory will be sufficient to hold all those photos, videos, songs, apps and software updates. This problem is a moving target. As the resolution of mobile cameras improves, image sizes increase, particularly with 4K video. Apps and games are becoming more sophisticated, consuming more processing power. A lot has to do with users: the more time we spend staring at our screens, the faster the batteries drain. Makers have been slow to compensate for the increasing strain we put on our phones. The latest handsets from Apple and Google go some way to solving it, with more storage — on the device and in the cloud — and much-improved battery life. Longevity is relevant because both companies are pushing their phones into the most demanding territory yet, by trying to turn them into personal portable concierges. Lookalike hardware I have been testing the iPhone 7 Plus alongside the Google Pixel XL for about a week. (I prefer the more expensive larger phones, but most points in this review also apply to their small-screen siblings.) The Pixel is the latest in a long line of would-be “iPhone killers” from Google. I loved last year’s Nexus 6P but Google argues that the Pixel is different because it had greater involvement in shaping both hardware (which is built by HTC) and software. That approach of tying the two together has been Apple’s playbook for decades, so it is disappointing that the Pixel is not more distinctive. Its rounded black rectangle is different primarily because the fingerprint reader is on the back. It lacks the iPhone’s camera bump but as a result, the wedge-shaped handset is slightly thicker, though also lighter and shorter than its rival. I asked both phones to ‘show me photos of camping’. Siri heard me right first time but Assistant showed web search results for ‘my face has a campaign’ When it comes to software, inspiration seems to be travelling in the opposite direction. A new feature of iOS 10 apes Google Now: swipe sideways from the iPhone’s homescreen to see live widgets, such as the weather, calendar and suggested apps based on time, place and user habits. In many ways, the devices are evenly matched. Both excel on battery life. Whereas previous iPhones and Android devices often failed to last a full day (I admit to being a heavier user than most), I often went to bed without even hitting the “red zone” of low power on either device. Battery management software in both Android and iOS now kicks in to preserve the life of the phone by cutting background processes to essentials, such as calls and texts. Anyone who shares my daily frustration with battery life would benefit from upgrading. There is one crucial difference in endurance between the two devices, though: the iPhone 7 is waterproof while the Pixel is not. Clouds apart FT on WhatsApp Get the FT’s daily editor’s pick on WhatsApp Where the two devices begin to part ways is in their connected cloud services, which are key to alleviating the pressure on internal memory. Google’s neat solution to this kind of range anxiety is “Smart Storage”. If your device is running low on memory, flip a switch in the settings and it will delete older images that have been backed up to the cloud on Google Photos. It is also offering Pixel owners unlimited storage on Google Photos at full resolution — including hefty 4K videos. Even if you do not own a Pixel, Google is already slightly more generous with its free cloud storage than Apple. Where iCloud offers only 5GB free, Google allows 15GB — but that has to cover Gmail and Drive storage as well as photos. Pricing for extra storage evens out: Apple charges $1 a month for 50GB, Google charges $2 for 100GB. Apple has a 200GB tier for $3 and both offer 1TB for $10 a month. Digital butler All this cloud storage, however, is only useful if you have a good search tool to find your files once uploaded. Pixel is the first phone to feature Google Assistant, a digital butler that is accessed Siri-style by pressing and holding the home button or calling out “OK Google”. I found Assistant good but not significantly better than Siri. In one test, I asked both Siri and Assistant to “show me photos of camping” from the large library of images I had previously uploaded to both Apple and Google’s clouds. Siri heard me right first time and produced about a dozen pictures. Most were of the tent from my most recent camping trip and a few were random outdoorsy photos that were taken nowhere near a campsite. Not terrible but not particularly comprehensive, especially as I’ve been using iCloud to back up my pictures for years. Wearable technology Personal tech to improve running technique Measuring stride, paces per minute, bounce and foot strike to go faster and limit injuries Assistant first tried to show me web search results for “my face has a campaign”. A second attempt at machine-readable elocution was more successful but showed only web search results of camping pics, not my own pictures. After adding the possessive “Show me my photos of camping”, Google produced many happy camping memories I had uploaded to its Photos service, stretching back more than a decade. These included not just pictures of campsites but fireside suppers and beach walks from the same trips. Bafflingly, however, it did not find the most recent tent photo that Siri did. It is worth noting that Google Photos is also available as a standalone iOS app. It even comes with a “free-up space” option that clears all the original photos from your iPhone once they are backed up to Google. The files will be stored at a lower resolution than if you buy a Pixel, though. Verdict Both the iPhone 7 and Google’s Pixel provide long-overdue ways to mitigate range anxiety. But solving one problem may lead to another kind of nervousness, this time about privacy. Taking full advantage of the Pixel’s cloud back-up and Assistant means going all-in on Google, giving its smartphone constant access to your location, your photos and your most personal information. If that sounds too much to entrust to one company, then combining Apple’s hardware with some of Google’s software may provide a better balance.

After GSMArena pointed out how the 32GB version of the iPhone 7 uses a much slower storage module, there is now another report by Cellular Insights that points to varying levels of network reception in places where the network signal could be a bit weak. Apple this year, with its iPhone 7 models used Qualcomm modems on some and Intel modems on others devices. While the consumer thinks that both in reality should perform identically in the same conditions, testing by Cellular Insights in a report by Apple Insider show irregularities. While both Qualcomm and Intel-based units performed the same in areas with good coverage, in areas with a fainter signal, Qualcomm units outperformed the Intel ones. By how much? Well, that performance gap would be roughly 30 percent. To give better insight (rather making things worse) following tests also included other smartphones for comparison like the iPhone 6s, LG G5, Nexus 5X and the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. From the report, its clear that Intel-based iPhone 7 got left in the dust while the Galaxy S7 edge was the winner. For now it isn’t clear how much of a difference this has made to users of the iPhone 7 (or whether they have even noticed the reception problem). Moreover, Apple recently pushed out an update that addressed earlier reception issues, and customers don’t seem to be reporting too many problems with reception as well (for now).

If a video is available for free through Netflix, for instance, that will be the most prominent option By: AP | New York | Published:October 21, 2016 8:42 am Amazon will offer viewers a choice of providers. If a video is available for free through Netflix, for instance, that will be the most prominent option (Source: AP) Amazon’s own video store will no longer have the starring role on the company’s Fire TV streaming devices. Software updates coming this year will give movies and TV shows from Netflix, HBO and other competitors equal prominence on the devices’ home screen. The approach is similar to one Apple took when it refreshed its Apple TV device last year. Amazon’s Fire TV has offered solid performance at reasonable prices, but its home screen has been cluttered with Amazon products – whether to rent or buy, or offered at no extra charge through Amazon’s $99-a-year Prime program. That’s made it tough to find video from competing providers without turning to a voice-search feature that, until recently, excluded Netflix. For the most part, finding video typically required opening a service’s app first. Now, competing services will be offered space on the home screen. Netflix, for instance, could choose to highlight its original series “Stranger Things” alongside personalized recommendations. Netflix could also include a short video trailer that plays on the home screen. And while Amazon has long had a watch list for viewers to keep track of what they want to watch, choosing a title has directed the viewer back to Amazon’s store. Now, Amazon will offer viewers a choice of providers. If a video is available for free through Netflix, for instance, that will be the most prominent option, even if Amazon’s own store is selling the same title. The development comes as leading video services make major investments in original shows, making it difficult for any single service to fulfill all of a viewer’s needs.

Jones , USA TODAY 7:48 p.m. EDT October 20, 2016 7.1k Shares 'Watch the Throne' fall?  (Photo: Christopher Polk, Getty Images For BET) Kanye West aired a little Family Business during his Saint Pablo tour stop in Seattle Wednesday. While onstage, the rapper shared that he and his "big brother" Jay Z will not collaborate on a follow-up to their platinum-selling collaborative album, Watch the Throne. The reason? "TIDAL/Apple bull----." West says the ongoing tension between the competing streaming services is also why his verse on Pop Style didn't make the studio version of Drake's Views album, which was released exclusively on Apple. "It will never be a Watch The Throne 2," he said. "You know why? Because that’s the reason why I wasn’t on the song. I wasn’t on the song 'cause of Hov. 'Cause it’s this TIDAL/Apple bull----." And those politics seem to have gotten personal with West revealing that North, his 3-year-old daughter with Kim Kardashian, and Blue Ivy, Jay Z's 4-year-old daughter with Beyoncé, haven't even had a playdate. "I can’t take this (expletive), bro!" West said. "Our kids ain't never even played together." And if that wasn't enough to have fans say Mercy, West added that he and Jay Z haven't seen each other since Kim Kardashian's traumatic robbery experience in Paris. "Don't call me after the robbery and say, 'How you feelin'?'" he said. "You wanna know how I'm feelin'? Come by the house. Bring the kids by the house. Like we brothers, let's sit down."

LeEco heralded its entrance into the US market during a Wednesday showcase in San Francisco, where the company unveiled a sleek smartphone called the LePro 3 that will sell for $400 and an internet-connected TV with a seven-foot screen priced at $5,000. LeEco positions the LePro 3 as an alternative to Apple Inc's latest iPhone and Google's Pixel phone, whose prices both start at $650. The company is promising its giant TV, called the UMax 85, will be as good or better than other high-end home entertainment systems that cost $8,000. Both the phone and TV will go on sale Nov 2 in LeEco's online store, LeWeb.com. The company is also selling a smaller smartphone and smaller TVs with screens ranging from 43 inches to 65 inches. Besides the phones and TVs, LeEco also is coming to the US with a virtual-reality headset, a high-tech bicycle and an electric car in a challenge to Tesla Motors Inc. The company wants to bundle the devices with other services, including an online video package of shows and movies that ties into its origins as the "Netflix of China.'' LeEco, which stands for "Happy Ecosystem,'' is branching out to challenge technology leaders who have been able to demand a premium for their products partly because they have been pleasing US consumers for years. "America is the most important global market for us,'' LeEco CEO Jia Yueting said through a translator during a presentation. "Once we get the hearts and minds of US users, we can move on to the hearts and minds of global users.'' Innovation in the US has hit a "bottleneck,'' making it an optimal time for LeEco to enter the market, Jia said in an interview with the Associated Press that was also translated. He envisions creating a platform that enables consumers to hopscotch from LeEco TVs to phones to cars to watch its video service and use other applications that that company plans to introduce. "The company is using the devices as Trojan horses, to deliver its digital services,'' said Gartner Inc analyst Werner Goertz. "This is a general trend in the industry, and LeEco is a prime example of how companies are subsidising hardware with ulterior motives.'' "Google is similarly selling its new Pixel phone in an effort to drive more traffic to its search engine and other service,'' he noted, though that device "is being sold at a premium price.'' Amazon.com Inc's Echo, an internet-connected speaker that understands and responds to spoken language, also is designed to get boost sales at the company's e-commerce site. The expectations for LeEco are modest. Research firm Strategy Analytics Inc projects that LeEco will sell about 25 million smartphones worldwide this year. By comparison, Apple had sold 214 million iPhones in the past year ending in June.

Tech companies like Snapchat and Skype’s owner Microsoft are failing to adopt basic privacy protections on their instant messaging services, putting users’ human rights at risk, Amnesty International said today. The organization’s new ‘Message Privacy Ranking’ assesses the 11 companies with the most popular messaging apps on the way they use encryption to protect users’ privacy and freedom of expression across their messaging apps. “If you think instant messaging services are private, you are in for a big surprise. The reality is that our communications are under constant threat from cybercriminals and spying by state authorities. Young people, the most prolific sharers of personal details and photos over apps like Snapchat, are especially at risk,” said Sherif Elsayed-Ali, Head of Amnesty International’s Technology and Human Rights Team. Amnesty International has highlighted end-to end encryption, a way of scrambling data so that only the sender and recipient can see it, as a minimum requirement for technology companies to ensure that private information in messaging apps stays private. The companies that ranked lowest on the scorecard do not have adequate levels of encryption in place on their messaging apps. “It is up to tech firms to respond to well-known threats to their users’ privacy and freedom of expression, yet many companies are falling at the first hurdle by failing to provide an adequate level of encryption. Millions of people are using messaging apps that deny them even the most basic privacy protection,” said Sherif Elsayed-Ali. Amnesty International’s ‘Message Privacy Ranking’ ranks technology companies on a scale of one to 100 based on how well they do five things: · Recognize online threats to their users’ privacy and freedom of expression · Apply end-to-end encryption as a default · Make users aware of threats to their rights, and the level of encryption in place · Disclose details of government requests to the company for user data, and how they respond · Publish technical details of their encryption systems Tencent, Blackberry and Snapchat score less than 30/100 Chinese firm Tencent came bottom, scoring zero out of 100, ranked as the company taking least action on messaging privacy, and the least transparent. It was followed by Blackberry and Snapchat scoring 20 and 26 respectively. Despite Microsoft’s strong policy commitment to human rights, it is still using a weak form of encryption on Skype, scoring 40 and leaving it four places from the bottom. None of these companies provide end-to-end encryption of their users’ communications. Snapchat, a US-based company used by more than 100 million people every day, also scored badly. Although it has a strong policy commitment towards privacy, in practice it does not do enough to protect its users’ privacy. It does not deploy end-to-end encryption, for example, and is not transparent in informing users about the threats to their human rights or its use of encryption. Facebook, Apple lead the way No company provides watertight privacy, but Facebook, whose apps Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp together have 2 billion users, has the highest score with 73 out of 100. Facebook is doing the most out of the 11 companies assessed to use encryption to respond to human rights threats, and is most transparent about the action it’s taking. However, despite including end-to-end encryption as an option with its new “secret conversation” feature, Facebook Messenger’s default mode uses a weaker form of encryption, which means Facebook has access to all the data. WhatsApp uses end-to-end encryption by default and notably provides clear information to users about encryption within the app. Apple scored 67 out of 100, providing full end-to-end encryption in all communications on its iMessage and Facetime apps. But Apple needs to do more to make users aware that SMS messages are less secure than iMessages. The company should also adopt a more open encryption protocol that allows for full independent verification. End-to-end encryption: a basic protection few firms provide Instant messaging services like WhatsApp, Skype and Viber are used by hundreds of millions of people every day. This includes human rights activists, opposition politicians and journalists living in countries where their work could put them in grave danger. With large data breaches occurring all too frequently and governments’ mass surveillance operations unabated, the strongest encryption as well as transparency about who has access to message data, is key to protecting them. Yet only three firms, Apple, Line and Viber scored full marks for providing end-to-end encryption by default on all their messaging apps. “Most technology companies are simply not up to standard when it comes to protecting their users’ privacy. Activists around the world rely on encryption to protect themselves from spying by authorities, and it is unacceptable for technology companies to expose them to danger by failing to adequately respond to the human rights risks,” said Sherif Elsayed-Ali. “The future of privacy and free speech online depends to a very large extent on whether tech companies provide services that protect our communications, or serve them up on a plate for prying eyes.” Amnesty International is calling on companies to apply end-to-end encryption to messaging apps as a default. This would help protect the rights of everyday people, as well as peaceful activists and persecuted minorities all over the world by enabling them to exercise their freedom of speech. It is also calling on technology companies to publish full details of the policies and practices they have in place to meet their responsibility to respect the rights to privacy and freedom of expression. ends Content Sourced from scoop.co.nz Original url  Print This Post Tweet     Blogroll China Economic Scan Compare house prices Deposit Rates Direct Broking – NZX & ASX Trading & Prices Findata – Market Data Good Returns Herald Business Interest.co.nz – Interest Rates News & Views National Business Review Property Talk Sharechat Stuff Business Value Cruncher – NZX Latest Business news DCC Blocks 2017 Petroleum Offer Theresa Gattung Venture Capital fund Tower estimates quake could trim profit by up to $7.2 mln MYOB awarded Service Provider of the Year Antipodes Gold Reverse Takeover Update Hamilton’s outlying villages see boost in house hunters New World Kaikoura re-opens NZ dollar little changed below 71 US cents as greenback Unique chance to develop consented lifestyle land in Twizel Candidates for Fonterra Board of Directors’ Election Go Green Expo a breeding ground for pseudoscience Update to Wellington roads Wellington highways closed due to surface flooding When strangers call bearing investment gifts: hang up Fonterra chooses Epson projectors for dynamic edge blending Text Links Recent Comments Lan: Unbelievable that a WEST AUSTR... jackp: Murray, when Key is involved t...

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Kanye West Blames Apple Music/Tidal Rivalry For Killing Projects By Tyler Lee on 10/20/2016 18:39 PST While there are plenty of music streaming services out there today that could be considered competition for Apple Music, the Cupertino company’s music streaming service seems to be more closely associated with the likes of Tidal. Now competition is generally considered healthy, which is why regulatory companies tend to frown upon monopolies. However if there is someone who doesn’t appreciate the Apple Music/Tidal rivalry, it would be none other than artist Kanye West. Speaking during his Saint Pablo tour, West revealed that the rivalry could have potentially killed off some projects. West named one song in particular “Pop Style” in which the original song by Drake featured both him and Jay-Z, but apparently that version did not make it onto Drake’s VIEWS album due to the rivalry between Apple Music and Tidal. According to West, “Y’all didn’t get, what y’all were supposed to get with me and Drake on this song because of some Tidal/Apple bullshit. Every time I perform this song I think about this shit. I think about the politics. I think about how hard I go for music, for art, for y’all.” He also adds that a second “Watch The Throne” album will not be possible due to the rivalry as well. “It will never be a Watch The Throne 2. You know why? Because that’s the reason why I wasn’t on the song. I wasn’t on the song cause of Hov. Cause it’s this TIDAL/Apple bullshit. And this shit be getting me tight every time I perform this muthafucka.” Drake’s affiliation with Apple is well-documented, with his (in)famous “Hotline Bling” video having been funded by Apple themselves. West himself has proven to be more of a Tidal fan and his album, The Life of Pablo, was initially exclusive to Tidal before it was eventually released onto both Spotify and Apple Music.

If you're wondering whether it's worth picking up, I'd say yes — with a few caveats. If you don't have an iPhone, then, sorry, the Apple Watch is not for you. For iPhone users, the new series 2 will appeal most to those who have tried or considered a fitness band, but found them lacking. Looks do matter While other watches such as the Huawei Watch or Moto 360 have tried to ape the design of traditional watches, the new Apple Watch maintains the large, squarish watch case and it unabashedly stands out as a digital device. This time, however, the Watch adds a ceramic case as an option, besides stainless steel and aluminium. Why ceramic? Apple's choice is actually pretty current in the world of watches; ceramic watches being prized for their resistance to scratches. Non-ceramic case Watches do use zirconia ceramic at the back - it's non-conductive and unlike metal, will not interfere with the wireless charger used to recharge the watch's battery. Even if you choose the cheapest aluminium case, it's easy enough to dress up the watch by selecting one of the many bands available. It is super simple to replace the Watch's bands. Merely depress a latch on the case and you can slide a strap out of the requisite slot, to fit in a new one. Of course, some might complain about the proprietary design that doesn't make buying an ordinary watch strap an option. Still, Apple provides enough colour options and materials — nylon, stainless steel, fluoroelastomer (Apple's custom polymer sport band material) — that you'd be have quite a few choices. There are also third-party straps on the market, though they are harder to come by in Malaysia. This reviewer's particular favourite is the classy Milanese Loop band. With its chain link finish and magnetic clasp, it is easily adjustable to any wrist size. The black stainless steel case with the black Milanese Loop band variant is probably the best looking in the bunch; only pity is that Apple only offers its ceramic case in white. A black ceramic case would probably sell pretty well judging by how popular the Jet Black iPhones are right now. A better battery Apple has tweaked the new Watch to have a better battery, after criticism over the last version's unimpressive battery life. In testing, I found the watch to last about two days for ordinary usage (no workout logging) but on workout days, would need charging after about a day's usage. The continued Bluetooth connection to your smartphone will not take much of a toll on the Watch but will sap your iPhone. My recommendation? Don't forget to turn off the Bluetooth on your iPhone at night but you can still set your phone in Nightstand mode, placing it on its side and on the charger. You can even set an Alarm on the Watch, no iPhone needed. Even with notifications and playing a few Apple Watch-compatible games, I found the Apple Watch's battery would last me through the day. A marathon runner, however, might find the battery draining faster with GPS and the heart rate monitor enabled. You can disable the latter as well as the fitness tracker to save battery on days they're not being used. Choosing the new series 2 means more strap options at your nearest Apple store. Your swimming companion What will appeal to regular swimmers is the Apple Watch's waterproofing. While it's not made for activities that require deep immersion (scuba diving) or heavier water activity (jet skis), for swimming in the pool, the Apple Watch works just fine. It now has a special lock function that will auto-lock the Watch when it detects water and to unlock it, all you need to is turn the digital crown on the right side of Watch until the screen indicator says your watch is unlocked. The special unlocking function also dispels water from the Watch's speakers -- very neat. Wearing it in the shower, as I've tried, is also pretty convenient. You can still glance at the time, when you turn the watch face towards you, but you can't use the Watch to answer calls or access other functions, thanks to the auto-lock mechanism. Do note that you shouldn't do this if you're using a leather or steel strap: stick to showering with the sports band strap with the Watch instead. A Zen-like experience A new app on the Watch might win my personal "least annoying/most useful default app ever" award. I'm talking about the Breathe app. The Breathe app is the equivalent of a Meditation 101 app; at certain intervals, it will exhort you to take a short break to just breathe — showing an animation as well as vibrating on your wrist as you inhale and exhale. You can even customise how long the sessions last, as well as how often you get the reminder to use the app. It's a nice way to help those who find themselves stressed on a regular basis find time to just, as the app says, breathe. Sure, it sounds super hippie and a little twee, but just taking a few deep breaths to calm yourself can be a great help. The screen is twice as bright now, with a 1,000 nit rating: bright enough to be easily viewable outside or indoors. Minor niggles While the Workout app works fine when tracking ordinary workouts such as running or swimming, it's not quite as smart at tracking workouts on the "Other" spectrum. Despite doing heavy work clearing brush and felling overgrown foliage in my backyard, the watch insisted I had only burned 160 calories all day. My aching arms and back would probably disagree. The watch did freeze on me a couple of times during the week I was testing it but a simple reboot sorted it out. What I was not quite crazy about was the learning curve at trying to navigate the Home screen and switching through apps; it was a lot less intuitive than I'd like — a tweak of the Apple Watch app might make it easier for future new users of the Watch. What is certain, though is that this is a very good, fitness-centric upgrade of the Apple Watch series. Overall, the Apple Watch still offers a far more fun and seamless experience when compared to its Android Wear rivals and is much better looking than any of the dedicated fitness bands out there. When it comes to a smartwatch that works well for both work and play, the Apple Watch still does it better. For the more budget-conscious, the original Apple Watch is a much cheaper option at RM1,199 but the older processor is slower and it does not have GPS or waterproofing, with only the aluminium case with sports band option available on the online store. You might, however, find the older variants selling on discount at local Apple distributors if you're lucky. To view the available models, visit the official online Apple Store. Pricing is as follows: Apple Watch Series 1 (Aluminium case only) Sport Band 38mm: RM1,199 Sport Band 42mm: RM1,299 Apple Watch Series 2 Aluminium case: Sport Band/Woven Nylon 38mm: RM1,649 Sport Band/Woven Nylon 42mm: RM1,749 Stainless Steel case: Sport Band/Woven Nylon 38mm: RM2,499 Sport Band/Woven Nylon 42mm: RM2,749 Saddle Brown Classic Buckle 38mm: RM2,999 Saddle Brown Classic Buckle 42mm: RM3,249 Midnight Blue Modern Buckle 38mm: RM3,499 Midnight Blue Leather Loop 42mm: RM3,249 Milanese Loop 38mm: RM2,999 Milanese Loop 42mm: RM3,249 Link Bracelet 38mm: RM4,299 Link Bracelet 42mm: RM4,549 Black Stainless Steel case: Black Milanese Loop 38mm: RM3,249 Black Milanese Loop 42mm: RM3,449 Black Link Bracelet 38mm: RM4,799 Black Link Bracelet 42mm: RM5,049 Apple Watch Nike+ (Series 2) with Aluminium case: Nike Sport Band 38mm: RM1,649 Nike Sport Band 42mm: RM1,749 Apple Watch Edition (Series 2) with Ceramic case: Sport Band 38mm: RM5,699 Sport Band 42mm: RM5,949 The Apple Watch series 2 and series 1 should be available on the official webstore soon, but it should already be purchaseable at your nearest official Apple distributor.

Prior to this, Apple had pretty much used Qualcomm’s modems exclusively. When it was discovered that Intel’s modems are being used, we also wondered how this might impact performance. Turns out there is some difference. According to some tests that have been conducted, it was discovered that Qualcomm’s modems appear to have better reception in places where the signal is fainter. This means that if you’re inside a building or underground, the tests seem to suggest that the Qualcomm model will provide you with better service than the Intel model. The disparity in performance was not just limited to the iPhone 7. Cellular Insights, who performed the test, brought in other phones as comparisons which included the iPhone 6s, LG G5, Google Nexus 5X, and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. It seems that the Intel iPhone 7 got left in the dust while the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge proved to be the clear winner. Now whether or not this will affect your daily usage remains to be seen. So far there doesn’t appear to be too many complaints regarding reception (there were issues with reception but those were addressed with software fixes), meaning that maybe in real-world usage the disparity can’t be felt as much. It also reminds us of the time the iPhone 6s was discovered to have chipsets made by Samsung and TSMC, with the latter proving to have better battery life than the former, although like we said then, those were merely tests and real-world usage is probably what really matters.

Speaking at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit in San Francisco, Mr. Cue said that Apple was focused on making it easy to access content from everyone. Apple has produced original content, mostly for its Apple Music streaming service, and is known to be developing other shows, too. But according to CNet, Mr. Cue insisted Apple isn’t trying to go toe-to-toe with companies like Netflix with original programming. “You’re not seeing a huge number of them,” he said about Apple original shows. “The real opportunity for us is to make it easier to get access to all this content.” Apple TV Apple has been trying to launch some kind of streaming video service for years, with leaks coming from a variety of industry sources. Many (including me) have speculated that Apple might turn to developing its own shows as way of establishing itself in the market, but Mr. Cue’s comments suggest there are limits to what Apple is willing to do on that front. Mr. Cue was on stage with HBO chairman and CEO Richard Plepler.

The iPhone maker said it has been buying phony accessories on Amazon bearing the Apple name and found that a whopping 90 percent of those are counterfeit. A customer reviews faulty product after it malfunctions Jack Percher Even more troubling, Apple said, the phony products "pose an immediate threat to consumer safety," because they haven't been put through the rigorous industry standard testing Apple uses. In a review posted Dec. 24, a customer shared a photo of a charred charger, writing that "after just a few hours of use on the every first day, the charger literally caught on fire." Related: First U.S. Suit Filed Over Exploding Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Smartphones With the safety of customers and the protection of its reputation in mind, Apple filed a lawsuit Monday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco against Mobile Star L.L.C., the company selling many of the products Apple bought on Amazon. "Mobile Star has been deceiving Apple customers and putting their safety at risk by selling counterfeit power adapters. They have ignored our repeated requests, so we are taking legal action to get them to stop," Josh Rosenstock, a spokesman for Apple, told NBC News. It's not always easy to tell whether what you're buying is the real deal. An example listed in the lawsuit shows how customers could easily believe they were buying products from Apple when they weren't. The listing says the product's being sold by Apple — but the fine print notes that it ships from one of Amazon's fulfillment centers. A customer compares two iPhones at an Apple Store in Chicago last month. AP Amazon identified Mobile Star as the supplier, according to the lawsuit, and turned over the additional inventory of Apple products that the company bought from Mobile Star. Apple said it determined that the majority were fake. Mobile Star didn't immediately respond to NBC News' request for an interview. Amazon wasn't named as a party in the lawsuit. Aaron Toso, a spokesman for Amazon, told NBC News that the retailer "has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits on our site." "We work closely with manufacturers and brands, and pursue wrongdoers aggressively," Toso said. For Apple, the problem of counterfeits may be a game of whack-a-mole. The company said in the lawsuit that "each month, Apple identifies and reports many thousands of listings for counterfeit and infringing Apple products to Amazon.com under its notice and takedown procedures."

October 20 AAPL: 117.06 -0.06 Comment: Kanye West has a point when he says the Apple vs Tidal battle is harming the music industry Chance Miller - 4 weeks ago @ChanceHMiller Apple Music View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Kanye West has a storied history when it comes to offering his opinion on the music and tech industry, specifically relating to Apple and its battle for exclusive content. This time, West took time during a performance as part of his Saint Pablo tour to address the race for exclusive content between Apple and Tidal, slamming the entire station. And I actually agree with him, as scary as that is to say. Prior to the performance of the song “Pop Style” last night in Seattle, Kanye discussed what went into the song originally. “Pop Style,” for those unfamiliar, is a song off Drake’s latest album “Views,” though an early version of the track featured a verse from Kanye as well as Jay Z. According to West’s monologue at last night’s show, however, one of the reasons for him and Jay Z not appearing on the album version is because of Views being an Apple Music exclusive. Jay Z, of course, is the owner of streaming music service Tidal, while Drake has been a supporter of Apple Music from the start. According to Kanye, Jay Z originally claimed that he didn’t want to be featured on “Pop Style” out of respect for Meek Mill, who Drake has a long-running feud with. When Kanye offered to call up Drake and Meek Mill and resolve the issue, though, the reason for Jay Z not appearing on the track turned into a variety of other reasons. Kanye explains it best (via Billboard): “Then Jay thought about it, and out of respect for Meek Mill he didn’t want to be on the track. And I said, ‘Look, I’ll call Drake, I’ll call Meek, I’ll call y’all, we gotta squash this sh-t, we gotta let people have this song. But then it went out of that and went into some Tidal, some political sh-t, some sh-t about percentages on songs. I can’t take this sh-t, bro. I wasn’t on this song ’cause of Hov. Cause of this Tidal-Apple bullsh-t. And this sh-t be getting me tight every time I perform this motherf—er. That y’all didn’t get what y’all were supposed to get with me and Drake on this song ’cause of some Tidal – Apple bullsh-t.” Essentially what we have here are two rappers on either side of the fence — Jay Z with Tidal and Drake with Apple Music — and Kanye stuck in the middle. Kanye is one of the many artists who own a portion of Tidal, but seems to be of the opinion that the business-aspect of music streaming is hurting the creativity side, as am I. Kanye has spoken out about this issue before via his infamous Twitter rants. Over the summer, the rapper discussed the issue on Twitter, saying that the “beef” between Tidal and Apple Music was hurting the music industry before calling for a meeting between Tim Cook, Jimmy Iovine, and Larry Jackson, as well as Jay Z, Drake, and Scooter Braun Ultimately because of this drama between Apple and Tidal, Kanye says that we won’t be getting a Watch The Throne 2 album because of the Apple Music and Tidal drama hurting his and Jay Z’s relationship. Personally, this is something I agree with Kanye on. Music is music and the fact that the race for exclusive content between streaming services is preventing collaborations from happening is simply and matter of factly not good for the listener. The music should come first, not the business. And this is coming from someone who isn’t exactly thrilled to agree with Kanye West on something. The issue here, however, is how do we resolve this problem? Apple has been rumored in the past to have held interest in acquiring Tidal, though the company has denied that. Certainly an acquisition would ultimately solve the issue, it’s not necessarily the best way to go about it. Universal Music Group earlier this year stated that it would no longer negotiate with streaming services for exclusive rights after getting embarrassingly burned by Frank Ocean. More labels taking this approach would lend a hand in solving the issues currently facing streaming music services. Apple Music head Jimmy Iovine himself has said that the ultimate goal of Apple Music is to provide music fans the best way to listen to music possible, but the situation between Kanye West and Jay Z is evidence that it’s not necessarily succeeding at that goal. Sure the Kanye West and Jay Z issue is the first we’ve heard publicly about, it’s impossible to know what else has gone on behind the scenes where someone with a big-mouth like Kanye isn’t involved. Sure the industry surrounding rap music has always been somewhat like this, with artists having feuds with one another and verses being cut from tracks at the last minute. But this seems significantly different to me personally. Less exclusive content would be the beginning of solving the issue, but wouldn’t entirely fix it. And to be frank, I’m not sure what will. Streaming music services lately have turned the music industry into a more toxic environment than it ever has been. What do you think?

She is also a victim of domestic violence. Those two realities have collided, as Giants kicker Josh Brown has admitted to abusing his wife. Giants owner John Mara addressed Brown's situation during an appearance on WFAN on Thursday afternoon. Brown did not travel with the Giants to their game in London on Sunday, but he remains on the team. "He's admitted to us he's abused his wife in the past," Mara said. "But what I think is a little unclear is the extent of that." Mara's stunning revelation That comment created outrage on social media. Apple, who has a column with SI.com and contributes to ESPN's Sunday NFL Countdown, sounded off on her verified Twitter account that has more than 25,000 followers. Apple tweeted that "as a domestic violence survivor, reading these Mara comments makes me sad, angry and completely baffled. He just doesn't get it. This is sad." As a domestic violence survivor, reading these Mara comments makes me sad, angry and completely baffled. He just doesn't get it. This is sad — Annie Apple (@SurvivinAmerica) October 20, 2016 That started a string of tweets during which Apple condemned domestic violence and the Giants' handling of the Brown situation. I'm more sad than embarrassed. My heart breaks for a woman who had to live in fear for her life& daily safety. That makes me sad. Been there https://t.co/q3DR4ETzgv — Annie Apple (@SurvivinAmerica) October 20, 2016 It's one thing to like someone or even a team. It's a whole other thing to cosign the bullsh*t. Don't cosign the bull. — Annie Apple (@SurvivinAmerica) October 20, 2016 By the first time a domestic violence victim calls police, there are dozens of times b4 that she didn't. Takes courage to seek help, justice — Annie Apple (@SurvivinAmerica) October 20, 2016 And Molly Brown is somebody's daughter, sister, mother; more importantly a human. It's not about my son's boss.

(Associated Press) By MICHAEL LIEDTKE, Associated Press Published: October 20, 2016, 5:14 PM A   A SAN FRANCISCO — Most U.S. consumers haven’t heard of LeEco, but the Chinese technology company is setting out to become a household name with smartphones and flat-screen TVs that undercut the prices of Apple, Google, Samsung and other industry stalwarts. LeEco heralded its entrance into the U.S. market during a Wednesday showcase in San Francisco, where the company unveiled a sleek smartphone called the LePro 3 that will sell for $400 and an internet-connected TV with a 7-foot screen priced at $5,000. LeEco positions the LePro 3 as an alternative to Apple’s latest iPhone and Google’s Pixel phone, whose prices both start at $650. LeEco is promising its giant TV, called the UMax 85, will be as good or better than other home entertainment systems that cost $8,000. Both the phone and TV will go on sale Nov. 2 in LeEco’s online store, LeMall.com. The company also is selling a smaller smartphone and smaller TVs with screens ranging from 43 inches to 65 inches. Besides the phones and TVs, LeEco also is coming to the U.S. with a virtual-reality headset, a high-tech bicycle and an electric car in a challenge to Tesla Motors. The company wants to bundle the devices with other services, including an online video package that ties into its origins as the “Netflix of China.” LeEco, which stands for “Happy Ecosystem,” is branching out to challenge technology leaders who have been able to demand a premium for their products partly because they have been pleasing U.S. consumers for years. “America is the most important global market for us,” LeEco CEO Jia Yueting said through a translator during a presentation. “Once we get the hearts and minds of U.S. users, we can move on to the hearts and minds of global users.” Innovation in the U.S. has hit a “bottleneck,” making it an optimal time for LeEco to enter the market, Jia said in an interview with The Associated Press that was also translated. He envisions creating a platform that enables consumers to hopscotch from LeEco TVs to phones to cars to watch its video service and use other applications that the company plans to introduce. The company is using the devices as “Trojan horses,” to deliver its digital services, said Gartner analyst Werner Goertz. “This is a general trend in the industry, and LeEco is a prime example of how companies are subsidizing hardware with ulterior motives.” Google is similarly selling its Pixel phone in an effort to drive traffic to its search engine and other service, Goertz noted, though that device is being sold at a premium price. Amazon.com’s Echo, an internet-connected speaker that understands and responds to spoken language, also is designed to get boost sales at the company’s e-commerce site. The expectations for LeEco are modest. The research firm Strategy Analytics projects that LeEco will sell about 25 million smartphones worldwide this year. By comparison, Apple had sold 214 million iPhones in the past year ending in June. Other Chinese companies that tried to make a splash in the U.S. electronics market have barely made a ripple. But LeEco is making a major commitment. During the summer, the company paid $2 billion for budget-TV maker Vizio, a well-known brand in the U.S. that sells in Costco and other chains. It employs several hundred workers at its U.S. headquarters in San Jose, Calif., with ambitions to expand in Silicon Valley. Earlier this year, it spent another $250 million to snap up a 50-acre site in Santa Clara, Calif., where it has approval to build an office complex that could span up to 3 million square feet and accommodate about 12,000 workers. Jia plans to call the complex “EcoWorld.” “They are not taking a half-baked approach,” Goertz said. “But I think they are going to be hemorrhaging money for the foreseeable future. The question is how long they can sustain this strategy?” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

The company this week sent invitations to the media, asking them to gather at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., for a product launch event. Apple is widely expected to introduce a batch of laptops at the event — an area of the company’s product lineup that has gone without a major refresh for quite a while. Apple hasn’t updated its Retina MacBook Pro or MacBook Air in more than a year; the company did offer a refresh of its MacBook in April. The standard MacBook Pro hasn’t had an update in four years. The timing of the event puts Apple in the sweet spot for the holiday season. The new system has a lot of new features, but chief among them is Siri. Rumors have been flying for some time about what Apple might have planned for its laptops. They include the suspicion that Apple will add Touch ID to its laptops and that the firm will add USB-C to all of its laptop models.

The new midsize prestige-sport-luxury sedan will take on segment rivals such as the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Audi A6 family, the Lexus GS, and the Cadillac CTS, as well as its next-generation successor that’s believed to adopt the Cadillac CT5 nomenclature. During the unveiling, not only did BMW emphasize the new model’s redesigned architecture, powertrain, driving dynamics and performance, but the Bavarian automaker also made it a point to highlight the model’s various technology features, including assistive driving and in-vehicle tech, the most notable being the first shipping iteration of wireless Apple CarPlay. In other words, BMW beat everyone else — including General Motors — to the punch in offering a cord-free CarPlay experience, no longer requiring an Apple Lightning cable to take advantage of the advanced phone integration feature set. Apple CarPlay in a 2016 Cadillac CTS “And smartphone integration has been further improved – from Apple CarPlay (which, in a first for a carmaker, has been incorporated fully wirelessly), to inductive phone charging and the WiFi hotspot for up to ten devices,” BMW started in its press release. CarPlay works via BMW’s iDrive infotainment system by integrating phone, navigation, entertainment, as well as vehicle control and information features onto its central 10.25-inch touchscreen. Now in its fifth generation, the system enables drivers to interact with the system using the iDrive Touch Controller, voice commands, gestures, or by touching the screen. Though not specifically described by BMW, we would presume that CarPlay takes over part or all of that widescreen display when in use. In addition to wireless CarPlay, the 2017 5 Series will also offer an inductive phone charging system based on the Qi standard. The automaker is even offering official BMW wireless charging cases for the iPhone 5/5s and iPhone 6/6s, which do not support inductive charging out of the box. Also available is a Wi-Fi hotspot capable of supporting 10 connected devices. The GM Authority Take BMW has been the one automaker with the slowest uptake of CarPlay, so this development is rather surprising. Here’s to hoping that GM — whcih was one of the first automakers in the world to adopt CarPlay — isn’t far behind in adopting the wireless variant across its own vehicles. To note, wireless Apple CarPlay has been available since the release of iOS 9, or for roughly a year.

New car programs typically take 3-5 years. Any tech that goes into a new car MUST be proven in the marketplace and in safety tests, THEN it has to be integrated into a vehicle program. Most new features are integrated in a new architecture; some architectures have lasted multiple decades. This is why mobile devices blow cars away – they have development cycles measured in months, not years. Vehicle components have dev cycles measured in months, but then you have to integrate them. Reply Alex Luft says: October 21, 2016 at 9:06 am What you are describing is true of embedded tech and active safety systems, but does not apply to third party integrations like CarPlay or Android Auto. These kinds of tech can be slipstreamed on the fly, even via an OTA update (for 4G LTE vehicles) if GM so desired. Apple CarPlay has “been proven” in the marketplace, with demand being higher than availability of vehicles with the system. Meanwhile, wireless CarPlay guidelines and standards have been available for integration for over 13 months at this point, more than enough time to integrate it into 2017 model year vehicles. In all, GM has had a decent amount of time to integrate this logical update into a system demand for which is extremely high… and BMW beat them to it. The sad part is that GM was (and in many ways, still is) a leader in deploying CarPlay in the marketplace, while BMW has traditionally been the laggard. Reply Scott3 says: October 21, 2016 at 3:51 am Well tech like this is not difficult to install in a car and since they already have Apple Play there is no major obstetrical to adding this. A feature like this does not need a new architecture to be put into a car. As you note BMW did this in one car i expect GM has this going into many of these cars at once much like how they introduced Apple play. The 6s has no wireless charging yet a and I am getting a 7 today that I believe still has no wireless charging. It is expected in the 8. As shown here you have to use a special case for the wireless charging on an Apple so if anything they are behind and GM could be waiting on this. Samsung is the leader in wireless charging and unfortunately fires at the moment. As for much of this phone technology we will see it change in cars about as fast as the phones change. The My link in my 2012 is very old now compared to what is out. I expect the changes will be coming fast and often to the future car and in some cases automakers will really start to use this as a selling point. We should see this in most of their products in 2 years and less. They may be working also around future Apple Products too. The 8 is expected to be a major change and they may have targeted that model. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Share Tweet Whatsapp Email Share Many Apple products on Amazon are fake - Yahoo7 Pinterest Tumblr Apple says it has been buying Apple chargers and cables labelled as genuine on Amazon.com and has found nearly 90 per cent of them to be counterfeit. The revelation comes in a federal lawsuit filed by Apple against a New Jersey company on Monday over what Apple says are counterfeit products that were sold on Amazon. In the lawsuit, Apple says Mobile Star imprinted Apple logos on cables and chargers that "pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock". It says the chargers and cables were being sold on Amazon as genuine Apple products. Apple says it purchased the products on Amazon and later told the online retailer that they were fake. Amazon then identified Mobile Star as the source. Amazon isn't named in the suit, but said in a statement that it has "zero tolerance" for counterfeiters on its site and that it pursues "wrongdoers" aggressively. Mobile Star didn't return a voicemail seeking comment.

The success of the temporary storefront Google opened in the trendy Soho neighbourhood could help the California-based company decide whether to follow Apple’s lead and operate its own brick-and-mortar retail operation. The New York pop-up shop will be open through the end of this year, and let people get their hands on new Google devices such as Pixel smartphones which began shipping yesterday in a direct challenge to Apple’s latest iPhones. “This is not even a testing ground, just an extension of the launch,” Google spokeswoman Chrissy Persico said at the showroom opening event. “We want people to come in and experience the products.” Google early this month took on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into hardware, launching the in-house designed Pixel smartphone and a slew of other devices showcasing artificial intelligence prowess. By producing both the phone hardware and its Android software, Google is making a more direct assault on Apple and its tightly controlled ecosystem. The pop-up shop also displayed Google’s freshly unveiled Daydream View virtual reality headset, a modular Wi-Fi system, and a Home virtual assistant that will challenge the Amazon Echo device. Nothing is sold at the Google shop, but the staff directs potential customers to the company’s online store or telephone operators who can take orders for products. People visit the new Google pop-up shop in the SoHo neighbourhood in New York October 21, 2016. — AFP pic‘Big battle’ A wall in the shop is decorated with an artful arrangement of blue, red, yellow and green blocks, arranged to display the internet company’s trademark colours. Only 30 or so visitors ventured into the pop-up store for its opening morning, a lean showing in comparison to mobs typically drawn to new Apple stores. Apple has a shop in Soho, too, and many more across the country and around the world. As differences on the hardware side of premium smartphones have faded, competitors have increasingly stressed “experiences” such as smoothly accessing content or services. “I am interested in technology, so I just hang out in stores,” Columbia University student Ravi Lakshmanan told AFP in the Google shop. “There is going to be a big battle of platforms and it’s going to be interesting to watch.” Another visitor, Ike McLaughlin, said he has flip-flopped between the rivals but is on Google’s side for now because he felt Apple was “playing it safe, when Google is taking risks and making a push in artificial intelligence.” McLaughlin’s verdict echoes the concerns of analysts that Apple has not delivered a market-shaking new product since the death of visionary co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. But even if its market capitalisation has fallen below peaks hit in 2015, Apple remains the world’s most valuable company based on its share price. For the financial year ending September 2015, Apple posted a net profit of US$53 billion (RM221.6 billion), double the figure posted in the last year of the reign of Steve Jobs. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Facebook accidentally declares some users dead, including founder Zuckerberg Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Sony seeks to patent method for measuring journalists' accuracy The best action cams for winter sports Consumer drone business stumbles, but commercial markets beckon Apple now sells refurbished iPhones Robotic dinosaur replicas stomp in Tokyo hotel (VIDEO) Best smartphones for holiday 2016 Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Malaysian gaming content exports soar 75pc to RM80m Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Models with Down Syndrome team up with celebrities Reuters Video: Reflection ‘healthy’ for Democratic party, says Obama 'Beauty and the Beast' first full-length trailer Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Reuters Video: Duchess meets movie-star cat, animals go wild Related Articles Google to name and shame the web’s worst malware offenders Daydream View brings Google’s VR experience to five countries Google rolls out Chrome Canary experimental web browser to Android Google, automakers object to California rules for self-driving cars Intelligent personal assistants coming to the home (VIDEO) Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

X Commission may examine 300 more Irish tax rulings Margrethe Vestager defends Apple ruling as State intensifies discussions with Brussels Fri, Oct 21, 2016, 01:00 Suzanne Lynch, Denis Staunton Minister for Finance Michael Noonan with EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager at a European Union finance ministers’ meeting in Luxembourg in 2012. Photograph: Francois Lenoir/Reuters         EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager has refused to rule out further state-aid investigations into Ireland’s tax arrangements with multinationals, as the Government intensifies discussions with Brussels about the tax it must reclaim from computer giant Apple. In an interview with The Irish Times, the Danish commissioner said her staff were assessing about 1,000 tax rulings from across Europe, up to 300 of which are understood to be from Irish tax authorities. Ms Vestager defended her record Apple ruling, saying it was “fact-based”. She said the commission was well aware of the forthcoming appeal by the Government and was “very prepared” for the case. European Commission refuses to comment on Noonan claims EU tax harmonisation: an issue that won’t go away Apple expects to offset €13bn Irish tax bill by paying less in US The Attorney General is preparing an appeal to the European Court of Justice of the EU Commission’s finding that Apple benefited from up to €13 billion in illegal state aid. It is expected to be filed within the next three weeks. Final figure It is understood that the Revenue Commissioners have stepped up engagement with commission officials in Brussels in recent weeks over the final figure it must reclaim from Apple ahead of a deadline next week. Under EU rules, the Government must outline to the commission how it intends to recoup the money within two months of the decision, with the alleged unpaid tax to be paid by the end of the year. While the commission has estimated that the bill could be up to €13 billion plus interest, some analysts suggest that the final figure could be closer to €11 billion. Efforts to meet next week’s deadline are taking place as the commission prepares to relaunch its controversial common corporate tax base next week, the latest stage in the EU’s clampdown on tax avoidance. As EU leaders gathered in Brussels yesterday, Taoiseach Enda Kenny briefly met Theresa May on the margins of the summit. In her first visit to Brussels as British prime minister, Ms May was under pressure to reassure leaders about her approach to Britain leaving the EU, after she appeared to back a “hard Brexit” in a speech to the Conservative Party conference.

Coys, a valuation and auctioneering company, sold the Aston for £825,000 using a social media platform known as Vero. Payment was taken via the Apple Pay app. The car is a right-hand-drive, silver birch model, that features red leather trim. It has been fully restored – with an engine rebuild and overhauled suspension and gearbox – after being kept in dry storage for 20 years. Earlier this month, Coys announced at the Paris Motor Show that a number of historic cars would be available for sale through Vero, including the aforementioned DB5. The car was also featured on the Coys exhibition stand at the famous motoring show. The anonymous buyer saw the car when it was on the stand in Paris, and made the decision to buy it almost immediately. Chris Routledge, CEO of COYS, said: “The proud new owner saw the DB5 at the Paris Motor Show, he was overjoyed to see the car of his dreams and didn’t want to lose it. “He was keen to quickly get in front of the queue, so a few days later he hit the ‘Buy Now’ button on Vero to guarantee the purchase, leaving two other collectors disappointed in his wake.” Routeledge added that the sale was an important milestone for Coys’ online presence, and signals a new era for classic car sales. “The ‘Buy Now’ feature on Vero will give informed and savvy collectors a crucial head start in a highly competitive market place,” he said. “Collectors worldwide fight fiercely amongst themselves to obtain the best machines and we certainly feel that Coys’ presence on Vero will give our clients that essential edge.” Ayman Hariri, co-founder and CEO of Vero, said: “Classic cars set the pulse racing like few other things. We’re delighted that Coys have chosen Vero as the platform to express their love of classic cars. “Coys remind us of the influence classic cars have on us through movies such as the Italian Job, Ronin, and of course, Bullitt. With Vero’s unique Buy-Now feature, Coys is offering collectors a new way to purchase the cars they’ve always dreamed of owning.” Other classic cars that are listed for sale on Coys’ Vero profile include a Ferrari Dino 246 that was once owned by Led Zeppelin manager Peter Grant, a Ferrari Daytona and a Bentley Continental S2. apple PayAston MartinMotoringsocial mediavero Related Chris Evans 'relieved' Top Gun pilot was sick during Top Gear challenge Previous ArticleNext Article Newsletter Sign up Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.

The revelation comes in a federal lawsuit filed by Apple against a New Jersey company on Monday over what Apple says are counterfeit products that were sold on Amazon. In the lawsuit, Apple says Mobile Star imprinted Apple logos on cables and chargers that "pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock." It says the chargers and cables were being sold on Amazon as genuine Apple products. Apple says it purchased the products on Amazon and later told the online retailer that they were fake. Amazon then identified Mobile Star as the source. A shopkeeper dressed as an Apple store employee looks out from a window of a shop masquerading as a bona fide Apple store in China Credit: AP Amazon isn't named in the suit, but said in a statement that it has "zero tolerance" for counterfeiters on its site and that it pursues "wrongdoers" aggressively. Mobile Star didn't return a voicemail seeking comment.  Apple has long had to battle with the problem of counterfeit products, most notably in China, where dozens of fake Apple stores sprung up. Many of the stores look just like Apple's signature outlets, right down to the sales staff kitted out in blue T-shirts bearing the company's white logo and the sample iPads and iWatches displayed on sleek wooden tables. Where to buy | iPhone 7 and 7 Plus  In 2013, the company advised anyone worried their USB charger might be a counterfeit to take it into an Apple store and have it replaced by one made by the company.  It followed reports that a Chinese woman was electrocuted when she picked up a call on an iPhone 5 as it was charging. However, there have also been similar cases in Britain. Two years ago, the London Fire Brigade warned of fake iPhone chargers on sale in markets and online that could cause fires, electrocutions or burns. One  such device  caught fire and set alight to a house in Tottenham.  Follow Telegraph Science & Tech READ MORE ABOUT: Apple iPhone Amazon Show more Technology latest 15 Nov 2016, 12:01am Bad battery life?

That's according to a lawsuit Apple filed Monday against Mobile Star LLC. Apple claims the chargers—manufactured by Mobile Star and wrongly bearing the Apple logo—"pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock." According to Mashable, the lawsuit claims the cables and chargers are being sold "as genuine Apple products using Apple's own product marketing images." And they're being sold by both third-party sellers and Amazon itself. Apple says customers would have no reason to believe the faulty products are anything but the real deal. And it says that could damage its reputation, 9to5Mac reports. Apple says it routinely buys its own products off Amazon to make sure everything is on the up and up. Apple's lawsuit claims that over the past nine months, nearly 90% of the cables and chargers it purchased were counterfeit. Amazon is cooperating with Apple and has turned over its inventory of cables and chargers. In a statement, Amazon says it "has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits on our site. We work closely with manufacturers and brands, and pursue wrongdoers aggressively." Apple is seeking $2 million per type of counterfeit product from Mobile Star.

Was that just to be greedy & sell more replacements?) 4) Now that I've tried out 1 Windows phone and 2 Androids, so far I've never had an issue with a cracked screen. It sure seems to me Apple screens crack more than their competitors. 5) Wifi antenna dying (fixed it twice by refluxing - putting the iPhone innards in the oven to melt and reflux the solder - but the fix only lasts so long. You can only pull this off once on a phone.). 6) Cables, chargers, covers, stands etc. - seem to cost 4 or 5 times more than BETTER equivalent standard equipment for non-Apple equipment. I have never experienced any of these problems with non Apple products. Scott Newbury Oct 21, 2016 9:36 AM CDT A few months ago, I bought a slew of these "knockoff" chargers and cables because I have had success with Amazon's audio and video cables, which are priced much more reasonably than the brand names, and among my family, we have several iPads, laptops, and phones, but the kids keep losing the chargers. Today, I wish I could return all of them (the chargers, not the kids...most days). Several of the cables are already falling apart, and clear compatability issues plague these chargers, which sometimes fluxuate between "charging" and "not charging" states while the device is plugged in and immobile. In this case, I agree with Apple. Avoid Amazon's chargers until they fix the quality problems.

However following the recall of the Galaxy Note 7 after reports of explosions, Apple was surprisingly mum on the whole issue. Samsung’s other rivals on the other hand took this opportunity to poke fun at the company and their misfortune. LG was one of those companies who took advantage of the situation to promote their brand, and it looks like once wasn’t enough. According to a report from the Korea Times, it seems that LG has invited the press to a tour of the company’s Digital Park in South Korea. During the tour, LG showed the press what went on behind the scenes during the development of their phones, like the recent LG V20, and how the handset apparently underwent 60,000 safety and usability tests before it went into mass production. Apparently it performed well enough to pass the military-standard transit drop test of the United States Department of Defense. The company performed all kinds of tests, such as dropping the device onto a steel bar, dropping a steel ball onto its display, stress tests to see if it can take a person’s weight, and more. Now to be fair, we’re sure tons of companies test their devices just a vigorously ahead of selling them. Even Apple themselves invited the media to see their testing process following the “Bendgate” scandal in 2014, so in this instance we can only imagine that this is just LG taking another swipe at Samsung.

So much so that if you wanted one, you’d have to wait until December. According to the shipping times for the Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus, Apple’s website has listed it as shipping in 6-8 weeks. What this means is that if you’re lucky, you will get it on the 1st of December at the earliest, If you’re not so lucky, you’ll be looking at a mid-December shipping and hopefully in time for Christmas. While demand for the device is probably to blame for the delayed shipping, last we heard even Apple’s manufacturers are having a hard time producing that particular model, so combine that with the demand and you’ve got yourself a nice backlog. That being said, this is for Apple’s online store so there’s a chance that if you really wanted one today, or sooner than 6-8 weeks, you can try Apple’s retail stores or any of their authorized third-party resellers. Alternatively you could always choose to get a different finish if you’d rather not wait. The matte black option isn’t looking too shabby either, we reckon. Filed in Apple >Cellphones.

If you are a subscriber, simply log in or Subscribe now! SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — In a story Oct. 19 about LeEco's entrance into the U.S. market, The Associated Press erroneously reported the address of the company's online store. It is LeMall.com, not LeWeb.com A corrected version of the story is below: China's LeEco sets out to shake up US consumer tech market Story continues below video × Most U.S. consumers haven't heard of LeEco, but the Chinese technology company is setting out to become a household name By MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Technology Writer SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Most U.S. consumers haven't heard of LeEco, but the Chinese technology company is setting out to become a household name with smartphones and flat-screen TVs that undercut the prices of Apple, Google, Samsung and other industry stalwarts. LeEco heralded its entrance into the U.S. market during a Wednesday showcase in San Francisco, where the company unveiled a sleek smartphone called the LePro 3 that will sell for $400 and an internet-connected TV with a 7-foot screen priced at $5,000. LeEco positions the LePro 3 as an alternative to Apple's latest iPhone and Google's Pixel phone, whose prices both start at $650. LeEco is promising its giant TV, called the UMax 85, will be as good or better than other high-end home entertainment systems that cost $8,000. Both the phone and TV will go on sale Nov. 2 in LeEco's online store, LeMall.com. The company also is selling a smaller smartphone and smaller TVs with screens ranging from 43 inches to 65 inches. Besides the phones and TVs, LeEco also is coming to the U.S. with a virtual-reality headset, a high-tech bicycle and an electric car in a challenge to Tesla Motors. The company wants to bundle the devices with other services, including an online video package of shows and movies that ties into its origins as the "Netflix of China." LeEco, which stands for "Happy Ecosystem," is branching out to challenge technology leaders who have been able to demand a premium for their products partly because they have been pleasing U.S. consumers for years. "America is the most important global market for us," LeEco CEO Jia Yueting said through a translator during a presentation. "Once we get the hearts and minds of U.S. users, we can move on to the hearts and minds of global users." Innovation in the U.S. has hit a "bottleneck," making it an optimal time for LeEco to enter the market, Jia said in an interview with The Associated Press that was also translated. He envisions creating a platform that enables consumers to hopscotch from LeEco TVs to phones to cars to watch its video service and use other applications that that company plans to introduce. The company is using the devices as "Trojan horses," to deliver its digital services, said Gartner analyst Werner Goertz. "This is a general trend in the industry, and LeEco is a prime example of how companies are subsidizing hardware with ulterior motives." Google is similarly selling its new Pixel phone in an effort to drive more traffic to its search engine and other service, Goertz noted, though that device is being sold at a premium price. Amazon.com's Echo, an internet-connected speaker that understands and responds to spoken language, also is designed to get boost sales at the company's e-commerce site. The expectations for LeEco are modest. The research firm Strategy Analytics projects that LeEco will sell about 25 million smartphones worldwide this year. By comparison, Apple had sold 214 million iPhones in the past year ending in June. Other Chinese companies that tried to make a splash in the U.S. consumer electronics market have barely made a ripple. But LeEco is making a major commitment. During the summer, the company paid $2 billion for budget-TV maker Vizio, a well-known brand in the U.S. that sells in Costco and other prominent chains. It employs several hundred workers at its U.S. headquarters in San Jose, California, with ambitions to expand in Silicon Valley. Earlier this year, it spent another $250 million to snap up a 50-acre site in Santa Clara, California, where it has approval to build an office complex that could span up to 3 million square feet and accommodate about 12,000 workers. Jia plans to call the complex "EcoWorld." "They are not taking a half-baked approach," Goertz said. "But I think they are going to be hemorrhaging money for the foreseeable future. The question is how long they can sustain this strategy?" Jia, who has accumulated an estimated fortune of nearly $5 billion, will shoulder a huge chunk of any losses because he owns half of LeEco. He declined to say how much LeEco has spent in the U.S. so far. "We are financially prepared to bring a new model and a new value for the U.S. consumers," Jia said.

Jones , USA TODAY 7:48 p.m. EDT October 20, 2016 7.1k Shares 'Watch the Throne' fall?  (Photo: Christopher Polk, Getty Images For BET) Kanye West aired a little Family Business during his Saint Pablo tour stop in Seattle Wednesday. While onstage, the rapper shared that he and his "big brother" Jay Z will not collaborate on a follow-up to their platinum-selling collaborative album, Watch the Throne. The reason? "TIDAL/Apple bull----." West says the ongoing tension between the competing streaming services is also why his verse on Pop Style didn't make the studio version of Drake's Views album, which was released exclusively on Apple. "It will never be a Watch The Throne 2," he said. "You know why? Because that’s the reason why I wasn’t on the song. I wasn’t on the song 'cause of Hov. 'Cause it’s this TIDAL/Apple bull----." And those politics seem to have gotten personal with West revealing that North, his 3-year-old daughter with Kim Kardashian, and Blue Ivy, Jay Z's 4-year-old daughter with Beyoncé, haven't even had a playdate. "I can’t take this (expletive), bro!" West said. "Our kids ain't never even played together." And if that wasn't enough to have fans say Mercy, West added that he and Jay Z haven't seen each other since Kim Kardashian's traumatic robbery experience in Paris. "Don't call me after the robbery and say, 'How you feelin'?'" he said. "You wanna know how I'm feelin'? Come by the house. Bring the kids by the house. Like we brothers, let's sit down."

The merger was announced in April. If the Justice Department grants approval, Tilden said the financing is already in place and the deal can close quickly. Retail Apple warns of phony cables Apple says it has been buying Apple chargers and cables labeled as genuine on Amazon.com and has found nearly 90 percent of them to be counterfeit. The revelation comes in a federal lawsuit filed by Apple against a New Jersey company over what Apple says are counterfeit products that were sold on Amazon. In the lawsuit, Apple says Mobile Star imprinted Apple logos on cables and chargers that “pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock.” It says the chargers and cables were being sold on Amazon as genuine Apple products. Apple says it purchased the products on Amazon and later told the online retailer that they were fake. Amazon then identified Mobile Star as the source. Amazon isn’t named in the suit, but said in a statement that it has “zero tolerance” for counterfeiters on its site and that it pursues “wrongdoers” aggressively. Mobile Star didn’t return a voice mail seeking comment. Earnings Microsoft hits record Microsoft’s quarterly earnings blew past investor expectations on Wednesday, fueled by growth in sales of server software and the company’s range of cloud-computing offerings. The report sent the software company’s share price around all-time highs after hours. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in recent years to reshape the company into a seller of on-demand software and computing power over the Internet, as its traditional businesses of Windows and out-of-the-box Office stagnate. Investors have cheered the company’s progress in that aim, particularly in an environment in which other business technology giants such as IBM and Oracle have struggled to navigate similar transitions. Microsoft’s “commercial cloud” — a grouping that includes business sales of Office 365, the Azure network of on-demand computing power, and other business tools — was on pace in September to bring in $13 billion over the course of a fully year. That set of businesses “continues to impress,” Brent Thill, an analyst with UBS, said in a note to clients. In after-hours trading, Microsoft shares climbed more than 5 percent, exceeding $60 a share and reaching above the all-time closing highs reached in 1999. Rite Aid sale gets delayed Walgreens Boots Alliance earnings topped $1 billion in the fourth quarter, easily surpassing analyst expectations, but the chain also announced a delay in closing its latest megadeal. The company said Thursday that it expects to wrap up its $9.4-billion purchase of rival Rite Aid Corp. early next year, rather than by the end of 2016. Walgreens leaders then cautioned analysts against reading too much into the delay. Walgreens revealed plans to buy the nation’s third-largest drugstore chain nearly a year ago, a deal that could create a chain with about 12,000 U.S. locations, or several thousand more than its closest competitor, CVS Health Corp. The combination also would give Walgreens beefed-up negotiating muscle and enlarge its presence in the Northeast and Southern California. Airlines Warriors are flying United The Golden State Warriors have named United Airlines as their official airline, as well as being a founding partner for Chase Center, the planned sports and entertainment complex in in San Francisco’s Mission Bay neighborhood. In a news release, United said it is beginning its partnership with the Warriors for the 2016-17 season at Oracle Arena in Oakland, and then will continue the relationship when the team relocates to San Francisco in a few years.

Those who wanted their own multiple displays and great expandability. Lately, Apple seems to have lost interest in that market and focussed on mobility. There is a smattering of hopeful signs, the weight of evidence is that the Mac Pro is headed for the annals of Apple history. A New Mac Pro: Pros There are just a few hopeful signs that we’ll get a refresh of the Mac Pro. The most notorious is the discovery by Pike’s Universum in late 2015 that a kext plist made a reference to a new model identifier, “AAPLJ95,1.” The current 2013 Mac Pro is codenamed “AAPLJ90,1”. Reference in the plist is made to 10 USB 3.0 ports. That’s what we might expect to see in a powerful, headless desktop. However, a year later, we’d expect USB 3.1 Gen 2 and Thunderbolt 3 over USB-C, so perhaps that code was for an older prototype that, clearly, never went into production. 2013 Mac Pro. The oh-so beautiful, but “ugly black duckling” still for sale. At full price. Recently, our Bryan Chaffin suggested that Apple’s use of the event tagline “hello again” could represent a reinvigoration of Apple’s commitment to the Macintosh line. “Apple ‘hello again’ Media Invites Suggest Reintroduction of Mac Product Line.” Apple has been taking some heat recently, from many circles, for its inattention to the entire Mac line. Our appetite is thoroughly whetted. A not so great scenario would be if Tim Cook and Phil Schiller come out and give us a 1) new MacBook Pros 2) Updated MacBook Airs, and maybe a A10x-based 12.9-inch iPad Pro with all the display niceties of its smaller sibling. Then stop. We’d be left hanging, wondering what Apple’s commitment is to the entire Mac line for professionals and consumers alike. The beatings would continue. Understanding the effect this would have, feeling some heat from customers and the competition hot on its heels, Apple may have decided, during this long respite, to breathe new life into the Mac line. To make the wait worth it. On September 9th, Tim Cook responded to a MacRumors email: “I love the Mac and we are very committed to it. Stay tuned.” But does that refer to unbridled enthusiasm for the entire Mac line? Or perhaps just the ones in use by a subset of the customers: The notebooks and iMacs. The use of the Steve Jobs phrase “stay tuned” could mean that Apple is finally ready to surprise and delight us after a long period of stellar engineering development. The last of its kind?  It was a great ride. A New Mac Pro: Cons Back in June of 2013 when the current Mac Pro was announced at WWDC, Apple was still catering to technical professionals. The previous “cheese grater” Mac Pro was a professional’s dream. Lots of drive bays and slots. Lots of power and fans. Industrial strength. The 2013 Mac Pro disappointed many who sought a certain technical path for upgrades, but it, at least, punctuated Apple’s passion for continuing the pro, headless desktop. Since then, however, several things have happened. Apple discontinued its Thunderbolt display without replacing it. That sends a message that headless Macs may be endangered. Next, Final Cut Pro X 10.2 hasn’t been updated in 18 months. (Although 10.3 was recently, accidentally divulged.) The last update to Aperture was 24 months ago and development has been discontinued. For some insights, see: “Everything you need to know about Apple’s decision to kill Aperture and iPhoto.” The point is that Apple has done nothing conspicuous to reverse the notion, from 2014, that it is losing interest in the professional market. This colors my expectations. For example, one outward sign that would have telegraphed a clear, positive message would have been to release a new 2015 version of the Mac Pro with upgraded Xeon processors (for example, the Xeon E3-1200 V4 Broadwell) and new GPUs. However, one could argue that Apple was waiting for Thunderbolt 3 support. Even so, whatever happend to the days of upgrading Macs incrementally? Why do we have to wait years and years for Apple to refresh some Macs these days? Is it too much trouble to reassure the professional community with frequent hardware upgrades? Hardware upgrades are the surest way to provide warm fuzzies and allow customers to plan intelligently We haven’t received any of those warm fuzzies. The Mac Pro Verdict This long delay could mean that Apple has been working on an exciting new vision for Macs and how they interoperate with our iPads and iPhones. That will probably entail the thoroughly rumored Skylake-based MacBook Pro, perhaps an upgraded MacBook Air, new iMacs, perhaps a new 27-inch 5K display with internal graphics for the underpowered notebooks and FCPX 10.3. We’d be pleased, but not out of our minds. However, what if Apple, on October 27th, were to announce, in addition to all the above, a fabulous new “Late 2016” Mac Pro, kept secret in the bowels of Austin, Texas. We’d be all shocked, surprised and delighted. Consider that re-imagined Mac Pro with a 50 teraflops of computational power connected to a LG manufactured, Apple branded 38-inch ultrawide curved display. LG’s new model 38uc99 38-inch curved display, in Apple branding, would be a perfect desktop partner. Image credit: LG It would take our breath away. We’d go out of our minds. Shall Cook’s Apple settle for anything less? Apple’s track record and the pessimist in me say I fantasize too much. I think the weight of evidence is that, instead, the 2013 Mac Pro will just be left to linger and die quietly. Stay tuned.

They can’t sell an orphaned product at the prices they’re at now. If the price drops significantly on the ones that are left, I may buy one. Then again, it’s been languishing so long that there may not be very many out there. Maybe they just won’t be available after next week. October 20, 2016 at 4:58 EST PM Rick Allen October 20, 2016 The ship has sailed! I hope that there would be a new Mac pro. I held onto my Grater 2009 pro as long as I could (in fact I still use the 27 inch Cinema display at home). I passed on the new Mac Pro as I had 4 drives in old one, and had upgraded the Video card as much as I could. I eventually sold it and transitioned to the display and a MacBook Retina 15 maxed out. Now I think “Consumer” is the Apple way. Also “Closed” and “Contained” are they way their hardware is designed these days. No user replaceable parts, no expansion, very few options. This is at odds with how I view a Pro level machine. Sadly I say “The Mac Pro is Dead” And I hope next week I can add the rest of the traditional phrase “Long Live the Mac Pro!” October 20, 2016 at 5:08 EST PM Christopher Fox October 20, 2016 How about an iMac Pro? This could be made thicker with 2 or 3 SSD slots with a 27inch 5k display? Not the same as the cheese grater (I had a G5) but time has moved on and maybe hanging onto the past is something Apple does not do. October 20, 2016 at 5:30 EST PM geoduck October 20, 2016 I just had a thought. Suppose they roll out a whole new line of Macs, from laptops to all in ones, but drop the Pro moniker. The 12″ Macbook would be joined by a 13″ and 15″ models. The iMac would be an iMac, or possibly just be called the Macintosh. The MacPro would quietly disappear, but you could buy a Macintosh with a lot more power just in a different case. Similarly Pro means little on the iPad. They could drop it and just have 7″, 9.7″ and 12″ iPads. Apple might be going back to the old nomenclature where all of their machines are Macs, and if you want there would be enough power in the upper end of each line for the professional engineer/animator/film maker/scientist. Remember the Macintosh IIci. It was the Pro machine of its day, without the name. The SE/30 similarity. Calling some Macs “Pro” machines is a competitively recent innovation. October 20, 2016 at 5:31 EST PM Chazaska October 20, 2016 And what of Apple’s investment in that advanced new manufacturing process for the MacPro, not to mention all the Made in USA hoopla? Hard to imagine they would have taken such a major leap for a one-off product. Despite their almost 100% consumer product focus, I remain hopeful. October 20, 2016 at 6:27 EST PM Lee Dronick October 20, 2016 Chazaska writes “And what of Apple’s investment in that advanced new manufacturing process for the MacPro, not to mention all the Made in USA hoopla? Hard to imagine they would have taken such a major leap for a one-off product. Despite their almost 100% consumer product focus, I remain hopeful.” As geoduck says suppose that they go back to old ways with the option of ordering a more powerful CPU and such. That is the currently the case to a limited extent though they could offer greatly faster CPUs and much more RAM. Something needs to be done with the number of ports, perhaps Apple branded hubs Oh and for the love God can they put the audio port on the front or at least the side. Be it a 3.5, or whatever. October 20, 2016 at 6:48 EST PM CudaBoy October 20, 2016 Jeez, to me the Mac tower has always been a subset almost literally saying “I do shit with this Mac” from killing it on Avid or Digidesign, MOTU or in the visual Quark,Aldus,Freehand,Pshop, sheeit – even Kai’s Power Tools – this was the ammo we’d throw at those Microsloth clones. But when my bud’s studio here in Hollywood that does trailers for the top and I mean Spielberg type top – I’ve met all my heroes through out partnership in Mac crime – did NOT upgrade to the ash can I knew the jig was up. The thing was one of the first Macs designed with ZERO pro ergonomics in mind vis a vis cables and cards and external pro gear!! And, as far as grunt good news/bad news depending on Apple/Customer his previous newest Macs still ran the external cards that run Avid HD stuff just fine. The great news for all you guys is that if Timmy kills the tower (and I don’t think he will) as joining member #763 (i think) I will never post again here. I know I know, You’ll really miss me being a pissed off nitwit lo these years but hey, it was fun, I’m just not a “mobile toy” guy. October 20, 2016 at 6:50 EST PM PSMacintosh October 20, 2016 The Mac Pro “Cylinder” was an obvious design failure from the start. What idiot (Ivy?) designs a costly computer for sophisticated professional users without easy access to upgrade slots and add-in slots and with lots of ports, excellent ventilation, and perhaps even a rack-mountable configuration? Instead, they made it beautiful, but not functional. It’s like making a gold hammer. Of all the computer user types, Professionals want functionality over beauty everyday all day long. If you can make it beautiful as well, OK. Otherwise, they don’t care about beauty! They want a hard-working, powerful tool that can keep up with them and move into the future. The Mac Pro “Cylinder” was everything that they didn’t want. That designer FAILED at his/her basic job–supply the target audience with what they want and need. Most people would have been FIRED!!! October 20, 2016 at 7:19 EST PM Michael Burke October 20, 2016 Please no iMac pro. We need a headless Mac. A Mac Mini Pro on the other hand would actually be very nice. (Think headless high-end iMac) October 20, 2016 at 7:24 EST PM PSMacintosh October 20, 2016 If Apple makes a new Mac Pro, it needs to be FUNCTIONAL to the hilt. If they are not going to do that, then they should abandon the effort. But they SHOULD make a new Mac Pro. The Graphic Design industry (and other science and art industries) are what built up Apple in the first place. If Apple abandons the very people who built it, what does that say about what they will do to their current users in the future. Wow! We will LEARN a lot on Oct 24th. October 20, 2016 at 7:24 EST PM JustCause October 20, 2016 The sky is falling, the sky is falling. (damn, we have to be right one of these times if we keep writing it.) October 20, 2016 at 9:48 EST PM Duane Bemister October 20, 2016 There was some speculation that Apple was designing their own Data Center servers. This could lead to a more powerful Mac mini. This form factor has already been incorporated into a racked solution by some third parties such as Doreo Hosting. This would be great for our new WebSonar Libraries coming soon. October 20, 2016 at 11:05 EST PM Cacho October 21, 2016 I think the ship has sailed on a new MacPro or any pro mac workstation. Apple has been bleeding its pro base for years since 2012 when it switched to a more consumer/iOS focus, so it seems a bit late that they would try to appeal to the pro market again. But I could see them coming out with some sort of cloud-acceleration / cloud-computing service ala HP’s RGS or Xbox’s Microsoft Cloud (Crackdown), where some of the processing gets handed off to the cloud, essentially turning your MacBook into a workstation. Working in the post production industry, in 2014, I noticed many post houses phase out their cheese graters for HP workstations switching from FCP 7 to Premiere. They had already been switching to HP for years for their Avids, as Avid was being slow on its Mac updates to compete with FCP. FCP 7 was the reason to have a mac editing suite but when FCP X came out, Premiere instantly filled that void, without requiring Mac hardware. The MacPro cyclinders didn’t help either, less I think because of their non-upgradeability, but because they use AMD FirePro cards with undersupported OpenCL hardware acceleration, as opposed to Nvidia’s CUDA. Not having a CUDA option on the MacPro cylinders was a breaking point for me and many of my colleges who need it for apps like Octane, not to mention it being better supported by Adobe. It was why after 20 years of being Mac-only, I ended up building my own PC workstation that is faster and half the price of a MacPro. It sucks to be on Windows, but Apple gave me no choice. Right now I need to upgrade my 2011 MacBookPro. I’m really hoping the upcoming refresh will be worth it and not make me abandon Apple all together. October 21, 2016 at 6:48 EST AM Dudemeister October 21, 2016 FCP X hasn’t been updated for EIGHTEEN MONTHS??!! LOL! Talk about ultra-crappy research!! It’s just barely been six months and before that it was never more than four months between updates, mostly three!! The only reason it’s taken longer this time around, is because it’s a major re-write with new features and functionality that are geared almost exclusively to “pros”, whatever that even means anymore today… so so much for that tired, nonsensical blather. Maybe actually know what you’re talking about before you write it?? Never mind that the whole pathetic “Apple doesn’t care about pros!” whining is getting SO old. Someone call a waaaaaaaahmbulance!! October 21, 2016 at 7:31 EST AM Robbo October 21, 2016 ~The Mac Pro “Cylinder” was an obvious design failure from the start.~ Could it be that it was set up to fail? To me it was almost like the Mac Pro last Hurrah type design. Apple thought, ‘if we can make it work with this design, fine, if we can’t, at least it went out with a bang’. October 21, 2016 at 10:32 EST AM mrboba1 October 21, 2016 @geoduck I think you are on the right track with the naming conventions. Apple is shedding the “i” moniker from their line, slowly but surely, except for the ones that use iOS. iMac makes no real sense anymore, and it’s been a long time since there was an iBook. The question will be what the lines actually look like at the end of it all, and whether there will be a headless, high powered version of the Mac line. October 21, 2016 at 1:16 EST PM Ryan Kelly October 21, 2016 The new Matte Black MacBook is here: http://imgur.com/gallery/jXMp5 You guys should think about integrating these pics into your article. October 21, 2016 at 2:13 EST PM MikeSmoke October 21, 2016 One thing often overlooked is how on top of the game Apple has been with maintaining and advancing Logic Pro X. What’s more, you don’t need the latest greatest hardware to use this and use it professionally. The Pro market is dying faster than pro hardware. Recording studios in my area have closed down faster than Sports Authority and Circuit City. October 21, 2016 at 3:22 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

The company introduced the Satechi Slim Rechargeable Aluminum Bluetooth Keypad in Gold, Silver, and Space Gray on Thursday. They look pretty spiffy to me, and the battery lasts up to 2 weeks on a charge time of 1-2 hours. They’re priced at US$39.99 and are available now. Check It Out: Satechi Slim Rechargeable Aluminum Bluetooth Keypads Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit 3 Comments Add a comment John Kheit October 20, 2016 Watching these guys try and make an appropriate numeric keypad is almost as bad as apple being brain dead and not making a keyboard with a key pad. So this has NO function keys. It also has no cursor or page navigation keys. You know the very things that demonstrated as being nice on the freak’n corded apple keyboard. They usually make these keypads with bad materials, wrong fonts, bad key throw different from the apple keyboard. Here is a dramatic re-enactment of apple and 3rd parties making wireless keyboards: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdKa9bXVinE October 20, 2016 at 11:14 EST PM Awilliams October 21, 2016 This is what I’ve been looking for for a long time. Looks like this will match the Magic Keyboard perfectly and it is rechargeable. October 21, 2016 at 7:19 EST PM Andhaka October 24, 2016 And this is why I still use an Apple Extended Keyboard II “hacked” with a teensy micro-controller to go full USB. This new “slim” keyboard does not sit well on a desk. 😉 Cheers October 24, 2016 at 3:58 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

And the Wii U, too, of course, but it’s 3DS that Nintendo focused on in its latest Nintendo Direct, announcing a few more games for the aging handheld.   All of them have a little bit of weirdness to them. There’s a port of the Wii U game Yoshi’s Woolly World that heavily features the tongue-lolling dog-thing Poochy (unless he dies on the way back to his home planet). There’s Super Mario Maker with no online level sharing. There’s a new Pikmin… but the real-time strategy has been traded in for Mario-ish side-scrolling action.   All in all, as I argue on this week’s Game|Life podcast, it’s a very safe lineup from Nintendo—taking as few risks as possible, attempting to provide 3DS software that could sell very well while still reserving the majority of its effort for the launch of NX.   After calming me down about Nintendo, as is their job, WIRED’s Jake Muncy and TIME’s Matt Peckham discuss Obduction, the new puzzle adventure game from the creators of Myst.

Who’s at fault for Rock Band 4‘s stumbles, Harmonix or Mad Catz? And what are our first impressions of Mirror’s Edge: Catalyst?   Each and every one of these questions are answered by myself, Matt Peckham, and/or Jake Muncy on this week’s Game|Life podcast.

(And why isn’t it free-to-play, anyway?)   I found Kyle Bosman’s recent Star Fox Zero video “Miyamoto’s Failure” to be well-done, and agree with its points, although I disagree on the final conclusion.

We know it’s coming out for Nintendo’s new NX game machine as well as the Wii U, but NX isn’t going to make an appearance at this year’s E3 Expo in June. What’s more, Nintendo says the only game playable at its E3 booth will be Zelda.   Does any of this make sense? Perhaps Nintendo’s making the best of a bad situation.

(Or, you know, you’re on a giant waiting list with no end in sight.) On this episode of the Game|Life podcast, Time’s Matt Peckham joins in and we run down our favorite VR experiences so far, and talk about what makes a good VR game versus a bad VR game.   Going off on a bit of a tangent, we talk about the idea that Microsoft and Sony might be introducing slightly-better game consoles soon, getting players into an incremental upgrade cycle.   Later, we pick up on a few news stories that have hit this week: Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture is going to be available on Steam soon, and the publisher is PlayStation. (More like Everybody’s Gone Third Party!) Finally, rumors from a reliable source suggest that The Legend of Zelda for Wii U will feature voice acting… and an option to play as a female character.

(It’s nearly available here in the U.S., but you can play it on Xbox One right now if you set your regional settings to Japan.)   Talking about Nintendo and Dark Souls pretty much ran us out of time, so Matt Peckham and I take just a moment at the end to talk about one of the more interesting virtual reality experiences I had at Game Developers Conference last week.

Maarten de Boer/Getty Images Podcast RSS iTunes Download At the DICE Summit this week, I got the chance to talk with Penn Jillette, one half of Penn & Teller, and Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford, following their keynote presentation. The pair are working together on a new version, with some virtual reality elements, of the classic Desert Bus. Their session at DICE focused on how game developers can use principles of magic in their designs.   After a few minutes of conversation, I realized I wanted to share the whole session with everyone. So on this episode of the Game|Life Podcast, it’s the whole interview. To call it “wide-ranging” might undersell it a bit. Here’s some of what you can expect:   Desert Bus Hillary Clinton Janet Reno Virtual Reality, Shakespeare, and politics The Music Man The time Penn met Notch The Residents Guarding magical secrets The Internet as world-peace engine Fake lottery tickets   And more. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did, and thanks to Jillette and Pitchford for joining in. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Game|Life Audio Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

I had a lot of thoughts about the message that this game was trying to convey, but I held a lot of them back at the time of its release for fear of “spoilers.”   Well, the statute of limitations on that is quite up, and more to the point, I haven’t been able to find other analyses of the game that get at what I was taking away from it. Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture tackles one of the great questions of human existence—coming to terms with the inevitability of death—and gives us a metaphor to help us think about it. It can be a profound experience, aided by one of the greatest (and most impactful, in terms of its literary connection to the game’s message) original musical scores in recent memory.   On this episode of the Game|Life podcast, Jake Muncy and TIME’s Matt Peckham join in for a no-holds barred pull-apart of Rapture.

There are certainly a lot of leaks and rumors coming out about it, which would tend to indicate that Nintendo is getting close to announcing something about the new dedicated game machine that it’s often said it planned to discuss at some point in 2016.   TIME’s Matt Peckham joins me on this episode of the Game|Life podcast to discuss the NX rumors and what it might all mean, what we might hear at Nintendo’s upcoming financial briefing on February 2, and of course what we both think about Jonathan Blow’s The Witness, because you pretty much have to talk about that these days on gaming podcasts.

It says the chargers and cables were being sold on Amazon as genuine Apple products. Apple says it purchased the products on Amazon and later told the online retailer that they were fake. Amazon then identified Mobile Star as the source. Amazon isn't named in the suit, but said in a statement that it has "zero tolerance" for counterfeiters on its site and that it pursues "wrongdoers" aggressively.

Although the lawsuit is not against Amazon itself, the retail giant is implicated because it fulfills the orders on behalf of the supplier. The case, spotted by Patently Apple this week, says: “Over the last nine months, Apple, as part of its ongoing brand protection efforts, has purchased well over 100 iPhone devices, Apple power products, and Lightning cables sold as genuine by sellers on Amazon.com and delivered through Amazon's 'Fulfillment by Amazon' program. “Apple's internal examination and testing for these products revealed almost 90% of these products are counterfeit." Related: iPhone 7 review Apple even cited Amazon reviews from customers whose chargers caught fire, in its legal filing. "These counterfeits have the potential to overheat, catch fire and deliver a deadly shock to consumers while in normal use,” Apple’s counsel wrote. Amazon responded by claiming it had ‘zero tolerance’ for fake products on its site. It told the BBC: "We work closely with manufacturers and brands and pursue wrongdoers aggressively." If Apple succeeds in getting these accessories removed from stores like Amazon, it stands to make more money from selling officially manufactured or licensed cables.

The only reason reason why chargers for Apple are expensive is because of the silly chip inside every lightning connector that has to be sourced from Apple. I say silly because at the other end of the cable is a dumb USB connector. Whatever the chip inside the Lightning connector does, can be placed inside the device so you have 2 dumb connectors on the cable: USB and lightning. But then that wouldn't be the apple way .....!! toboev October 21, 2016, 6:02 am There's loads of counterfeit Samsung batteries.

The success of the temporary storefront Google opened in the trendy Soho neighborhood could help the California-based company decide whether to follow Apple's lead and operate its own brick-and-mortar retail operation. The New York pop-up shop will be open through the end of this year, and let people get their hands on new Google devices such as Pixel smartphones which began shipping Thursday in a direct challenge to Apple's latest iPhones. "This is not even a testing ground, just an extension of the launch," Google spokeswoman Chrissy Persico said at the showroom opening event. "We want people to come in and experience the products." Google early this month took on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into hardware, launching the in-house designed Pixel smartphone and a slew of other devices showcasing artificial intelligence prowess. By producing both the phone hardware and its Android software, Google is making a more direct assault on Apple and its tightly controlled ecosystem. The pop-up shop also displayed Google's freshly unveiled Daydream View virtual reality headset, a modular wi-fi system, and a Home virtual assistant that will challenge the Amazon Echo device. Nothing is sold at the Google shop, but the staff directs potential customers to the company's online store or telephone operators who can take orders for products. - 'Big battle' - A wall in the shop is decorated with an artful arrangement of blue, red, yellow and green blocks, arranged to display the internet company's trademark colors. Only 30 or so visitors ventured into the pop-up store for its opening morning, a lean showing in comparison to mobs typically drawn to new Apple stores. Apple has a shop in Soho, too, and many more across the country and around the world. As differences on the hardware side of premium smartphones have faded, competitors have increasingly stressed "experiences" such as smoothly accessing content or services. "I am interested in technology, so I just hang out in stores," Columbia University student Ravi Lakshmanan told AFP in the Google shop. "There is going to be a big battle of platforms and it's going to be interesting to watch." Another visitor, Ike McLaughlin, said he has flip-flopped between the rivals but is on Google's side for now because he felt Apple was "playing it safe, when Google is taking risks and making a push in artificial intelligence." McLaughlin's verdict echoes the concerns of analysts that Apple has not delivered a market-shaking new product since the death of visionary co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. But even if its market capitalization has fallen below peaks hit in 2015, Apple remains the world's most valuable company based on its share price. For the financial year ending September 2015, Apple posted a net profit of $53 billion, double the figure posted in the last year of the reign of Steve Jobs.

The revelation comes in a federal lawsuit filed by Apple against a New Jersey company on Monday over what Apple says are counterfeit products that were sold on Amazon. In the lawsuit, Apple says Mobile Star imprinted Apple logos on cables and chargers that "pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock." It says the chargers and cables were being sold on Amazon as genuine Apple products. FILE - In this Sept. 16, 2016, file photo, Lisa Gao, from Chicago, compares a new jet black iPhone 7, right, with her iPhone 6 at an Apple Store in Chicago. Apple said in a lawsuit filed Monday, Oct. 17, 2016, that it has been buying Apple products labeled as genuine on Amazon.com and has found nearly 90 percent of them are counterfeit. (AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato, File) Apple says it purchased the products on Amazon and later told the online retailer that they were fake. Amazon then identified Mobile Star as the source. Amazon isn't named in the suit, but said in a statement that it has "zero tolerance" for counterfeiters on its site and that it pursues "wrongdoers" aggressively. Mobile Star didn't return a voicemail seeking comment. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Apple claims more than 90 percent of ‘genuine’ Apple chargers sold on Amazon are fake Apple claims more than 90 percent of ‘genuine’ Apple chargers sold on Amazon are fake By Joel Hruska on October 20, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment Update (10/20/2016):  Amazon has reached out to Extremetech with the following statement:  “Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits on our site. We work closely with manufacturers and brands, and pursue wrongdoers aggressively.” Amazon has a reputation for delivering quality goods at low prices, but a new lawsuit filed by Apple sheds unwelcome light on just how good some of those products actually are. It’s common to see Apple-compatible chargers and hardware for sale on Amazon and advertised as genuine Apple products — but according to Apple, the vast majority of these products are fake and built to terrible quality standards. According to Patently Apple, Apple has filed suit against one such manufacturer, Mobile Star, whose products are available directly from Amazon and advertised as being genuine hardware, as shown below: Image by Patently Apple Underwriters Laboratories Inc (the testing facility responsible for certifying a great many products) recently conducted a series of tests on 400 counterfeit Apple adapters. Here’s how they describe the outcome: The results of UL’s testing of counterfeit phone adapters were literally shocking. Part of the test equipment was damaged by energizing some of the counterfeit adapters. Twenty-two samples were immediately damaged during the process of energizing or during the leakage current test with 12 samples having a very high leakage current with a capacity for electrocution. With regard to the electric strength test, only three of the four hundred samples passed, which corresponds to a 99 percent failure rate. Selected construction reviews found issues with the isolation transformer design. The internal components are vastly diﬀerent when compared with a genuine UL Listed Apple adapter. Post testing analysis of the tested samples revealed a complete lack of triple isolation wire used for the secondary windings; neither the primary or secondary windings were separated properly, which is the major reason for the dramatic failure rate on the electric strength test. When only three out of 400 samples can pass a test, you’ve clearly got a problem — and Apple is acting to isolate and reduce the possibility of product damage by suing one manufacturer directly. On the one hand, this is not surprising. Counterfeit and cheap generic power supplies from no-name vendors are a known point of failure. Generic power supplies tend to use cheap components and often aren’t designed for anything like the load ratings they advertise. We’ve also seen a number of problems with USB-C in the past year, thanks to the efforts of Benson Leung, who took on the challenge of testing whether myriad cables advertising USB Type-C compatibility were actually built to spec and up to code (the answer has been no, in many cases, particularly when dealing with cheap Chinese manufacturers). Goods and services in China are often built with a mindset of “Chabuduo,” or close enough — this essay over at Aeon explores the problems and root causes of the philosophy and how the tech industry, in particular, has pushed to adopt manufacturing philosophies more in line with what Western customers expect. When you don’t get what you pay for The problem with counterfeit devices these days is that many of the counterfeits are good — so good, you need to literally read the fine print or examine the UL and Apple logos extremely closely to determine whether the hardware is actually legitimate. That’s not something you can plausibly do from an Amazon order page, not when stock photos are easily available and can be substituted for the product you’re actually buying. The fact that this hardware was sold directly by Amazon is another problem, though Amazon appears to have cooperated with Apple in removing the offending listings. The problem here is that consumers tend to assume that a product is genuine if it is sold by Amazon and advertised as an official Apple product. There’s an unconscious assumption that someone — either Amazon or Apple — has already verified that products being advertised as genuine actually are genuine. Situations like this drive home the point that this is not the case. But the consumer has no practical way of validating the authenticity of the product without purchasing it and doing a close examination of its external markings and/or internal structure. The simplest way to avoid the problem is to buy directly from the manufacturer. Don’t try to cut corners when it comes to power adapters and supplies — you may save a few bucks up front, but it could cost you significantly more later on. Feature listing by UL.

Thursday, October 20, 2016 [Tweets] [Favorites] Amazon Selling Fake Apple Chargers and Cables Ben Lovejoy (Hacker News): There’s no shortage of third-party chargers and cables sold for Apple equipment, some of them claiming to be the genuine article, but Apple has found that even Amazon has been selling counterfeit products labelled as the real thing. The products concerned were sold by Amazon directly, and not by a third-party Marketplace seller. The items have now been removed from sale, and Apple is suing the company that made them … Patently Apple reports that Apple has filed a trademark infringement case against Mobile Star LLC, which Amazon named as the primary supplier of the counterfeit products. Apple said that Mobile Star was not only illegally using its trademark, but that the fake chargers had not passed safety tests and posed a risk to consumers. Apple: Apple makes great efforts to combat the distribution and sale of counterfeit Apple products bearing its trademarks. Despite Apple’s efforts, fake Apple products continue to flood Amazon.com. Each month, Apple identifies and reports many thousands of listings for counterfeit and infringing Apple products to Amazon.com under its notice and takedown procedures. Over the last nine months, Apple, as part of its ongoing brand protection efforts, has purchased well over 100 iPhone devices, Apple power products, and Lightning cables sold as genuine by sellers on Amazon.com and delivered through Amazon’s “Fulfillment by Amazon” program. Apple’s internal examination and testing for these products revealed almost 90% of these products are counterfeit. John Gruber: I can certainly see why Apple is suing Mobile Star (hopefully right out of business), but why not sue Amazon too? John Gordon: This has been going on for a long time… Previously: Amazon’s Chinese Counterfeit Problem Is Getting Worse. Amazon Apple Lawsuit Shopping Trademark 2 Comments 2 Comments Rich Cheng October 21, 2016 10:37 AM Selling counterfeit products is illegal (in the jurisdictions I just checked, at least). I don't believe that if a physical department store's was selling counterfeit products that this would be tolerated by the authorities. (Maybe I'm being naive, here) I don't get why, just because Amazon are online, it falls to Apple to open civil lawsuits in an attempt to prevent this. Smokey Ardisson October 23, 2016 12:33 AM I don't understand Amazon's thinking here—it's going to sell Apple chargers, but it's going to source them from…some unknown company that's not Apple? That's extreme stupidity at best, deliberately criminal at worst. So, like John Gruber, I don't understand why Apple isn't suing Amazon, too (well, I do—it would open up all sorts of other cans of worms, but I hope they privately agreed to some sort of settlement and compensation).

According to a lawsuit filed by the iPhone maker, 90 percent of Apple power accessories found on the retail site are fake, even those labeled as genuine. Patently Apple reports that the Cupertino company is suing US-based firm Mobile Star LLC for trademark infringement, alleging that it has been selling counterfeit goods using Apple logos and product images in its listings. Apple states in the lawsuit that, so far this year, it has bought more than 100 Apple-branded products from Amazon, such as "iPhone devices, Apple power products, and Lightning cables,” 90 percent of which turned out to be fake. Mobile Star is reportedly responsible for the “majority” of these items. Buying one of these fakes doesn’t just mean you're missing out on an authentic Apple product, you could also be putting yourself at risk. Apple says they’re often poorly built with inferior or missing parts, flawed designs, and inadequate electrical insulation. Meaning they have the potential to cause fires or even “deadly” electric shocks. Apple argues that its reputation is damaged when consumers buy these products. The company is seeking an injunction against Mobile Star selling any more of the fake goods, destruction of all counterfeit items, and damages of $150,000 for alleged copyright infringement and up to £2 million for trademark infringement. When Apple alerted Amazon to the fake Mobile Star products, the retail giant handed over all the stock purchased from the company. Amazon said it “has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits on our site. We work closely with manufacturers and brands, and pursue wrongdoers aggressively.” Just remember: if you find something that seems too good to be true when shopping online, it probably is.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile iPhone 7s with Intel modems struggle badly in low-signal areas iPhone 7s with Intel modems struggle badly in low-signal areas By Joel Hruska on October 20, 2016 at 4:23 pm Comment Apple has a reputation for tight supply chain management and demanding rigorous quality control, but the company may have a modem problem on its hands. Previously, Apple has tapped both Samsung and TSMC to build its SoCs, but stuck with the same Qualcomm modem for all its hardware. With the iPhone 7, Apple adopted an Intel modem for its AT&T and T-Mobile variants, while the factory-unlocked devices, Sprint, and Verizon hardware all use Qualcomm’s modem silicon (MDM9645M if you want to get technical). According to an analysis performed by Cellular Insights, both devices perform equally well if you have a strong signal, but the Intel modem (XMM7360, pictured at top) drops off significantly as signal strength weakens. Cellular Insights tested multiple LTE bands (Band 4, 7, and 12) in a 4×2 MIMO configuration. The graph below is from Band 4, which Cellular Insights describes as the most common band for North America LTE deployments. Image and data by Cellular Insights RSRP is a measure of LTE signal strength and is expected to range from ~-75dBm when measured directly on top of a cellular base site to -120dBm at the edge of coverage. What we see here is that the Intel modem can’t sustain the same throughput as the Qualcomm device, particularly at the -105dBm threshold. At -115dBm, the gap between the Intel and Qualcomm modems is roughly 2x — meaning the Qualcomm device is sustaining about twice the network throughput on the same signal strength. Cellular Insights also compared the two devices against the Galaxy S7 Edge, the iPhone 6s, the LG G5, and the Nexus 5X. Image and data by Cellular Insights First of all, kudos to Samsung; the S7 Edge does extremely well in all cases. The Intel XMM7360, in contrast, is the worst overall performer of the lot — though the 6s doesn’t exactly distinguish itself well, either. That might explain why Apple was willing to work with Intel in the first place, but the Intel XMM7360 doesn’t keep up with Qualcomm’s MDM9645M. It would be interesting to see a battery life comparison between Intel and Qualcomm devices and it’s possible that Apple could improve the Intel modem’s performance via a software update. If you really care about LTE performance on an iPhone or live in an area with marginal LTE coverage, the factory-unlocked version of the device is definitely your best bet — right now, the Intel modem isn’t performing where it ought to be. Winning the iPhone 7 was a huge victory for Intel’s beleaguered modem division, but that victory was predicated on the idea that the Intel and Qualcomm modems would offer equal performance. So far, that doesn’t seem to be the case. It’s not clear how much this impacts the iPhone 7’s range, network timeouts, or other issues that might arise in areas where cellular connectivity is weak, but the general implication is that the Qualcomm modem offers better performance and possibly better range when operating in low-signal areas.

This year’s event kicks off Friday and is full of events at varying price points that highlight the versatility and variety of hard cider. There will be a block party meant to remind you of farm to plated dinners as well as food tastings to show off how cider can pair with a meal just as well as wine or beer can. It will also feature the debut of some local ciders, including Big Apple Hard Cider. “We’re just launching commercially at Cider Week this year, so it’s a really big year for us,” cider master Danielle von Scheiner said. Von Scheiner is hoping to highlight the way New Yorkers drink cider — more like a wine, as opposed to West Coasters who drink it more like a beer. Big Apple’s ciders, including one dubbed Brooklyn Brew, use 100% New York apples fermented with 100% juice and with no added sugar — and thanks to that, “there’s really no hangover.” “It allows people to kind of get into a drink that is gluten-free, paleo and it supports a local economy,” she said. It will also be the first year at Cider Week NYC for Brooklyn Cider House, which has an orchard in New Paltz and is in the process of building a tasting room, production facility and restaurant in East Williamsburg that will serve as a “flagship location.” Brooklyn Cider House will be pairing its cider with pork at Porktober Fest on Saturday at Solar One ($55 a ticket), and will be pouring samples at the free Lower East Cider festival on the appropriately named Orchard Street Sunday. The Lower East Cider Festival is among the more rustic events this week, said Lindsey Storm, whose business card lists her as the “cider goddess” at Brooklyn Cider House. “It’s kind of the closest thing to the afternoon at the farm that you can get here in New York City,” she said. For those looking to experience cider in a different way, this year features the inaugural Cider Revival ($55-$65) on Monday, a more high-end tasting of more than 25 ciders paired with fondue and other snacks from Murray’s Cheese Bar, held on the terrace at the Bowery Hotel. Both Brooklyn Cider House and Big Apple Hard Cider are among the cider makers who will be on hand to pair their cider with savory snacks. “Cider doesn’t have to be this stand-alone beverage that you have once in a while in the afternoon,” Storm said. “It can stand up against food the same way as wine.” Cider pairs especially well with spicy foods thanks to its low alcohol content, Smith said, and while people often think of it as sweet, many varieties offer the dry, mineral-focused flavors of white wines that complement foods like oysters. “The true wine geeks consider themselves acid hounds, that’s their phrase that’s used, and apples — nobody can beat apples for bringing that kind of sensory experience to the finished product,” she said. But of course, despite the varieties that make cider a beverage diners can drink year round, there’s something alluring about it this time of year, especially in New York — the second biggest producer of apples in the country. “People often have, particularly people in the northeast, have a personal connection to apple-growing and orchards. A lot of people, whether growing up or now that they have their own kids, spend time in the fall apple picking,” Smith said. “It’s this wonderful fruit that we kind of take for granted and it has this wonderful second life when it’s fermented.” IF YOU GO Cider Week NYC is Friday through Oct. 30.

The US asked India to consider relaxing local sourcing norms in single-brand retail trade, aimed at helping American companies such as Apple. The issue was highlighted at a meeting between Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and US Trade Representative Michael Froman. India, however, pointed to reforms in foreign direct investment (FDI) norms, which allow relaxation in local sourcing norms in specific cases. In July, the government had announced relaxation of FDI norms by giving a three-year exemption to foreign players from local sourcing in single-brand retailing and a five-year relaxation for companies providing ‘cutting edge technology’. But companies like technology major Apple had sought a blanket exemption. Apple has not approached the commerce ministry after the rules were relaxed, Department Of Industrial Policy & Promotion Secretary Ramesh Abhishek said on Thursday. At present, 100 per cent FDI is permitted in single-brand retailing, but it requires 49 per cent permission from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. India has pushed for a greater market access for agricultural export as well as institutional mechanisms to improve food export. Problems faced by Indian exporters of mangoes, Basmati rice and grapes due to unwarranted requirements and restrictions were raised, Sitharaman said. That country’s Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA) and Food Safety Modernisation Act have created an elaborate system of inspection and high inspection fees, affecting smaller exporters, she added. Bilateral trade is $109 billion a year. Both sides wish to increase this to $500 billion. Foreign direct investment from the US was $4.2 billion in 2015-16, up from $806 million in 2013-14. The Government of India’s (GOI’s) concerns on the US totalisation pact were also discussed. GOI says it discriminates against Indian workers in the US, who lose their social security contributions due to discrepancy in the visa and social security regime rules. GOI wants early conclusion of a totalisation agreement to protect the interest of professionals of Indian origin. The US has signed such a pact with several nations, with the aim of avoiding double taxation on income with respect to social security taxes. The issue of increase in visa fee and reduction in the number of available H1B and L1 visas, proposed by US lawmakers, was also discussed. GOI says it will adversely affect the Indian information technology sector. “In 2014-15, as much as 69 per cent of all H1B visas and 30 per cent of L1 visas were issued to Indians,” US commerce secretary Penny Pritzker had earlier said. On Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), GOI has maintained Indian laws comply with World Trade Organization norms. The US has raised concerns over the patents regime, particularly in pharmaceuticals. On trade secrets, the US wants a separate law. Later in the day, USTR officials are said to have met Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.

He said that conflict between Tidal and Apple is part of the reason that the Throne does not appear on the album version of Drake's "Pop Style," and will prevent a sequel to Watch the Throne from happening.  Kanye's monologue was impassioned and, as a result, sometimes difficult to follow. Here are a handful of questions we have.  What does Apple Music have to do with Watch the Throne 2? Q: Jay Z and Kanye are both part-owners in Tidal. Neither have any publicized stake in Apple Music. Presumably, an album made between the two of them would have nothing to do with Apple’s streaming service. Why does Kanye say that the politics of the streaming economy are affecting the one record that should be hermetically sealed from additional corporate interference? A: This is an impossible question to answer, in part because Kanye, in true Kanye fashion, isn’t too clear on what, exactly, he’s talking about. When he calls out the politics between streaming services, he could be just conflating the “Pop Style” conflicts with whatever is hampering Watch the Throne 2. Completely hypothetically, though, it could go deeper than that—Kanye could be pushing for the album to not be a Tidal exclusive, for example. Or, there could be a dispute about its exclusivity period on the streaming service—if Kanye wanted it to be on Tidal for two weeks, say, and Jay Z was pushing for it to be on Tidal, and Tidal alone, for good. Why couldn’t they pull a Radiohead? Q: What’s stopping Kanye and Jay from releasing an album themselves, like Radiohead did with In Rainbows? A: Surely they could, but it would involve a serious financial contribution from both to record the project. Given the lyrics of “Saint Pablo,” Kanye is likely hesitant to spend his own money on music—something he’s usually had label support for—when he’s investing so much of his time and money in his fashion endeavors. People would definitely buy the album if they released it themselves out of the blue, but there would still be money left on the table, and both clearly believe that streaming is the future of music. From Jay’s perspective in particular, this would do little for the reputation of Tidal. In fact, a release outside of the service he’s spent so much time and money building cache for would likely harm the streaming service. What does Kanye’s Tidal contract say? Q: Since March 2015, when Kanye appeared on stage with Jay Z to help launch Tidal, he’s been involved with the streaming service. Sometimes that means full-voiced support on Twitter and exclusive releases, and at others times the relationship seems far more cloudy. What, if anything, is Kanye required to release on Tidal? A: Nothing. According to a Tidal spokesperson, he is an artist-owner. So, while he stands to make money from any Tidal releases, he is in no way legally prevented from releasing his next album on Apple Music—or however else he wants. It’s why, weeks after stating that The Life of Pablo would only ever be available on Tidal, the album showed up on Spotify and Apple Music. It’s also why Kanye has been free to discuss an Apple Music exclusive deal, something he did last year and later rapped about on “Saint Pablo.” What does Drake have to do with this? Q: Does Kanye recording an album with Drake, who is an Apple Music artist, affect the situation? A: Maaaaaybe? Both Jay and Kanye worked on a version of “Pop Style” released in advance of Drake’s Views, but their verses did not appear on the album version, according to Kanye, because of Hov’s relationship with Meek Mill, a Roc Nation artist, and because of "some political shit" involving Tidal and Apple. (Weirdly, the version of “Pop Style” with the Throne is available on Apple Music; but it wasn’t heavily promoted by Apple the way Views was.) If Apple Music wouldn’t allow Drake to use verses from Tidal artists on his album, or vice versa, that’s no good for art. But Jay appears on DJ Khaled’s latest album, which was an Apple Music exclusive. This suggests that Apple Music’s policies aren’t strict. Of course, Khaled is managed by Roc Nation, meaning money from Khaled’s project would’ve found its way to Jay via some channel. Ultimately, it seems that Jay will make the decisions that benefit him financially; or, that pulling out of “Pop Style” could be a sort of “fuck you” to Drake and Apple Music. After all, why support the project of a rival business? True, Jay gave a few lines to Drake initially, but even that reads a bit like a “fuck you.” Like, here’s this pittance. And perhaps Jay feels cool about the prospect of Watch the Throne 2 when Kanye and Drake have discussed their joint album, which would likely have to be an Apple Music exclusive, at least for some period of time, given Drake’s involvement. Why doesn’t Spotify get brought up? Q: There’s a name missing from these conversations: Spotify. By its subscriber numbers, the Swedish streaming service is larger than Apple Music and Tidal, combined. If this is really about politics between streaming services, why isn’t one of its biggest names more of a point of contention? A: It comes down to strategy. In the streaming economy, Apple and Tidal are the primary players dealing in exclusives—signing the biggest names to their platforms. Artists like Jay Z, Beyoncé, Kanye, Drake, Rihanna, and Chance the Rapper give their music to either Tidal or Apple Music exclusively, for a time, ostensibly driving more subscribers to either service. Spotify has largely stayed out of the race for big name exclusives, opting instead to wait the typical two week grace period for the album to hit other services. Whatever is happening here appears to be the streaming economy’s race for exclusive leaking down to the upper echelon of hip-hop. So, is this personal? Q: During Wednesday night’s show, Kanye seemed hurt that Jay only called him after Kim Kardashian was robbed in Paris, instead of coming by their house to show his support and concern. Is Kanye’s anger with Tidal really him lashing out at Jay? A: Your guess is as good as mine. Kanye’s comments went past music last night, as he went on to make a personal tirade about his and Jay’s relationship. "Don't call me, after the robbery, and say, 'How you feelin?' You wanna know how I'm feelin? Come by the house," Kanye said. (He also bemoaned the fact that his kids don’t play with Jay and Beyoncé's daughter.) Whatever is going on here, it appears that there’s something else going on underneath the surface, and with Jay inextricably tied to Tidal, it’s tough to parse where the dividing lines of either issue lie.

Microsoft’s Surface business skyrockets as the iPad’s slows Posted Oct 20, 2016 by Matt Burns (@mjburnsy) 0 SHARES Next Story A trip to Google’s New York City Pop-Up Shop Microsoft saw revenue from its Surface line jump 38% over last year’s total, according to its most recent financial report. Released today, the report states that Surface revenue hit $926 million during the last quarter, up from $672 million last year. Even at this level, Apple’s iPad business is still much larger, though growing more slowly. Apple’s iPad business is still dramatically larger than the Surface, though. During Apple’s last quarter, iPad revenue was $4.9 billion up from $4.4 billion compared to the same quarter the year prior. That’s a growth in revenue of 11% year over year, but the first growth Apple’s iPad business saw in ten quarters. The substantial jump in Surface revenue was on the back of just two products: the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. Microsoft has been pushing these hard with a major ad campaign and key partnerships like with the NFL — though Coach Belichick and others might not be big fans. It’s said Microsoft is set to release new Surface products at an event next week, which should mean Microsoft will have a fresh line available for purchase in time for the holidays. A better picture of the iPad vs Surface fight will come into view next week when Apple announces its latest quarterly earnings, but as it stands right now, Apple should take notice. The Surface is coming. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Microsoft Founded 1974 Overview Microsoft is an American multinational corporation that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells a range of software products and services.

Telemundo, owned by NBCUniversal, is syndicated worldwide to more than 100 countries in over 35 languages. For those unfamiliar with universal search, it's a feature that allows users to conduct Siri voice searches or text-based searches to find TV and movie content across a wide range of channels. At launch, universal search only supported a few channels, but Apple has been rapidly expanding the feature to encompass additional channels. Apple TV universal search is now available for a wide number of apps in the U.S. and Australia, but the feature is limited to iTunes and Netflix in Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In some other countries and regions, only movies in iTunes are supported.

"sorry I don't understand boxcar jengo real mandarin" Rating: 5 Votes thisisnotmyname 4 weeks ago Let's be fair buddy, not even Google Translate understood what you said. :D Other than dropping articles and prepositions that's basically what he said though. And the conjugation of the verb. OK, that's a mighty simplistic translation, never mind :) So, Siri is language specific though, would you have to put your Apple TV in Spanish language mode for her to "understand" that statement? Bilingual Siri isn't really a thing yet, I wonder if you need to anglicize pronunciations for Siri to find shows on Telemundo if your primary language is set to English. I'll have to try it out. edit: so I just tried it out. I attempted to find Al Rojo Vivo both pronouncing it correctly and anglicized (al ro-joe vie-vo) and got about three of four interpretations back from Siri that were all wrong (El rodeo vevo for example). Maybe I'd have better luck if I switched over to Spanish as the primary language but I don't have time to do that right now. [doublepost=1477005856][/doublepost] Search Plex and you have a winner. I'd accept this as a fallback but I'd still rather have Apple support their own home sharing functionality. [doublepost=1477005924][/doublepost] Does Siri even understand Spanish? Spanish is one of the Siri languages. It's supported in primarily Spanish speaking countries (e.g. Mexico) as well as the US. Rating: 5 Votes ksnell 4 weeks ago Search Plex and you have a winner.

Does it search apps you don't have installed? Rating: 2 Votes iamgalt 3 weeks ago how about adding home share files to the search. I'd rather watch movies that I already have downloaded and I can access over my local network, rather than stream it. There are other people in my house using the internet for their own purposes that would prefer I access already downloaded files too. Rating: 1 Votes KazKam 4 weeks ago Universal Search is honestly one of the best things about Apple TV. It's by far the easiest way to check where a show is available. Whereas before you'd go to shady sites or have to check each site individually. Now you can just ask Siri and it displays all the services the show is available on along with what seasons are available on each. It's great. It'll check where a show is available... except on your Home Share where you've already purchased and downloaded it so you don't have to stream it. One more cool thing about it is, if you search for say, "Find American Horror Story for free", it'll parse through all the services you're logged into, like Netflix, and show you where it's available to watch for free; along with all the other services it's available on. Pretty cool. But you can't search for say, "Find American Horror Story locally" so you can return results from your Home Share where you've already purchased and downloaded it so you don't have to stream it. [doublepost=1476998280][/doublepost] Nope. Yup. It's searches all supported legal services available regardless of which apps you have, which is the best thing about it, and also sorta the point. Legal? Also, it's the WORST thing about it IF you want to bypass Apple's kludgy navigation and only want to search the content you already purchased and/or downloaded, or just search the channels you've determined for yourself may have relevant content instead of returning results from services you'll never pay for which essentially equate to advertising in your results. You and Apple have made a lot of assumptions about how users want to discover and access content... mostly skewed in favor of using up bandwidth and selling content.

Rating: 1 Votes Sakurambo-kun 4 weeks ago As with the previous models Apple seem completely disinterested in anywhere outside of America. Not that there are many Apple TV apps in the UK to search anyway, as the UK app store is a batten wasteland of shovelware and sewage. It's like the Roku store minus the small selection of good UK apps Roku have.

Software updates coming this year will give movies and TV shows from Netflix, HBO and other competitors equal prominence on the devices' home screen.  The approach is similar to one Apple took when it refreshed its Apple TV device last year. Amazon's own video store will no longer have the starring role on the company's Fire TV streaming devices.  HOW IT WILL WORK  While Amazon has long had a watch list for viewers to keep track of what they want to watch, choosing a title has directed the viewer back to Amazon's store.  Now, Amazon will offer viewers a choice of providers.  If a video is available for free through Netflix, for instance, that will be the most prominent option, even if Amazon's own store is selling the same title. Amazon's Fire TV has offered solid performance at reasonable prices, but its home screen has been cluttered with Amazon products — whether to rent or buy, or offered at no extra charge through Amazon's $99-a-year Prime program.  That's made it tough to find video from competing providers without turning to a voice-search feature that, until recently, excluded Netflix.  For the most part, finding video typically required opening a service's app first. Now, competing services will be offered space on the home screen.  Netflix, for instance, could choose to highlight its original series 'Stranger Things' alongside personalized recommendations.  Netflix could also include a short video trailer that plays on the home screen.

An Amazon-centric search penalizes viewers looking for not just Amazon's 'Transparent' but also Netflix's 'Luke Cage' and Hulu's 'The Mindy Project' (pictured) The development comes as leading video services make major investments in original shows, making it difficult for any single service to fulfill all of a viewer's needs.  An Amazon-centric approach penalizes viewers looking for not just Amazon's 'Transparent' but also Netflix's 'Luke Cage' and Hulu's 'The Mindy Project.' The refreshed Fire TV Stick, which begins shipping Thursday for $40, will get the free software update first, followed by the standard $100 Fire TV device released last year.  Both will get the updates by the end of the year.  Amazon says older devices will get the updates, too, but no timetable was given.

Linley SandersOct 20, 2016 4:40PM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest After receiving complaints that its chargers were overheating and catching on fire, Apple took matters into its own hands. The tech giant began purchasing so-called "genuine" Apple power adapters and charging cables directly from Amazon, ABC News reports, then tested them for authenticity. After undergoing tests, Apple found that approximately 90% of those purchased on Amazon were counterfeit. The faulty electronics were eventually traced back to a company called Mobile Star, which Apple promptly filed a trademark infringement against and opened a lawsuit for selling counterfeit products through Amazon, PatentlyApple reports. An Amazon spokeswoman told BBC that "Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits on our site," and that it works closely with manufacturers and brands to pursue wrongdoers aggressively. In the lawsuit, Apple says the cables and chargers “pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock.” Unless you're sure your charger came from a genuine Apple source, be careful the next time you charge. And if you're deliberating a new Apple purchase, just go into the store until this is all sorted out.

The rapper is once again venting about streaming music services that have apparently put him "Through the Wire." Back in July, West was on Twitter seemingly trying to negotiate a deal where Apple Music would buy rival Tidal. "I need Tim Cook, Jay Z, Dez, Jimmy, Larry, me and Drake, Scooter on the phone or in a room this week!!!" West tweeted. Fast forward to West's concert in Seattle on Wednesday, and Jay Z, Drake, Apple Music and Tidal were once again on his mind. West went into an expletive filled rant to explain that he and Jay Z would not be doing a sequel to their successful 2011 collaborative album "Watch The Throne." Such a project would not be happening, West said, for the same reason he and Jay Z didn't make the album version of the Drake single they performed on titled "Pop Style." The reason? "Some Tidal/Apple bulls***," he told the audience. "There will never be a Watch The Throne 2 ," West said. "I wasn't on the [the album version of 'Pop Style'] 'cause [Jay Z]. It was some Tidal/Apple bulls***." Jay Z owns Tidal. Drake's album "Views" was released exclusively on Apple. West went on to explain that while he and Jay Z had rapped on the "Pop Style" single, Jay Z declined to be on the album version out of respect for his rapper and friend Meek Mill, who was feuding with Drake at the time. "I said, look, I'll call Drake, I'll call Meek, we gotta squash this s***," West said. "We gotta let people have this song!" Yeezy is, after all, a man of the people. Copyright 2016 by CNN NewSource.
