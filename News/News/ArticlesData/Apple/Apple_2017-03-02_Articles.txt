Cory Gardner (6 letters) screen shotHow to tweak settings on your iPhone to let Apple take care of backing up photos. Q: What is the best way to save photos taken on an iPhone? ~Cheryl Armstrong, Loveland Tech+ The best way — with “best” meaning easiest — is to let Apple handle it via its online cloud storage. Take a photo and whoosh! Apple backs it up online in your private iCloud. That works until you hit your free 5 GB storage limit, and then you have to pay Apple a monthly fee to expand your storage. This also can use up your data allowance. So best? Well, it’s all relative. But let me run you through some options (and for Android or other smartphone users, the suggestions can be tweaked to work with your phones, too). ScreenshotLetting your iPhone automatically back up new photos requires changing the iCloud settings, as pictured here. The easiest: Let Apple do it If you use all your iPhone’s built-in apps, then here’s how to back up your photos. Make sure you have signed up for Apple’s iCloud storage. Check by going into phone’s “Settings” and then “iCloud.” Staying in the iCloud settings, look for “Photos,” which takes you to the area to configure how iCloud should back up photos. There are four options with toggle switches. This should be self-explanatory. Turning on “My Photo Stream” won’t use up mobile data but only activates when connected to Wi-Fi. More tips are at support.apple.com/icloud Do this and if you lose your phone, you’ll still have all your photos in Apple’s cloud. However, go beyond the free 5 GB of storage and expect to pay a monthly fee. Use a different cloud service to back up photos Take your pick: Google Photos, Dropbox, Prime Photos from Amazon, Flickr, Microsoft OneDrive. All have iPhone apps that do the same thing as Apple’s iCloud, including some free storage. Amazon and Google offer free unlimited photo storage with some caveats (you need to either be an Amazon Prime member or for Google, opt for lower resolution). Either way, such cloud apps are also configured in the iPhone’s settings so you can set the apps to automatically back up new photps. Plugging in: Backing up photos to a computer If you’re one of those people who prefer to have that photo backed up on a computer hard drive, you can do this in one of two ways: Rely on iTunes or drag them to a folder on your computer. Within iTunes (assuming you’ve installed this on your computer): The first time you connect your iPhone, iTunes will ask, “Do you want to allow this computer to access information on “iPhone” (or whatever you’ve named your phone). Hit “Continue.” Now, open iTunes and look for the tiny icon of a phone. This is usually near the top — below the play button and below the “File”  options — and next to the drop-down box that says “Music” or “Movies,” etc. Click the phone icon. This opens the phone’s settings. Select the option to automatically back up to “This computer.” There’s also an option to “Back up now.” But if you don’t want to bother with Apple’s software, go old school and turn your iPhone in a hard drive. Connect the iPhone to a computer via the proper cable. The iPhone will ask, “Trust this computer?” Select yes. Separately, create a folder for iPhone photos. This could be part of your existing photos folder. Keep this open. Open Windows Explorer to see the directory of your PC. Look for your phone, which could be simply “Apple iPhone.” Select it and you’ll probably see one folder that says “DCIM.” Open that and you’ll end up in iPhone’s assorted photo folders. Then drag and drop photos to another folder you created on your PC. Use a photo app to print a hard copy If you’re truly old school and prefer to touch and feel printed photos, check with your favorite photo printer store to see if it has an app that lets you pick and choose images on your phone to send directly to the printer. Some options:  Walgreens: Not only can you fill your prescription with this app, you can order photo prints right on the phone! Pick up is available in an hour. Details at dpo.st/walgreensphoto. Freeprints from PhotoAffections — It’s not totally free, but users can pick up to 85 4×6 photos per month and get them printed for a shipping fee that “never exceeds $9.99.” Details at freeprintsapp.com. Shutterfly, Snapfish, Photobucket… All have apps that let you pick and edit photos and then order prints. Update: Last week’s Tech+ answer offering free alternatives to Microsoft Word missed one goodie: WordPad. This stripped-down software has been a freebie since Windows 95. I didn’t even realize it was still around! But reader Bob Correll reminded me (thanks Bob!): WordPad 10 is available as a free Windows 10 app. Hunt for it in the Windows search area.

Well-connected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo with KGI Securities put a different spin on the report, as he believes it’s not an either/or situation, but one of both… sort of. Photo by olleeriksson iPhone 8 to use USB Type-C for fast charging The analyst said in a research note that all three of this year’s new iPhone models will probably feature fast charging via “Type-C Power Delivery.” However, he clarified that he doesn’t expect Apple to ditch the Lightning port in favor of the industry standard USB-C port. Rather, he expects the iPhone 8 to have both a Lightning port and USB Type-C port. The reason is because it’s vital to maintain that data transmission is stable during fast charging and that the device is safe. Apple certainly wouldn’t want to find itself in Samsung’s shoes. In order to safely provide fast charging on the iPhone 8, Kuo expects Apple to TI’s power management offerings and Cypress’ Power Delivery chips. He adds that the more premium OLED-display model, which is the one expected to bear the iPhone 8 moniker (or possibly iPhone X), might charge a bit faster than the two other models (probably the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. The reason is because he expects it to have “a 2-cell L shaped battery pack design.” ZDNet suggests that the iPhone 8 might not have a USB-C port built into it, but rather, the charging cable may have a USB-C bit on the other end (not the one that plugs into the device). This is pure speculation because it’s unclear exactly what is meant by all this. Some seem to believe the device will have both ports, while others maintain that there will probably be some sort of adaptor. That seems the most likely scenario because Apple uses a USB-C adaptor for some of its other devices. Lightning port to be used for other things According to Kuo, Apple will keep its proprietary Lightning port too but utilize it for its Lightning accessories, particularly for the MFi Program licensing. The Lightning port’s design is a bit slimmer than that of the USB Type-C port, which should help with that. Kuo also believes the high-speed data transmission on USB-C is still only “niche” when it comes to the iPhone. The Wall Street Journal was the one to report about the iPhone 8 and the Lightning and USB-C ports earlier this week. The tech blog-o-sphere jumped to conclusions with that report and was quick to say that the iPhone 8 would ditch the Lightning port in favor of USB-C, while the other two models to be launched this year would retain the Lightning port. Jumping to conclusions However, a comparison of what the WSJ said and what Kuo says now indicates that perhaps that’s not what was meant after all. The WSJ is now being criticized by Mac Rumors and others for unclear and/ or vague reporting, leading to confusion in the tech community. Kuo also offered some clarification on that report, suggesting that the iPhone 8 could actually have a USB-C connector for the power cord rather than a “port,” which was what the WSJ called it. The analyst also made it clear that USB-C isn’t being used instead of the Lightning port, but rather, in addition to. Besides, why would Apple dump its own proprietary port design, especially when it makes money licensing the design to third-party accessory makers. Some MacBooks have a USB-C port, while some iPad models use a Lightning to USB-C cable to delivery fast charging capabilities, so it seems likely that the iPhone 8 will adapt a similar strategy. And given Apple’s constant desire to go thinner and thinner, it wouldn’t make sense to even put a USB-C port in the iPhone because it will make it more difficult to do so. The Lightning port is thinner and allows for thinner devices.

Phones by David Carnoy March 2, 2017 2:07 PM PST @DavidCarnoy Will Apple ditch Lightning for USB-C on the new iPhone? Tim Cook thinks the AirPods are a "cultural phenomenon," the iPad isn't getting a hybrid OS anytime soon and is Apple really getting rid of USB-C? by Brian Tong 5:34 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Those hoping that Apple would trade a Lightning connection for a standard USB-C connection on the iPhone 8 will most likely be disappointed: Apple has always had a proprietary connection on its iOS devices and it's not going to change that, in my opinion. The rumor that Apple might ditch Lightning in favor of USB-C, which is increasingly found on Android phones and computers, got started a couple of days ago when the Wall Street Journal quoted anonymous sources claiming such a move was on deck. (The slightly vague USB-C mention was included as part of a larger story that stated at least one of Apple's next-generation iPhones would include a curved OLED display, in line with earlier iPhone 8 rumors.) Enlarge Image The iPhone 7 Plus' slightly smaller Lightning port (top) vs. the Google Pixel's USB-C port. Sarah Tew/CNET To anybody who follows Apple closely -- or has some insight into its general business model -- the possible switch to USB-C seemed farfetched, or at best misleading. Consider the fact there are two ends to every cable: The more likely scenario is that Apple would choose to include a USB-C to Lightning cable with the next iPhone, along with a USB-C wall adapter. (Whether the new cable would be in addition to or in place of standard USB-A to Lightning cable bundled with today's iOS devices is anybody's guess.) Apple already sells such a cable for $19 here in the US. That USB-C to Lightning cable isn't included with Apple's 12-inch MacBook and the new MacBook Pro laptops, all of which have a USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 port or ports and no standard USB-A port. (When you're paying north of $1,300 for an Apple laptop it'd be nice if it included a cable to connect your iPhone to it, wouldn't it?) Apple did not respond to CNET's request for comment on the WSJ story. But within just 48 hours, a more specific narrative on the USB-C/Lightning question emerged from Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst with KGI Securities who has an excellent track record on Apple predictions. As cited by MacRumors, Kuo states: All three iPhones rumored to be launched in 2017 will retain Lightning connectors with the addition of USB-C Power Delivery for faster charging, including an all-new OLED model with a larger L-shaped battery and updated 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models. In other words: USB-C is in the mix, but Lightning stays in the picture in a big way. Enlarge Image Close-up of Lightning (left) vs. USB-C connectors. Sarah Tew/CNET Lightning and USB-C, not one over the other The possibility of Apple killing off Lightning in favor of USB-C offers a vision of a gadget utopia to some: a compatibility dream in which The One True Cable would work with every mobile device, computer, accessory and charger -- now and forevermore. The fact that Apple standardized USB-C in its new Macs is the idea that first gave the one-cable-fits-all argument some gravity; Apple already has a foot firmly in the USB-C camp. But sticking with Lightning -- while adding USB-C chargers -- makes much more sense for Apple, across the board: Licensing Lightning makes Apple big bucks: In backing up his claim that Apple would retain the Lightning connector, Kuo pointed out that Apple would like to "sustain MFi Program [Made For iPhone] licensing income from Lightning accessories." No kidding: You don't have to be a tech analyst or CNET editor to figure out that getting a royalty from every officially licensed Lightning cable, headphone or charging case is part of the Apple equation. Staying with Lightning avoids a user backlash: Apple has a long history of dropping support for legacy media and connectors: everything from the floppy disk to the optical drive. But Apple's two big 2016 transitions -- dropping the standard headphone jack from the iPhone 7 and moving MacBook laptops from USB-A to USB-C connectors -- led to an unending campaign of #donglelife grumblethreads. And the 2012 move from 30-pin to Lightning was just as painful, as tens of millions of consumers came to terms with the fact that their old accessories and cables wouldn't work with their new iPhones. Sticking with Lightning largely avoids all of that. Quick charging with Lightning and USB-C is already here. Connect an existing 12.9-inch iPad Pro to the 29-watt USB-C charger that comes with the 12-inch MacBook, and you'll get a much faster charge than with the stock iPad adapter, thanks to its USB 3-compatible Lightning port. An iPhone-optimized version of this, as Kuo suggests, is a total no-brainer. Apple has already committed its entire mobile and accessory line to Lightning. If Apple was moving to USB-C beyond the Mac, why put Lightning in its two latest high-profile accessories, the BeatsX and AirPods wireless headphones? Why move its Mac mice, trackpads and keyboards to Lightning charging, as it did in 2015? The Apple TV remote recharges via Lightning, too. As do all current iPads, iPhones and even the largely forgotten iPod Touch and iPod Nano. Is Apple really going to undo all of this? The end game: Wireless everything In fact, the only current Apple mobile device that doesn't use Lightning is the Apple Watch -- it comes with a magnetic charging adapter. And before this USB-C on the iPhone 8 rumor emerged, all the talk was about the next iPhones having wireless charging capabilities, too. Personally, I agree with Apple guru John Gruber: the only way Apple moves away from a proprietary connection on its iOS devices is if it removes all wired connections altogether. Whether we get wireless charging with the iPhone 8 remains to be seen. And a portless iPhone is certainly still a few years away. But I think you'll see no ports before you see a USB-C port on the iPhone. Does the Mac still matter? Apple execs tell why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care.

For most folks, the fact that Macs hold their value is owed to how long the computers last. Even so, we can recognize the signs of a Mac that’s not quite in its prime anymore. Booting it up seems to take forever, the latest features of macOS just aren’t enjoyable, and modern software seems to drag. Don’t rush right out to buy a new computer when that happens, though. There may be a few things you can do to an old Mac to make it feel new again. Upgrading your older Mac could be preferable to buying a new one. (Image Credit: Kamyar Rad) Recognizing When Your Older Mac Isn’t Worth the Upgrade First, let’s set the record straight. I’m not saying you can revitalize that old PowerBook G4 and run macOS Sierra. There are limits, after all. You should start off by ensuring your Mac is on the list of models supported by macOS Sierra. You’ll also want to make sure you have at least 2GB of memory and 8.8GB of storage space. Check out your Mac’s specs from About This Mac from the Apple menu. About This Mac will tell you how much memory and storage space your older Mac currently has. Upgrade Your Hard Drive to SSD If your older Mac still has a mechanical hard drive, the best upgrade you can make to revitalize it is to replace that disk with a solid-state drive (SSD). SSD drives don’t have any moving parts, so they’re exponentially faster than their older counterparts. Upgrading to an SSD drive might not be cheap, but it’s less expensive than purchasing a new Mac. You’ll reap the benefits of an SSD in a number of areas – booting up, opening apps, and moving files around. Make sure you can make the swap without too much trouble. You should also be sure to pick an SSD that’s compatible with Mac. Crucial’s Mac SSD compatibility page is a good place to start, as is Other World Computing. Both sites offer installation guides to help you know what’s involved in the job. Increase Your Mac’s Memory The next best upgrade you can perform on an older Mac is to upgrade the system memory. An SSD improves performance in just about every aspect, but more RAM will allow you to have more apps running at once without slowing things down. You can find out how much memory you already have by looking back at About This Mac. EveryMac’s Actual Maximum RAM page will tell you how much you can upgrade. Apple’s official specifications are sometimes understated. If you have a MacBook Pro Retina from 2012 to present, you won’t be able to upgrade the memory at all. Once you’ve determined whether you can upgrade your Mac’s memory, check out either Crucial’s Mac memory finder page or Other World Computing. Clear Out the Apps You Don’t Use This tip won’t cost you any money at all. If you’ve been using your older Mac for a while, you probably have quite a few applications that you installed but never use anymore. It’s a good idea to do “spring cleaning” once in a while to clear out those apps and their associated library and preferences files. Removing these unused and possibly outdated applications could even give you a performance boost, since those apps might still be loading files in the background. For sure, they’re taking up precious hard drive space. Make sure they’re completely cleared out by using a tool that hunts down all of the extra files associated with those apps. I like the free and simple-to-use AppCleaner. All you have to do is drag the unused apps onto the window, and AppCleaner does all the rest. AppCleaner in action. Do a Clean Install of macOS Sierra Finally, you might consider doing a fresh install of the operating system. Windows users do this more often than Mac, but it’s still an option that can sometimes give you even more of a performance boost. As John Martellaro points out, this is often unnecessary and is always a time-intensive process, but you might decide to forge ahead with it anyways. Be sure to read his entire article before you begin, since he outlines the best way to accomplish the clean install. A Brand New Mac, Almost After upgrading your memory and swapping to a SSD, your older Mac should feel new again. You’ll be able to get a bit more time out of your Mac, and it’s a less expensive option than buying a whole new computer. Of course, Apple continues to blaze forward, and might “sunset” your Mac with the next version of macOS. Weigh the pros and cons of upgrading versus buying new. If your Mac is from 2012 or later, you’ll probably find the upgrades to be the wisest investment.

It began to take 90 seconds to boot in 2013 so I maxed the RAM to 4GB and installed a 256GB SSD, It was like a new computer, booting in 22 seconds. Purchased the 256SSD AND two modules of 2GB from Other World Computing for about $150.00. Even though Apple doesn’t support it, it continues to run great. You may not be able to run the latest version of Safari, my youngest son has been running Chrome, which does the job. I teach college classes and my 10 year old (in June) Mac eats much newer Microsoft machines for lunch. I have even witnessed more than one Microsoft machine dying in class at the same time, very sad. So, even if your older Mac isn’t supported doesn’t mean you have to upgrade. I upgraded to a 2012 Macbook Pro 15inch in 2014, what I found interesting was that the 2007 was faster than then 2012 with an Intel 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 Quad Core proccessor. I immediately replaced the HDD with a 500GB SSD, immediately booted in 12 seconds. March 5, 2017 at 9:14 EST AM Russ Hilton March 5, 2017 Forgot to mention that the 2007 still boots in 22 seconds, four years after the upgrade. March 5, 2017 at 9:16 EST AM Jeff Butts March 5, 2017 Thanks for the comment, Russ! Yeah, it’s amazing how much difference the SSD can make. March 5, 2017 at 4:39 EST PM trahajje March 5, 2017 I’m thinking about putting an ssd in a Mid-2010 27″ iMac. My biggest fear is that Apple will “sunset” that model later this year. Does Apple continue to offer security fixes for older operating systems? If so, for how long? March 5, 2017 at 10:42 EST PM Carl Camp March 6, 2017 Russ, I’d love to know where you found a SATA 1.5G SSD Drive, I have the previous model MacBook that I had to use a Seagate Hybrid Drive because the every SSD I tried did not slow dow to SATA1 specs as they claimed. The Venerable MacBooks are great machines even with OS X.7.5 as the best OS possible. Help us out, what brand SSD and where did you find it? March 6, 2017 at 12:48 EST AM fultonkbd March 6, 2017 I upgraded a 2009 iMac with an SSD and maxed out the RAM and it definitely worth the costs. Before it was just too slow to do much of anything. Now I’m back to using daily. March 6, 2017 at 10:45 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Instead, Apple will stick with the Lightning conector and add support for USB Type-C power delivery for faster charging. Apple isn’t killing the iPhone’s Lighting connector after all Earlier this week the Wall Street Journal reported the iPhone 8 would sport USB-C instead of a Lightning connector, which didn’t sound like a change Apple would make this year. I suspected the sources misinterpreted what they knew, and instead Apple would include a Lightning to USB-C cable in the box. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo told investors, “We believe all three new iPhones launching in 2H17 will support fast charging by the adoption of Type-C Power Delivery technology (while still retaining the Lightning port).” My hypothesis still stands, and it looks like now we know where the misinterpretation happened. Type-C power delivery will be built into the Lightning connector, and it’ll be supported on all of this year’s iPhone modes and not just the 8. Translation: Apple is including a Lightning to USB-C cable with this year’s iPhone models, and they’ll let our smartphones charge faster than before. Faster charging is great, but it comes at a price. If you don’t have a Mac with USB-C support (right now, that’s the MacBook and late 2016 MacBook Pro) you can’t connect your iPhone without an adapter or a traditional Lightning to USB A cable. In essence, Apple will push the need for a dongle back to older computers. Adding Type-C charging won’t help older iPhones or iPads juice up any quicker even though the new cable will support it. Type-C charging requires compatible chips, likely coming from Cypress and Texas Instruments, so connecting the new charger system to an iPhone 7 or older won’t have any benefit. The still rumored iPhone 8 is expected to include an edge-to-edge OLED screen, an on screen finger print reading zone for Touch ID instead of a Home button, 3D sensing front-facing camera, wireless charging support, and more. It’s expected to be announced this fall along with the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, but will ship a few weeks later than the other models.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > The Oculus Rift on MacOS isn’t exactly dead… The Oculus Rift on MacOS isn’t exactly dead, but it’s not on the road map either By Kevin Parrish — March 1, 2017 4:37 PM Subscribe Share Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Apple customers hoping that the Oculus Rift VR headset will officially be supported on their devices may be waiting indefinitely until proper hardware comes along. Support for the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset on MacOS isn’t dead but it’s not arriving anytime in the near future, either. Oculus VR co-founder Nate Mitchell said in a recent interview that supporting Apple’s platform was “something near and dear” to his heart, but the company currently isn’t in the position to fully dive into bringing the Rift headset to MacOS. “We do want to do OS X (MacOS) support for Rift. It’s not something that’s currently on the roadmap for — I can even say — the next six months,” Mitchell said. “We will continue to revisit it. The real challenge for us is just how much we invest into that space because it does require a lot of our time and energy to get it right and to deliver a great experience.” More: Google’s Tilt Brush arrives for Oculus Rift, redesigned for Touch controllers Right now, the OSVR headset is the only high-resolution PC-based solution that can work on MacOS. OSVR is an open-source platform created by Razer and Sensics that is supported by Steam. The platform is still in the development kit stage, with the HDK2 model selling for $400. Getting the headset to install on MacOS appears to require Homebrew first to load and run the OSVR software. That said, the HTC Vive VR headset isn’t exactly MacOS friendly either. As with the Oculus Rift, the HTC Vive requires a certain level of hardware performance that MacOS-based devices currently cannot provide. That is been the big holdup with bringing the Oculus Rift to MacOS all along, with Oculus VR founder Palmer Luckey stating that the hardware just isn’t there for the Rift headset. Still, MacOS devices will undoubtedly have the necessary components in the future to run VR headsets. However, right now, the curvy MacPro desktop sports AMD FirePro D300 and D500 graphics, which falls under the Vive and Rift requirements. The new MacBook Pros are based on integrated Intel graphics, which is nowhere close to what the VR headsets need. Of course, Oculus VR will likely jump into full MacOS support when capable devices hit the market. That may not be until late 2017 or sometime in 2018. However, given Apple’s partnership with AMD, customers could very well see hardware solutions before the end of the year that are based on AMD’s upcoming Radeon RX Vega family, or the rumored Radeon RX 400 Series refresh rebranded as the 500 Series. Oculus VR and parent company Facebook started 2017 off with a bang by reducing the price of the Rift headset and the Touch controllers. As a bundle, the setup now costs $598 whereas the headset alone now costs $499, the Touch controller pair costs $99, and the sensor retails for $59. That is $200 off the bundle’s original price tag. According to Mitchell, the price hack was meant to drive Rift users to the Touch controllers, which have done well since their debut in December. Thus, by the time the Oculus Rift is officially supported on MacOS, the setup and the required hardware could be very affordable.

Microsoft and Google Defeat Apple in Schools As iPads and MacBooks Hit New Low GO Research shows use of Apple devices collapses in the US Mar 3, 2017 22:37 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft and Google both experienced substantial increases in the education sector, while Cupertino-based rival Apple hit a new low last year, according to a new report. Futuresource Consulting says in a research that Google is the leading choice in the classroom in the United States, while Microsoft’s Windows has become the runner-up. At the same time, Apple’s devices have turned from leaders to one of the last choices, losing ground lately due to the lack of innovations. Specifically, the research shows that, in the United States, Chromebooks are the number one choice with no less than 58 percent share, while Windows comes second with 22 percent. iOS fell to third place with 14 percent, down from 19 percent, while Linux is the last one with 5 percent. Chromebooks experienced the biggest change versus 2015, as it managed to improve shipments by 8 percent. A total of 12.6 million devices were sold to schools in 2016, and more than half of them were Chromebooks, the research indicates. As far as the rest of the world is concerned, Windows is the dominating choice here with 65 percent, while Android is second with 17 percent. iOS is third with 9 percent, followed by Chrome OS with 6 percent. Microsoft and Google likely to continue growth Both Microsoft and Google are expected to grow in education, mostly as a result of investments in 2-in-1s and the growing number of OEMs building devices that come with detachable keyboards. 2-in-1 devices have become Microsoft’s own obsession, as the Redmond-based software giant itself pioneered this product category with its own Surface lineup. These devices bring a series of advantages for customers in the education sectors, as they can be used as both tablets and laptops, having a detachable keyboard and touchscreen. “Both Microsoft and Google (and their respective partners) have announced a wide range of 2-in-1 products designed specifically for education and are expected to sell for under $300. The 2-in-1 form factor is ideal for education, providing schools with flexibility in usage,” the research reads. Apple is also investing in 2-in-1s, but the bigger price point seems to significantly affect adoption in schools, so it’ll be interesting to see how Cupertino tackles the growth of Google and Microsoft in this industry. #Microsoft#Google#Apple#Surface#Windows subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Loses First Place to Apple in NZ 2-in-1 Battle Better Late than Never: Microsoft Surface Now Supports Wake on LAN New Windows Phone Spotted at MWC 2017 MediaTek Says No to Windows 10 on ARM Because It’s a Risky Idea Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1 Google Play Celebrates Five Years, Here Are the Most Downloaded Games and Apps Samsung Confirms Delay of Android Nougat Update to Galaxy S6 and S6 edge Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1    Apple losing ground in US schools New Apps Vectr: Seamlessly develop graphic elements that you can use for your website, business-card, T-shirt or applications using this intuitive program Arclab Website Link Analyzer: SEO optimization tool that can analyze a website to help you find broken links and other problems that might result in a lower search engine ranking Reimage: Assess you computer's stability and discover any possible security issues with the help of this PC repair tool that improves your machine's performance A1 Website Scraper: Scrape information from websites by using crawlers that can be customized to extract the specified type of data and save the results on your local drive A1 Sitemap Generator: An efficient and reliable application that performs various automatic tasks such as scan website, build sitemap and FTP sitemap upload Stellar Phoenix Mailbox Exchange Recovery: A comprehensive application that enables you to recover EDB files from corrupt or damaged servers, in a quick and effortless manner Fast Video Downloader: A lightweight and straightforward application that allows you to download your favorite videos from several online hosting websites Reader comments Apple Makes Fun of Windows, Says Its iPad Pro Doesn’t Get Any Virus more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley girl 'socked' with love and magic Friday Mar 3, 2017 at 2:34 PM Mar 3, 2017 at 2:34 PM Mia Clayton was recently awarded a $500 Disney Summer of Service grant thanks to the Youth Service America. Funds from the grant will allow young Mia to continue purchasing socks and other necessities for those in need. Monica Solano Staff Writer @DP_MonicaInes APPLE VALLEY —  For Mia Clayton, providing for those in need of warm feet has become a passion. The 7-year-old aims to continue helping the homeless, too, one pair of socks at a time.    “I like helping because I want them to be happy and feel loved,” Mia happily said. “I have been helping the homeless since kindergarden.”   The second-grader from Apple Valley was recently awarded a $500 Disney Summer of Service grant thanks to Youth Service America (YSA), a resource center that partners with thousands of organizations committed to increasing the quality and quantity of volunteer opportunities for young people ages 5 to 25 in order to serve locally, nationally and globally. Mia was one of 340 young leaders across the country awarded a grant for her nonprofit organization, Mia's Boxes of Love. The grant will support Mia in her continued efforts and community service project addressing the issue of helping to relieve the symptoms of homelessness by collecting essentials for families in need throughout the High Desert. “Mia was pretty excited to hear about the grant, especially since she loves Disney and is a huge fan of Disneyland and Disney channel,” said her father, Nicholas Clayton. “For her to have seen the Disney logo on the letter, that was a big deal for her. (And) really for Mia this has been a driving force for her since the beginning. She's always wanted to help out as many people as much as possible.” Expressing her love for “Finding Dory” while happily sharing her thoughts on the new Disney Animated Film “Moana," Mia has teamed with more than a dozen local schools and businesses in the Victor Valley to help collect socks to donate to local rescues. “I think she’s just been overwhelmed by everyone’s reaction, seeing as she really wants to help out and her mission is to give back to the community,” Clayton said. “We’ve had so much support over the years from families and the Rescue Mission and every one of her friends and staff from the Victor Valley Elementary School District.”  Known as a nationwide annual campaign, “Socktober” was popularized by Sesame Street and American personality Robby Novak, aka Kid President. Mia first heard about “Socktober” after watching one of Novak's Youtube videos when she was 4 years old. That inspired Mia to start the fundraiser locally.   Over the course of three years since Mia first began her organization in 2014, now a nonprofit project under the High Desert Community Foundation, the young dreamer has collected close to 18,000 pairs of socks to hand out to the homeless, according to Clayton. “I like helping and I like that they get to have warm feet,” Mia said.  Having worked with families in 13 schools in the High Desert and mobilized thousands of students to collect 8,000 new pairs of socks last October, Mia expressed her love for helping others, saying she would like “to change the world” as she looks forward to purchasing more socks with the grant and delivering them herself to the shelters in need this spring.    Those who would like to donate socks can visit any donation drop-off site listed on Mia's website, miasboxesoflove.org, which include all school sites within Victor Elementary School District.

Image: Emojipedia By Damon Beres2017-03-03 22:14:55 UTC Hey! Did you know that 68 percent of the people who work at Apple are dudes? That tech darlings like Uber have rampant sexism problems? And that only 4 percent of CEOs in the Fortune 500 are women?  And who would have thought it: That male-dominated culture seems to have dripped into something as innocent as your iPhone's emoji suggestions. SEE ALSO: Two determined women take on tech industry sexism in a new Secret ad If you type in leadership roles like "ceo," "cfo" or "cto" using the default keyboard in iOS, the emoji it suggests will be the default male in a suit, Mashable noticed Friday—even if you include a gendered context word like "she's" in the sentence you're composing. Men, men, men! Just like you'd see in Silicon Valley. Some caveats: We're not entirely sure how Apple's predictive text suggestions work, particularly when it comes to emoji, which were added as options only last year. The company did not immediately respond to our request for comment. Predictive text supposedly learns from your own texting habits, though it's possible that it also pulls in some aggregate data from other users to make better suggestions. There may also be a technical reason this is happening. Emoji are created using a standard called Unicode. A man's face is generated using the code U+1F468, while a female is generated with U+1F469. Because the code for a female character is a number higher than the code for a male, it's possible that the dude comes up by default. (See that? She's already a step behind.) Whatever the case, a number of Mashable staffers tried typing in the terms and confirmed that the emoji worked the same way by default for acronyms like "CFO" on their iPhones. You may see something different depending on your autofill or predictive text settings. In all fairness to Apple, iOS has generally been ahead of the competition when it comes to diverse emoji. It proposed female emoji variations for a few new professions last year, and if you type in one of them—firefighter, say—you'll get an emoji prediction for each gender: Note also that the female businesswoman emoji sometimes is suggested alongside her male counterpart: Capitalize "CEO" rather than using all lowercase and she will appear (not that anyone texts with Caps Lock on).  The female businesswoman also appears when you use iOS 10's "emoji replacement" option, which highlights key words that can be replaced by the iconic little characters. Better yet, she's even displayed ahead of that doofy guy with the mustache: So, no, this isn't a crisis per se for gender equality, but it does speak to how teeny biases can be communicated in everyday scenarios. Egregious? No. But worth considering in some layer of the massive dirt pie that is Big Tech's sexism problems? Absolutely. Thanks for the tip, Shelby Simon! Freia Lobo contributed reporting.

Apple is not done, however, having now sued Qualcomm in a court in the United Kingdom. This latest lawsuit was initially lodged on January 23, but Qualcomm had not seen the claim at the time, and could not comment. Court records show the filing made March 2 concerns registered designs and patents but does not list which ones. Apple's move comes as a result of a push from phone makers and regulators to reduce the excessive royalties Qualcomm charges. Though a big chunk of the latter's revenue comes from selling chips, more than half of the company's total earnings are generated via separate licensing deals. In regards to this very subject, the iPhone-maker stated previously that Qualcomm had "unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with". Unlike the two previously initiated legal battles, this third one has no concrete amount of money linked to it. Regardless of the sum, this is no doubt a big thorn in Qualcomm's side.

Esteemed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today chimed in on the speculation, writing that all three next-generation iPhone models will retain the Lightning port. Instead, the Big A will likely introduce a series of internal changes to accommodate the much-desired fast charging capability. “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY The hardware tweaks will ultimately enable Apple to replicate some of the power benefits that come with USB Type-C and still maintain its signature Lightning connector. As 9to5Mac remarks, it remains unclear whether this rumor has any relation to previous reports about wireless charging. Kuo further noted that although USB-C would certainly trump the capabilities of the Lightning connector, the Cupertino heavyweight has little incentive to make the transition. The report makes no reference as to how the possible adoption of USB-C fits in with the rest of the Apple ecosystem and upcoming iPad lineup. As of now, the two primary reasons Kuo lists for sticking with Lightning are royalties from licensing deals as well as the compact size of the technology, which allows Apple to cram more tech into a smaller body. As we mentioned in our initial coverage, while Apple would indeed lose some revenue from licensing deals, the transition to USB-C makes sense in light of the latest lineup of MacBook Pros – especially since the switch will enable customers to use the same cable for both their phones and laptops. In any case, chances are we’ll likely have to wait at least one more year until Apple finally decides to make a radical design change in the iPhone that also happens to be user-friendly.

In 2016, 58% of the 12.6 million mobile computers shipped to educational customers -- or approximately 7.3 million -- were powered by Chrome OS, up from 50% of 2015's 10.7 million (or 5.35 million), U.K.-based Futuresource Consulting said in a report yesterday. Meanwhile, Apple's OS X/macOS and iOS operating systems -- which power Macs and iPads, respectively -- fell from a combined 25% share in 2015 (or 2.7 million devices) to 19% in 2016 (or 2.4 million). Futuresource counted laptops, tablets, Chromebooks and the aged category dubbed "netbooks," but omitted desktop computers in its tallies. The downturn in Apple's K-12 fate last year was the second consecutive decline, according to Futuresource: In 2014, OS X + iOS accounted for 34% of educational mobile computer shipments in the U.S. That year, Chrome OS's share was 38%. While Apple's share was falling and Google's was climbing, Microsoft's remained stable, said Futuresource: Windows powered 25% of the shipped computers in 2014, dipped to 22% the next year and held steady at the same share in 2016. Apple's educational reputation harks back nearly 40 years, with roots in the Apple IIe that became the de facto educational computer in the K-12 world. But the higher prices of the Mac successor, and continued premium cost of the company's iPad from 2010 on, allowed first the Windows PC and then later, Chromebooks, to curry favor because of their lower acquisition costs. Futuresource cited Chromebooks' affordability and manageability as selling points, but not surprisingly in an environment where school district dollars are ever more precious, stressed the former above all else. "The rise of Chromebooks has also set new industry benchmarks with regards to average device pricing, with prices reaching as low as $120 on certain projects," the research firm said. Microsoft has announced initiatives to better compete with Chrome OS -- an attempt to move Windows' share from its mid-20s mark -- such as January's trumpeting of Windows 10 devices as low as $189, and Intune for Education, cloud-based device management priced at $30 per machine, the same Google charges for its Chrome OS management suite. The Redmond, Wash. company is also reportedly working on a new edition of Windows 10, tagged as "Windows 10 Cloud," to power Chromebook competitors. Even so, Microsoft "continues to face challenges to win back end-user mindshare" in the educational space, said Mike Fisher, an analyst at Futuresource, in a Thursday statement. Futuresource Consulting Apple's share of the U.S. K-12 educational market has slipped two years running, while Chrome OS's has climbed to claim the largest chunk by far.

Many MSPs are seen to be stuck in the same comfort cycle of doing business within the few markets that they are comfortable in, but delivering stellar growth goes beyond doing just that; they need to take risks and branch out, or risk being gone. This exclusive ARN roundtable, in association with SolarWinds MSP, addressed key trends in the market for MSPs, diversifying areas of play – from SMB through to mid-market and enterprise, lucrative verticals, the importance of strategic alliances, as well as expanding into niche areas such as cybersecurity and ransomware and using them as a hook for customer conversations.

But in a data centre driven world there is no silver bullet, rather an assortment of solutions that when combined, align with the digital transformation priorities of Australian businesses.

Zeman   @phonescooper Apple is taking Qualcomm to court in the U.K. over patent-licensing fees. Apple filed a similar lawsuit against Qualcomm in the U.S. Apple alleges that Qualcomm using unfair practices to license its chips and technology. At the heart of the matter is how Qualcomm works its contracts. It charges companies to use its chips, including mobile processors and cellular radios, but also charges a separate technology licensing fee that's based on the total retail price of the device in which the chips are used. Apple says Qualcomm "unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with." The FTC in the U.S. and the associated governmental bodies in the European Union and in Korea have filed similar complaints against Qualcomm. The FTC's complaint revealed that Qualcomm effectively forced Apple to use only Qualcomm chips for several versions of the iPhone. Qualcomm hasn't responded to Apple's latest legal action. more info at Bloomberg » Related Apple news   Apple phones AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

A source indicated to The Post that Apple SVP Eddy Cue spoke to executives from Paramount Pictures as well as Sony’s TV and film units, suggesting that Apple is working on “something big.” Reports are that Apple has been vague about its ultimate goal in the discussions, however one executive who spoke with Apple was left with the impression that Apple is looking for a “transformative acquisition” rather than just making a deal to buy TV shows. However, the report also pulls in comments from several inside sources suggesting that Apple still isn’t entirely clear about what it’s own plans are, and may be just testing the waters. One source said that Apple appears to “have a lot of trepidation” about the world of Hollywood, while according to other insiders it’s not even clear exactly who is driving the effort. Several Apple executives including Eddy Cue,SVP of Internet Software and Services, Robert Knodrk, VP of Apple Content and Media Apps, and Apple Music chief Jimmy Iovine are reportedly talking to different people in Hollywood and each trying to arrange their own exclusive deals. As one insider told The Post, “They each want to be the guy, and they’re telling people, don’t deal with the other one,” while another insider said “They just haven’t figured it out.” A third insider who is familiar with Apple’s thinking said that he didn’t know “if Apple is fully committed” but did suggest that wouldn’t do it “as a startup” but would more likely make some kind of acquisition. Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledged last month that Apple has “put its toe in the water” in the area of original content with projects like Carpool Karaoke and Planet of the Apps, however Apple Music chief Jimmy Iovine also clearly stated that Apple’s plans were about enhancing Apple Music in order to make “the music service a cultural point of reference” rather than looking to get into competition with services such as Netflix.

The service, owned by Spotify Ltd, has been growing at a breakneck pace. The company said that it had 30 million subscribers less than a year ago and 40 million subscribers by September last year. Apple, owner of the second-largest paid service, said last month that its streaming service has more than 20 million customers. Adding paying customers will help Spotify to pitch to investors, who expect the company to file for an initial public offering (IPO) and are looking for signs that the company can convert its growing subscriber base into a sustainable business.  Spotify, which is unprofitable, generates almost all of its sales from subscriptions, though the music service also has tens of millions of additional users who listen for free, supported by advertising. It charges a standard rate of US$9.99 (S$14.10) a month and also offers promotions and discounts, including a US$4.99 plan for students. Spotify and other paid streaming services have boosted the entire record industry. Recorded music sales grew by 7 per cent last year, the fastest pace since piracy obliterated sales nearly 20 years ago, according to a report from media research firm Midia. Streaming accounted for US$5.4 billion of US$16.1 billion in global record sales. While the growth has been good for most holders of music rights, it has also emboldened Spotify in negotiations with record labels. Spotify has not had long-term deals with any of the three major labels for months, and recent talks have reached a standstill, according to people familiar with the discussions, who asked not to be identified discussing private business matters.  Spotify does face some pressure to make a deal with labels to help reassure IPO investors. The clock is ticking. Investors in a previous fund-raising round have the right to turn their stakes into shares at a discount to the IPO price, with the discount growing if Spotify takes longer to go public. On the other hand, the longer the labels wait to strike a deal with Spotify, the more users the service adds and the bigger its clout grows.

The head of hardware at Google has confirmed that the firm is developing a second-generation Pixel for the ‘premium smartphone market’.  It is believed that the 'Pixel 2' could launch this fall, which would put the handset in direct competition with Apple's iPhone 8. Scroll down for video  The head of hardware at Google has confirmed that the firm is developing a second-generation Pixel (pictured is first-generation Pixel handsets)  for the ‘premium smartphone market’. It is believed that the 'Pixel 2' could launch this fall The confirmation comes from Rick Osterloh during an interview with AndroidPT. ‘There is an annual rhythm in the industry,’ Osterloh said in the interview. ‘So, you can count on us to follow it’ ‘You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now."

Share this article Share 32 shares Google debuted the first smartphones in its Pixel line during a conference in October 2016, a Pixel and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL. Both phones are available in 32 GB ($649 for the Pixel, $769 for the XL) and 128 GB ($749 for the Pixel, $869 for the XL) – prices that surpass Apple’s iPhone line. Although the Pixel 2 release would fall around the same time as the iPhone 8, Google is focusing on the upper price segment of the market. The confirmation comes from Rick Osterloh during an interview with AndroidPT. Google’s second-generation phone (pictured is the original Pixel) would go head-to-head with Apple’s launch of its rumored iPhone 7s and highly-anticipated iPhone 8 Osterloh stated that ‘Pixel stays premium’ and the firm will ‘leave lower price segments to other manufacturers’. The firm launched the Pixel line around the same time as the iPhone 7 was revealed. 'We believe the next big thing will be at the intersection of hardware and software,’ Osterloh said in October. And he also took aim at Apple, saying the phone has 'no unsightly phone bump'. Brian Rakowski of Google said the phone was 'designed inside and out to be smart'. He said the Pixel's new camera was better than the iPhone 7. 'It's the best smartphone camera anyone has made,' he said. GOOGLE PIXEL SPECS  The Pixel runs on a Snapdragon 821 2.15GHz processor. The handsets come in 32GB or 128GB models, with microSD card slots enabling an additional 256GB of storage. The first-generation Pixel is be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chip They have 12.3 and 8-megapixel cameras and a full HD AMOLED screen with Gorilla Glass protection. Fast charging gives 7 hours of use in 15 minutes Included is Google's AI assistant, Allo for messaging and Duo for video calls. Free online storage for pictures and video Is be available in US on Verizon and in an unlocked version from $649.  The first-generation handset range includes two new phones, a Pixel and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL If a fall release date is in order, Google’s second-generation phone would go head-to-head with Apple’s launch of its rumored iPhone 7s and highly-anticipated iPhone 8 – which could give Google some competition.

In fact, last year we reviewed the duo’s last fitness tracker, Mi Band 2, with rave reviews. And now, Huami is back with a GPS enabled fitness smartwatch. Dubbed the Amazfit Pace, this rather affordable GPS tracker uses a customized version of Android Wear, features an always-on transflective touch screen, prompts you with notifications from your phone, and allows you to store music directly on it. Unlike most other GPS or fitness trackers, Huami’s goal with the Pace is an untethered experience. To get a firm grasp on its offerings, over a period of a month and a half, we took the Amazfit Pace on sweaty runs, an insane half-marathon trail run, and casual everyday use. 2/3/2017 Update: Shortly after publishing this review, Amazfit released a new software update that improves the GPS accuracy, adds cycling, and better data synching.  Features/Specs Unlike most other GPS enabled smartwatches, the Amazfit Pace has a very reasonable price tag of $160. By comparison, Garmin is one of the more popular GPS-enabled watch brands, and their most similar model costs $20 less, has a slightly less favorable battery life, a basic LED display, and receives push notifications from your phone. It also boasts some solid battery life with between 3-5 days of active tracking and 11 days of basic use. For serious runners, the price tag alone should be appealing, especially when it comes time to upgrade beyond advance step trackers like Fitbit; however, the watch is not without its shortcomings. GPS and Data Tracking As far as basics go, the Amazfit does a great job. Between GPS location tracking, heart rate monitoring, and sleep tracking, the smartwatch appears to be just as accurate as competing hardware. For example, we took the watch out while on a half-marathon trail run out in the wilderness, and the Amazfit accurately tracked distances and heart rate in parallel to the Apple Watch 2. Through several other outdoor runs in other environments, it continued to track with near identical results. Of the data tracked, the watch will pull: distance, time, pace, heart rate, calories, speed, cadence, maximum/average moving pace, max/avg moving speed, max/avg cadence, altitude, elevation gain, elevation loss, and min/max altitude. While the Amazfit Pace does have an integration with Strava, it’s limited in passing off data. It also does not support Google Fit or Apple Healthkit yet, which is a huge pain. Coaching Notifications are great, but data-based coaching is even better. The Amazfit touts a lot of different data points, and you can have it display more or less while in an activity. While on the go, you’ll get the basics, including vibration alerts, for when you hit mile markers, but there are other advanced settings. Unlike the Apple Watch, Amazfit also includes pace alerts. If you start to hit a pace slower than your target, it’ll notify you to pick up the pace. Other GPS trackers offer this as well, but cost a bit more money. Untethered One of the more unique features is that the watch allows you to store about 4GB worth of music on it. Using wireless or Bluetooth connected earbuds or speakers, you can then play music directly from the watch, rather than using your phone. This would be great in theory, except you can’t control the music while running, there is no way to shuffle it, and it just plays in a straight line. This could just be speaking from personal experience, but there is a lot of swapping of music during long distance running to find the right motivator. Overall, the Amazfit Pace is a great piece of hardware, is accurate with tracking, but has quite a few software shortcomings. Design GPS watches are not what we would call pretty or fashionable. Apple’s latest watch version has that edge over most competitors, but otherwise screens are often oversized, a bit bulky, and designed to take hits. Amazfit Pace on the other hand looks pretty damn good, but it’s still not something you’d likely wear during an evening out on the town. With a slightly oversized watch face, it boasts a ceramic bezel that allows it to look better and remain resistant to scratches. Amazfit also has an IP67 rating, which allows it to be water and dust resistant as well, but would not be ideal for swimming. It also uses standard watch bands, which means you can more easily customize it away from the flashier red/orange colors. Speaking of colors, the default base comes in either red or black, as do their bands. Generally speaking, the hardware itself looks nice, but once again has some issues tied to the software. Within that large screen size is an always-on transflective color LCD screen. In theory, this means the watch face will automatically adjust for the level of light hitting it, but due to the automatic settings it’s rather difficult to see in the dark. And, because there is no way to manually adjust the brightness, that is a huge pain. Like other trackers, the Amazfit also features several different watch faces; however, these too can’t be customized. Due to this being a Chinese watch converted for Americans, there are still some UI bugs to flesh out, such as forced 24 hour clocks instead of 12 hour clocks, and using Chinese audio queues alongside English text prompts. Overall the hardware looks great, can take the kinds of hits you’ll experience when running, but lacks customizations for watch faces and has issues with LCD brightness. Pros and Cons Highs Accurate GPS, sensors Lightweight, comfortable design Great display, sans brightness Lows Can’t adjust screen brightness Limited, custom Android Wear Limited data export Overall Thoughts Should you buy the Amazfit Pace? It depends. On one hand, we really dig the hardware. On the other, the software uses some sort of custom version of Android Wear, but it’s feature locked and over-simplified. In the future, we’d suspect that the software will improve to the point where the watch will better integrate with Apple Healthkit, Google Fit, or other fitness apps, but right now you’re stuck with a limited Strava connection. Software aside, the Amazfit has a decent active battery life, is physically designed well, and is accurate for tracking distance, heart rate, and sleep. We give the Amazfit Pace a 3.6 out of 5, but would still recommend it as a standalone, affordable GPS watch. It’s designed to be untethered from your smartphone, but currently it feels like that connection is more of an afterthought. If they fix up the English version of the software, the score would easily get a boost.

It is believed that the iPhone will not go into mass production until September, which has suggested that iOS users will not get their hands on one until October.

Scroll down for video  The latest rumor regarding Apple’s flagship smartphone may send some fans into an uproar. It is believed that the iPhone will not go into mass production until September, which has suggested that iOS users will not get their hands on one until October (artist impressions) WHY THE DELAY?  The latest rumor about Apple's iPhone 8 suggest users may have to wait until Oct. to purchase one. Its believed that the firm is developing its own fingerprint sensor to replace the Touch ID, which is very complicated and needs more time to manufacture. And this means the firm will not start mass production of the handsets until Sept.  However, it may be worth the wait, as this technology will allow for a bezel-less design because the component will be a ‘built-in’ sensor integrated into the display. It is speculated that this component will use biometric technologies, instead of the traditional capacitive sensors found in Touch ID. It is also believed to be positioned in the ‘function area’ region of the display. Rumors surrounding the iPhone 8 began sweeping the web just a few months after Apple released the iPhone 7 line. And although the iPhone 7 sold out in a week, many saw it as nothing more than a refreshed iPhone 6 – which has put some pressure on Apple to impress its users. But with all the cutting-edge technology that is expected to be in the iPhone 8 design, many suggest that the Cupertino company is pulling out all the stops for the iPhone 8 family.  However, it seems that the new technology may push back the launch date, according to a new report from DigiTimes. It is suggested that Apple has passed over both the Synaptic’s Natural ID touch fingerprint sensor and Qualcomm’s Sense ID for the iPhone. It is, however, going with its own technology for a fingerprint recognition solution – Authentec algorithm combined with Privaris glass identification technology. ‘Apple's in-house developed fingerprint ID solution will be fabricated at TSMC's 12-inch line using 65nm process technology, sources told DigitTimes. The sources also said this move will push production for the OLED iPhone back until September, which means the handset will not go on sale until October. However, it may be worth the wait, as this technology will allow for a bezel-less design because the component will be a ‘built-in’ sensor integrated into the display, reports 9to5Mac.

Share this article Share 16 shares It is speculated that this component will use biometric technologies, instead of the traditional capacitive sensors found in Touch ID. It is also believed to be positioned in the ‘function area’ region of the display. The firm is going with its own technology for a fingerprint recognition solution – Authentec algorithm combined with Privaris glass identification technology. It is speculated that this component will use biometric technologies Although the delay could be a disappointment, Apple is one to stick close to a timeline when it comes to launching its devices, which is usually in September. And the last time the firm released a handset in October was the iPhone 4s. IPHONE 8 RUMORS   Several rumors have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have:  - Dual-lens 3D camera - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings  - Curved glass casing - Plastic OLED screen - Wireless charging - A folding element  - New 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimeter) model, which will have a wraparound OLED screen  - 5.8 inch will be designed with the Touch ID finger print sensor 'under the glass and in the active display area' - A new 'pure white' model - Aluminum back will be replaced with two reinforced glass panes and a metal frame in the middle  - Facial recognition Other than speculating the release date, other reports have suggested that the iPhone 8 will come with a hefty price tag. Fast Company revealed earlier this month that the smartphone could cost $1,000. Surpassing the $1,000 (£800) mark may sound outrageous, but Apple has already released a smartphone that gets close to the price – the 256GB version of the iPhone 7 Plus costs $969 (£919). However, ‘the new iPhone 8 is expected to be packed with many more features,’ reports Mark Sullivan with Fast Company. Sources also revealed the new technology that could make its way into the device. There are mixed feelings about the name for Apple’s 5.8-inch phone, as some say it will be called the ‘iPhone 8’, while others suggest ‘iPhone X’. Regardless, it is said to ‘look something like a smooth black monolith, with few visual interruptions to its sleek design,’ explained Sullivan. The firm is also rumored to be launching two other smartphones along with the iPhone 8 – a 4.7-inch (the iPhone 7s) and a 5.5-inch (the iPhone 7s Plus). Both the 5.5-inch model and the 5.8-inch model are believed to be equipped with the same camera used in the iPhone 7 Plus – the dual-lens camera.    Read more: Here's Why Apple's 10th Anniversary iPhone Will Likely Cost More Than $1,000 | Fast Company | Business + Innovation Apple News on iPhone, iPad and Macbooks | Daily Mail Online Report: iPhone 8 to start mass production in September, featuring Apple-custom ¿built-in¿ fingerprint sensor | 9to5Mac Apple redesigns fingerprint ID solution for OLED iPhone, say sources Share or comment on this article e-mail 16 shares Most watched News videos Leopards attack giant Rock Python in Kruger National Park The Walking Dead: New strain of spice turns homeless into zombies Woman stops car to beat passenger senseless on the road Louis Tomlinson challenges photographer before taking out fan Shocking video shows moment teenager is stabbed in South Norwood Droning on!: Neighbour tries to shoot down spying drone Violent brawl breaks out after man is savagely headbutted to floor Shocking video shows why Coke Zero really is better for you The Manly ferry tackles huge swells over the weekend Dash cam captures close drive-By shooting in Kansas Avalanche crashes down mountain at Russian ski resort Clever dog says 'I love you' to its owner to get treat PIERS MORGAN: Sorry Emma, but you haven’t done yourself...

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Share on Twitter Click me! Copy Link Apple is one of the most successful companies in the world and beloved by millions and millions of adoring fans who will wait hours in line to be the first to purchase one of their new iPhones or other devices. But like much of the tech industry, they also have an increasingly obvious problem with gender, racial and cultural diversity that is perhaps most glaring in the company’s leadership. But for the second year in a row, the company’s shareholders rejected a seemingly benign proposal that would task the company with beginning an effort to recruit more diverse members across its senior management and board of directors. In fact, as USA Today reports, shareholders didn’t just reject the proposal, they did so in overwhelming fashion, with 95 percent voting against the proposal from shareholders Tony Maldonado and Zevin Asset Management, which in part would task Apple to “adopt an accelerated recruitment policy ... to increase the diversity of senior management and its board of directors.” Apple’s own numbers paint a bleak picture for diversity proponents. While the company sites marginally improved numbers, the facts remain clear: the company’s overall workforce is 56 percent white, with 9 percent Asians, 12 percent Hispanics and 9 percent African-Americans. However, the company’s senior management reportedly remains overwhelmingly white. For its part, Apple claims their own diversity recruitment policy is actually better than the one offered by Maldonado and Zevin Asset Management. In the shareholding meeting before the vote, Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly said: "We are focused on human rights and diversity, (and are) advocating for it around the world and increasing it in our own community.” However, Maldonado tells The Verge that he never expected to win the vote. But if the proposal received even 6 percent support, that would meet a baseline allowing him to re-submit it next year. Instead, he says the company openly advocated that its shareholders vote “no,” saying: “Apple basically duped the investors, to be quite honest,” he said. “They conned ’em to say, ‘Look, we're on top of it. Don’t worry about it. Everything’s fine.’ However, I believe that shareholders don’t have all information as to the background of the issue.” Recently on GOOD Stop What You're Doing This Instant And Change All Your Passwords Immediately Do it for your data Culture Andre Grant New Coke Ad Shows A Brother and Sister Fighting Over The Pool Boy It’s a fresh twist on the Diet Coke hunk campaign Communities Tod Perry Four Vietnamese Girls Come Together To Give A Hilarious Response To A Racist Question It’s an unforgettable yearbook quote Communities Tod Perry Is Artificial Turf Toxic?

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India Elections World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones iPhone 8 release date, features: Late launch expected over delay in mass production Apple is using its Authentec algorithm and Privaris glass identification technology for new fingerprint ID in iPhone 8. Raymond Ronamai   March 4, 2017 00:37 IST AppleReuters Apple has the tradition of releasing its iPhone devices in September, and the current iPhone 7 also arrived in the same month last year, but the launch of the upcoming flagship dubbed as the iPhone 8 is likely to be delayed. The Cupertino giant is using its "Authentec algorithm combined with Privaris glass identification technology to redesign a new fingerprint ID solution" for its new iPhones, and not Synaptics' Natural ID touch fingerprint sensor nor Qualcomm's Sense ID fingerprint technology, industry sources told Digitimes. [READ: Apple's iPhone 8 could feature huge change that fans may not see coming] The report went on to say that the upcoming iPhone 8 will not go into mass production until September, which means its launch could be delayed. Apple usually sells over 10 million units of its flagship in its release week itself, so it may take some time to make so much handset. It won't come as a surprise if the release date of the device is pushed to October. Nothing much is known about Apple's iPhone 8 but a few reports that have been spotted thus far have claimed that the device could be a game-changer for the Cupertino-based company. Reports have claimed that it could sport a 5.8-inch display with an OLED (organic light-emitting diode) screen and come with a wireless charger.

The former positions iPad Pro as a clutter-free alternative to clunky desktop PCs. The latter makes the bold claim that iPad Pro and Apple Pencil “revolutionized the way people take notes,” adding that users can even record voice notes. Watch the new videos, then jump into the comment section to tell us how you liked them. Like prior iPad Pro videos, the new clips are based on real tweets from real people. Here are the new videos. Take better notes Based on a 2012 tweet from Twitter account @jeszka24. “You could take notes in a whole new way, if your computer was an iPad Pro”. We get it, Apple—iPad is the new computer. Need less stuff Based on a 2015 tweet from blogger, designer and photographer Lix Hewett. “Your computer would be more than a computer, if your computer was an iPad Pro,” says the video’s description. Must be fun for these folks to wake up realizing their tweeting has been featured in an Apple commercial. The previous ad has showcased other Apple Pencil features. The remaining clips in Apple’s “Real problems… answered” ad campaign positioned iPad Pro as a viable notebook replacement, focusing on such features and benefits as lack of viruses, availability of Microsoft Office and built-in cellular connectivity. How do you like the new videos? Which one do you prefer over the other, and why?

First it was “the iPad” a simple focused tablet then they screwed the iPad line with the iPad mini and the iPad Air… And again with the iPad pro and the iPad pro mini ( 9,7″ ) and now the upcoming 10.5″ iPad pro mini plus ( hopefully it wouldn’t be called that ). God damn it Apple! More models kill the simplicity that you once were loved for. Blip dude “Just too many options …. And you can’t just go around throwing “pro” at what ever you like.” I don’t think options is the issue, but Apple has yet to convince me how the iPad is a “Pro” device outside of the extra cost for the previlege to use their overpriced pencil and keyboard. How about an iOS design for the iPad first?? You know, an OS that actually unleashes the true power of the iPad. Stuart Lombard I would also have to agree. The average consumer may be turned off by the ‘pro’ monicker. Apple’s audience may be confused about what the device is and isn’t.

According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the new iPhones will retain the Lightning connector on the device side but make use of USB-C Power Delivery specification for charging. This means the other end of the charging cable is the one that will have a USB-C connector, the one that plugs into the charger. This has two advantages. First, USB-C can carry much more power than standard USB-A. It's the same reason Google provides end-to-end USB-C cables to enable fast charging on its devices (and not just to spite you). Future iPhone chargers will then have a USB-C connector like the new MacBook/MacBook Pro chargers or the Google Pixel charger. Second, the iPhone could then be plugged straight into the company's new MacBooks without the need for an adapter. Sure, you'd then need an adapter for practically every other computer but I'm sure Apple will be happy to sell you an adapter for that. To be clear, this is not new. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro already supports fast charging when you use the optional Apple USB-C to Lightning cable and plug it into one of the Apple 29W, 61W, or 87W USB-C Power Adapter. So far this has been the only iOS device to support fast charging but clearly we are going to see this feature coming to more iOS devices this year. Kuo is a reliable source but again at this point it's still a rumour. However, it seems far, far more likely than Apple putting a USB-C connector on one of its iOS devices. That rumor seemed outlandish to begin with and in the light of this rumor seems even more unlikely.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Movies TV Awards Reviews HWD Daily What’s Next for the Academy? Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER HWD Daily What’s Next for the Academy? Academy leadership change is on its way, critics love this Kong, and Apple is looking for polished résumés. by Rebecca KeeganMarch 3, 2017 1:38 pm Email Facebook Twitter It’s Friday, and I’m about to embark on a glamour-filled, one-week staycation in the San Fernando Valley. While I’m gone, my colleagues Yohana Desta and Joanna Robinson will be minding the HWD Daily store. Hello from Los Angeles, where we’re eyeballing the Academy’s next steps, checking on who’s taking meetings with Apple, and marveling at Kong’s gorilla-size raves. Sign up to receive Rebecca Keegan’s HWD Daily, Hollywood’s new must-read, in your inbox. THE ACADEMY’S NEXT CHAPTER What a difference a week makes. Last Friday I was sitting in Oscar rehearsals at the Dolby Theatre praying for something interesting to happen on Sunday night’s show. It sure did, and after a week of processing the best-picture envelope snafu, now a major looming question is what happens next for the two people who have lead the Academy through a period of historic transformation, controversy, and growth— the group’s elected president, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, and its C.E.O., Dawn Hudson, who reports to the board of governors. On Thursday, Boone Isaacs sent what Deadline’s Pete Hammond called a “pep talk” email to Academy members, recapping the show’s highlights and promising “changes will be implemented” to address the problems that lead PricewaterhouseCoopers accountant Brian Cullinan to hand Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway the wrong envelope. By Michael Buckner/Variety/Rex/Shutterstock. One big change coming, whether Academy members want it or not, is that Boone Isaacs is winding down her fourth and final term as president this summer. The onetime marketing executive has been a steadying hand in tumultuous times, and, as its first black president and only its third woman, was someone especially well positioned to lead the organization during a diversity debate that she never asked for. This summer, the Academy will have to select a new leader to carry out the ambitious inclusion initiatives the board passed during Boone Isaacs’s tenure, complete the building of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures scheduled to open in 2018, and navigate the organization’s critical relationship with its broadcast partner, ABC, which has exerted more creative control over the telecast since extending its contract through 2028 last summer. Before Boone Isaacs leaves, in May, the Academy’s 54-member board of governors faces another important leadership decision, when Hudson’s contract comes up for renewal. Hudson, who has overseen the staff of more than 300 people running the Academy’s day-to-day operations since 2011, has been the yang to Boone Isaacs’s yin, prodding dramatic change at the 90-year-old organization, and may continue to do if the board wants her to stay. Whatever the board does regarding Hudson, there’s no question the two women have lead the Academy during one of its most challenging eras, with complementary and occasionally clashing styles. VF.com’s Yohana Desta takes a look at what’s next for the major players in Sunday night’s show. KONG-SIZE PRAISE Who’d a thunk it? It turns out Kong: Skull Island, which Warner Bros. opens stateside March 10, is actually pretty good. Variety chief film critic Owen Gleiberman writes that the action-adventure pic starring Brie Larson and Tom Hiddleston “isn’t just 10 times as good as Jurassic World; it’s a rousing and smartly crafted primordial-beastie spectacular.” The Hollywood Reporter’s Todd McCarthy says director Jordan Vogt-Roberts’s take on the giant primate feels “more like 90 minutes than two hours—and achieves an ideal balance between wild action, throwaway humor, genre refreshment and, perhaps most impressively, a nonchalant awareness of its own modest importance in the bigger scheme of things; unlike most modern franchise blockbusters, it doesn’t try to pummel you into submission.” APPLE’S HOLLYWOOD SHINE Senior Apple execs are taking an awful lot of meetings in Hollywood right now, The New York Post’s Claire Atkinson reports. The Cupertino, California, tech giant has been talking to film and TV producers, made stops at Sony and Paramount, and is “looking for a transformative acquisition,” Atkinson writes. TRAVIS’S NEXT STEP Laika C.E.O. Travis Knight, who directed the Oscar-nominated stop-motion animation film Kubo and the Two Strings, has signed on to helm Bumblebee, the first spinoff of Paramount’s Transformers franchise, Deadline’s Anita Busch reports. The 2018 film will be the first live-action effort for Knight, the son of Nike founder Phil Knight, and will presumably require the Laika exec to find someone to assume some of his duties at his Portland, Oregon, studio. That’s the news for this sunny Friday in L.A. I’ll be back in the saddle Monday, March 13.

As the increase in streaming subscribers continues to push the global recorded music industry to growth it hasn't seen since the last millennium, there has been a slight shift in power from traditional record labels towards digital streamers like Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon. Now, Indian streaming service Saavn -- the subcontinent's version of Spotify, with 20 million monthly active users -- is moving to break down the boundaries between streamers and labels, assuming more of the responsibilities that labels have long provided for their artists. Already, signs of the shift have appeared in the U.S., as Frank Ocean's Blonde and Chance the Rapper's Grammy-winning Coloring Book were released directly through Apple Music without the support of any record label, raising the question of whether Apple would move to expand its operations. So far, the tech giant has demurred from commenting on the possibility, and as Chance and Frank both already enjoyed significant fan bases, there was little risk in investing in things such as artist development on each release. In India, however, Saavn is taking a more explicit approach, introducing an Artist in Residence program last August -- the company released an album by electronic DJ Nucleya and helped route and promote his subsequent tour using its listening data -- as well as a remix initiative shortly thereafter, aiming to give Indian artists on its platform the rights to remix songs by Western artists such as Maroon 5 and OneRepublic, and vice versa. On Feb. 24, Saavn announced a new Artist Originals initiative, having linked with Indian rapper Naezy to release his song "Azaad Hu Mai," becoming the first streamer in India to back a song from inception to distribution without collaborating with a middleman. As the service has grown -- 41 million new users installed its app and listening hours doubled over the past 12 months, according to the company's internal statistics provided to Billboard -- it is beginning to expand its outreach to provide more and more services to local artists bypassing the label system and, more significantly, signing artists to direct deals. "You have a new world of artists that are budding in India, from hip-hop to singer-songwriters," says Rishi Malhotra, Saavn's co-founder and CEO. "Because we have the scale we do, we're starting to blur the lines between a streaming service and a label. Our goal is to be the most creative place for artists to do what they love." Part of Saavn's success in the space comes from the particulars of the local Indian music industry, which has traditionally been tied to Bollywood and the film world, and encompasses some 900 distinct labels that have resisted the consolidation that the U.S. has seen. Saavn's growth has coincided with both a rise in independent underground artists with no ties to the film world, producing a creative class without a traditional support system -- which created the gap for Saavn to fill. "If in the U.S. the way artists got promotion and distribution was through mixtapes and radio, in India that has always been film," Malhotra says. "And I think what you've seen in the last 12 to 24 months is the massive disruption of that, due just to the market... In the last year, film music was 85 percent of total streams; now it's 65 percent." Malhotra chalks that up to several reasons: the generational shift towards mobile and away from traditional television and film; the internet's ability to break down traditional borders, leading to a rise in English language music -- Drake, Sia, the Chainsmokers -- streaming in India; the steady rise in internet access across the subcontinent; and what he calls India's "connectivity tipping point," which he compares to AT&T's introduction of unlimited data plans nearly a decade ago and its subsequent boon for streaming services like Pandora in the U.S. "In September 2016, [telecom company] Reliance Jio opened up unlimited data, and since then you're just seeing a boon in terms of connectivity and engagement," Malhotra says. "Whereas we used to do 500 million streams in a quarter, now we do 500 million streams in a month, easily, and that's just in the last six or seven months." Saavn's potential attracted interest from key players early on such as Guy Oseary, who manages Madonna and U2 and runs Maverick Management, who invested in the company through his investment firm, Sound. "I finally was able to do almost two things at once: which is back the best streaming service with the best people involved in India, but also now have a real relationship with India for the first time," Oseary says. "So after, you know, 25 years in the music business, I can finally say to Madonna or any of the clients that we work with, if you want to do something musically with India we have the partner to do it with." Oseary has been a key part of Saavn's moves further into the label space, connecting his artists with the service's remix initiative, for example. "I’m patient," he says about Saavn's prospects on a broader scale. "I don’t know if the word is explode, but I know I’m going to get to the same place regardless. I believe that this company will be the streaming service of India." With its original music programs, Saavn also distributes its artists' work beyond just its own streaming service, working songs to radio and releasing them widely to other digital outlets as well -- an approach that seems counter-intuitive for a company that would otherwise be able to directly control all aspects of its distribution. But Malhotra doesn't see long-term value for artists in maintaining exclusivity. "We believe in distribution, and it's not just about us containing the song to Saavn's user base," he says. "If you do exclusivity in perpetuity, it increases piracy and it really holds back the reason for actually doing this: the music should be heard." Will Saavn's 360-degree approach catch on Stateside? Apple Music, Spotify and Tidal have all made strides into original content, but it has largely centered around films, documentaries or new television series, like Apple's Carpool Karaoke show. But there have been small-scale steps in that direction; Spotify, for instance, introduced a singles series in November where artists such as John Legend, D.R.A.M. and Tove Lo record an original song of their own and a cover song in Spotify's in-house studio, as well as a live performance initiative that it will host on its platform. But so far, the major players in the Western streaming world have resisted moving in on the labels' territory. Saavn, clearly, does not have the same reservations. "Labels are our core partners, and they always will be, and I think that's true of any music streaming service," Malhotra says. "But I think music isn't only about libraries, it's truly about moving people. [India is] a country that has been heavily pirated over the last 20 years, and now Saavn has become a legitimate platform for labels, artists and users. So this coming year is about two things: growth and delivering a sustainable economic model for this country. And I believe we're delivering in both cases."

Windows 10 Mobile not widely used. Bottom Line Windows 10 delivers a host of new technology that makes interacting with your PC more natural than ever. The improved interface, security, Edge Web browser, and other apps and features make Windows 10 worthy of our Editors' Choice award. By Michael Muchmore Windows 10 holds the lead in innovation when it comes to desktop operating systems. Consider, for example, that the voice-activated digital assistant Cortana showed up a full year before Apple added Siri to macOS, that only Windows Hello lets you log in with your face, and that only Windows offers full touch-screen support. What's more, last summer's Anniversary Update added rich digital-inking capabilities, lock-screen Cortana and music controls, better security, and improvements to the interface and Edge web browser. Yet even with all its forward-looking features, the OS manages to remain familiar to longtime Windows users. For this, Windows 10 joins macOS as a PCMag Editors' Choice for desktop operating systems. //Compare Similar Products Compare Apple macOS Sierra   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Windows 8.1 Update   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Windows 7   %displayPrice%%seller% Ubuntu 12.04 ("Precise Pangolin")   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft's latest operating system is a much bigger hit than its ill-fated predecessor, Windows 8. In the year and a half since launch, Windows 10 has attained a 25 percent desktop operating system share, with more than 400 million copies installed—a faster adoption rate than any previous version of Windows. By comparison, all versions of Apple's operating system account for just 7 percent of worldwide computers, according to data from NetMarketShare. Microsoft bills the operating system as a "service," meaning it's continually updated via the cloud. A case in point is last summer's Anniversary Update, which added impressive new features like digital ink support, as well as some helpful design improvements, many of which were prompted by the vast amounts of user feedback Microsoft has collected. In October the company announced that the Windows 10 Creators Update would arrive in "early 2017." This will add a 3D-capable version of Paint (more on that below), and game broadcasting. More productivity, creativity, security and gaming features are on the way, too, according to Microsoft. The previously announced My People unified communication feature announced for Creators Update has been postponed to the next major update. In between those major updates, Windows 10 users have received a completely updated version of the Photos app, new Cortana capabilities, and new features in the built-in Maps app. The most recent feature news between major updates comes in the Windows Mail and Calendar apps. Below, you'll find more on all of these. View All 25 Photos in Gallery How to Get Windows 10 If you didn't move up from Windows 7 or 8 during the year it was free, you can still get Windows 10, but you have to pay for it. You can get the software via download or on USB sticks for the same prices as previous Windows versions; that is, $119.99 list for Home and $199.99 for Pro. Your data and programs come along for the ride when you update from previous versions, though it's always a good idea to back up before an OS upgrade. Windows 10's minimum system requirements are surprisingly low: a 1GHz processor, 1GB of RAM, and 16GB of hard drive space. The 64-bit version of Windows 10 increases the RAM requirement to 2GB and the disk space to 20GB. You'll also need a DirectX 9-capable graphics card and a display with at least 800-by-600 resolution. You can find out whether your system is up to snuff by reading Can My PC Run Windows 10? Windows 10 is available to most users in just two editions: Home and Pro (with 32-bit and 64-bit options for each), but all of the major features appear in both versions. Pro adds business-y things like network domain joining, Hyper-V virtualization, group policy management, and BitLocker encryption. That last one may be of interest to security-conscious personal users, too. Unsurprisingly, if you upgrade from Home levels of Windows 7 or 8, you get Windows 10 Home, and if you update from the professional versions of 7 or 8, you get Pro. There are, of course, other editions of Windows 10 for special use cases: Enterprise is still an option for large organizations that want bulk licensing deals. Anniversary Update introduced two new Education versions for K-12 institutions: Windows 10 Pro Education and Windows 10 Education. Neither includes Cortana, for now. And let's not forget the lightweight edition that powers Internet-of-things devices and the Raspberry Pi: Windows 10 IoT Core. Windows 10 presents almost no learning curve for longtime Windows users, while managing to incorporate many of the advances of Windows 8—faster startup, tablet capability, better notifications, and an app store. Its windowing prowess remains unmatched, letting you easily show the desktop and snap windows to the sides and corner quadrants of the screen. The newest Windows still runs the vast majority of the millions of Windows programs in the wild. Yes, that means it still uses the much-derided Registry to maintain configuration settings, but on today's fast hardware that no longer presents issues. (Microsoft recommends against using any third-party registry-optimizing software for Windows 10.) When setting up a Windows 10 account, you can log in to a local account, without the need for a Microsoft account (macOS, by comparison, requires an Apple account), but you'll lose many of the OS's best features if you do so. A lot of critics have nevertheless called out Microsoft for harvesting usage data by default, so if you're the paranoid type, you shouldn't set up the PC using Express Settings, which enable anonymous usage data collection. For details, read Windows 10: How to Protect Your Privacy. Interface Aside from the improvements to headliner features, such as Cortana, Hello, and Ink, the Anniversary Update makes some subtle, but useful, improvements to the desktop interface. For example, the Start menu has been updated: Now it shows the All Apps list without a second button press, and it also shows most used and newly installed apps. I've often found clicking the date in the Taskbar useful, since it pops up a calendar; now you can also see your appointments in that view. Live tiles have also been updated in a way that makes more sense than before. Now, when you click on a live tile, you'll go to the content highlighted there, rather than just to the app. For example, you'll go directly to the news story or the email or the photo showing on the live tile. The Windows Store also gets another redesign, this time with features designed to appeal to gamers, in particular. It's aligned more closely with the Xbox Store, and it now offers game bundles and subscriptions. For everyone else, the new design does make it a bit easier to get to the top apps, music, and movies. The Store's download progress indicator is now bigger and clearer, too. One other tweak is that the Action Center (see below) icon now is all the way at the right of the Taskbar, making it easier reach. And one final new interface option, Dark mode, shows apps with black window backgrounds, which can be gentler on the eyes—as well as just looking cool. Another interface feature I've really started to cherish is File Explorer's Quick Access section. This lets you easily find whatever file you were last working on in whatever application you were using. So, if you edit an image and want to add it to another app, it's right at the top of the Quick Access list. You never have to remember where you just saved a file to find it. Overlap between the Settings App and Control Panel still remains an interface legacy of Windows 8, but really, it's no longer such an issue. For simple system settings, you use the Settings app, for deep, technical system options, you go to the Control Panel. Cortana Tricks Cortana, Windows' voice-responsive AI digital assistant, may be Windows 10's highest-profile feature. The intelligent voice assistant predates Apple's Siri on the Mac by over a year. I should note that you can no longer completely disable Cortana in the Update, but you can prevent her from accessing your location, email, contacts, and browsing history, and communications. You can also turn off her listening for "Hey Cortana." Cortana is, however, the search function in the OS, but you can hide the search bar if you never want to use it. You can now use Cortana from the lock screen. This is useful for things like playing a particular music playlist, asking about today's weather, or asking for information. Speaking of music, the Cortana panel now has a musical note button that serves a Shazam-like function to identify songs in range of your PC's mic. Intel also has new wake-on-voice technology that means you could say "Hey Cortana!" and have the PC respond even if it's in sleep mode. It's sort of like an Amazon Echo, without the need for a separate device. Cortana Notebook, which is where you specify your interests so that you'll be notified about what matters to you, has added a few more categories, including On the Go, which pops up suggestions for when you arrive at work or home. Unlike Siri or Google Now, with Cortana, you specify exactly what the assistant knows about you—interests, important people, locations—and you choose whether to have her respond to your spoken "Hey Cortana," or whether you want to use the feature at all. One improvement to Cortana Reminders is the removal of the Place, Person, or Time requirement: Sometimes you just want to be reminded of something without having to specify any of those. With the previous version, I sometimes tried to set a reminder but gave up because I didn't have a time or place in mind. This simple tweak makes the tool a whole lot more useful. Cortana Reminders is now a share target; when you hit the share button in a Universal Windows App (UWA), you can set a reminder that's richer than before. For example, if you're in the Edge Web browser, you can hit the Share button, choose Cortana Reminders, and attach the site URL to the reminder. If you do this from the Photos app, the picture is included in the reminder. A recent Cortana reminder feature can scan your Outlook.com or Office 365 email for phrases like "I'll get you the report by the end of the day," and pop a reminder automatically at the end of your workday. It's a completely opt-in feature, and you have to add Outlook.com or Office 365 as a connected service in Cortana's Notebook. Cortana in Windows 10 now interacts more tightly with Cortana apps on other devices, such as Android phones and iPhones. You can enable notifications from the phone, including things like low-battery warnings, to show up on Cortana on Windows. You also see messages from WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and SMS from the phone. With all of these improvements, Windows 10 is edging towards the tight integration between mobile and desktop that you find in macOS, though it still doesn't let you reply, except to Skype messages. The integration also works more fully with Android devices than with iOS devices, since the latter restrict access to some system capabilities. Of course, it works best with phones running Windows 10 Mobile, but while they're still available, and even with new models like the HP Elite x3 coming out, the platform has failed to make significant inroads into the smartphone market. Windows Ink Touch and pen input support is a major differentiator between Windows 10 and Apple's macOS. Apple sticks with Steve Job's edict that touch screens don't make sense on laptops and desktops. But a touch screen is the most intuitive interface type possible. You see something you want to interact with, such as a button, you press it with your finger. In using a Surface Pro 4 and an Asus Zen AiO Pro Z240IC all-in-one PC (both of which have touch screens) for the past year or so, I've gotten to the point of trying to tap buttons on computers with non-touch screens out of habit. Windows' digital ink capabilities allow stylus input to work just like a pen or pencil, converting it to text. This is a technologically cool feature, but it will only be of interest to owners of tablets and convertibles like the Surface Pro 4, the Surface Book or the Lenovo IdeaPad Miix 700. The new Windows Ink Workspace offers sticky notes (with extra smarts), as well as Sketchpad and Screen Sketch options. It also shows recent apps you've penned in and suggests pen-friendly apps in the Store. You can turn off the feature's icon if you don't expect to use it. This new Ink Workspace can be summoned by clicking a stylus button. You can also take advantage of some Cortana smarts in the new sticky notes. For example, if you write "Wednesday," the text is turned to a blue link, and clicking this gives you the option to set a Cortana reminder. I actually had better luck getting Cortana to notice flight information when I typed it in the note, rather than penning it, however. Info on flight status for such notes appears at the bottom of the sticky. Sketchpad offers ballpoint pen, pencil, highlighter, eraser, ruler, and touch writing tools. Sketchpad resembles the whiteboard app on the Surface Hub. It also lets you crop the image, copy it, and share it to any Universal Windows app in the share sidebar. A ruler tool lets you draw perfectly straight lines, and even includes a compass. Double-clicking the pen button or choosing Screen Sketch from the Ink Workspace snaps a screenshot of your desktop and opens it in Sketchpad so you can annotate and draw on top of it with any of the aforementioned tools. One of the coolest inking capabilities is the pen keyboard. You switch to this mode from the standard on-screen keyboard. Start writing on the line there, and text predictions show up. Hit enter, and your writing turns into text in whatever text area you're writing in. It does surprisingly well with even poor penmanship, and striking through your writing deletes it easily. Edge Web Browser Gets More Capable The Edge Web browser that comes with Windows 10 is fast and compatible, and it offers unique tools like Web Notes that let you mark up and share webpages, a clean (ad-free) Reading view, and built-in Cortana information. Until now, however, it has lacked a feature that power users insist on: Extensions. Edge's new Extensions menu option links to the Windows app store, from which you can finally get Edge extensions. I tested by installing one I consider essential—LastPass. There are also extensions for Amazon, Evernote, Microsoft Translator, OneNote, Pinterest, Pocket, and others. Though it's not a long list yet, those are some heavy hitters that will make the browser appealing to more demanding users. Of course, it's just a start, and there are only 23 extensions at time of writing, compared with thousands for Firefox and Chrome. Microsoft representatives told me that the reason for this is that the Edge team is being very careful in vetting extensions, not wanting another ActiveX-type security nightmare. They're also still building out the API; we should see a lot more extensions when Creators Update rolls out. Coding for IE's extensions uses the same Web technologies as Chrome does (HTML and JavaScript), however, and Microsoft says converting existing Chrome extensions will be trivial. In fact, the W3C is coming out with a Browser Extension standard, which Microsoft aims to support. After downloading the LastPass extension in the store, I hit the Launch button on its store page, and then saw a message in the top-right corner of the browser notifying me that a new extension was available and offering to turn it on. I then had to log in to my LastPass account on a webpage. (I also use Duo Mobile for two-factor authentication, which I allowed from my iPhone). Unlike most browsers' extensions, Edge's appear by default in the overflow menu rather than next to the address bar, but you can add their icons to the toolbar with a Settings option. The LastPass extension worked just as in other browsers. LastPass's on-page features, such as automatic password fill-in, also worked well via the extension. Edge now gets 460 out of a possible 555 points in my testing on the HTML5Test.com site, making it highly compatible with modern Web standards compared with IE, which scores 312. Firefox, by comparison, gets 466, Opera comes in at 504, and Chrome still leads with 507. Edge's low battery drain on portable PCs and tablets, is another feather it its cap (see my review linked below). I also did a quick speed test using the JetStream benchmark on a Surface Book with an Intel Core i5 and 8GB RAM. The benchmark runs three times through a bank of 38 tests. Bigger scores are better. Firefox got a score of 142, Chrome achieved 168, and Edge came in at 196. That's not so surprising: Earlier Edge versions even beat Chrome on Google's own Octane benchmark. Tablet and touch-screen users will like Edge's new swipe gestures, which let you go back and forth in history, and desktop users will appreciate that the back button now drops down tab history, as most browsers do. I also appreciate that Edge, like other browsers, now offers a Paste-and-go option and the ability to pin tabs. Unfortunately, there's still no full-screen browser view and you can't set an image as your desktop background from the browser. For an in-depth look, read my full review of Microsoft Edge. Windows Hello and Improved Security One focus of the Anniversary Update is security, including Windows Hello biometric authentication. Hello is not only supported on Surface Pros and Books, but you can also use third-party biometric login devices, such as the Eidon Mini fingerprint reader, Intel's RealSense cameras, and a wristband from Nymi that identifies you by your unique heartbeat signature. And on the software side, Windows Universal Apps and websites you browse in Edge can also use Hello for authentication, similar to identifying yourself on an iPhone or Apple Watch with Apple's TouchID. Apps that support Hello now include Dropbox and iHeartRadio. In more security news, the included anti-malware software, Windows Defender, adds the ability to schedule regular system scans and new notifications about threats. Enterprise security feature adds include two major new features: Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection, which detects and resolves advanced network threats; and Windows Information Protection, which isolates corporate data from personal data on work PCs. Though our security expert, Neil Rubenking, found the pre-Anniversary version of Defender showed some improved scores on independent lab tests, it still trails most third-party antivirus. Action Center A Windows 10 feature with roots in mobile operating systems is the Action Center. While previous versions of Windows included something also called Action Center, the new feature is more like a smartphone's notifications plus quick action features. In fact, that's exactly what it is. Windows 8 had notifications, but they were ephemeral—if you missed one, whether it was a Facebook message or a severe weather alert, it was gone after a brief appearance. The Windows 10 Action Center, similar to Apple macOS Sierra's Notification Center, keeps those messages available in a right-side panel. You open Windows 10's Action Center panel from a taskbar button, or on touch screens with a swipe in from the right edge of the screen. The panel also offers frequently needed functions like power, settings, networking, and screen brightness and rotation. One of these actions, Connect, is pretty neat, in that it lets you project your screen onto another one on your network. I was able to display my Surface Pro 3's screen on a big Samsung TV with no setup aside from choosing OK on the TV—pretty nifty. Store and Universal Windows Apps If you never upgraded to Windows 8 or 8.1, you don't know what it is to have an app store on your PC desktop. Why do you need an app store on your PC? Mac users have had one for several years, and it offers the advantages of automatic updating and a single source for finding programs you need. It gives you access on all your PCs (and Windows Phones) to apps you've bought. Acceptance to the Windows Store also means an app has been vetted by Microsoft for security. You can also install apps to external memory—something tablet users will appreciate. For Windows 10, there are even more advantages for these modern apps: They can tie in with the notifications and share panels. For example, if you use the Facebook app rather than going to the Facebook website, you can see notifications for new messages and you can send shareable content via the app. Windows 10 Store apps are called Universal Windows apps, meaning they can run on desktops, tablets, phones, the Surface Hub, and eventually on the Xbox and Microsoft HoloLens reality-augmentation 3D headset. Underneath these apps is Windows 10's OneCore platform, a common base that underlies all these device types and allows not only apps, but also device drivers to work with them. UWAs have one more benefit: They run within containers so that they don't mess with the rest of your system. Continuum and Tablet Mode Continuum refers to switching among desktop, smartphone, and tablet modes. The idea is that the single OS can automatically reformat itself to work best with the form factor at hand. It's most impressive on smartphones, where Continuum lets you use the small handheld device to power a large screen along with a mouse and keyboard, for a desktop-like experience. That's been the idea of the future for several years: A world in which your only computer fits in your pocket. You can either use the Microsoft Display Dock for this or connect over Wi-Fi using a Miracast-supporting HDTV or set-top box. It's brilliantly done, and pretty impressive when you first see it. The phone turns into a trackpad and keyboard when needed, yet you can still use it as a phone while it's displaying Windows on the big screen. One drawback: Continuum only allows the phone to display one full-size modern Store app (including Office apps) at a time. Another issue is that it only works with the latest Windows Phone models, such as the Lumia 950. Tablet mode is no longer considered a Continuum feature, but is simply referred to as Tablet mode. This is a trimmed down, more touch-friendly version of the OS, with a full-screen tile-based Start screen. After you pull off the keyboard from a tablet, such as the Surface Pro 4, or convert a convertible laptop to tablet mode (often by bending the screen backwards), Windows pops up a message asking if you want to switch to Tablet mode, in which the Start menu and modern apps become full screen. Touch gestures like closing an app by swiping down from the top of the screen work in this mode. For Anniversary, the All Apps view stretches across the screen with large tiles, making it easier to get to any app on the PC. Continuum and tablet mode should not be confused with Apple's Continuity, which is all about switching from one device to another while continuing an activity, whether you are sending an SMS text or editing a document. Windows 10 actually does have an option for using Bluetooth to continue app experiences from one device to another, however. Included Apps—Office Mobile, Mail, Calendar, Photos You get a surprisingly full kit of apps with Windows 10. Not only do you get the modern information apps that came with Windows 8—Maps, Money, News, Sports, Food & Drink, Health & Fitness, and so on—but you also can get Microsoft Office from the Windows app store. You heard that right, but there's a catch: Unless you have an Office 365 subscription, you can only read, not edit, documents with these productivity apps. The version of Office you get with Windows 10 is equivalent to the iPad version of Office, called Office Mobile. It's capable of most word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation needs, but pros who need to dig into Excel pivot tables and Word advanced formatting will want the Office 365 version. The included Mail app (which is called Outlook on the mobile version of Windows 10) is getting smarter too, with Focused Inbox rolling out even before Creators Update. This is a great feature that's already implemented in the Outlook for iPhone and Android apps. It filters out all the newsletters and promotions, and only shows you mail from those with whom you regularly correspond, or that is=s in some other way deemed important by the service. You can of course still see everything else at the tap of a tab, and turn off this focusing for mail you don't want highlighted. You can now also use @ signs in an email body to add them to the conversation. Still, the app isn't as powerful as the Office 365 desktop version, though I must admit that it's now good enough to be my everyday work email client. The Mail app is integrated with Calendar and Contact apps, available from buttons along the bottom of Mail. Calendar does a presentable job of handling multiple calendars, appointments, and views. Recent additions to the Calendar include color-coding for event categories, public calendar subscriptions for shows and sports, and cards for deliveries and travel reservations. The cards for travel reservations even include links to online check-in services. In addition to the Office apps, you get the Groove Music app, which you can use either to simply play music sitting on your hard drive or in your OneDrive cloud storage or with its paid ($9.99 per month) ad-free, on-demand streaming service. The latter offers a huge library, though it has limitations compared with the Mac's iTunes and Apple Music. Another included app is Movies & TV, which also offers a content store as well as the ability to play your own videos. You still get lots of utility-type apps, too, including a scanner app, alarms, a calculator, a camera, a reader (for viewing PDFs and several other document formats), and a voice recorder. There's even a Phone Companion app that works with iOS and Android mobiles as well as with Windows phones. The impressive Maps app recently has been updated with support for Windows Ink, meaning you can mark up a map using a stylus or your finger on a touch-screen PC. But that's not all: You can calculate the distance of a line you draw on a map and get directions for two points you tap. If you don't have a touch screen, the same functionality is possible with a mouse. You can also use a virtual on-screen ruler to make your lines straight. Of special note is the updated Photos app, which lets you organize your photos into albums, apply fixes like red-eye correction, lighting, and color, and effects like selective focus and Instagram-like filters. The app has recently been updated with a completely new interface that uses slider bars instead of wheels, adds more filters, and gives the ability to draw on photos. Photos even creates automatic galleries for you based on photos taken at a similar time and place, picking the best of similar photos to include. But again, at this point in its evolution, it still slightly trails the macOS counterpart, Photos, which adds face recognition. And an entry-level video-editing app like the old Windows Movie Maker or Apple's iMovie is completely AWOL from Windows 10. Though the reappearance of a video editing is a matter of speculation, we have heard about an old standby, Paint, taking on forward-looking new 3D capabilities. See my preview of Paint 3D, which will launch next spring in the Creators Update. Not only does it let you create, customize, and decorate 3D objects, but you can also share them with the Remix3D.com online community. OneDrive and Skype Two of Microsoft's cloud services—OneDrive for online storage and syncing and for communication—will play an increasingly important role in Windows 10. There's an important distinction between these and Apple's analogous iCloud for macOS: They can be used on any platform. So there are Skype and OneDrive apps for Macs, Androids, and iOS devices, as well as for PCs and Windows phones. While OneDrive does a great job syncing Office documents and personalization settings, and Skype is a very rich communication tool, there's still some work for Microsoft to do in integrating them with Windows 10. For example, when using the Photos app, you can tap the Share icon to send selected images to Mail, Facebook, Twitter, or any other app that accepts sharing of that file type—but not to OneDrive. Skype integration in Windows 10 is also somewhat in flux. In fact, the service's Universal Windows App is still called Skype Preview, which now supports chat bots. Windows has the potential for parity to macOS's Messaging and Facetime apps, but it's not there yet. The Action Center now shows Skype messages, but still not missed calls. You can now directly reply to messages inside the panel just as on the Mac. The Mac solution here is still more seamless, but Windows 10 is getting closer. Also keep in mind that Skype is a full, standalone VoIP solution that can call standard phones, while the Mac is just hooking into the iPhone's mobile connection. And like OneDrive, Skype works on all major platforms, not just one. Gaming Microsoft continues to make the Window 10 proposition sweeter for gamers. The Xbox app for Windows 10 not only lets them see an activity feed, but it also includes game DVR and can even stream games from an Xbox One to the PC. PCMag's game maven Jeff Wilson has taken a good look at Windows 10's Xbox gaming app. While he found that game streaming and the DVR feature worked well, he was less impressed with the game selection—it can't compete with Steam's. He was also disappointed that you can't buy games right from the app, but instead have to switch to the Windows Store app. He also found the interface somewhat cluttered. On the plus side, the Xbox and Windows 10 Stores have been unified, and the Play Anywhere initiative means you can buy games for one platform and play them either on the console or the PC. Game progress stays in sync between platforms. Play Anywhere games have begun to appear, but the list is still quite short: At the moment, only three full-fledged games are Play Anywhere-compatible—Gears of War 4, Forza Horizon 3, and ReCore—but about a dozen more are available in preview form. You can keep up with the list on the Xbox Play Anywhere page. Beyond the Xbox app, Windows 10's 3D video engine is now DirectX 12, which, according to some game developers, could open up a whole new level of realism to games. And Windows 10 was recently enhanced with the ability to turn off VSync and instead enable AMD's Freesync and Nvidia's G-Sync in Universal Windows Platform (UWP) games and apps. The same update also unlocked frame rates for UWP games. Microsoft's own Gears of War: UE game will soon be updated with those features, as will Forza Motorsport 6: Apex (free). You can read more about what Freesync, G-Sync and unlocked frame rates mean for Windows 10 on our sister site, Extreme Tech. All of this adds up to one more reason it's never been a better time to be a PC gamer. If you have doubts about that, you should check out all the first-rate titles in our Best PC Games of 2016 feature. The Creators Update will add built-in game broadcasting capability and will also let users create their own Arena gamer tournaments on Xbox Live. Windows of Opportunity Windows 10 Anniversary Update offers more ways to interact with your desktop PC than any competitor, along with more third-party hardware and software options. Whether it's using your voice with Cortana, gesturing on a touch screen, or writing with a digital pen, Windows is the OS of choices. It's the platform that offers the most choice in form factor, from the smallest tablets to massive gaming PCs and the giant Surface Hub. Its only device-based weakness is the flagging Windows Phone ecosystem, despite impressive new Windows phone models, such as the Alcatel Idol 4S occasionally showing up, and Microsoft's rumored Surface Phone). Windows is a desktop and tablet operating system that's familiar, innovative, and adaptable to the size and capabilities of the hardware on which it's running. For managing to include so much new technology, while remaining intuitive to use, Windows 10 earns a PCMag Editors' Choice for desktop operating systems, an honor it shares with the polished and impressive macOS.

Terrific interface is now brighter, more welcoming. Numerous audio editing and mixing workflow improvements. Rock-solid stable on two test systems. No copy protection, unlike many of its competitors. Excellent value. Cons Some plug-ins still need a UI makeover. Bottom Line Apple Logic Pro X 10.3 is a powerful update to an already-excellent digital audio workstation, and if you own Logic Pro X, it's free. By Jamie Lendino For post-production, film and video game composers, and home-studio musicians alike, Logic Pro X ($199.99) continues to set the bar for pro-level audio editing at a bargain price. The latest upgrade, to version 10.3, contains another round of useful upgrades, and the update is free to existing Pro X owners. The package puts even more pressure on its well-established digital audio workstation, or DAW, competitors, many of which have moved to subscription-based pricing that make them more expensive to buy and maintain over the long term. Unless you need Avid Pro Tools for compatibility with other studios, or simply because you're more familiar with it, Logic Pro remains our favorite mainstream DAW and a clear Editors' Choice. //Compare Similar Products Compare Avid Pro Tools 11   %displayPrice%%seller% Steinberg Cubase 7   %displayPrice%%seller% MOTU Digital Performer 8 (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Cakewalk SONAR X3 Producer   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple GarageBand 10 (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Setup, Installation, and User Interface To get started with Logic Pro X 10.3, you'll need a recent Mac running OS X v10.11 (El Capitan) or later, with at least 4GB RAM and 6GB of free space for the base program. To install everything, including all of the packaged synths, instruments, loops, and effects, you'll need 57GB free. As always, Logic Pro X doesn't require hardware or software copy protection; as long as you're logged into the Apple Store with your account, you can download, install, and run it seamlessly. For this review, I tested Logic Pro X 10.3 on two machines: a 2013 MacBook Air with the Core i7 upgrade, a 256GB SSD, and 8GB RAM running macOS Sierra 10.12.2; and a quad-core i7 2012 Mac Mini with 16GB RAM and a 256GB SSD running OS X El Capitan 10.11.6. I tested Logic Pro X 10.3 with both a Focusrite Scarlett 18i8 audio interface and each Mac's built-in audio, and as expected, I ran into no problems. In fact, I didn't run into any bugs at all; this may be the most stable version of Logic Pro X I've tested in years. View All 10 Photos in Gallery Apple heavily redesigned the interface for the Pro X launch back in 2013; most of the improvements were welcome, but the color scheme wasn't. It took on a much darker tone that works well for video editing in a dark room, but not necessarily for audio editing. Apple has lightened things up a bit this time around. It's still not as silvery-bright as Logic Pro 9 was. More significantly, the UI elements and fonts have received a flatter, macOS Sierra-like makeover, with a simpler, cleaner design that's easier on the eyes. The transport numerals get a thinner, sharper font as well. The UI itself remains almost entirely the same, so there's nothing new to learn; it's just a bit cleaner and more attractive throughout. Despite its immense power, Logic remains a simple program to start using, because the main screen can include everything you need from start to finish—depending on how you populate it, of course. Basic tracks are available in several kinds: audio, for recording live instruments; MIDI, for recording MIDI data from a keyboard, electronic drum set, or other input device; and instrument, which combine the two for use with virtual synthesizers and other plug-in instruments. The main view doesn't see much change in 10.3. The transport is located at the top of the screen and away from any keyboards, mixing surfaces, or other things you may have sitting at the bottom of the monitor and blocking part of the view. The Library contains all available media content; it's on the left and easily collapsible. The top right portion of the screen contains the arrange window, which is where you do most of your composing and editing. Each track in the arrange window has volume and pan controls. Below that is a multi-mode window that can display the mixer, a piano roll, a score editor, or a sample editor. To the left, a track inspector window shows the mixer channel strip for the individual track, plus the track's output bus—be it the master stereo or 5.1 surround bus, or an aux. The right side pops up a number of windows that cover the tempo and time signature of your project, as well as the current MIDI track's event list, which when combined with the piano roll or score editor, makes it simple to edit your tracks. The score editor still isn't quite as capable as Finale, but it certainly does the job for songwriters or orchestral arranging in a pinch. Touch Bar and Track Alternatives Some of the biggest news with the 10.3 update is full-fledged support for the Touch Bar on the newest MacBook Pro lineup introduced in October 2016. It can show a timeline view with appropriate region colors, track controls, Smart Controls on a track-by-track or even plug-in basis (such as compressor or EQ controls, or electric piano distortion). Tap on a knob, and you can slide a fader right or left to change its value, which makes sense given the thinness of the Touch Bar; you wouldn't want to try and actually tweak a knob that small in a circular manner. In addition, the Touch Bar supports hundreds of keyboard shortcuts, including customized sets, and you can use the Touch Bar to perform with small drum pads, piano keyboard scales, or even map MIDI continuous controllers to a slider for third-party plug-ins that use the mod wheel for expression, like Garritan Personal Orchestra or Spectrasonics Omnisphere. The Touch Bar enhancements are admittedly tempting enough to consider upgrading to one of the latest MacBook Pros, and along with Logic Remote on an iPad, could further reduce the need for an expensive hardware transport and mixing controller. Editing and comping tracks gets a boost thanks to a new Track Alternatives feature, which is similar to a Pro Tools Playlist. It does what it says on the tin; it lets you create alternative versions of a track and then audition and switch between edits, takes, or regions. It's in addition to Take Folders, and as such offers more flexibility when comping a lead vocal or a guitar solo. You can also destructively render selections of a region now; say you've found a combination of effects you like, and know you want to keep it; you can print it right away, just for that region, and then get back to work. Recording and Virtual Instruments Apple hasn't changed Logic Pro X's built-in sound set much in 10.3, but with a few exceptions, you could argue it didn't need to. There are over 2,700 instrument and effect patches, including 750 sampled instruments, plus 5,600 downloadable loops. Most of the instruments are contained in a neat Library drawer that pack the instrument plug-in and separate effects already set up, which makes laying down new tracks a cinch. But for our purposes, let's drill down to the actual plug-ins available. EXS24 continues to be the workhorse sampler it has been for over a decade, and provides the core workstation-style sample set, including drum kits and pianos. Logic's venerable E-series plug-ins (such as ES1, ES2, ES P, the EVP88 electric piano and so on) provide plenty of synthesizer and keyboard sounds, although many of these sound a bit thin when stacked against today's top plug-ins. That doesn't matter, because you also get Retro Synth, which provides fat-sounding imitations of subtractive, FM, and wavetable-based based vintage synths, and you can even drag any waveform into the wavetable module; the plug-in will automatically look for pitched information and transform it into a playable virtual instrument. You can stack up to eight voices—and you thought your Roland JUNO-106's Unison mode sounded thick! The star of the show is now Alchemy, a full-blown additive, spectral, and granular synthesizer originally from Camel Audio that Apple added back in the Logic Pro X 10.2 release. I've been meaning to buy a copy of that synth for years to begin with; it used to cost several hundred dollars. Apple redesigned the interface, reworked the filters for a fatter analog-type sound, and added support for importing EXS24 instruments. Finally, a separate vintage keyboard and organ collection includes such niceties as B3-style drawbars, a vastly configurable Leslie simulator, and a suitcase-style electric piano. There are also plenty of guitar and bass amp simulators and effects included as well. I've always been a fan of third-party drum plug-ins like Superior Drummer and EZdrummer, but it's tough to argue with the one built into Logic Pro X. Drummer is an artificially intelligent session player—one of 28, each with different styles, personalities, and drum kits for a distinctive groove. You can adjust the frequency of fills, whether they're using the toms or hi-hats more in a given section, and even the frequency of ghost notes and whether they're rushing the beat (a la Stewart Copeland) or relaxing the groove (a la John Bonham). Drummer can follow other tracks for inspiration; for example, the bass player can set the groove for a performance, and Drummer will take cues from the bass track to figure out where to lock in the kick drum. You don't have to use Drummer for auto-generated grooves, though; if you're like me, you'll want to program your own grooves. And for that, it sounds great. The Producer Kits include excellent-sounding, multi-channel mixes done by legendary engineer Bob Clearmountain—complete with EQ, compression, and additional processing and routing—and you can see all of the settings to learn what he did with the stock Logic plug-ins. Drummer can also do electronic music; you can dial up any number of styles and kits, from house and retro to hip hop and electro pop. The interface changes, when appropriate, to something that models a drum machine or Akai MPC-style unit. That said, many of the acoustic drum kits sound somewhat similar, with low tom tuning, highly compressed cymbals, and deeper sounds; there's little funk, crisp heavy metal, jazz, or Latin sounds on offer, though of course you can get there with some tuning. Third-party plug-in support remains extremely robust, and you can organize your favorite plug-ins into folders. In testing, I had no problems opening up and using major plug-ins I own like Spectrasonics Atmosphere and a series of East West Play-compatible orchestral and world-instrument libraries, and mastering tracks with Izotope Ozone worked exactly as before. Mixing and Effects Apple spent plenty of time catering to its higher-end customers this time around. For starters, the summing engine has been upgraded from 32-bit (already pristine, with tons of headroom) to 64-bit. Most working studios and bedroom producers won't hear a difference. But if you've got super-large projects with tons of tracks and higher-end recording gear and studio monitors, this could matter. The more plug-ins you stack, the more you'll hear a difference. There are now 192 busses available instead of 64, and there's finally a true stereo panning option that lets you adjust the individual left and right levels instead of just attenuating either left or right signal. The main mix console offers large faders, pan and other track controls, and as many inserts and sends as you need—once again, with a flatter, cleaner, macOS-Sierra-style look. There are welcome analog-style VCA faders available. Instrument tracks keep everything neat and tidy, though most sequencers now offer some form of that, in lieu of messy audio + MIDI track combinations. At the top of each channel strip, the built-in console EQ really just pops up the EQ plug-in, which offers eight bands, plus configurable Q settings and customizable low-pass and high-pass filters. It offers enough musicality for rounding out the high-end of an electric bass or tightening up the boom of a loosely tuned kick drum. As before, you can write automation to regions, which makes it much simpler to move around and arrange your project without destroying recorded fader and knob movements. There are Relative and Trim modes for adjusting existing automation data; you can use them to ride a fader and smooth out an edit. Region Gain is similar Clip Gain, one of my favorite features in Pro Tools; it makes it easy to quickly adjust a region that for whatever reason is recorded at a different level, without having to resort to inserting a plug-in or a destructive edit. Fades are generated in real time, rather than stored as separate audio files with your project, which greatly simplifies file management. You can also finally apply fades to multiple regions simultaneously—a single change that can make sound design or track editing much faster. Flex Pitch and Flex Time make quick work of tuning vocals and fixing mistakes in recorded audio tracks. Flex Pitch in particular is a great freebie if you're used to working with an entirely separate app (like Melodyne) or needing to budget for one. I've used it extensively by this point, and with careful edits, I find it to be as transparent as you could possibly want, and I love not having to export and re-import tuned vocals each time. Logic's effects plug-ins come alive in the compressor and reverb department. The compressors in particular shine, with their Platinum (transparent solid state) and Opto (tube-like) modes, which behave differently and provide exactly the kind of warmth and crunch you'd expect from actual vintage hardware. There's a gorgeous scalable (to 5K Retina iMac levels) paneled interface for each of the modes, including a dBx 160 emulation called Classic VCA. In all, there are over 4,500 presets available across the various 80 bundled plug-in effects, plus roughly 1,000 sampled convolution reverb spaces in Space Designer. You can now side-chain a software instrument as well as a compressor. It's tough to imagine a mixing situation these tools can't cover. Unfortunately, the various recent UI updates still haven't made it to some of Logic's other long-running core plug-ins. Pop up an existing effect or even instrument, and you'll see the same old interface you've seen for over a decade—complete with now positively tiny controls (there's a pixel-quadrupled view, although it looks blocky). It's about time Apple went through and refreshed the cluttered UIs for the entire plug-in lineup, now that we're all running 1080p or even Retina-class displays. EXS24 in particular has needed an update for years; while it's optimized for playing hundreds of voices concurrently on a modern Mac running inside Logic Pro X, it could use a big UI refresh, post-Kontakt 5 and MachFive 3 (which, admittedly, cost hundreds of dollars each, whereas EXS24 is free with Logic). The same goes for the surprisingly powerful ES2 and Space Designer. GarageBand, Import/Export, and Logic Remote Over on iOS, in tandem with the Logic Pro X 10.3 update, GarageBand for iOS now shares the same underlying engine as Logic. It supports 32 tracks now, and comes with 12 Logic effects, including a visual EQ and compressor on every channel plus four additional plug-in slots. It even comes with a stripped-down version of Alchemy, including 150 patches. New to both GarageBand and Logic, you can now save a project in Logic in an iCloud/GarageBand –compatible version that sums all the tracks together as a single stereo reference track. Then you can load that on GarageBand for iOS with all tempo, key, meter, and other information intact, add up to 31 additional tracks, and then bring the whole shebang back into Logic with the original Logic tracks expanded and the new GarageBand tracks also added individually. You can also import and export XML for scoring in Final Cut Pro, and export your projects direct to SoundCloud—the days of mixing down to a CD, then figuring out how to duplicate it, encode it to MP3, put it online, etc. are long gone. Logic Pro X 10.3 still opens any project from Logic 5 or later, though I wouldn't make any promises about old third-party plug-in support if you never got around to printing straight audio tracks as backup! If you've got an iPad, the Logic Remote app turns your tablet into a remote control for all of Logic Pro X's major functions. For example, you can record tracks with on-screen keyboards, guitar fretboards, or other smart composition tools pulled directly from GarageBand on the iPad. You can make fader moves and control the transport as well, of course. But what's most interesting is that the iPad becomes the front end for Logic Pro X, if you want it to be. You can control your entire Logic Pro X-based studio from the couch, and not just Logic itself; Plug-In View lets you access third-party AU plug-ins right from the iPad. Still the Logical Choice There are hundreds of other features I simply didn't have the room for, many of which have been with the program for years. With the latest update, Apple keeps Logic Pro at the forefront of the DAW market. Any quibbles we have with the program—and some are to be expected, given the sheer breadth and depth of what Logic Pro offers—pale in comparison to its virtues. And as is more and more the case these days, you don't need a desktop machine for professional work. Add Logic Pro X 10.3, a USB MIDI keyboard, and a pair of headphones to a MacBook Air or MacBook Pro—plus an audio interface like the wonderfully designed (and very Logic-friendly) Apogee Duet, and some microphones if you're recording live instruments—and you've got a portable music studio that was simply impossible on this scale even just a few years ago, let alone using the same software the pros use on a regular basis. The competition is well established and fierce, but much of it costs more. Avid Pro Tools, MOTU Digital Performer, Cakewalk SONAR Producer, and Steinberg Cubase—what used to be considered the other four major established DAWs years ago that are still around today—all remain hundreds of dollars more expensive than Logic, and require either hardware copy protection, subscription or membership fees for support, or some combination of those. Perhaps the most compelling more expensive DAW is Ableton Live, which commands a rabid following for its unique composition and live performance-oriented UI. On the lower end, Logic does see some stronger competition from PreSonus Studio One, the utilitarian-but-bargain-priced Cockos Reaper, and long-standing electronic-dance-music favorites FL Studio and Reason. (Stay tuned for more reviews!) Logic has been around for several decades now, and by this point it's got some serious celebrity cred; most recently, Adele's Hello was recorded in Logic Pro, along with the score of the Academy Award-winning La La Land. Many commercial studios in the US remain committed to Avid's Pro Tools. But it's getting tougher and tougher to justify the costs, given how capable Logic Pro X has become, especially when coupled with high-end Apogee hardware. The need for outboard processing gear (as you'd find with Pro Tools HDX) is basically gone except for the absolute largest of projects. And now Pro Tools has a monthly subscription fee, which it didn't the last time we tested it at PCMag a few years ago. PCMag awards Logic Pro X a rare five-star rating—not because it's perfect, but rather it's an outstanding software product and an amazing value at just $199.99. If you have a Mac and haven't decided on a proper songwriting, recording, or mixing program yet, or if you're aching to upgrade from an earlier version of Logic or even GarageBand (project files from which, incidentally, still open seamlessly in Logic), Logic Pro X 10.3 is a great bet—and our Editors' Choice for digital audio workstations.

I can't tell you what people are actually buying -- that's up to folks like NPD Group, which tracks online and brick-and-mortar sales everywhere, not just at CNET -- but I do know how much traffic our headphone reviews get. With that in mind, here's a look at the most popular headphone reviews on CNET for the month of February 2017.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « IDC Sees Apple Watch Performance in Q4 2016 as a 'Magnificent Success' while Low-end Wearables firm Fitbit wins in Volume | Main | Apple Invents Next-Gen Fabrics that could one Day be used for iDevice Housings and Beyond » March 03, 2017 Apple Invents a Next-Gen iPhone Case that Incorporates a Heat Removal System to keep it Safe and Humming   Yesterday the US Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple that relates to a new accessory device that, in addition to providing a protective cover for the electronic device, it provides a heat removal system to draw heat from one or more heat-generating components in the electronic device. At a first glance, the patent figures appeared to have a similar look as the iPhone 5c case. However in patent FIG. 15 further below you'll clearly see that the third layer and backside of the case is solid without holes. So there's absolutely no connection to the former fruity 5c case design.   Accessory devices are used to provide a protective cover for an electronic device. The accessory device generally covers the enclosure, or housing, and protects the electronic device in the event the electronic device is dropped. The thickness of an accessory device varies with the desired level of protection. For example, some accessory devices include a thickness of several millimeters and offer increased protection.   However, while the increased thickness may provide additional protection, it may also cause some drawbacks such as trapping heat which could cause problems. In some cases, heat could cause an iPhone (or other electronic device) to throttle down to reduce its performance in order to reduce the heat, which may then in turn reduce the overall performance of the iPhone.   Alternatively, or in combination, the accessory device may retain the heat causing a hot spot in the accessory device. As a result, a user contacting the hot spot may experience a burn.   Apple's invention to combat this problem is to reinvent an iPhone's casing by adding a new heat transfer mechanism on the face that accepts the backside of the iPhone.   The heat transfer mechanism may include a heat collector capable of receiving heat generated from the component. The heat transfer mechanism may further include a heat conduit thermally coupled with the heat collector. The heat conduit may provide a pre-defined heat path that limits a transfer of heat to a pre-defined portion of the wall.   In another aspect, a method for forming an accessory device having a shell configured to secure an electronic device and aid in navigating heat away from a heat-generating component in the electronic device is described. The method may include disposing a thermally conductive layer in the shell in a first location that corresponds to a location of the heat-generating component when the electronic device is secured by the shell. The method may further include extending the thermally conductive layer from the first location to a second location different from the first location. The thermally conductive layer may define a path along which heat flows from the first location to the second location. In some embodiments, the second location corresponds to an opening that extends through the shell to allow any of the heat at the opening to dissipate away from the shell.   In some embodiments, in response to heat from the heat-generating component, the thermally conductive feature absorbs the heat from the electronic device by changing from a solid to a liquid.   Apple's patent FIG. 3 noted above illustrates a front view of the accessory device with the iPhone removed to show the new heat navigation features; FIG. 12 noted below illustrates a bottom isometric view of an embodiment of an electronic device having heat navigation features embedded in an enclosure of the electronic device.   Triple Layer Construction   The First Layer: Apple's patent FIG. 15 noted below illustrates an exploded view of an alternative embodiment of an accessory device. The first layer #910 of the new case is formed from a porous material, such as microfiber to allow heat generated from an electronic device (not shown) to pass through the first layer. Also, the first layer may include one or more thermally conductive features #912 (shown as dotted lines), such as a first thermally conductive feature #914 and a second thermally conductive feature #916. The thermally conductive features 912 may be disposed on a rear exterior region 918 of the first layer 910. In some embodiments, the thermally conductive features include a material (or materials) designed to absorb heat.   Further, the thermally conductive features may absorb heat by a phase change. For example, in response to heat generated by one or more heat-generating components in an electronic device, the thermally conductive features may absorb or extract the heat, causing the thermally conductive features to change from a solid state to a liquid (or quasi-liquid) state.   The Second Layer: The accessory device 900 may further include a second layer 920 designed to couple with the first layer 910. The second layer 920 may be formed from a polymeric material, such as plastic, designed to add structural rigidity to the accessory device 900.   The Third Layer: The accessory device 900 may further include a third layer 930 designed to couple with the second layer 920. In some embodiments, the third layer 930 includes a silicone material. In this regard, the third layer 930 may be designed to provide an aesthetic and low-maintenance cover that may easily cleaned and may readily resist microorganisms.   Apple's patent application was filed back in Q3 2015. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time. One of the inventors listed on the patent filing is Apple's Product Design Manager.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Latest: Target returns unsold iPhone SE models ahead of rumoured iPhone SE 2 announcement. by David Price | 03 Mar 17 Share Tweet   Comments When will the new iPhone SE 2 be released in the UK? Welcome to our roundup of the latest iPhone SE 2 release date rumours, in which we collect and analyse the clues, hints and evidence pointing to the date when Apple will launch a follow-up to 2016's iPhone SE, as well as the iPhone SE 2's tech specs, design, new features and UK pricing. This page will be updated whenever new information emerges relating to the launch of an updated iPhone SE in 2017, so check back regularly for the latest iPhone SE 2 rumours. You may also like: Best iPhone SE deals | iPhone buying guide New iPhone SE 2 2017 release date rumours UK: Release date One logical date to expect the iPhone SE launch would be March 2017, given that the original iPhone SE was announced in March 2016 and Apple usually updates its phone lines once a year. But reports suggest we'll have to wait a little longer than that. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has forecast that the iPhone SE 2 won't make an appearance in 2017 at all, on the principle that Apple doesn't want to cannibalise sales of the (higher-margin) iPhone 7. The SE 2, after all, would be a newer alternative at a lower price. Ming-Chi Kuo has a tremendous track record of Apple predictions, but we're not entirely convinced: six months as undisputed flagship ought to give the iPhone 7 more than enough time to rack up some decent sales, and anyone who opts instead for the iPhone SE 2 after that was more likely in any case to buy a first-gen SE or a smaller Android device than an iPhone 7. (And Apple was quite happy to risk cannibalising iPhone 6s sales by launching the original iPhone SE six months later - that strategy appeared to work out okay.) Still, four-inch smartphones appear to be a lower priority for Apple than its larger-screen handsets: there was a 30-month hiatus between the iPhone 5s launch (September 2013) and the SE (March 2016). Maybe Kuo is right. The iPhone SE could even turn out to be a one-off, like the iPhone 5c. Despite the chances of a one off, Macrumors reported in February that we could see a 128GB version of the iPhone SE introduced in March alongside new iPad models. This would make sense given the iPhone 7 saw the 16GB tier cut to make way for 32GB. Coupled with the relatively affordability of the SE, 128GB could prove a sweet spot for those who want a small handset but high capacity iPhone.  Off the back of the initial Macrumours report, the site now reports that US store Target has been instructed to return a large number of unsold iPhone SE models to Apple by March 1. The list of SE models includes unlocked 16- and 64GB models in Gold, Silver, Rose Gold and Space Grey, along with two Sprint variants of the phone.  An anonymous tip to the site claims that her Target store hadn't received any iPhone SE stock since before the iPhone 7 was announced back in September 2016, prompting some to connect the dots that suggest a new iPhone SE is imminent. Of course, there are other reasons that Apple would request unsold iPhone SE models, like poor sales, but the timing seems a little bit too suspicious to us.  See also: iPad Pro 2 rumours Turn to the next page to read all the details of the iPhone SE launch >> >> Read on… Pages 1 2 3 4 Tags: iPhone , Rumour , iPhone 5s , iPhone 5c , iPhone 6 , iPhone 6s Share this article Share Tweet   Comments Comments Advertisement Nintendo Switch review: Portable power and versatile design let down by expensive accessories and… 1995-2015: How technology has changed the world in 20 years The Best Design Podcasts: 6 Entertaining, Insightful Podcasts for Designers iPhone 9 release date & new features: Future iPhone technologies and smartphone developments for… Apple News Apple Reviews Apple How To Macworld Magazine Apple Deals Mac Forums Apple Mac iPhone Reviews iPad Reviews Mac Downloads About Macworld Contact Site Map Information for advertisers Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions Cookies UK Tech Weekly Podcast:Soundcloud/ iTunes Follow Macworld on Twitter Follow Macworld on Facebook © Copyright 2017 IDG UK.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Smartwatches Huawei Watch 2 vs. Apple Watch Series 2 Emily FerronMarch 4th, 2017 20 pictures The second-generation Huawei Watch and the Apple Watch Series 2 have similar specs, but different approachesView gallery - 20 images The Huawei Watch 2 represents a big, sporty departure from its more traditional-looking predecessor. In terms of specs, it compares favorably to the Apple Watch Series 2, though the two makers' approaches are quite different. Let's take a look. Note that for the sake of this comparison, we are considering two variations of the Huawei Watch 2: the Huawei Watch 2 base model and the Huawei Watch 2 Classic, which vary slightly in features and aesthetic. There are also two sizes of Apple Watch (42 mm and 38 mm) which are very similarly equipped. In many cases, there are no differences in the pair of options from each maker. In those instances, we've only included one image to be representative of both. Size Both variants of the Huawei Watch 2 are the same size, which is considerably bulkier than the rectangular, contemporary-looking Apple Watches. Its round face is about 20-percent wider than that of the larger Apple Watch. The Huawei Watch is also considerably thicker – it will stick out about 17-percent further from your wrist. Build (watch face) The base model Huawei Watch 2 has a partially-plastic case with ceramic bezel and Gorilla Glass 3 display covering, while its more traditional-looking counterpart, the Watch 2 Classic, uses stainless steel. The entry-level Apple Watch 2 models are built out of aluminum, with Ion-X glass on the front (similar to Gorilla Glass). For a premium, you can also upgrade to stainless steel or ceramic builds with a sapphire display. Colors (watch face) Color choices for the Huawei Watch 2 depend on the configuration. The Watch 2 Classic is only available in one dark metallic gray color, but the base model is available in orange (4G models only), gray (non 4G models) or black (both 4G and non 4G). The aluminum build on the Apple Watch is available in four different metallic finishes. There are additional neutral and metallic options available if you upgrade to stainless or ceramic. Band All of these watches have removable, interchangeable bands, so if you don't like the manufacturer's choice, you can always swap to something you like better. The Huawei Watch 2 comes with a rubbery-plastic sport strap, while the Watch 2 Classic has a leather strap that's reinforced with a rubber-like material on the inside. With the Apple Watch Series 2, you can choose from a bevy of material and color options. Display size The round display on the Huawei Watch 2 packs in more overall area than the rectangular Apple Watches, despite the larger diagonal measurements of the latter. Display resolution Exact pixel counts vary, but all of these watches end up with a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch. Always-on display option An always-on option is conspicuously absent from the Apple Watch – you'll have to wake the watch to see time and other key notifications. Pressure-sensitive display The Apple Watch has a pressure-sensitive display, so you can navigate differently depending on how hard you tap the screen. This can be helpful when trying to navigate on such a small device. Scrolling navigation Similarly, the Apple Watch also has a rotating "Digital Crown" – you can turn the crown to flip through your apps and content. Again, this adds a comfortable way to navigate through your watch, so you don't need to depend on taps or voice control. Smartwatches from Samsung and LG add similar scrolling features, but Huawei has yet to join the club (though the two physical buttons on the side of the watch face could be helpful). Water resistance The Huawei Watch's IP68 water resistance rating means it's safe from splashes and accidental dunks, but the Apple Watch is fully swim-proof to 50 meters. You can leave it on in the shower and the pool, and even use it as a fitness tracker during swimming workouts. Standalone cellular option Some models of the Huawei Watch 2 are available with 4G cellular connectivity, so you can use your watch completely independently of your phone. That's not an option with the Apple Watch. GPS Both watches are GPS-equipped. Heart rate sensor They also have heart rate sensors for your fitness tracking (or meditative) needs. NFC Both watches have NFC, the technology that enables mobile payments. The Apple Watch works with Apple Pay while the Huawei Watch is Android Pay-compatible. Battery Many factors go into overall smartwatch battery life. It's tough to say which watch has longer life overall without conducting controlled side-by-side tests. iPhone/Android compatibility The Huawei Watch 2 can be paired with both Androids and iPhones. Apple Watches can only be used with iPhones. Software The Huawei Watch 2 runs Android Wear 2.0, which was just released earlier this month. It has a few perks which help it untether from your phone, such as an on-board version of the Google Play Store. The Apple Watch runs watchOS 3. Release The Huawei Watch 2 is expected to hit several markets starting next month. The Apple Watch Series 2 was released last September. Starting price The Apple Watch Series 2 starts at US$369, but if you opt for build upgrades the price can go much higher. Huawei has yet to confirm US pricing of its second-generation smartwatch. If you want some indication of the Huawei Watch 2's cost, the European price tags are €329 for the Watch 2, €379 for its LTE variant and €399 for the Classic. That's about US$345, $400 and $420, respectively, though international prices are very rarely direct conversions based on the exchange rate. Once the Huawei Watch 2 is released, we will post a full-length review. Read up on our hands-on impressions of the Huawei Watch 2 or our review of the Apple Watch. Correction: The original version of this comparison omitted ceramic from the Huawei Watch 2 (standard) build materials. We regret the error.

Open-source. Suitable for government and other security-conscious offices. The only desktop suite available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Can open and convert almost any legacy document or worksheet. Cons Less stable and not as good-looking suites from Microsoft, Google, and Apple. Online collaboration requires manual installation by an IT expert on a corporate or office-based server. Some dialogs and options are cramped or incomprehensible. Bottom Line LibreOffice is free and open-source, opens almost any legacy document, and is the only office suite available on all major desktop platforms. What it lacks is the smooth interface and stability of its paid competitors. By Edward Mendelson There are lots of reasons to choose the free LibreOffice 5 as your office suite, and plenty of reasons to choose something else, too. The best reason for choosing it is that it's the only fully up-to-date open-source office suite, meaning that security-conscious users like governments and financial institutions—who are typically leery about proprietary office apps from Microsoft, Google, or Apple—can use LibreOffice in full confidence that everything it does is publicly visible, and that none of their data is slipping surreptitiously into some remote database in the name of enhanced productivity. This review focuses mainly on version 5.3 of LibreOffice for Windows, but I also tested it on the Mac, as I'll explain. //Compare Similar Products Compare Microsoft Office 2016 (for Windows)   %displayPrice%%seller% Corel WordPerfect Office X8   %displayPrice%%seller% Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Office 2016 (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Office 365 Home   %displayPrice%%seller% Pages (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Keynote (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Numbers (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Office Mobile for Office 365 Subscribers (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% LibreOffice (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Google Drive   %displayPrice%%seller% Keynote (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% IBM Lotus Symphony 3.0   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Excel (for iPad)   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft PowerPoint (for iPad)   %displayPrice%%seller% Free and Flexible Other reasons for choosing LibreOffice include that it's free; that it's available with an identical interface and feature set in Windows, macOS, and Linux; and that it's one of the few suites that can open and convert almost any legacy document that you or your office may have created over the last three decades. Another attraction is that LibreOffice still uses the familiar toolbar-and-icon menu structure that millions of users learned from older versions of Microsoft Office, but which Microsoft abandoned ten years ago for the new Ribbon interface. As for the reasons to choose something else, I'll get to those later. Office Work LibreOffice combines a word-processor called Writer, a spreadsheet called Calc, a presentations app called Impress, a vector-drawing program called Draw, a database called Base, and a math-formula editor called Math. The newly released version 5.3 retains the old-school interface of earlier versions, but with more features added to the optional sidebar panel and standard shortcut keys like Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V for cutting and pasting visible on the menu and enabled by default. View All 10 Photos in Gallery A new Safe Mode lets you start LibreOffice with a new user profile, disable extensions, or reset the whole configuration. All this is designed to help you fix the suite when it starts crashing regularly—a problem that, in my experience, is more common in the macOS version than the Windows version. (I haven't been able to fix this problem in macOS, but it's more of a time-wasting annoyance than a data-losing disaster because it usually happens when I try to open a file.) The Writer word-processor finally provides a dialog that lets you jump to a specific page number, supports preset table styles, adds a line-drawing toolbar, and enhances color-selection tools and coordinated color themes that more closely match the stylish ones in Microsoft Office. The Calc spreadsheet acts more like Excel, with wildcards rather than regular expressions as the default setting in formulas, enhanced pivot-table dialogs, and a function-selection menu that narrows down your choices as you type. The Impress presentations app, never a strong point, gets some moderately stylish new templates and a new template-selection dialog when Impress opens up, but don't expect anything like the elegant design and gee-whiz animations that Microsoft gives you with PowerPoint and Apple with Keynote. LibreOffice's main rivals are Microsoft Office, Google Docs, Sheet, and Slides, the corporate G Suite, and Apple's Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, formerly marketed as a suite under the name iWork. All these rivals exist in online versions accessible through a web browser or mobile apps, and all support real-time remote collaboration. Microsoft and Apple's apps exist in both desktop and mobile versions; Google's are only online. Until now, LibreOffice, in its full version, was available only for the desktop. Now, it's also available in a browser-accessible LibreOffice Online version, complete with collaborative editing, but only if your IT department installs it for you. There's no publicly available LibreOffice Online, as there is for Microsoft's, Apple's, and Google's apps. LibreOffice's developers have made slow but steady progress into making the sidebar panel into an easy-to-use alternative to the menus and toolbars, and I'm impressed with the current version's spacious, clean design. The LibreOffice sidebar looks a lot like the sidebar in Apple Keynote, Numbers, and Pages but Apple gets things right that LibreOffice doesn't. For example, Apple's page-layout sidebar lets you enter custom settings for all four page margins. LibreOffice's sidebar only lets you choose among preset margin settings, and you need to open a separate dialog to set custom margins. Once you've set custom margins, the sidebar shows Custom as one of the available margin settings—but if you click on Custom, you don't get back to the dialog where you change the settings. Instead, you have to go back to the separate margin-setting dialog. Apple and Microsoft get this kind of thing right in their desktop suites, but keep in mind that you have to pay for those suites while LibreOffice is free. Legacy File Formats I mentioned LibreOffice's compatibility with legacy file formats. This is a major feature for anyone who may have to work with files created decades ago in obsolete word processors or spreadsheets, and LibreOffice far outclasses Microsoft, Google and Apple in this arena. Its closest rival is the Windows-only Corel WordPerfect Office suite, which also opens almost any legacy document, but, oddly, can't open documents created by the last, unofficial release of WordPerfect for the Mac, while LibreOffice can. If you work in a school, office, or lab with legacy documents, LibreOffice is an essential tool even if you don't use it for everyday work. Clunky and Crashy As for reasons to choose something other than LibreOffice, these may be decisive for you as they are for me. First of all, despite improvements, it's clunky to look at and crashes more than it should. You can easily change its ugly default font, the open-source Liberation Serif font, but until you do, no one will be impressed by your documents. The most commonly used menus are clear and spacious, especially the ones in the sidebar pane, but the Options menu is cramped and often incomprehensible unless you've been using LibreOffice for years. Next, until someone funds a publicly accessible version of LibreOffice online—and that's not likely to happen—you can't work with LibreOffice remotely in the way you can with Microsoft, Apple, and Google. Another problem is that some features simply don't work—or at least don't work reliably enough to rely on. The Mac version of LibreOffice typically crashes a few seconds after I import any Word document, though the same documents cause no problems when I import them in LibreOffice's Windows version. On both the Mac and Windows versions, I wasted a lot of time trying to use an option to access "remote files" on Google Drive or OneDrive, but every effort to log in to those drives produced an obscure error message saying "The specified device is invalid." I eventually discovered that I had encountered a known bug that's been left unfixed for a year. This isn't how professional-quality software is supposed to work. When I edit documents in Microsoft Word in Window (or via Word in Office on the Mac), I turn on the feature that hides the top and bottom margins of the page, so that when I type a sentence that begins on one page and ends on another, I don't have to look at two inches of blank space where the page break occurs. LibreOffice has nothing like this, offering only a Web View that doesn't show any page formatting at all. This hide-blank-space feature may not matter to you, but once you get accustomed to it, there's no going back. A Good Backup Suite LibreOffice is an impressive achievement that keeps getting better with its frequent incremental releases, and anyone who has legacy documents lurking on a hard disk ought to have a copy. But unless you have security requirements that demand open-source software, or your organization needs apps that work on Linux as well as on Windows and the Mac, you're likely going to prefer to pay for Microsoft Office or use Apple's or Google's apps instead.

Includes background music that automatically fits your movies. Good collection of filter effects. Output can be sent to Premiere Pro. Online video sharing. Cons Lacks storyboard templates. Cannot rotate video. Automatic mode cuts too aggressively. No choice of transitions. Bottom Line Premiere Clip is Adobe's mobile app companion to Premiere Pro, and it offers useful lighting adjustment features and clip joining, trimming, and splitting tools. Still, it lacks templates, a choice of transitions, and video rotation. By Michael Muchmore If you have an iPhone 6s or later Apple smartphone, you should take advantage of its glorious 4K video capture capability. And you definitely want to show people well-presented digital movies rather than random, untrimmed video clips. That's where Adobe Premier Clip comes in, letting you cut and combine footage shot on your iPhone into pleasing presentations. Even though editing video on such a small screen isn't ideal, the app makes spiffing up video clips shot on the phone simple. And it lets you continue editing on the desktop in Premiere Pro, thanks to Creative Cloud. Clip is an easy-to-use, effective app, but Apple's iMovie tops it in a few significant ways. //Compare Similar Products Compare iMovie (for iPad)   %displayPrice%%seller% Instagram (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% Artisto (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% Snapchat (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% Boomerang from Instagram (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple iMovie (for Mac OS X)   %displayPrice%%seller% Adobe Premiere Pro CC   %displayPrice%%seller% Getting Started Clip is a free app, but you do have to sign into an Adobe account—which includes a free option—to use it. It doesn't require Premiere Pro on the desktop. At 91MB, Premiere Clip is a much smaller download than iMovie's more than 600MB. It runs on iOS 8.1 or later, so your device can be pretty out of date and still run the app. I tested the app on my iPhone 6s with 64GB of memory. View All 5 Photos in Gallery Using Premiere Clip The app offers two editing modes: Automatic and Freeform. The former adds a music track timed to your movie and cuts clips down to what the app considers the interesting bits. Freeform is just as it sounds; it gives you complete control over your project. Adobe has removed the Guide mode since the last time I reviewed the app a few years ago. This offered storyboards for common projects, such as interviews, news reports, and fight scenes. The professional Premiere Pro users won't miss this feature, but it makes the app less appealing for consumer users. The Apple iMovie app still offers this kind of guidance, with its Trailers and Themes features. I first added several clips I shot at a community college basketball tournament and chose Automatic. The default music wasn't appropriately energetic, but selecting a more driving soundtrack from the list of canned music was easy. You can also use music from tracks on your iPhone. More disconcerting was how unsparingly the app cut my clips. When I created an automatic movie with iMovie using the same material, the result was more pleasing, with elegant dissolve transitions added. Clip does offer a Pace option, which lengthens clips. And photos get the Ken Burns zoom-and-pan treatment to keep up the viewer's interest. In Automatic mode, you can reorder clips, but you can't trim them to taste. Freeform Editing If you choose Freeform, you obviously get a lot more control, and you can in fact convert Automatic projects to Freeform. In Freeform, not only can you trim each clip's in and out points, but the app lets you adjust exposure, highlights, and shadows. I do prefer iMovie's trimming interface, though, in which you move the clip preview, rather than the trim endpoint. Settings in Freeform mode let you apply fade-in and fade-out to black, as well as crossfades between clips. They also let you apply Looks to your entire movie, including film, retro, and B&W looks. Several of these are really appealing, and most are subtler than Instagram filters. You can also split a clip at the play head, but iMovie makes that even easier. Finally, you can slow down clips, though forget about speeding them up or applying freeze-frame, both of which are options in iMovie. Other important things missing in Clip are the ability to rotate video and a choice of transitions, both of which are offered by—you guessed it—iMovie. Rotation is particularly important for iPhone videos, as it's easy in the heat of the moment to shoot in portrait rather than landscape orientation. And now something for the pro video editor: Storycard. This feature lets movie makers add notes, sketches, location shots, or cue cards. A Storycard is an image in the midst of your video to which you can add a text title or something shot from your iPhone camera. There's not much there to guide you in how to use it, however. Sharing and Output Clip, like so many media-editing apps, includes its very own sharing community. Along with saving your creation to your phone, you can share directly to Dropbox, YouTube, and Twitter (Facebook, Instagram,, and Snapchat are oddly absent here). And back in the Adobe fold you save it to Creative Cloud (which is basically Adobe's version of iCloud Drive or Dropbox), send it to Premiere Pro CC (but not Premiere Elements), or choose Publish and Share. This last option sends the video to Adobe hosting, from which you can share to Facebook, send in email, or copy a link. If you choose Public (the default), other Clip users can find and play your video from within the app. Free accounts get 2GB of online storage, and Creative Cloud subscribers get 20GB. This is actually more helpful than Apple's iMovie Theater sharing option, which only allows playing on Apple devices you yourself are signed into. Of course, you can still post to your social networks from iMovie or save your creation to your phone's storage. Best for Premiere Aficionados The best reason to use the Adobe Premiere Clip app is if you're a Premiere Pro user and occasionally want to save a video idea when you're out and about. It does offer some quick-and-dirty editing tools like trimming and lighting fixes, along with an appealing selection of effect filters. But the average iPhone user is better served by Apple's more capable and more usable iMovie app. Back to top PCMag may earn affiliate commissions from the shopping links included on this page.

If you're sharing a small number of documents with only a few colleagues, the free version of this suite is enough. But for corporate, educational, or any other organized, collective operation, you'll want the paid (starting at $5 per user per month) subscription-based versions that Google offers under the name G Suite. //Compare Similar Products Compare Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Office 365 Home   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Office 2016 (for Windows)   %displayPrice%%seller% LibreOffice 5   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Office 2016 (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Corel WordPerfect Office X8   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple Pages (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple Numbers (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple Keynote (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% G Suite's Competition G Suite has powerful rivals, including various corporate-level versions of Microsoft Office 365; Apple's set of iCloud-accessible apps, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote (which used to be sold as a suite called iWork); and online collaboration services like Zoho. Even when compared with these productivity titans, G Suite has plenty of advantages, and it gets new and improved features every few weeks. It has limits too, however, as I'll explain, so you need to make sure it strikes the right balance for your needs before committing to it. Getting Started With G Suite I set up a G Suite account through a simple wizard that required me to choose a domain name, either one I already owned, or a new domain that I could create by paying a $12 annual registration fee. I created a new domain, PCMagReviewers.com, and then created e-mail accounts at that address for myself and some colleagues. The setup screen let me send out messages to my colleagues' existing addresses notifying them of the new addresses I had created for them. After that, I signed in at google.com using my new e-mail address, and a menu at the upper right of the window let me access all the G Suite apps. View All 10 Photos in Gallery G Suite offers three versions: Basic, Business, and Enterprise. All include the Google apps and calendar, video and voice conferencing, and management features. The Basic service costs $5 per user per month and gives you a total of 30 GB of cloud storage, shared among users. The Business version costs $10 per user per month and offers unlimited storage, plus archiving, auditing and data-retention features for corporate compliance, and electronic discovery for use when gathering legal evidence. Enterprise plans are priced individually and add advanced security, data-retention, and data-analysis features. Note that business subscriptions to Office 365 also start at $5 per user per month. G Suite's management menus are clear and straightforward, but Microsoft's equivalent menus in corporate versions of Office 365 seem to me easier to navigate and visually more elegant. Apple doesn't offer a corporate-level service comparable to G Suite or Office 365, though the $19.95 macOS Server add-on to macOS provides features for sharing files, calendars, contacts, and mail accounts. G Suite Administration I've been using an enterprise version of G Suite for years through a large organization that I work for, but, for this review, I tested G Suite's Basic service to get an idea of what it's like to administer the suite instead of merely using the setup that an administrator created for me. As in corporate-level versions of Office 365 and Zoho Docs, I used a site-creating wizard to build a website for my new domain, and make it accessible either only to users with addresses at PCMagReviewers.com or to anyone on the web. The Google Sites app that creates these sites has all the elegance and simplicity of Google's other apps, making it effortless to build a multipage site in less than an hour. Google Sites is free for anyone to use, but free users can only create sites with a sites.google.com address, while G Suite subscribers use their own domain name as their site address, just as in any other paid web-hosting service. Office Suite Functionality G Suite's versions of Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides offer the same elegant, minimalist-looking templates that you get in the free versions, but G Suite lets you upload your own documents, spreadsheets, or presentations to use as templates for creating new ones. For collaboration and sharing, G Suite offers more options than you get with the free Google apps. For example, you can specify that a document can be shared only with members of your organization, or only members of your organization to whom you've sent a sharing link. As with the free Google office suite, you can specify that changes made to your document by your collaborators appear in color, to indicate that they're suggestions rather than actual edits. These suggestions can be accepted or rejected one by one by clicking on buttons in the comment panel at the right of the window. When you choose G Suite over Office 365 or Apple's apps, you're making a major decision to rely on data and apps that live almost entirely in the cloud, accessible only in a browser or a mobile device. Google doesn't supply desktop apps like the desktop versions of Microsoft Word or Excel or Apple's Pages and Numbers. If you want to edit your documents on a Wi-Fi challenged airplane, you'll need to edit them in Google's Chrome browser via an optional extension. And, before you go offline, you'll need to download every document that you want to edit. I'm not willing to take that kind of trouble every time I risk being somewhere—like a typical Amtrak train—where Wi-Fi may suddenly stop working. Office Suite in the Cloud In contrast with Google's cloud-only apps, Microsoft's and Apple's apps run either on the desktop or in a browser or mobile device, and the desktop apps have the kind of power that no mobile app can offer. Also, Microsoft's OneDrive and Apple's iCloud typically store copies of your documents on your hard disk and also in the cloud, whereas Google stores only links to your documents in the Google Drive folder that you can create on your hard disk. You can download your Google documents to your hard disk but only in formats like Office format or Open Document (LibreOffice) format, not in the Google Docs format itself. I'm not entirely comfortable with the idea that my documents live in the cloud in a format that I can't download on my hard disk, but this may not bother you as much as it does me. Cloud-only apps like Google's always have a reduced feature set compared to desktop equivalents, but the vast majority of documents and worksheets don't need any more features than Google provides. The apps in G Suite have Google's typically elegant interface, and I'm impressed with the way Google takes keyboard accessibility seriously. The toolbars and menus display keyboard shortcuts for almost every feature, so you don't need to strain your wrist mousing around the screen as you mostly need to do with Apple's apps. (Microsoft's online Office also offers plenty of keyboard shortcuts.) Editing and Versioning The Google apps keep track of all editing changes that you make on your document, going back to the time it was first created. You can revert to an older version of your Google Slides presentation or simply use the document-history feature to look back at an old version to find and copy text that you want to paste into the current version. Microsoft and Apple both offer a Track Changes option, but you need to remember to turn it on, and it's much more convenient to have it running by default. Apple's apps let you turn on revision tracking in the desktop version, but the online versions of Apple's apps don't support revision tracking at all, which can be a problem. If you use a browser to open a document that has revision tracking switched on, you won't be able to edit it. Another advantage in Google's apps is the Explore pane, which you can open from the menu or a keyboard shortcut. Like Microsoft's Smart Lookup feature, Explore searches the web for relevant information about your document. Unlike Microsoft's feature, however, Google displays a quotation-mark icon next to each of its search hits. Click on this icon, and the reference material is inserted into your document as a footnote. You'll probably need to format and revise the footnote text, but you'll avoid a lot of complicated steps required to add references in any other app. An Excellent Office Suite G Suite has plenty to offer any organization that needs a collaboration-ready office suite, a website, shared calendars, and mail services. Compared with Office 365, which exists on the desktop and in the cloud, G Suite is cloud-only, and that's either an advantage or a disadvantage, depending on your needs. Cloud-only apps are an advantage if you want to assure that everything produced by your organization is always available. They're a disadvantage if you want the full power of desktop apps, or if you need offline access to your files. I'm impressed with the ease, elegance, speed, and depth of G Suite, and if I still prefer to get my work done in Office 365, that's because I need the full power of desktop apps like Microsoft Word for the work I do. If your organization can manage with the relatively lightweight cloud-only apps in G Suite, and you don't mind keeping your documents in Google Drive, G Suite is a superbly powerful and elegant choice and an Editors' Choice winner for business-class cloud-based office suites.

That’s impressive when you consider the streaming music provider just hit the 30 million member mark a year ago and crossed 40 million paid users in September. In comparison, Apple said last December that it had 20 million Apple Music subscribers. Apple’s Eddy Cue said in February that Apple Music had well over 20 million users but failed to reveal how many. Thank you to our 50 million subscribers. #Spotify50 pic.twitter.com/eXkOV71bwu — Spotify (@Spotify) March 2, 2017 In March 2016, Tidal said it has passed the three million subscriber milestone although data obtained by Norwegian newspaper Dagens Næringsliv claims the actual number of subscribers it reported to record labels was only 850,000. Sprint bought 33 percent of Tidal in January. Spotify said last June that it now has more than 100 million active monthly users but many of those don’t pay for the service and instead use the ad-supported tier. It’s unclear how many total active listeners Spotify has today. Word surfaced just the other day that Spotify is preparing to launch a new subscription tier that’ll afford lossless CD-quality audio. Although the company has yet to announce or confirm the service, several people on social media presented screenshots in which they were propositioned to sign up for Spotify Hi-Fi for anywhere between $5 to $10 extra per month.

But it seems the Wall Street Journal, which ran the report, may not have been totally accurate; there will be USB Type-C, but only on one end of the power cord – the handset itself will retain the Lightning port. That’s the opinion of renowned KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who wrote in a note to investors that all three iPhones set to be launched this year – the flagship 8 and what are likely to be the iPhone 7s/7s Plus – “will support fast charging by the adoption of Type-C Power Delivery technology (while still retaining the Lightning port)." So, it seems what Apple may actually be replacing is the regular USB connector on one end of the power cable with USB Type-C. A setup that would allow owners to plug their new iPhones into the latest MacBook Pros, which sport only Type-C ports, to charge their handsets. Kuo’s prediction sounds much more plausible than Apple removing the Lighting port from the iPhones – and makes more sense. Apple's reversible connector only arrived back in 2012 on the iPhone 5, and the analyst notes it is smaller than USB Type-C, allowing for a slimmer phone design. Moreover, there’s also the Lightning licensing revenue to consider. Apple’s new iPhones are rumored to be unveiled this October, including the 5.8-inch $1000 model, which is expected to be the first to feature an OLED panel - and it will likely be a curved one.

The report mentions that Eddy Cue, Apple’s Senior Vice President in charge of Internet Software and Services, former Beats head Jimmy Iovine and Apple’s content chief Robert Kondrk are all said to be involved with the negotiations. “Robert Kondrk, Eddy Cue, Jimmy Iovine, everyone is trying to be the person,” one insider told the publication. “They each want to be the guy, and they’re telling people, don’t deal with the other one.” “Eddy is talking to some people. Jimmy is talking to others,” noted a second insider. “They just haven’t figured it out.” Another source added that Apple seems to have “a lot of trepidation” about the world of Hollywood entertainment. Cue and Apple’s boss Tim Cook are reportedly on the hunt in La La Land, with visions of studio mogulhood dancing in their heads. Last week, Cue allegedly held talks with Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures, two of the biggest film studios in Hollywood. Apple is currently dippings its toes in original content with Apple Music-exclusives such as “Carpool Karaoke” and “Planet of the Apps”, but sources said that the Cupertino company may be “preparing something big,” potentially looking for a “transformative acquisition” in the entertainment space rather than “just a deal to buy TV shows”. If Apple is looking to acquire big name players in Hollywood, I don’t think Netflix would be the right pick due to its sheer size, market valuation (nearly $60 billion) and unique corporate culture. The Cupertino firm reportedly considered acquiring Time Warner but ultimately failed, leaving the field clear for AT&T’s $80 billion buy. A recent Bloomberg article blamed lack of major takeover deals on Apple’s arrogance and risk aversion, but offered no proof beyond quotes from investment bankers who argued that the Cupertino company should hire investment bankers to make more large acquisitions (so that these bankers could get their fair share of Apple’s cash). The iPhone maker, however, is frequently mentioned as a potential partner for Disney. Notably, Disney CEO Robert Iger has a seat on Apple’s board of directors while Jobs’s widow, Laurene Powell Jobs, has a stake in Disney through a trust established following her husband’s passing. Powell was Disney’s largest single shareholder before recently reducing her ownership stake in the Mouse House by half, according to an SEC disclosure in January 2017. She now owns less than five percent of Disney’s outstanding shares. Apple has for years attempted to persuade content owners to allow it to sell their programming in an à la carte fashion, something Hollywood has long resisted. The company then focused its energies on trying to put together a so-called skinny bundle of the most popular channels, to no avail. “We’re not in the business of trying to create TV shows,” Apple’s Eddy Cue was quoted as saying recently. “We’re not trying to compete with Netflix or compete with Comcast.” “In terms of original content, we’ve put our toe in the water doing some original content for Apple Music, and that will be rolling out throughout the year,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook on a recent conference call. “We’re learning from that and we’ll go from there.” As a slap in Apple’s face, Google’s YouTube announced this week a streaming live TV bundle, called YouTube TV, which offers content from four major networks (Fox, ABC, CBS and NBC) and 39 other local broadcast networks and channels like ESPN, with unlimited DVR, for $35 per month. Google’s new service will be live later this spring.

The 32GB gold iPhone 6 is labelled as a “2017” model, which would technically be correct as Apple never previously released a 32GB version of the iPhone 6, meaning these are new devices being manufactured specifically for specific Asian carriers as entry-level devices. According to the report, the new model is expected to launch on Taiwan Mobile on March 10, and has apparently been quietly available in China for the past few weeks. Notably, this new 2017 iPhone 6 model will only be available through select carriers, not on Apple’s online store or in its retail stores. Taiwan Mobile is currently advertising the devices as part of a special limited-edition promotion as the most inexpensive iPhone the company has ever offered — it’s basically being given away for free with a 30-month contract plan. It’s unclear if it may come to other Taiwanese carriers or remain exclusive to Taiwan Mobile; it’s presently also being sold by one carrier in China. It’s very unlikely that the “new” model will extend beyond China, however.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft takes back market share in the education sector with low-cost 2-in-1s as Macs and iPads fade 0 by Michael Allison  @Mkeallison Mar 3, 2017 at 17:00 GMT4 days ago Despite the initial popularity of MacBooks and iPads as educational tools and Apple’s long history in the educational segment, there are some indications that Apple’s devices are no longer the preferred tool for educators. A study done by FutureSource found that – especially in the US – iOS and MacOS devices are in decline as the primary tools of educators. The major factors? The price and keyboards.While iPads have their value in helping educate younger students in kindergarten and the lower classes, as students progress, there is often a need for the older students to be able to turn in typed work like essays and creative pieces which are best done using an old fashioned keyboard and mouse interface. However, for the price of one decently specced Macbook, administrators can often pick up several cheap laptops and Chromebooks with little hassle and hand them out to students for little cost. In the case of Chromebooks and Office 365 equipped PCs, students can even save their work online and be able to login to other PCs and pick up where they left up easily. The New York times reports that one school administrator noted that he could purchase three Chromebooks for the price of one Laptop, making it a no-brainer to purchase those devices in lieu of Apple’s efforts. While Chromebooks have strong support in USA, this is mainly due to a specific online testing environment which does not exist in other markets. Apple CEO Tim Cook famously called Chromebooks “test machines”, referring to schools’ need for cheap devices for mass computerised testing purposes rather than actual education. While Chromebooks dominated education in USA, the story is dramatically different in the rest of the world, which is about half of the total mobile education market. FutureSource reports that outside of the US market, Microsoft remains a dominant market leader with a strong position in both developed and emerging markets. Microsoft is gaining share against Android, especially in large scale emerging market deals. Around 13.6 million mobile education devices (desktops excluded) shipped to the rest of the world in 2017, with this number expected to reach 15.8 million in 2017. 12.6 million unit devices shipped in USA in 2016. Even worldwide Chromebooks are a growing presence, growing from 2% in 2014 to 6% in 2016, and even topping the markets in Sweden in 2016. Microsoft has been sharpening its offerings, with services such as Intune for the classroom,  ‘Microsoft Classroom’, ‘School Data sSync’ and supporting low-cost laptops for school, such as the Acer Tracelmate Spin b1 and Lenovo N24 convertible. Some devices will hit price points as low as $189, neutering a significant advantage Chromebooks offer. FutureSource notes that 2-in-1 devices are the platform of the future, with Microsoft offering a wide range of 2-in-1 products designed specifically for education. “PC provider’s laser focus on the education sector is good news for schools and students. 2017 will see wide ranges of computing devices, designed specifically for education and at competitive price points, entering the market and vying to be the device of choice for learning,” noted Mike Fisher, Associate Director of Education at Futuresource Consulting.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) Apple stops buying cobalt from Congo as child labor persists Fri Mar 3rd, 2017 9:08am Business You must sign in or register to continue reading content. By Todd C. Frankel / The Washington Post Apple said it has temporarily stopped buying cobalt mined by hand in Congo after a recent investigation by British broadcaster Sky News, which found continuing problems with child labor and harsh work conditions. The change comes several months after Apple said it planned to keep buying so-called “artisanal” cobalt from Congo while it worked to address the problems. Cobalt is essential for the lithium-ion batteries found in laptops and smartphones, such as the iPhone. Sixty percent of the world’s cobalt supply comes from Congo. A Washington Post investigation last year detailed abuses in Congo’s artisanal cobalt supply chain, showing how miners — including children — labored in hazardous, even deadly, conditions. Amnesty International and other human rights groups also have alleged problems. The Post connected this troubling trade to Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Company, a Chinese firm that is the largest buyer of artisanal cobalt in Congo and whose minerals are used in Apple products. Apple responded by pledging to clean up its cobalt supply chain, but the tech giant said it wanted to avoid hurting the Congolese miners by cutting them off. That plan appears to have changed. In a response to Sky’s revelations that the problems identified earlier were still prevalent, Apple said it has stopped buying cobalt from artisanal mines. “We have been working with Huayou on a program that will verify individual artisanal mines, according to our standards,” Apple said in a statement, “and these mines will re-enter our supply chain when we are confident that the appropriate protections are in place.” Apple has said it intends to begin this year scrutinizing its cobalt suppliers like it does its “conflict mineral” suppliers — the tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold from Congo that companies are required by securities law to attempt to certify does not come from militia-controlled mines. Apple said it plans to publish a list of the cobalt smelters, just as it does for its conflict mineral smelters. Sky News reported that children continued to be employed in the cobalt mining that feeds into Apple’s supply chain. The report was centered on the former Katanga province of Congo, where Huayou Cobalt operates, although the Sky News report does not specify the locations. A Huayou Cobalt spokesman told The Post that it was investigating the allegations made in Sky News story and had asked the broadcaster for more details.   Most Read Julie Muhlstein Everett native sailing solo around the world Andy Stephens was a young Coast Guard veteran, college student and sailboat… Mar 6th, 2017 by Julie Muhlstein Snohomish County in dispute with landowner over condemned property LYNNWOOD — A dispute over a road-widening project has left a property… Mar 6th, 2017 by Noah Haglund Bothell’s new high school is modeled on the best in the world BOTHELL — Eric McDowell is a high school principal without students.

We explain all you need to know about the iPhone SE, and look to the future: When is the iPhone SE 2 coming out? The 4in iPhone SE is rumoured to be updated in 2017, possibly adding 128GB of storage to the small smartphone. By Marie Brewis | 03 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments The iPhone SE went on sale on 31 March 2016, and since the iPhone 7's launch it has been the only 4in iPhone you can buy new direct from Apple. We explain all you need to know about the iPhone SE, and look to the future: When is the iPhone SE 2 coming out? Also see: iPhone SE review iPhone SE UK release date: When is the new iPhone SE coming out? iPhone SE UK release date: 31 March 2016 iPhone SE 2 UK release date: March 2017 (TBC) The iPhone SE costs £379 with 16GB of storage (up £20 since its launch), or £429 with 64GB of storage, and is available in Silver, Gold, Space Grey and Rose Gold. That's cheap for an iPhone, admittedly, but still pretty pricey when you consider that an iPhone SE costs only $160 to make. Many people have speculated that Apple will announce the successor to the iPhone SE, the iPhone SE 2, approximately one year after its launch in March 2017, as is the case with its flagship iPhone updates. Until now, it seemed the iPhone SE would follow in the footsteps of the iPhone 5C as a potential one-off, with trusted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities stating that no new iPhone SE will arrive in 2017 (via Pocket-Lint). According to Kuo, this is because the launch of a new iPhone SE will impact iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus sales, which are already down. However, a new report from Mac Otakara says that a source claims there will be an update to the original phone. Whether it gets any upgrades beyond the rumoured increase to 128GB storage is unknown, but the report also states that we'll see new iPads at an Apple launch in March. Following the report from Mac Otakara, MacRumours claims that US retailer Target has been ordered to return a number of unsold iPhone SE models to Apple by 1 March 2017, only weeks before the rumoured announcement of the second-generation iPhone SE. The list of phones includes six 16- and 64GB SE models in Gold, Silver, Rose Gold and Space Grey, along with two Sprint models.  Of course, there are other reasons as to why Target is returning the stock - bad sales, for example - but it seems, to both us and Macrumours, that the timing is a little too coincidental. While we assume a 128GB iPhone SE 2 will make an appearance at the rumoured March event, we've only got a few weeks left until we know for sure.  See also: iPad Air 3 release date, price and specs rumours. Best places to buy iPhone SE in the UK: Where to buy iPhone SE You can buy the iPhone SE direct from Apple now. It’s available in Silver, Gold, Space Grey and Rose Gold. The 16GB option is £379 while the larger 64GB option is £429. If you buy direct from Apple, the phone will come unlocked so you can use it on any UK network. EE says all handsets bought from EE direct channels will support EE’s WiFi Calling service and 4G Calling (VoLTE), and you can order it here. Vodafone says customers who opt for the iPhone SE on Vodafone’s ultrafast 4G network can also enjoy Vodafone’s Data Test Drive for the first two months of their contract, meaning they can get to grips with their new iPhone SE without any limitations on their UK data usage. Furthermore, Vodafone’s Wi-Fi Calling service will be available on the iPhone SE, making it possible to stay connected anywhere there is Wi-Fi – from a basement flat to the London Underground. Order here. O2 is offering the iPhone SE on multiple contract plans here. Three is offering the iPhone SE on several pay monthly plans, including a massive 30GB per month. View all the plans here. It also points out that those who buy the iPhone SE from them will benefit from its Feel At Home policy (no roaming charges in selected countries), 4G at no extra cost, and a six-month free Deezer subscription. Carphone Warehouse allows you to order here, while you can do the same at Mobiles.co.uk here. You can also buy official accessories for the iPhone SE including leather cases in black and midnight blue (£29 inc VAT), and Lightning Docks in colour-matched metallic finishes for £39 inc VAT, both from Apple’s retail stores and Apple.com/uk. iPhone SE new features and specification: What's new in the iPhone SE? The iPhone SE looks very much like an iPhone 5s with the familia 4in Retina (326ppi) display, but with a new rose gold option, matt chamfered edges and a stainless steel Apple logo. On the inside, though, it's very much a smaller iPhone 6s and, according to Apple, it's the most powerful 4in phone ever. With the same 64-bit Apple A9 processor and M9 motion co-processor as the iPhone 6s, the iPhone SE is twice as fast as the iPhone 5s on raw performance, and three times as fast for graphics. And that's not all that's fast. With the addition of 802.11ac Wi-Fi the iPhone SE can support download speeds up to 433Mbps. It also supports faster 150Mbps LTE with more bands, plus Wi-Fi calling.  There have also been some improvements to battery life, with the iPhone SE beating the iPhone 5s' runtime for audio (50 hours vs 40 hours), video (13 hours vs 10 hours), Wi-Fi- and LTE browsing (13 hours vs 10 hours), and 3G talk time (14 hours vs 10 hours). With a new NFC chip inside and the Touch ID fingerprint scanner the iPhone SE also supports Apple Pay for making mobile payments. Read more about how you can take advantage of this in our Apple Pay guide. In common with its bigger brother, the SE features a 12Mp iSight camera with Focus Pixels and a True Tone flash. There's a new image signal processor and support for 4K video recording and panoramic images up to 63Mp, plus Apple's Live Photo feature. The photo below will give you some idea of what the iPhone SE's camera is capable of. At the front the iPhone SE has a Facetime HD camera with a new Retina Flash, that lights up the screen three times brighter for taking the ultimate selfie. The iPhone SE runs the new iOS 9.3 operating system. iPhone SE performance benchmarks: How fast is the iPhone SE? We should make it clear that we have not yet benchmarked the iPhone SE. However, it has the same hardware as the iPhone 6s, and according to Apple should perform the same (therefore we assume the iPhone SE must have 2GB of RAM like the 6s, although Apple has not confirmed this). Below are our benchmark results from our iPhone 6s review. The iPhone 6s scored 2511 in single-core mode and 4404 in multi-core mode in Geekbench, putting it just behind the processing power of the Galaxy S6, which scored 4438 points. It beat the HTC One M9 by a whopping 626 points, scoring 3778 points, which would normally be an acceptable score. However, it’s in the graphics department that the iPhone 6s really flexes its muscles. We ran two GFXBench tests – T-Rex and Manhattan, the same tests that our colleagues use when testing Android devices, and compared the results. Samsung’s Galaxy S6 managed a respectable 30fps in T-Rex and 14fps in Manhattan, while the iPhone 6s scored a whopping 59fps in T-Rex and 56fps in Manhattan. iPhone SE full specifications: What’s inside the iPhone SE?

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Apple pushing two-factor authentication for iOS 10.3 users 03 Mar 2017 0 2-factor Authentication, iOS Post navigation Previous: Researcher uses Google’s speech tools to skewer Google reCAPTCHA Next: Secrets of the Filecode ransomware revealed by Maria Varmazis 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Beta users of Apple iOS 10.3 are reporting that they’re receiving push notifications from Apple to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for their Apple IDs, which is used on Apple devices (like iPads, iPhones and Macs) to synchronize and share iCloud user data. Apple’s 2FA provides an extra layer of security for iCloud data as well as for devices registered to an Apple ID, and it seems with iOS 10.3 that Apple is taking stronger measures to encourage its users to enable this feature. Two-factor authentication isn’t new on iDevices, as it has been available for well over a year since iOS9 and OS X El Capitan – notably, the feature became available first for iCloud after a spate of celebrity iCloud hacking incidents, and then more broadly to secure Apple devices soon after. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Until iOS 10.3 leaves beta, you may not get the notification from Apple to enable 2FA, but the good news is that as long as your device fits the system requirements, you don’t need to wait for Apple’s friendly reminders. Here’s how you can enable 2FA on your iPhone right now (if you are running iOS 9 or later): Tap the “Settings” app Scroll down and tap “iCloud” (assuming you are logged in with your Apple iCloud ID already) Tap your Apple ID, which will appear at the top of the screen On the next screen, tap “Password & Security” In the middle of the screen, you will see “Two-Factor Authentication,” likely already set to “Off.” Tap “Turn on Two-Factor Authentication” and follow the prompts to set up 2FA for your device. You may be asked to verify your identity by answering security questions and confirming the credit card details you have on file tied to your Apple ID. Note: If you do not have a passcode set up on your mobile device, you will be prompted to create one before you can enable 2FA.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Sponsor Book → RSS → Review: 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display  March 3, 2017 ⌘ Permalink My years of a Mac user can be broken into three main eras: The Early Days: A string of PowerBooks and MacBook Pros with work and personal data on them. The Great Divide: An iMac at home and a laptop at work.1 Giving Up: Using a work laptop for everything again with a Mac mini as a home server. I’ve been lucky that every job I’ve had after leaving the Apple Store in 2008 has provided me with a Mac notebook to use as I see fit. This was the case in 2014 when Myke and I started Relay FM. I had a work-issued MacBook Air that I used for work and personal stuff, but I soon felt weird about using this computer to work on my new company, so I picked up a MacBook Pro with Retina display. This is the computer I was using for everything until October of last year. We’ve had a Mac mini with a bunch of attached storage on the network for years, but all of my work was taking place on this notebook. For the first year or so of independent life, I was working from home most of the time, but recorded shows at my brother’s office. My MacBook Pro would go with me, and dock with an external display, keyboard and mouse at each location. This setup was less than ideal, and when we moved last summer, I was lucky enough to have studio space at home for the first time. Suddenly, my portable machine found itself docked for weeks at a time. As it was a 15-inch model, when I did have to take it somewhere, I quickly became annoyed at the size and weight. So I bought my first iMac in years. Buying Refurbished I picked up a refurbished Late 2015 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display with the following specs: 3.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 processor 16 GB RAM 1 TB SSD AMD Radeon R9 M395 graphics card with 2 GB video RAM Retina 5K 5120-by-2880 P3 (wide color) display If I had ordered this configuration from Apple, it would have cost $3,099. Refurbished, it set me back $2,719. This isn’t my first refurbished Mac. While the options aren’t always great (I really wanted an i7), it’s a nice way to save a chunk of change. After AppleCare and tax, I still spent less than just the machine would have cost otherwise. The discounts vary over time, but the fact that Apple warranties these machines as new sets me at ease. This iMac — like the other refurbished computers I’ve purchased — was indistinguishable from a new one when it arrived. You aren’t going to be stuck scraping off someone else’s stickers if you go this route. (Yes, that is an iMac base made of a Time Capsule and first-generation Apple TV.) Upgrades & Performance I spend a lot of time in professional applications like Logic Pro X2 and Final Cut Pro X, so I knew I would want to max out the RAM when I got the iMac. For some reason I cannot comprehend or accept, the 21.5-inch iMac does not come with upgradeable RAM. Mercifully, the 27-inch model still does, so I picked up another 16 GB of RAM from MacSales. Installation was straightforward; you don’t need to be an ex-Genius to follow Apple’s directions. Despite getting a model with an i5, this machine has taken everything I’ve thrown at in stride. Of course, much of this has to do with the SSD. Unlike a Fusion Drive, it’s always fast, and while the 1TB option was crazy expensive, I haven’t regretted the choice. In short, everything is buttery smooth on this iMac all the time. That All in One Life At this writing, my iMac is the most up-to-date model. As such, it has a bunch of I/O that future models may not: 3.5 mm headphone jack SDXC card slot Four USB 3 ports Two Thunderbolt 2 ports Gigabit Ethernet In addition to Ethernet, I usually have at least one Thunderbolt port in use, as well as all most of the USB ports. I wouldn’t mind more USB ports, actually. I have USB 3 hub mounted under my desk for a few additional peripherals that I never unplug, like my Time Machine drive. Keeping one USB port empty on the iMac makes swapping things around a lot faster. After spending years hooking a notebook up to an external display, I had gotten use to a certain amount of cable clutter. MagSafe, Thunderbolt and USB cables were flopping all over the place. The beauty of the iMac’s iconic design is that all of that mess can be hidden from view. Even as a professional users with several discrete audio devices on my desk, I’m able to keep everything nice and tidy. One thing that has surprised me is how quiet the machine is. Only sustained renders in something like Final Cut ever really make the fans kick up but unless I’m working in perfect silence, I can’t hear them. Likewise, the built-in, downward-firing speakers are surprisingly good. Sure, they lack the punch that external speakers can bring, but for my use as a heavy headphone user, they are perfectly fine. Oh, and this 5K Retina display? Holy moly, it is good. There are downsides to the all in one life, of course. If this iMac ever needs repair, I can’t really do much about it myself. If the guts ever die, I won’t be able to use it as an external display, and I can’t upgrade things any more than I already have. If only Apple made a tower for pro Mac users with easy component access and lots of flexibility… Unseen Benefits I bought this iMac for a bigger reason then wanting a change from my 15-inch MacBook Pro. With the studio, my desk is no longer in the house. I’m not hogging the spare bedroom anymore, and the separation has been good. It’s clear to everyone when I am “at work.” When it’s time to “come home,” I can sleep the iMac, turn off the lights and lock the door behind me. The MacBook Pro I have now can be used for work, but I’ve become so spoiled by the 27-inch display, I really just use it for writing unless I’m traveling. For all intents and purposes, work happens at my desk, on the iMac. That clarity has been good for my kids, my marriage and myself. I’m working far fewer nights than I used to, and when I need to hunker down and get something out the door, I can do so in my own space, without getting in the way. The Future I expect my generation of iMac will be replaced very soon with Kaby Lake-packing, Thunderbolt 3-toting machines, but honestly, I’m fine with it. I don’t have to use any dongles with this machine, and it has so much horsepower, I really think I can get 3-4 years of useful work done with it. When the time does come to replace it, I bet I do so with another iMac. I’m a fan. This interview falls into this era. ↩ I’ve edited several shows over the last few weeks in Adobe Audition and am probably switching, but that’s a story for a different time. ↩ Post navigation ← Previous Post Next Post → New 512 T-shirt!

COURTESY BLOOMBERG Print Comment Tweet Posted: Friday, March 3, 2017 9:28 am By Jeff Green and Emily Chasan Bloomberg News Banking Despite diversity gains, white men still rule R.I. banking social welfare BCBSRI, CVS, Hasbro earn perfect scores on Corporate Equality Index (Dec. 5, 2016) C-Suite Awards Fostering whole life wellness (April 28, 2016) NEW YORK - Slowly but steadily, investors continue to let corporate boards know that "male, pale and stale" doesn’t cut it anymore. The small but growing number of shareholder votes on diversity proposals is on pace to match or exceed the record set last year, according to data compiled by ISS Analytics, which tracks proxies. Apple and Tyson Foods investors already rejected such proposals, and another eight are in the queue. The $309.7 billion California Public Employees’ Retirement System, has made diversity proposals a priority in its proxy voting, aiming to break companies "out of the group think of male, pale and stale," said investment director Anne Simpson. "As evidence grows on this and fund managers focus on building diversity even in their own organizations, I think we’re going to see support on this moving up." In each of the last five years, more than 20 board diversity proposals have been brought to U.S. companies, encouraging some to change their policies and avoid a public referendum. IBM and CVS have already done so this year -- explicitly stating they will consider gender and racial diversity in their board appointments. CVS confirmed the changes. IBM declined to comment. <a href="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/click/zone?zid=1&pid=0&lookup=true&position=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> <img src="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/view/banner/image/zone?zid=1&pid=0&position=1" height="60" width="468" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Click Here!"> </a> A vote doesn’t predict success -- in fact, the opposite. Of the nine proposals that came to a vote last year at companies including Apple Inc., LinkedIn Corp. and Skechers U.S.A. Inc., the only one to pass was at FleetCor Technologies Inc. On average, the proposals earned about 25 percent support, according to ISS. Engagement vs. confrontation BlackRock Advisors Inc. and Vanguard Group Inc., the two biggest funds by assets under management, rarely vote for shareholder proposals on diversity topics. Both firms say they prefer to engage privately with companies. "The vote is but one mechanism we have to message the companies,” said Glenn Booraem, Vanguard’s head of corporate governance. "Our direct engagement with companies has the benefit of being far more nuanced than voting for or against a proposal." Blackrock spokesman Ed Sweeney noted the company’s commitment to various initiatives to raise the number of women in governance and executive leadership. "When we speak with company management and independent directors, we emphasize diversity and inclusion as key components of corporate culture and strategy," he said. Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc. and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., on the other hand, vote for diversity proposals far more often. Morgan Stanley had no comment other than to refer to it’s proxy voting policy that says it considers such proposal on a case-by-base basis. "We tend to support most of these proposals on the rare occasions when we are voting on them," Donna Anderson, vice president and global corporate governance analyst for T.Rowe Price, said in an interview. "We think the business case is pretty strong that bodies with diverse views, including boards, tend to make better decisions than non-diverse groups." Moving the needle At the current pace of gains, women aren’t forecast to hold 50 percent of board seats until 2055. The number of people of color appointed as directors fell in 2016 and the overall rate of minorities serving on boards has been mostly unchanged over the last decade, according to executive recruiter Spencer Stuart. As of now, 13 percent of companies currently give specific details about the race and gender of directors named in their annual filings, said Belen Gomez, senior director of research at Equilar Inc., which tracks diversity disclosure. “The needle is moving, but it’s moving slowly. I do think things are going to ramp up.” NorthStar, based in Boston, filed six proposals this year asking companies to adopt language that they would seek greater board diversity. All six agreed to add specific wording, and the fund withdrew the proposals, said Mari Schwartzer, assistant director of shareholder activism, engagement and social research at the fund. “Companies think that they already have initiatives in place to ensure diversity,” said Ivy Jack, director of equity research at NorthStar Asset Management, which brought the proposals to International Business Machines Corp. and CVS Health Corp. “We look at it and say, ‘even if you have already been doing it, maybe you need to do it differently, or you’re not doing it enough, because your board still does not represent your customers, or just the general population of the country.’" Keywords diversity, Rhode Island, Providence, Woonsocket, CVS Print Comment Tweet Comments No comments on this story | Please log in to comment by clicking here Please log in or register to add your comment Related Stories Banking Despite diversity gains, white men still rule R.I. banking social welfare BCBSRI, CVS, Hasbro earn perfect scores on Corporate Equality Index (Dec. 5, 2016) C-Suite Awards Fostering whole life wellness (April 28, 2016) Popular Most Read 1.

Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies TV Politics Business MWC 2017     Analyst Says 2017 IPhone Models To Get Lightning And USB-C Fast Charge Posted: Mar 3 2017, 5:55am CST | by Shane McGlaun, in Rumors | Apple     Apple won't ditch the Lightning connector according to analyst Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI Securities has issued a research note to investors that indicates something interesting is expected for all three of the iPhone models expected to launch this year. According to Kuo, all three of the smartphones expected in 2017 will maintain the Apple Lightning connector but all three will also get the ability to use USB-C ports for power delivery. Don't Miss: MWC 2017 Highlights Those USB-C ports will allow faster charging and Kuo says that one challenge for Apple lies in being sure that the smartphones are safe and stable during data transmission. Kuo wrote in the research note: "New 2H17 models may all support fast charging. We believe all three new iPhones launching in 2H17 will support fast charging by the adoption of Type-C Power Delivery technology (while still retaining the Lightning port). A key technical challenge lies with ensuring product safety and stable data transmission during a fast charge. In order to achieve that goal, we think Apple will adopt TI's power management and Cypress's Power Delivery chip solutions for the new iPhone models. We note the OLED version may have a faster charging speed thanks to a 2-cell L shaped battery pack design." Kuo thinks that the USB-C high-speed data transfer is still a niche application for the iPhones. The analyst also thinks that Apple will maintain the Lightning connector to keep licensing income from the MFi program for accessories that use Lightning connectivity.

Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies TV Politics Business MWC 2017     IPhone SE Refresh Not Expected In First Half Of 2017 Posted: Mar 3 2017, 6:17am CST | by Shane McGlaun, in Rumors | Apple     Sales decline predicted during the first half of 2017 Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI Securities has published a research note recently that talks about the iPhone SE smartphone. According to Kuo, Apple won't refresh the iPhone SE in the first half of 2017. This is due to Apple wanting to maintain higher margins on high-end iPhone models according to Kuo. Don't Miss: Win a Free Nintendo NES Classic in our Giveaway The note also expects that total shipments of iPhones will decline in the first half of 2017 due to slow demand in China, reduced shipments off 4.7-inch iPhone's and the lacks of a refresh or the iPhone SE in the second quarter of 2017. Kuo expects that Apple will put pressure on its suppliers to cut prices for components to allow it to maintain margins on iPhone models. Price reductions aren't expected to kick in until November or December of 2017. Kuo does note that he doesn't expect all suppliers to cut prices on iPhone components. Suppliers like Samsung making the chips for the iPhone have a better position to bargain with Apple over costs, Kuo thinks that Samsung might even raise prices. Kuo expects shipments of iPhone models in Q2 2017 to be in the 35 to 40 million units range. While Kuo isn't expecting an update for the iPhone SE in the first half of 2017, that isn't stopping rumors about an imminent refresh from swirling. One source of those rumors is a report that has surfaced claiming that retailer Target has returned iPhone SE stock ahead of the March Appel event that is rumored. Target returned iPhone SE unlocked 16GB and 64GB models in gold, silver, rose gold, and space gray colors. A pair of Sprint models were also returned. The return of the devices could have been linked to poor sales of the models, but the returns come right on the heels of the rumored March Apple event leading some to speculate Target might know of a new model coming.

Until March 14, Apple is offering consumers the opportunity to snap up a new device and pay for it over the course of 12 months without spending a penny in interest. The catch? There isn’t one! Well, apart from the fact that you have to spend at least £399 to qualify – but that won’t be a problem in the Apple Store. What does it cost per month? This 0% finance offer covers almost every one of Apple’s products, except most of the Apple Watch 2 models. Getting a new iPhone 7 costs as little as £58.25 per month for the 128GB version that usually retails at £699. Meanwhile, the top-of-the-range iPhone 7 Plus (256GB) is £76.58 per month. For an iPad Pro 12.9-inch that possesses 128GB of storage, it costs £819 usually, but under the 0% finance offer it comes in at £68.25 a month. To get your hands on one of the newest MacBook Pro models, be prepared to spend considerably more. The basic 13-inch laptop that costs £1,449 is £120.75 per month. However, the cheapest one doesn’t come with Apple’s latest feature: the Touch Bar. To get that you need to get the next model up, which is priced at £1,745 and is a big £145.74 per month for the year. To take advantage of the offer, selecting "Financing" at the checkout and go through the required steps. If you pass the credit check then you're away. Whilst the 0% offer doesn’t actually save you any money, it’s far nicer to spread the cost over a 12-month period. Frankly, taking a £1,000+ hit from Apple never felt better.

Originally released in 2014, Apple has launched a new 32GB configuration for the device. It is technically new because the iPhone 6 originally debuted in 16/64/128GB configurations and has never gotten a 32GB SKU. The 32GB iPhone 6 will be launching with select Asian carriers as the low-end model and will not be available through Apple retail. It will be available on Taiwan Mobile on March 10 and has quietly available in China since late February. Apple will not be selling the 32GB iPhone 6, which is only available in gold, on its website or in Apple retail stores. It will continue to sell the iPhone SE as the low-end model which has better internals but lacks a larger display. While Apple has been quiet about the situation, Taiwan Mobile is advertising it as a ‘new’ special edition model. The carrier says that this is the cheapest iPhone yet and is already accepting pre-orders. They will be selling the device for ‘free’ with a NT$1,399/month contract plan (which equates to around $45 US). Tags: iPhone 6 About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology. He conceits himself by religiously rocking the Apple brand. You can find him on Twitter @iPeterCao.

This time around, Sinfiled took the time to edit a longer birds-eye overview of Apple Park, which opens in April. Sinfield’s video arrives a week following Roberts’ aerial clip of Apple’s massive new office building. Running four minutes and six seconds long, filmed using DJI’s Inspire 1 Pro drone and put together using dynamic editing techniques, the video shows off the stunning progress made on the main 280,000 sq ft ring-shaped building which is set to accommodate over 13,000 employees, as well as a new research and development building and many other impressive details. The video gives us a closer look at the solar panels, which are still being installed on the main building’s roof. We can also see the nearly completed solar panel installations on the rooftops of vehicle garages. The entire building will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy. 75 percent of total power requirements will be delivered via a micro-grid installation capable of producing 17 megawatts of power from solar alone, with Bloom Energy-provided fuel cells similar to those installed at the North Carolina data center providing the rest of the power needed to operate the facilities. Enjoy Sinfield’s March 2017 Apple Park update in the video below. Apple continues to plant trees, including drought-resistant trees in the center of the main building. Landscaping work at the maintenance facility is now visible, too. At the moment, the most polished facility is the secure research and development building.

The 30-second spots, narrated by Beats 1 radio host Julie Adenuga, were aired during The BRIT Awards for pop music in the United Kingdom on February 22. The ads are in line with a report that said Apple is shifting its focus towards regional marketing campaigns. Apple Music has over 20 million subscribers, which still trails market leader Spotify, which yesterday revealed it has 50 million paying subscribers. Apple Music launched around the world in June 2015.

Read the latest rumours about the 2017 iPhone specs, price and UK launch date, celebrating 10 years of the iPhone. 10 years of iPhone mean one thing: the iPhone 8 should be the best iPhone update yet By Chris Martin | 03 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments The iPhone 7 has only been on sale for a while, but all we seem to be hearing are rumours about the iPhone 8. We think Apple might well be holding back some major updates and improvements for the iPhone 8, which - if the rumours are true - will be launched on the 10th anniverary of the first iPhone. Here we round up the rumours about the iPhone 8 release date, price, features and specifications. See also: Best phones 2016. Hang on a minute, shouldn't the next iPhone be the iPhone 7s? It still could be. Leaks and more rumours are pointing to not one but three new iPhones, two of which may well be branded as iPhone 7s and 7s Plus models. The main launch, though, would be the flagship, 10th anniversary iPhone '8'. We'd be surprised if Apple goes for that naming convention, however, and other rumours say it  could even be called simply 'The iPhone', or iPhone Pro, but for now we'll stick to calling it the iPhone 8 for simplicity. Update 3 March: A new report from analysts at TrendForce - and another from AppleInsider - says that the iPhone 8 won't have two heavily rumoured features: wireless charging and a screen with curved edges. Based on information from the iPhone supply chain, TrendForce said, "Apple will not implement the curved display design for the high-end iPhone because there are issues with the 3D glass in terms of production yield and drop test results. Thus, the next high-end iPhone is expected to have the same 2.5D glass for display cover as the current models.". On wireless charging, AppleInsider obtained information from Cowen and Company which reckons that the long-range wireless charging system which Apple is working on won't feature in the iPhone 8. What's more likely - as  detailed below - is that the phone will use a similar system to current phones that support Qi wireless charging. This means you'll have to put the phone on a charger, just as with the Apple Watch. The third new piece of news is that KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo refutes other reports saying Apple will use USB-C instead of Lightning on the iPhone 8 in order to introduce fast charging. Via TechTimes, he says that Apple will make a few power-management tweaks to enable the battery to be charged faster when using a Lightning cable. Here's a summary of what to expect from the iPhone 8: iOS 11 software 5.8in edge-to-edge screen with no bezels and no physical home button 3D front-facing camera could replace Touch ID Long-range wireless charging - may not come until 2018 Apple A11 processor 64- or 256GB with 3GB RAM Latest Intel LTE modem Possible change in case material to glass or ceramic - or just glass back That's the main specs covered, but here are the other rumours: The main logic board will be in two pieces instead of the traditional one Apple may move the SIM tray to the bottom edge (this could be to allow room for other internal components or to include a Smart Connector) Quick charging will be supported when using a cable New speaker design could make the phone the thinnest ever It will use an OLED screen from Samsung - read more. Facial recognition in addition to fingerprint scanner Laser sensor for gesture recognition - read more. The latest video from ConceptsiPhone does a decent job of showing what the iPhone 8 might look like. It's interesting to see an idea of how the bottom of the display might be used, similar to the Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro. Find the best Apple deals. When is the iPhone 8 UK release date? iPhone 8 UK release date: September 2017 (TBC) Although still months away, we can fairly confidently predict the iPhone 8 release date. Assuming the annual September announcement tradition continues, the iPhone 8 release date will be in September 2017. However, 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone launch, so we wouldn't be too surprised if Apple mixed things up a bit (it launched the SE - pictured below - in March). According to Tech Trader Daily (via MacRumours), Apple might be putting the iPhone 8 into production in June, sooner than expected. However, that doesn't necessarily mean the launch will be earlier than September given the potentially radical design change. It's not necessarily going to be called the iPhone 8, of course, but that's the name we're using to keep things simple. What will the 2017 be called? It seems the name may have been confirmed with an Apple employee referring to the new device by the name 'iPhone 8' unprompted when speaking to Business Insider. However, there is another suggestion as Apple Insider claims that Apple could call this year's iPhone the iPhone X. As we've mentioned, the iPhone for 2017 is slightly harder to predict because it will mark a big anniversary for the smartphone. The latest rumours are that Apple will release three new iPhone models as part of the main lineup. This could well be the 'S' versions of the 7 and 7 Plus, and the extra 'iPhone 8', an even more premium flagship with 'revolutionary' features. The Wall Street Journal says: "Apple plans bigger design changes for 2017, the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone. Those changes could include an edge-to-edge organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen and eliminating the home button by building the fingerprint sensor into the display, according to people familiar with the matter. "At a meeting with an Apple executive, one of the company’s China-based engineers asked why this year’s model [the iPhone 7] lacked a major design change in keeping with Apple’s usual two-year cycle. The answer, one person at the meeting recalled, was that the new technology in the pipeline will take time to implement. People familiar with the matter said some features that Apple hopes to integrate into iPhones, such as curved screens, weren’t ready for this year’s models," it added. If Apple follows the usual pattern, the iPhone 7 that launched this year will be followed by the iPhone 7S in 2017. The fact that it's 10 years since the original iPhone means this could all go out the window. Apple will want to do something special to celebrate the occasion so an 'S' model, which usually just brings small tweaks, won't suffice. It's pretty much anyone's guess at the moment, hence, we're calling the 2017 model the iPhone 8 at the moment but it's perfectly plausible that the new phone won't conform to the traditional naming system at all. The iPhone SE (special edition) is already a thing, so perhaps Apple will go with 'iPhone Pro', iPhone Anniversary Edition' or even just 'iPhone' - although naming the iPad 3 as 'the new iPad' didn't go down too well. A report from Nikkei suggested that in 2017 there would be three new iPhone models. It sounded as though we were in for the usual 4.7- and 5.5in models (the regular and Plus), plus a third new 'Pro' model with a 5.5in or above curved screen. Its source said the screen would be "bent on the two sides" making it sound like a Galaxy Note 7 rival. Of course, this didn't happen with the iPhone 7, though it doesn't mean we won't see a curved-screen iPhone 8. Vote in our poll to let us know what you think Apple will name the anniversary iPhone. How much will the iPhone 8 cost in the UK? We're speculating for now, of course, as the iPhone 7 has only recently gone on sale. Whether Apple will introduce a price increase for the potentially special iPhone 8 is anyone's guess. However, the iPhone 7 price jumped up to £599 in the UK thanks to Brexit and we hope that it will stay the same with next year's anniversary model. However, in light of the latest leaks, the 'anniversary' model seems to be an ultra-premium device that could cost more than any iPhone yet. At least one report claims it will be more than $1000 in the US.  Although one analyst predicts the iPhone 8 will be the best selling model ever - with up to 150m sales - another is worried that following the anniversary edition, Apple will see a possible 10 year slump afterwards. It is believed that moving to OLED for the iPhone 8 will push up costs as much as $50m for Apple, eating into the firm's profit margin. Whether the firm takes the hit and keeps the price of the phone the same or not remains to be seen. What are the rumoured new features? If Apple does indeed do something special for the iPhone's 10th anniversary, which is ever more likely from all the leaks, the iPhone 8 will be one which fans will no doubt want to upgrade to on launch day. Could we see the biggest queues ever? A combination of design and hardware changes will make the iPhone 8 the most radical new iPhone to date, if we are to go by the rumours and leaks. OLED screen: Will the iPhone 8 feature a next-gen display? It seems certain that the iPhone 8 will have an OLED screen - like the Samsung Galaxy S7 - rather than the traditional IPS tech Apple has used previously.  A recent KGI report says that it will be a 5.8in screen which will fit into a chassis a similar size to the current 4.7in iPhone and that the phone will have a significantly higher capacity battery. Here's a diagram from the report which illustrates how the iPhone 8 will slot into the range: As you can see, the screen will have two parts. A 5.15in 'main' screen with a resolution of 2,436 x 1,125 pixels and a separate 'function area' across the bottom. This is likely to be where the integrated fingerprint scanner will live, and it may operate like the Touch Bar on the latest MacBook Pro laptops. Whatever turns out to be the case, the screens are coming from Samsung. The Korean Herald reported that a source confirmed the order from Samsung and that - like the screen on the Galaxy S7 Edge - it will be made from plastic and not glass. Typically glass is only used for flat screens, so this is not too surprising. And  now according to GSMarena, the deal between Apple and Samsung for the screens is now finalised. The iPhone 8 won't be the first to have a bezel-less screen. Xiaomi has already launched the Mi Mix, reviewed. It's a stunning device and the first of a new category of phones with it's 91.3 percent screen-to-body ratio, according to the firm. A Facebook post by Robert Scoble - a well-known tech strategist - reveals new details about the next iPhone. In the lengthy post Scoble claims to have been told that it will be "a clear piece of glass... which will put holograms on top of the real world like Microsoft HoloLens does". He also says the phone will have an OLED screen and that Apple has 600 engineers working on a next-generation 3D sensor and that the phone will have eye sensors. These will bring "a new kind of interface". He also says that you'll "pop it into a headset which has eye sensors on it, which enables the next iPhone to have a higher apparent frame rate and polygon count than a PC with a Nvidia 1080 card in it." Plus, he says that new sources revealed we can "expect battery and antennas to be hidden around the edges of the screen, which explains how Apple will fit in some of the pieces even while most of the chips that make up a phone are in a pack/strip at the bottom of the phone." These sound like ridiculous predictions, especially the part about the phone being transparent - battery tech is not yet good enough to make one small enough to "hide" - but if true, the iPhone 8 will be a revolution rather than the evolution we've seen with the iPhone 7 this year. We'll continue to update this article as new information appears, but here's how things stand right now. This concept image via ConceptsiPhone shows what an edge-to-edge OLED display iPhone might look like: Glass frame: Will the iPhone 8 feature Gorilla Glass? Jony Ive has wanted to introduce an iPhone which resembles a single sheet of glass for a long time and the 2017 anniversary iPhone could be the one. It's rumoured that at least one iPhone in 2017 will use a glass body, according to Apple supplier Catcher Technology. Glass on the front and back would make it like a hugely updated version of the iPhone 4S. This, combined with the rumour that the iPhone 8 will sport an edge-to-edge OLED screen makes things rather interesting. Allen Horng, chairman and chief executive of Catcher Technology, a key supplier said: "As far as I know, only one [iPhone] model will adopt glass casing next year. I don't think this move will have an impact on Catcher's revenue as glass casing still needs a durable metal frame which requires advanced processing technology and would not be cheaper than the current model." However, don't get your hopes up. Although Foxconn - the manufacturer of iPhones in China - has been experimenting with building a glass chassis for around a year, it is likely too early to put it into mass production. Current tooling is all for aluminium chassis and that's where the expertise and investment is. A switch to glass - or ceramic or some other material - would be such a massive change that there would be far more leaks backing up these rumours. Put simply, we don't believe that the iPhone 8 will be an all-glass machine. Touch ID: Will the iPhone 8 have a home button integrated to the screen? What's much more likely is that the home button will be 'virtual' in the iPhone 8.  This makes sense, and is surely one of the features of the 'function area' in the diagram earlier. But will Apple ditch Touch ID? Previous rumours say no but another new Apple patent for an "Acoustic Imaging System Architecture" suggest otherwise. It's impossible to know what Apple will do, since there are so many patents. One Apple patent shows that the new iPhone's Touch ID fingerprint sensor, which is usually situated beneath the Home button, could be built-in to the entire display, eliminating the need for a Home button and making room for a larger display without enlarging the overall size of the smartphone. These rumours seemed pretty far fetched to begin with, but it might just happen. Sonavation recently announced that it has found a way to insert ultrasonic biometric sensors underneath a Gorilla Glass display, still being able to read a user's fingerprints. The newly developed tech is "well suited for through-the-glass fingerprinting and specifically architected to deliver advanced security  and ease-of-integration into mobile and IoT devices” Sonavation’s CTO Rainer Schmitt said. The company claims that it can even do one better than the existing Touch ID (and most other fingerprint scanners on the market) by being able to scan fingerprints on a finger that's wet, dirty or oily. Though it's not clear which devices will be the first to feature this new technology, but we assume it'd either be the iPhone or a flagship Android smartphone. Another patent has been awarded to Apple for a button which places the fingerprint sensing technology underneath the screen. Named a 'capacitive fingerprint sensor including an electrostatic lens', it means the Touch ID fingerprint sensor can work through various layers of the display.  Yet another patent, via Apple Insider, deals with the light sensor - the one which adjusts the screen brightness automatically. It's called 'Electronic Devices With Display-Integrated Light Sensors' and explains that having a light sensor can result in an increase in the size and weight of the device so "it would therefore be desirable to be able to provide improved electronic devices with light sensors and displays." Face-recognition: Will the iPhone 8 feature a 3D camera? However, Macrumours says that a JP Morgan analyst claims there will be no fingerprint recognition at all, and that Apple will instead embed a front-facing 3D laser scanner that will be able to accurately recognise your face. This will avoid the problem where Touch ID doesn't work if you have wet fingers - or the sensor has water on it. He says it will also be more secure, which could lead to more companies - including banks - supporting Apple Pay. This theory is backed up by Kuo of KGI Securities whose latest report, via 9to5Mac, says Apple will put an enhanced front camera and an IR sensor in order to build up a 3D model of the user's face. The report also says that Apple's 3D algorithms are "years ahead" of Android, and such a feature could be an iPhone exclusive for a couple of years before Android phone makers catch up. As pointed out by Patently Apple, yet more patents suggest a curved-glass design and also that the sides of the phone could be used for virtual buttons. For example, this could be used for certain controls when the camera app is in use. If true, the phone would rival Samsung's edge screen features. There were also some rumours we heard about the iPhone 7's screen that never made it to fruition. It's possible that they could see daylight with the iPhone 8. Economic Daily News speculated that the iPhone 7 could feature a 3D display, and one that doesn't require the use of those annoying 3D glasses. The website claimed at the time that Apple supply chain partner TPK is working on a project that could produce a glasses-free 3D display, though we're not holding out much hope for this as its been done before (remember the LG Optimus 3D?) and has never done well. There were also some rumours to suggest that the iPhone 7 could have a sidewall display, similar to that found on the Galaxy S7 edge and Note 7. This came from an Apple patent that was published in 2015. The patent hints at a future iPhone with a display that extends onto the sides of the device, providing interactive or touch sensitive portions that give access to slide-to-unlock functionality, music player controls, messaging readout, called ID, system controls and more. One of Apple's partners, Japan Display, is working in flexible an foldable screens similar to Samsung and LG. Whether this will end up in the iPhone 8 remains to be seen - it's unlikely but still interesting. Apple has plenty of patents describing bendable and folding devices, according to TechnoBuffalo. More details on the screen tech include that Apple is supposedly working on a new generation of 3D Touch. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the firm will make it from a thin film in order to introduce enhanced sensitivity - via AppleInsider.

I wish Apple would make a full-size Magic Keyboard, but that doesn’t seem to be happening any time soon. Thankfully Matias, a computer accessory manufacturer that’s been around since the 90s, is offering its own take on what an Apple-made full-sized wireless keyboard could be like. The end result — the $99 Matias Wireless Aluminum Keyboard — is an impressive rendition of Apple design principles, coupled with a few bonus features that truly make this keyboard worth considering. Have a look at our full video walkthrough for a hands-on look at the Space Gray version of Matias’ Wireless Aluminum Keyboard. The best wireless keyboard for the Mac? Four keyboard color options The Matias Wireless Aluminum Keyboard is available in four colors — Silver, Space Gray, Gold, or Rose Gold — that allows it to complement any color of MacBook or MacBook Pro. The Space Gray and Gold versions feature black key caps, while the Silver and Rose Gold colors feature white key caps. Needless to say, I think that Matias did a great job of nailing the Space Gray version that I’m currently testing, as it matches the 2016 MacBook Pro about as well as one could reasonably expect. I’m assuming that the other three colors are just as good, but I’ve not yet compared them in person. Video walkthrough Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube now Build quality & performance The surface of the keyboard is machined out of aluminum, while the bottom area of the keyboard is plastic. If you’ve used any of Apple’s standalone keyboards recently, then you’ll have a general idea of what to expect here. The keys themselves, while not underpinned by the much-improved butterfly switches that are found on the latest MacBook Pro, feature significantly more key travel, and are relatively stable no matter where you press on a key. I found that I could type fast on this keyboard, and didn’t experience any out of the ordinary key input issues. The keys on the keyboard are not backlit, but Matias is producing two versions with backlighting that are currently available for pre-order (shipping in June). The Backlit Wireless Aluminum Keyboard will come in two colors, and feature a separate battery dedicated to the backlight. The four rubber feet on the bottom of the keyboard do a good job of keeping the keyboard stable on the desk while typing. However, you won’t find any legs on the bottom to adjust the typing angle. Depending on the way you type, this could pose an issue with adjusting to the keyboard’s angle. It’s been a while since I’ve used Apple’s full wired keyboard with number keys, but if memory serves me correctly, the build quality between it and this keyboard is similar. The Apple-built keyboard may be slightly superior in overall build quality, as I did notice a little bit of play on the edges of the Matias hardware when pressed, but no one’s going to do that in real world usage, and that’s probably being overly critical. 1-year battery life The most impressive thing about this keyboard is its battery life. Matias includes a 1,600mAh battery, which it claims is 5x to 12x larger than competing hardware. The result is a keyboard that can be used for a year on a single charge. Included in the box is a USB charging cable, which features a full-size USB-A port on one end, and a right-angle micro USB plug on the opposite end. As much as I hate micro USB, I don’t mind it as much considering that I’ll only need to charge the keyboard once a year. The micro USB port for charging is located on the front of the keyboard, along with the unit’s power button. Charging that keyboard takes around 5 hours, and the Caps Lock key light shines amber while charging. Although there is a power button on the same front panel as the USB port, you’ll rarely need to use it. Once the keyboard is on and paired with your devices, you can leave it that way. Because the keyboard features such a large battery, it stays on and stays connected, which means that there should be no delays on the hardware side of things when you sit down for work. Number pad & full-size arrow keys To anyone who enjoys using full-size keyboards, I don’t have to explain why it’s such a good thing. I don’t have to explain the satisfaction of typing on a full number pad, or having full-size arrow keys to help you navigate. When it comes to a keyboard, having more keys is almost always a better thing in my opinion. But what makes this keyboard special is that it does two things that Apple has quarantined to two separate products. If you want a full-size keyboard in Apple’s world, then you have to live with having a wired connection. But if you want wireless, you have to ditch the number pad, and the rest of the amenities that come with a larger keyboard. With Matias’ offering, you get the best of both worlds. You get a truly wireless keyboard with a long-lasting battery, and you get a number pad, extra function keys, large arrow keys, etc. You aren’t forced to sacrifice one thing for another. Pair up to four devices You’ll notice four curious-looking keys above the number pad on the right-side of the keyboard. These keys are dedicated to paired-devices, and you can pair up to four devices at once with the keyboard. Thus, these dedicated keys make switching between an iPad and MacBook, for instance, a painless affair. You can literally press a single button to switch effortlessly between multiple devices, and it works just as advertised. Matias’ keyboard plays nice with macOS, iOS, Android, and Windows machines. Conclusion The Matias Wireless Aluminum Keyboard is probably the keyboard that Apple should be making. It’s a full-size keyboard with Bluetooth wireless connectivity, which is something that Apple doesn’t offer. If you’re in the market for a good-looking wireless keyboard that features Mac-centric keyboard shortcuts, yet can be easily paired and switched between other devices, then give it a look. You can find the Matias Wireless Keyboard for $95 from B&H Photo Video, but if you prefer to use Amazon, you can also find it there in all four colors.

With reports that Apple is now focusing on an autonomous driving system, is Apple still manufacturing an iCar, and when will the iCar be launched? We look at all the evidence. Latest: Apple pens letter to US transport regulators. by Lewis Painter | 03 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents Evidence that Apple is working on an iCar Evidence that Apple isn't working on an iCar When will the Apple iCar launch? Driverless or electric? What will the Apple iCar look like? Patents Leaked images Pricing Since February 2015, there have been various reports that Apple is working on a car that will "give Tesla a run for its money" after Business Insider spoke to an Apple employee with knowledge of the subject. This, coupled with sightings of cars registered to Apple, clad with sensors/cameras (which were later debunked), got everyone talking about the prospects of an Apple Car, or iCar. The iCar project is codenamed 'Titan', according to The Wall Street Journal, which originally stated there were "several hundred" Apple employees working on the project. With some reports describing an electric car and others describing a self-driving car, is there any truth to the claim or is it like the Apple TV set everyone was talking about a couple of years ago? Well… Updated with news of a letter penned by Apple to US transport regulators about self-driving cars, and speculation that the project has been given a target of 2017 to "prove feasibility". Evidence that Apple is working on an iCar Here is where we list some of the most prominent rumours suggesting Apple is making an iCar.  Also read: Apple rumours and predictions for 2016. Apple pens letter to US transport regulators about self-driving car rules While many had believed that Apple was stepping away from the autonomous car project, a recent letter penned to US transport regulators by Apple's director of product integrity Steve Kenner may suggest otherwise. Apple has apparently said that it was "excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation" and that there were "significant societal benefits of automated vehicles" to be realised.  An Apple spokesman has confirmed that the letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was prompted by its "heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems" and that it wanted to help define best practises in the industry going forward.  The letter urges regulators to not introduce too many rules regarding the testing of self-driving cars, claiming that "established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally". Kenner also suggests that companies should share data from crashes and near-misses to build a more comprehensive picture than would be possible by one company alone, helping to improve the systems.  Of course, with Apple being so focused on user privacy, it'd be out of character not to mention it in the letter. Kenner notes that an individual's privacy should not be compromised by the sharing of data, and that regulators "address privacy challenges associated with the collection, use, and sharing of automated vehicle data".  Apple CEO Tim Cook hints at motoring focus during Q4 2016 results During Apple's Q4 2016 financial results, Apple CEO Tim Cook answered a flurry of questions regarding Apple Pay, Siri and most importantly, the Apple Car. While the CEO neither confirmed or denied the existence of Apple's rumoured electric car, he said that Apple "always looks for ways that we can improve the experience and the customers' experience on different sets of products".  “And we are always looking at new things, and the car space in general is an area that it's clear that there is a lot of technologies that will either become available or will be able to revolutionise the car experience.” he continued. "And so it's interesting from that point of view, but nothing to, certainly nothing to announce today." As usual, Cook is speaking in riddles, but if you read between the lines, it does hint that Apple may have something to announce somewhere down the line.  Apple hires BlackBerry engineers for autonomous car OS project in Canada Bloomberg reports that Apple and its Project Titan team - focusing on an autonomous car OS following the closure of the Apple Car project - have hired a number of former BlackBerry engineers as part of a new Canadian office in Kanata, a suburb of Ottawa. "Many of the engineers working in Canada were hired over the past year and about two dozen came from BlackBerry's QNX, a leading automotive software provider," writes the outlet, citing "people familiar with the matter". Among Apple's hires from QNX is Dan Dodge, the firm's CEO. QNX staff were targeted by Apple because of the company's experience "developing fundamental components of operating systems and power management", an ex-QNX employee told Bloomberg. Apple 'in talks to buy McLaren' According to a report from the Financial Times (paywalled) citing three sources with knowledge of the project, Apple is apparently in talks to buy luxury supercar maker McLaren with the aim of improving its iCar project. What the Financial Times isn't clear about is whether this is a major investment or an outright purchase of the company, stating: "The California technology group, which has been working on a self-driving electric vehicle for more than two years, is considering a full takeover of McLaren or a strategic investment, according to three people briefed on the negotiations who said talks started several months ago." While this may seem strange on the surface, there is logic behind the rumoured buyout. The successor to the hugely popular McLaren P1 is indeed rumoured to be electric, and as well as this, McLaren's Applied Technologies Group supplies electronics to a range of companies, to those within Formula One to NASCAR, and has apparently done an extensive amount of work on data center optimisation, ideal for Apple's self-driving electric car efforts.  Apple 'rethinking strategy on self-driving cars', lays off a number of staff According to a report from the New York Times, Apple is said to be rethinking its self-driving car strategy as other tech giants like Google and even Uber appear ready to start road testing their competing efforts. According to three people briefed on Apple’s move (that aren’t allowed to speak about it publically, of course), the company has laid off dozens of employees working on the project, signalling issues with Apple’s ambitious car project. It’s not the first time that Apple’s car project has been in trouble, as the company had to draft in Bob Mansfield, Apple veteran, in July 2016 to oversee the project and drive it forward as no real progress had been made. Apple is said to have told affected employees that the layoffs were a part of a “reboot” of the project, and of course, Apple has refused to officially make a comment. Autocar report According to a report by Autocar, Apple is planning on aggressively selling the new iCar at a rate of half a million cars per year. This projection is ten times the sales by Tesla - a figure hard to envisage. In the report, Apple is set to change the way the car industry is heading, with radical design changes. It is also rumoured that Apple will have an iCar by 2021 with a fully autonomous car planned to launch by around 2026. Of course, these are all speculations and rumours, so take the report and speculations with a pinch of salt. Supply chain rumours In August 2016, Neil Cybart, the founder of Above Avalon, an analyst firm which concentrates on Apple, mentioned on Twitter the new developments of Apple's supply chain. It is stated that Apple has recently signed an NDA (non-disclosure agreement) with a major South Korean battery developer for cylindrical lithium-ion batteries. This is a strong indication that Apple is looking into electric cars and potentially driverless cars. We will be sure to update this article if we learn of any developments in Apple's supply chain. New roles working at Apple According to the WSJ, Apple has appointed Bob Mansfield (previously Senior Vice President of Technologies at Apple) to work and oversee the Electric Vehicle Team at the company. He previously was set to retire in June 2012, but has been involved in numerous special projects at the company. This further solidifies claims that Apple is committed to releasing their very own iCar, Apple Car or Titan project. It has also been reported by appleinsider that the project is delayed until 2021, a year after its inital rollout. As with all things, take this date prediction with a pinch of salt. Money spent on R&D It has emerged that Apple has spent $10bn in research and development costs, which is more than triple of what it spent just four years ago ($3bn). This massive increase in R&D costs, does suggest that Apple is developing something a lot bigger than simply a new iPhone, iPad or Mac device. Apple's future competitors In a recent interview with the BBC, Ford boss Mark Fields claims that the future rivals of the company may not be the likes of BMW and Audi, but instead tech companies like Google and Apple. Fields went on to explain that Ford's working assumption is that Apple is indeed building a car, and that the assumption provides Ford with "the right motivation to make sure we stay very focused not only on the product but overall on the experience that the customer has interacting with the product and the services that we have." This is following the opening of a new Ford-owned technology business in Palo Alto where employees will be working on autonomous cars that can drive automatically, as well as working with IoT companies to see how people interact with their vehicles. If nothing else, it's an interesting look at what big companies like Ford expect to see on the road within the next five to ten years regardless of Apple's efforts. Apple CEO Tim Cook comments on Apple Car rumours  It takes a lot for the CEO of a company to openly discuss rumours surrounding their own upcoming products, especially when it's the CEO of a secretive company like Apple. However, as unlikely as it seems, Tim Cook has recently teased the media about the possibility of an Apple Car in the future. While he didn't directly comment on the likelihood of an Apple Car, during a recent interview with Fortune, Cook said: "we don’t have to spend large amounts to explore". Apparently, Apple becomes "committed" to a project once the company begins spending huge amounts of money on tools, company acquisitions and other processes (as rumours suggest the company has), although hiring experts don't seem to count. "We explore things with teams of people. And that’s a part of being curious," Cook said. It wasn't the last that Cook had to say about the iCar, either. Only days after speaking to Fortune, Cook teased attendees at an Apple shareholders meeting about future possibilities. "Do you remember when you were a kid, and Christmas Eve... it was so exciting," Cook reportedly said. "You weren't sure what was going to be downstairs. Well, it's going to be Christmas Eve for a while." We'll obviously be waiting some time for an Apple-branded car, but the latest comments from the Apple CEO will definitely add fuel to the fire. 'Engine noises' heard late at night at Apple Car campus If Apple isn't developing a car, this rumour will be pretty hard to explain: AppleInsider has reported that someone who lives near Apple's mysterious campus in Sunnyvale, Calfornia (believed to be where Apple is developing its car) complained about "motor noises" coming from the facility at night.  "[Do] there have to [be] motor noises at 11:00 p.m. at night like last night? Even with the windows closed I could still hear it," the resident reportedly remarked.  However, the resident may be mistaken - construction sounds sound similar to the revving of an engine, especially at a distance. Last year, Sunnyvale issued permits to Apple allowing the company to build a "windowless repair garage" at one of the buildings Apple operates at, so it's possible that is what was heard - although why the construction would take place at night is a mystery.  It's also worth noting that if Apple is building a prototype car at the facility, the noises could be the sound of the lathes and mills required to shape the metal, a notoriously noisy process. Ford exec welcomes Apple to automotive industry The Apple Car is shrouded in mystery, with the only real information we have (if that's what you can call it) is in the form of leaks and rumours, but that hasn't stopped people from forming opinions - in fact, even car company executives are chiming in on the rumours. During an interview with TrustedReviews at CES 2016, Don Butler, Executive Director of Ford Connected Vehicles said that Ford welcomes the competition from Apple and that he thinks that techie companies including Apple and Google "can do it". “We welcome others joining. We welcome the activity that’s in the space. We think it’s exciting. It’s actually changed that we are embracing,” said Butler when discussing the automotive industry. “So I think Apple can do it. I think Google can do it.” While it's far from confirmation that Apple is creating the iCar, it goes to show that if/when Apple does enter the automotive industry, it's presence will be welcomed by the likes of Ford. From the above, it seems as if Ford believes that the likes of Apple and Google can (if they aren't already) change the automotive industry and the way we interact with cars for the better. In an interview with the BBC, Ford boss Mark Fields claims that the future rivals of the company may not be the likes of BMW and Audi, but instead tech companies like Google and Apple. Fields went on to explain that Ford's working assumption is that Apple is indeed building a car, and that the assumption provides Ford with "the right motivation to make sure we stay very focused not only on the product but overall on the experience that the customer has interacting with the product and the services that we have." This is following the opening of a new Ford-owned technology business in Palo Alto where employees will be working on autonomous cars that can drive automatically, as well as working with IoT companies to see how people interact with their vehicles. If nothing else, it's an interesting look at what big companies like Ford expect to see on the road within the next five to ten years regardless of Apple's efforts. Apple buys car-related domain names As first reported by MacRumours, it appears that Apple has bought a number of car-related domain names including apple.car, apple.cars and apple.auto. The purchases took place in December 2015 and were brought to light via Whois, a service that finds information regarding specific domain names and IP addresses. Whois records were updated on January 8 2016 to show that Apple had registered the domains through registrar MarkMonitor Inc, although it’s worth noting that none of the registered domains are currently active. While this may seem like confirmation that Apple is working on an Apple Car, it may not be the case; Apple could be buying the domains for use with Apple’s in-car system, CarPlay. It could also be to stop potential scammers looking to make money from people in light of the recent Apple Car rumours. Although with this being said, Apple bought iCloud.com months before its announcement and that was also picked up by MacRumours. Elon Musk 'confirms' existence of Apple Car in an interview As well as Apple buying car-related domain names, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk recently ‘confirmed’ the existence of Apple’s iCar when speaking to the BBC, claiming that it’s an “open secret” that the company is building a rival car. Musk went on to say that “companies like Apple will probably make a compelling electric car, it seems like the obvious thing to do” and regarding Apple’s privacy, he remarked “It's pretty hard to hide something if you hire over a thousand engineers to do it”. Although he’s fairly confident that Apple is creating a rival car, Musk isn’t worried. When asked if Apple was a threat by a German newspaper, Musk mockingly replied: “Did you ever take a look at the Apple Watch?”. The cheek. New electric car company could be a ‘front’ for Apple The latest reports on the web claim that a new car manufacturer, Faraday Future, could, in fact, be a front for Apple’s rumoured electric car, allowing the company to develop the vehicle without the prying eyes of the media watching them. Faraday Future is a relatively new manufacturer, first appearing on the scene earlier this year as a Tesla competitor – both companies are named after famous scientists, Nikola Tesla and Michael Faraday, and interested in electric vehicles. Though Faraday Future’s plans were initially unclear, the company recently announced that it’d be investing a whopping $1 billion in a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in either California, Georgia, Louisiana or Nevada. The company plans to create an electric vehicle, while it also explores “other aspects of the automotive and technology industries, including unique ownership and usage models, in-vehicle content and autonomous driving”. That’s according to Nick Sampson, senior vice president of Faraday Future, who continued to say "Our range of 100% electric and intelligent vehicles will offer seamless connectivity to the outside world." Very Apple-esque, wouldn’t you agree? So, where is the connection to Apple? First things first, the company claims to have a team of around 400 “automotive and technology experts” along with a number of key employees, including ex-Tesla director of vehicle chassis engineering, Nick Sampson. This matches up with the reports earlier this year claiming that Apple was poaching a number of Tesla staff for its iCar project – but that’s not all. Apple has reportedly just bought a huge amount of land in California, which is claimed to be around twice the size of its new Spaceship campus. Just to put that into perspective, Apple’s spaceship campus and surrounding land measures in at around 2.8 million feet. Now, where did Faraday Future say they’d be investing in a manufacturing facility? Oh… The company has also received a massive $1 billion in funding – a move that’s almost unheard of for a new company, and many suspect that it’s Apple footing the bill. Apple has around $200 billion in the bank, so $1 billion would (as ridiculous as it sounds) be only a drop in the water for the company. The rumours gained more traction when the New York Times reached out for more information on its backers, with Faraday Future claiming that they are “keeping their partners confidential”. Intriguing, right? Well, there’s one more piece to this puzzle… The CEO of the company has not yet been revealed, a move that shrouds this company in mystery. If Faraday Future is a front for Apple’s iCar development, it’d make sense not to announce a CEO; pushing an Apple exec to the position of Faraday Future CEO would immediately give away the company’s plans, possibly years before the launch of its electric car. Of course, nothing has been confirmed or denied, and it does seem like a lot of effort to disguise its own efforts, but it is possible – and if it was going to be any company, it would, of course, be Apple to do it. Apple Car ‘could have digital license plates’ According to website Electrek, Apple’s upcoming iCar could be the first to boast digital license plates. Why? Amongst the horde of employees that Apple has snapped up over the past few months is Rónán Ó Braonáin, ex-Director of Engineering at Reviver, a start-up working on what Braonáin called “the world’s first digital license plate”. According to his LinkedIn, he spent five years as a software engineer at BMW before becoming CTO at Vision Fleet, a company offering electric vehicle fleet management software, before moving onto Reviver and finally ending up at Apple as a “Secret Agent” on “Special Projects”. Digital license plates make sense, especially when you consider vehicle-sharing. The digital license plate could bring forward a new era of vehicle sharing, by giving the government a way to issue plate identifications to the driver of the car, instead of the car itself. Letting a friend drive? Your iCar’s digital license plate would (in theory) automatically update, letting everyone (aka the government) know who’s driving at any particular time. It’s a cool idea, but we’re not sure just how viable it is, especially when you consider that license plates need to be readable in almost any weather conditions, an issue that a digital license plate may struggle with. Steve Jobs ‘considered Apple car’ in 2008 Tony Fadell, former Apple executive, revealed in a recent interview that he and Steve Jobs occasionally talked about what an Apple-manufactured car could look like. The pair would chat informally about various features of the Apple Car and what they’d look like, from the dashboard to the seats to the type of fuel it could be powered by. Although in his follow-up, Fadell stressed that the questions were purely hypothetical and that Apple wasn’t actively developing a car in 2008. Apple execs reportedly liked the idea of building a car, but decided, in the end, to allocate the company’s resources to other products that’d have a bigger impact on consumers around the world – the iPhone, and then three years later, the iPad. However, Fadell did note that cars and iPhones have more in common than meets the eye: “A car has batteries; it has a computer; it has a motor, and it has mechanical structure. If you look at an iPhone, it has all the same things. It even has a motor in it,”. ‘Massive change’ is coming to the auto industry Speaking at Wall Street Journal’s WSJDLive conference at The Montage resort in Laguna Beach, California, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the automotive industry is close to “massive change” but refused to comment on whether Apple would be a leading part of the change, which Cook predicts will see users move away from internal combustion engines to electrification. “It would seem like there will be massive change in that industry, massive change,” Cook said at the conference. “You may not agree with that. That’s what I think.” This was followed by Cook refusing to respond to reports of Apple developing an electric car looking to be on sale by 2019. He said instead that the company is working to bring the “iPhone experience” to the vehicle via CarPlay, Apple’s in-dash system that allows users to access their iTunes music collections and driving directions without needing to operate phones. Apple 'testing a self-driving car at a War World II naval base' Project Titan is on its way, at least according to the Guardian. The newspaper reports that Apple has already developed its self-driving car, and now it just needs to be tested. Unlike many carmakers - such as Google and Tesla - that are testing their self-driving vehicles on public roads, Apple wants to keep a low profile. That means the company needs some barricaded doors behind which it can test its secretive projects. Apparently Apple has found the perfect top-secret testing base. Back in May, according to the Guardian, Apple's engineers met officials from GoMentum Station, a War World II-epoch disused naval base near San Francisco. The base reportedly hosts 20 miles of everyday public transport scenarios, from highways to cattle grids; its 24-hour surveillance by armed soldiers prevents the public from nosing around the facility. According to GoMentum officials, the base is "the largest secure test facility in the world". However, it's worth mentioning that the leaked report obtained by the Guardian consists of a filed public requests record about the meeting between Apple's team and GoMentum officials. There is no mention of an Apple iCar, and the most revealing clue comes from Apple engineer Frank Fearon, who said: "We would … like to get an understanding of timing and availability for the space, and how we would need to coordinate with other parties who would be using [GoMentum]." BMW negotiations A number of outlets have reported that Apple and the German automaker BMW have been meeting with one another, with Reuters reporting that Tim Cook and other Apple bigwigs visited the BMW production facility in Leipzig. In particular, Apple seems interested in the carbon-fibre-reinforced BMW i3 electric vehicle, reportedly the most energy-efficient car in the US. It's believed that the i3 could form the basis of the rumoured iCar. It's further been claimed that negotiations between Apple and BMW started in autumn 2014 and are approaching a final deal. However, it's worth pointing out that BMW was the first carmaker to incorporate iPod facilities into its vehicles, and that it is entirely possible that Apple is simply looking to secure an agreement with the German company to move its CarPlay project forward. Read more: Apple and BMW started talking about an iCar collaboration last year Hiring car industry veterans Perhaps the clearest sign of Apple's interest in the car industry is the number of new hires it's made from that field. According to the Wall Street Journal, Tim Cook has hired Doug Betts, a veteran of the car industry. Doug Betts has 25 years of experience working for Nissan and Toyota; from 2007 until last year, he was senior vice-president of Global Quality at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The automobile expert has changed his LinkedIn profile. He describes his current job as "operation-Apple Inc.", which could be interpreted as evidence to back up the WSJ's rumour. On the other hand, this cryptic statement could mean a lot of things.  Since February 2015, Apple seems to have been quietly cherry-picking automobile industry experts - such as Paul Furgale, the Swiss researcher who led the V-Charge project developing self-parking cars. Business Insider's source claims that Tesla employees are "jumping ship" to go and work at Apple. Evidence via LinkedIn supports this claim, with 50 profiles of current Apple employees that have an engineering history at Tesla, mainly through internships. Apple Insider reported that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said that Apple is trying very hard to get Tesla engineers, offering them a $250k signing bonus and 60 percent pay increase. The Korea Times has reported that Apple is also luring Samsung's tech experts away from them, namely experts in battery technology; perhaps to work on batteries for the iPhone, but also, reports suggest to work on a battery powered electric car. "Some of our personnel have been hired by Apple. They now work at Apple's headquarters in San Jose, Calif.," claimed one anonymous Samsung official, stating that Apple offers competitive benefits and large annual paychecks. If Apple is entering the electric car arena, the company is pretty late to the game and will be looking to file patents. It has already filed a few, as you will see below. "As the electric vehicle business is a new one, Apple needs patents and experts in battery technology. Top human resources firms have been approaching Samsung's battery experts, individually, and I think such human exchange moves are a win-win for both," said the Samsung official. It's easy to write this off as an unconfirmed rumour, but it does fit in with a lawsuit that was filed earlier this month claiming that Apple engaged in an "aggressive campaign" to poach engineers from electric car battery maker A123 Systems. The Register has also reported that Apple is reassigning workers to its car project at such a fast pace that other department leaders are beginning to complain about the loss of talent. Though Project Titan remains shrouded in mystery, reassigning such a number of staff from a variety of departments does point towards work on a significant scale, and possibly a move into a completely new industry.  'Apple cars' spotted There were also rumours surrounding Apple registered vehicles seen driving around the US. The vehicles were clad in sensors, which some assumed enabled the car to drive autonomously like Google’s self-driving car. However, it was too good to be true as Apple announced months after that these were, in fact, mapping vehicles that were being used to improve the Apple Maps service. In fact, the company has even listed all the locations that Apple’s mapping cars will be driving around – possibly to stop any future confusion. If you’re interested (for whatever reason) in seeing Apple’s mapping vehicles in person, head over to the Apple Vehicles page and take a look. More about this rumour below. Secret iCar facility There has also been talk of a secret automobile R&D facility where Apple is recruiting experts to potentially build the iCar. It's apparently run by the ex-head of R&D at Mercedes, Johann Jungwirth, and will be staffed with "experienced managers from its iPhone unit", according to The Times. They carry on to say that the seniority of the executives involved would suggest that an iCar could be in the works. They've also reported that Jony Ive and members of his industrial design team, who are responsible for most of Apples products, have been holding regular meetings with automotive execs and have even tried hiring them. Project Titan team growing According to a recent report from the Wall Street Journal, Apple is taking the iCar project more seriously. Why? Apparently, the company has decided to triple the 600-person strong team to an 1800-person strong team to help reach the iCars all-new 2019 announcement target (see below for more information).  Head over to page 2 for evidence that Apple isn't working on an iCar, along with all rumours discussing the electric vs autonomous debate and a possible release date.  >> Read on… Pages 1 2 3 Tags: Apple , Rumour Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

The most likely destination of Safari defectors: Google's Chrome. According to California-based analytics vendor Net Applications, in March 2015, an estimated 69% of all Mac owners used Safari to go online. But by last month, that number had dropped to 56%, a drop of 13 percentage points -- representing a decline of nearly a fifth of the share of two years prior. It was possible to peg the percentage of Mac users who ran Safari only because that browser works solely on macOS, the Apple operating system formerly labeled OS X. The same single-OS characteristic of IE and Edge has made it possible in the past to determine the percentage of Windows users who run those browsers. [ Further reading: Microsoft continues to bleed browser share at record rates ] Net Applications measures user share by sniffing the browser user agent string of visitors to its customers' websites, then tallying the various browsers and OSes. Safari's share erosion was much less than that suffered by Microsoft's browsers, particularly IE, during the same period. From March 2015 to February 2017, the use of Microsoft's IE and Edge on Windows personal computers plummeted. Two years ago, the browsers were run by 62% of Windows PC owners; last month, the figure had fallen by more than half, to just 27%. Simultaneous with the decline of IE has been the rise of Chrome. The user share of Google's browser -- its share of all browsers on all operating systems -- more than doubled in the last two years, jumping from 25% in March 2015 to 59.5% last month. Along the way, Chrome supplanted IE to become the world's most-used browser. It's impossible to be certain, but Chrome was probably the beneficiary from Safari's user share decline as well. In the last 24 months, Mozilla's Firefox -- the other major browser alternative to Chrome for macOS users -- has barely budged, losing just two-tenths of a percentage point in user share. The downturn of both IE and Safari expose the fragility of what was once thought to be their biggest advantage: That they were bundled with their respective operating systems. Because they came with the operating system -- Windows in IE's case, OS X and now macOS in Safari's -- their position was believed unassailable; users, it was thought, would largely use what they were given, rather than seek out alternatives. Microsoft became the agent of IE's destruction when the company unexpectedly called for the retirement of most versions of the browser, and told customers they must upgrade to IE11. Faced with that, many instead simply deserted to Chrome. Apple did not make that same mistake, so reasons for Safari's decline are muddier. One possibility: Those who used both Windows and OS X/macOS -- perhaps one at work, the other at home -- may have shifted to the common denominator of Chrome for the convenience of bookmark and password synchronization. Under that theory, a small increase of Chrome on OS X/macOS was simply a side effect of the much larger rise of Chrome on Windows.

Many MSPs are seen to be stuck in the same comfort cycle of doing business within the few markets that they are comfortable in, but delivering stellar growth goes beyond doing just that; they need to take risks and branch out, or risk being gone. This exclusive ARN roundtable, in association with SolarWinds MSP, addressed key trends in the market for MSPs, diversifying areas of play – from SMB through to mid-market and enterprise, lucrative verticals, the importance of strategic alliances, as well as expanding into niche areas such as cybersecurity and ransomware and using them as a hook for customer conversations.

Warren, AP) 84 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Flying below the radar in the noisy world of music streaming, Amazon Music has quietly made a sizable impact on the country genre. The e-commerce giant has already been performing disproportionately well among country music listeners compared to top streaming competitors Spotify and Apple Music. Of its top-50 streamed songs in the final week of February, 16 were country songs. That’s compared to just one between Apple and Spotify combined. Of its top-50 albums, 18 were country albums compared to zero between Apple and Spotify. Though it did not disclose the raw numbers, Amazon confirmed that country music’s percentage of total plays on its streaming service is two-times the industry average. Spotify and Apple have been active in the Nashville music community for years and both services boast impressive overall streaming statistics and subscriber numbers. Ryan Redington, who heads Amazon’s music division, said the company’s success in country music is due at least in part to the in-roads made before its streaming service began to gain traction.

We’ve been selling CDs since 1998. So we’ve been in the music business for almost 20 years and built long relationships with those physical customers. “And a lot of those customers are country music customers. Then I think on the streaming side, what’s nice is as those customers choose to migrate from the physical to the streaming world, we have a very welcoming platform for the country music customer.” At a presentation at the annual Country Radio Seminar in Nashville in late February, Redington touted the company’s success with country fans. He said the company has demonstrated the importance of country with its recent investments. Amazon sponsored Garth Brook’s record-breaking tour and was the exclusive streaming partner when the country legend released finally released his catalog on the increasingly popular delivery platform. And Amazon’s success comes as the company staffs up its Nashville office. The company announced in late February that it has hired Music Row veteran Kelly Rich as senior label relations manager for Nashville. Emily Cohen also works out of the Nashville office as music curator, focusing on tracking trends within the country genre, identifying emerging artists and building out playlists. Rich joined Amazon after working at Big Machine Label Group, where she was the senior vice president of sales. Amazon’s success has not gone unnoticed on Music Row. Warner Music Nashville Chairman and CEO John Esposito said his company is fully aware of how well country music is doing on Amazon Music. "Amazon is disproportionately country," Esposito said. "Their top 50 has (16) songs, compared to four in the overall top 200 in any given week. So it's noteworthy. Country and classic rock seem to be over-indexing for them." Country is already the No. 1 station on Amazon Music. And Christian music, which is also largely headquartered in Nashville, is the No. 5 station, the company said. Redington said Amazon is betting on its voice-operated speaker system called Echo bringing in more streaming customers in the near future. Echo users can sign up for Amazon’s premium streaming service for just $4 per month. “I can walk home and say, ‘Alexa start playing country music,’ and she’ll just start playing country music on Echo just like that,” Redington said. “You can play country music by genre and by era, so I can say, ‘Play country music from the 70s or the 80s.’ We’ve created a very frictionless way to ask for music. “You can even ask Alexa to play a song by just singing certain lyrics to Alexa. We’re hoping and we’re confident that this frictionless, welcoming platform draws in more country fans.” Lynn Oliver-Cline, the founder and owner of independent music company River House Artists, which is the home to emerging star Luke Combs, said Amazon has already proven to be a great partner for up-and-coming artists. Much like John Marks with Spotify, Amazon is working to cultivate new artists and expose them to fans. “They are a great partner for us already and we still have some room to grow,” Oliver-Cline said. “They are continually coming up with new opportunities for country artists.” Reach Nate Rau at nrau@tennessean.com or 615-259-8094.

Brian Barrett Gear Date of Publication: 03.03.17. 03.03.17 Time of Publication: 9:30 am. 9:30 am The Silicon Shift That’s Transforming How Tech Giants Make Phones Xiaomi Apple does it. Samsung, too. You may not be as familiar with Huawei, but it’s been doing it for years too. And now the Chinese smartphone powerhouse Xiaomi has joined this growing club of big companies that don’t lean exclusively on Qualcomm and others for mobile chipsets. Instead, they just up and make their own. You can’t quite call it a trend, but seeing so many manufacturers invest in their own chipsets marks a significant shift in an industry long dependent on the same few silicon specialists. Like all big bets, it carries the promise of big rewards for the companies and their customers—and the threat of just as many risks. Breaking Free Let’s clarify up front that aside from Apple, these companies still do big business with Qualcomm, MediaTek, and other processor pros for “system on a chip” technology. And Apple still taps Qualcomm for the modem in the iPhone, despite pursuing a billion-dollar lawsuit over the company’s business practices. Chips Ahoy David Pierce China’s Plan to Rule the World: Make All the Gadgets Tim Moynihan New Qualcomm Tech Could Lead to the Ultimate Drone Brian Barrett Intel’s Chips Finally Find Their Way Into the iPhone Brian Barrett What the Snapdragon 835 Chip Means For Your Next Smartphone In one sense, this speaks to Qualcomm’s dominance and capabilities. Smartphone manufacturers rely on Qualcomm chips for the same reason spec home builders rely on Alabama white marble countertops: They’re top of the line. “If you’re looking for a high-performance part, and connectivity is key, there’s really only one game in town,” says Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights and Strategy. “And that’s Qualcomm.” The company’s deep resources and industry-wide relationships mean its chips just work, at a high level, with pretty much any hardware and software you can throw at it. That kind of ubiquity obviously benefits Qualcomm, but the fact that everyone uses the exact same chipset motivates companies like Xiaomi to develop their own alternatives. In the cutthroat world of premium smartphones, the desire to differentiate makes sense. Nearly every flagship device next year that isn’t an iPhone will use the Snapdragon 835 processor. It’s like having a Daytona 500 where car runs the exact same engine. Engineers might find other ways to tweak performance, but they’re all fundamentally the same. “When you make your own chips you can design them to be ideal for your specific devices, rather than being designed for all possible use cases,” says mobile analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. You also dodge any rough patches a third-party supplier might experience. Rumors that Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 810 processor experienced overheating issues (later refuted) prompted Samsung to put the home-grown Exynos chips into the top-tier Galaxy S6 in 2015. Apple can do whatever it likes with its AX series of mobile processors, a freedom that reportedly has Cupertino considering a similar move in the Intel-dominated Mac space. All of which sounds great—if you can afford it. And Xiaomi can afford to take the risks. Where the Chips Fall Two years ago, Xiaomi decided to control its own destiny. “We need to be able to make a chipset to stand out as someone who was really innovative,” says company spokesman John Chan. “The key is having full control of the chipset and integration with the phone.” With that in mind, Xiaomi built the Surge S1, an eight-core, ARM-based processor that, while not exactly a powerhouse, can handle 4K video. More importantly, it’s fully integrated with the new Xiaomi 5C smartphone, which launched with the chip. Xiaomi’s 5C smartphone, with the company’s new chip inside. Xiaomi Xiaomi reportedly spent $145 million developing the Surge S1 and has already reaped benefits. First and foremost, it allowed Xiaomi to offer a phone right now— the Snapdragon 835 won’t appear until sometime in April with the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S8. Chan says the chip gives the company more control over when it pushes Android updates to customers.  And there are other areas to explore. Huawei, for instance, figured out how to squeeze a few days of battery out of its Keira 960 chip. What makes all of this so fascinating is it almost certainly couldn’t have happened even a few years ago. “What’s made it possible is intellectual property from ARM, and an improvement in the tools to design, develop, and take an SoC to a [fabrication plant] to go build it,” says Moorhead. Specifically, in recent years ARM introduced a program called Artisan, which provides something like an off-the-shelf intellectual property buffet. It’s easier than ever to build a processor operation from scratch—a major reason why it only took two years to go from urge to Surge. None of which necessarily makes any of this a good idea. Risky Business Apple’s success with the iPhone and its AX processors underscores how much can go right for companies that invest in developing their own silicon—but also belies how much can go wrong. “Unless you acquire an existing chip maker or designer you’re going to be worse at this than established chip makers,” says Dawson. That doesn’t just mean potential performance issues, though those are certainly possible. “Imagine if you messed up a chip and you’ve got to do a metal layer spin,” says Moorhead, referring to a step in semiconductor fabrication. “That could mean 90 days added to your schedule.” Then there’s compatibility, which creates the potential for pitfalls both specific and broad. A brand new chipset could create performance issues for individual apps. And big-picture features can remain beyond reach—Qualcomm, for example, builds the only chips with the muscle to handle Google’s ambitious Daydream mobile VR platform. That will likely be true of the next big breakthrough as well. “You run the risk of missing a major inflection point,” says Moorhead. That’s why the Surge S1 launches, at least, mostly as a hedge. Xiaomi says it remains committed to working with Qualcomm and its other parters, and vice versa. “We have a strong relationship with Xiaomi and will continue to collaborate to bring the latest technology features to mobile devices around the world,” says Qualcomm spokeswoman Tara Sims. How strong that relationship remains likely depends on the success Xiaomi finds with the Surge S1 and its successors. Chan says the company doesn’t expect a full return on investment until “much later on.” The company can’t achieve the same cost savings through scale that a company like Samsung can, because it doesn’t have the same breadth of products—the connected dishwashers and such—to plop chips in. But if Xiaomi’s gambit pays off, it raises the intriguing possibility that smartphones of the future won’t just be better. They’ll be different. They’ll offer options beyond screen size and and finish. After all, there’s no better feature than choice. Go Back to Top.

AbderholdenContact ReporterNews-Sun The latest arrest in connection with traveling scams in Lake County centers around two men who were going from Apple store to Apple store across the country returning old cellphones for new ones, but a traffic stop near the Deer Park store this week tripped them up, according to the Lake County Sheriff's Office. "These suspects were going across the country committing this fraud," said sheriff's office spokesman Sgt. Christopher Covelli. Three suspects charged with identity theft at Deer Park Apple store Just a day after sheriff detectives arrested two people at the Deer Park Apple Store for unauthorized purchases, a third out-of-state suspect was arrested Saturday night, according to Sgt.

Just a day after sheriff detectives arrested two people at the Deer Park Apple Store for unauthorized purchases, a third out-of-state suspect was arrested Saturday night, according to Sgt. Christopher Covelli of the Lake County Sheriff's Office. John Michael Johnson, 18, of Ferndale, Mich., was...Read the story "They were using fake names to exchange the phones. The phones they would exchange would be so severely damaged, and in some cases SuperGlued to prevent staff from seeing the serial number to determine if the phone were stolen," he added. "They would then get a new refurbished phone, which they would sell for significant profit." According to Covelli, a sheriff's deputy conducted a traffic stop Tuesday on a vehicle in the area of the Deer Park Town Center on Route 12 north of Lake Cook Road, where the sheriff's office has conducted increased patrols due to the Apple Store thefts. The driver of the car, Mohammed Hosein, 23, of Detroit, said he and his passenger, Wen Jie Qin, 21, of San Francisco, just left the Apple Store after exchanging broken iPhones. Covelli said they were pulled over for a traffic infraction and the driver had a suspended driver's license. "The alert sheriff's deputy, knowing there have been a number of fraudulent purchases at the Deer Park Apple Store, conducted additional investigation," Covelli said in a statement issued early Friday. "After further investigation by sheriff's deputies and detectives, it was determined Hosein and Qin traveled to numerous Apple Stores across the United States and fraudulently obtained possession of numerous Apple iPhones," the statement added. "Over 100 Apple iPhones were recovered from Qin and Hosein, which they obtained fraudulently," 2 arrested for trying to make fraudulent Apple store purchases, police say Jim Newton Two people who attempted to gain access to user accounts and make unauthorized purchases at the Apple store in Deer Park were arrested Friday night by the Lake County Sheriff's Office, Sgt.

Christopher Covelli said. Alexander J. Soto, 25, of Yonkers, N.Y., and Diamand D. Reid, 22, of Roseville,... (Jim Newton) Hosein was charged with felony charges of burglary and retail theft along with traffic-related offenses, Covelli said, adding that Hosein was held Friday morning in Lake County Jail on $50,000 bail pending a March 27 appearance in court. Qin was also charged with felony charges of burglary and retail theft, and he was also held Friday in Lake County Jail on $50,000 bail with the same scheduled court date, according to Covelli. Since last summer, there have been 12 arrests related to the Deer Park store, with seven New York state suspects arrested over a three-day period in late July for allegedly using stolen identities and stolen credit card numbers of victims throughout the country to make the purchases across the Chicago area, according to police. At the time, Covelli said the suspects would fly into O'Hare International Airport, rent a car and go to Apple stores to attempt to make purchases. Beside those seven initial suspects, three other people, two from Michigan and one from New York state, were arrested at the end of January for making unauthorized purchases, and they were charged with burglary and identity theft, according to police. In August 2016, a Las Vegas couple was arrested after a clerk at the Deer Park Apple store recognized the couple from a corporate alert that they were wanted for theft from Chicago area stores in Schaumburg and Oak Brook, and in the states of California and Nevada. Two stolen Apple drones were found inside the vehicle, according to police. In Gurnee at the end of January, police arrested three people from Orlando, Fla., who had flown into Chicago and rented a car for a $20,000 shopping spree in the village using fraudulent credit cards. Gurnee police said that on Jan.11, they received several calls from businesses that had been victims of credit card fraud totaling approximately $20,000, according to police. The suspects' descriptions were similar, and one of the victims got a description of their vehicle, which was registered to a rental car company. According to police, they searched hotels in the area and found the rental car, learned what hotel room the suspects were in and made the arrests without incident. "These rings travel all over the U.S., but the sheriff's office and Deer Park Apple Store have been working very diligently together to identify and arrest thieves," Covelli said Friday. fabderholden@tribpub.com Twitter @abderholden Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, Lake County News-Sun Crime Theft Reaction to the new travel ban Chance the Rapper donates $1 million to CPS 2017 Chicago Polar Plunge Sports Breaking Trending RedEye Opinion Suburbs Entertainment Advertising 57°

MobilityDevices Back to Home Apple takes patent battle against Qualcomm to UK Increase / Decrease text size Byomakesh Biswal 3rd March 2017 Add to favorites It is Apple’s fourth lawsuit overall. Apple has further expanded its ongoing legal battle against Qualcomm with a new patent lawsuit in the UK. Details about the lawsuit are unclear at the moment, but Bloomberg reported that the suit revolves around patents and registered designs. Apple already filed a case against Qualcomm in the US and two in China. Both the lawsuits were filed in January. According to the Verge, Apple said the lawsuit in the UK was also filed back in January alongside the other lawsuits, but is only being noticed now due to a refiling. Apple alleged that Qualcomm unfairly charges royalties for technology they have nothing to do with. In the US case, Apple accused Qualcomm of charging it “at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined.” The two lawsuits in China accuse Qualcomm of misusing its power in the processor industry and failing to fulfill promises to broadly licence standard essential patents at a reasonable price. One of the China lawsuits seeks JPY1bn (about $146m) in damages. As part of the claim, Apple accused Qualcomm of violating China’s Anti-Monopoly Law. Qualcomm is also facing anti-trust action by the US Federal Trade Commission and investigations by the European Union and Taiwan. Last December, Qualcomm was fined $853m by South Korea over unfair patent licensing practices. The company has however appealed the penalty.

Apple CEO Tim Cook referred to the company’s legal battle with Qualcomm during the recent earnings call, explaining that he sees litigation as a last resort and is open to settling the lawsuit. Cook said: “I don’t like litigation, and so if there’s another way, then that would be great, but at this point I don’t see it. I fully expect at this point in time that it will take some time, but in the end, I think common sense will prevail, and the courts will see it for what it is. So that’s the way I see it.” Tags Apple Qualcomm Previous ArticleIs Facebook turning its back on AI chatbots?

This implies that the company will have the sensor built into the display as the iPhone 8 is rumored to have no bezels whatsoever. Rather than relying on Synaptic or Qualcomm for the technology, Apple will be building the sensor in-house with Authentec algorithms and Privaris glass tech. Interestingly, the report also says that the iPhone 8 will not be going into production until September.. Apple typically needs months of leeway before launching a new iPhone. The company usually sells 15 million units within the opening weekend alone. A September production date means that Apple could potentially be launching this phone in October or later. Digitimes says that an Apple-custom fingerprint sensor is much more difficult to manufacture. The new component will use technologies such as ultrasound rather than relying on a capacitive sensor that’s currently being used with Touch ID. The September production date should be taken with a grain of salt, however, as the last iPhone launched in October was the iPhone 4s. If the phone truly doesn’t begin production in September, we should expect a launch date of late October, at the earliest.

Lake County sheriff’s deputies stopped a vehicle near the Deer Park Town Center on Wednesday, according to a statement from the sheriff’s office. The driver, 23-year-old Mohammed Hosein; and the passenger, 21-year-old Wen Jie Qin, had just left the Deer Park Apple store after exchanging broken iPhones. After a series of recent fraudulent purchases at that store, the deputies decided to investigate further, the sheriff’s office said. They found the two men to be in possession of more than 100 iPhones. Investigators determined that Hosein, of Detroit; and Qin, who lives in San Francisco, traveled to Apple stores across the county and “fraudulently obtained possession of numerous Apple iPhones,” according to the sheriff’s office. Qin and Hosein were charged with one count each of burglary and retail theft, both felonies, and were each ordered held on $50,000 bonds. Ten people from New York and Michigan were arrested in 2016 and earlier this year in connection with fraudulent purchases at Apple stores, several at the Deer Park location, according to the sheriff’s office. Deputies are providing increased patrols at the store as the investigation continues.

Login Search Buying Snap Today Could Be Like Buying Apple 35 Years Ago March 03, 2017, 08:36:01 AM EDT By Chris Ciaccia Snapchat (Shutterstock photo) Many on Wall Street are comparing Snap Inc. (SNAP) to Facebook (FB) or Twitter (TWTR) and for now, that's okay. All three can be considered social networks, rely on daily active users and generate the majority of their revenue from advertising. In the future, however, Snap may wind up being more like another Silicon Valley giant than the aforementioned ones -- Apple (AAPL). Buying stock in Snap today is a bet on CEO Evan Spiegel more than it is on the company's prowess as an advertising behemoth. Spiegel, 26, is a product visionary the world has not seen seen Apple's Steve Jobs and to some extent, Tesla Inc. (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk.  There are similarities between Jobs and Spiegel, both starting their companies after dropping out of college, are wonderful salesmen and marketers, but the similarities go further than that. Jobs is Spiegel's idol; he has a portrait of the legendary Apple co-founder hanging in his office. When unveiling Spectacles to The Wall Street Journal this past fall, he even used Jobs-ian language, saying "You wanna see it?" as he took off the towel covering the product. This mentality plays to the culture of secrecy at both companies, not releasing products until they are ready to be talked about.  And unlike other technology companies, neither Snap or Apple have "beta" products. There is no group of early adopters buying and using a product so the companies can get an idea of how users are interacting with it and then continue to refine. Every meticulous detail is thought out and obsessed over and is not released until it's perfect. Aegis Capital analyst Victor Anthony said the company's most valuable asset is its demographic, with 13-24 year olds comprising nearly 60% of its user base. While these are highly coveted by advertisers such as Procter & Gamble, Clorox and others, Spiegel is the company's most valuable asset. The ability to know what people want before they want or see it is an invaluable trait that very few executives have. It can not be measured or valued, but it's something that investors need to keenly aware of when looking at where to put their investing dollars. Snap has positioned and sold itself as a camera company, having mentioned that multiple times in its S-1. This can allow them to expand into everything and anything that has a camera.  Despite the optimism surrounding Spiegel, the stickiness of Snapchat (engagement levels are shockingly high) and the coveted user base, it's not all roses for Snap at this stage. There are concerns about the company's financial picture, as it still generates the majority of its revenue from advertising. Going up against Facebook and Google, which have mountains of user data that advertisers love, can be a daunting task (just ask Twitter). Issues surrounding slowing user growth, the ability for competitors to copy product features, lack of data analytics, no voting control with Class A shares are all valid reasons to be wary of Snap, especially at a $35 billion valuation.  But again, it comes down to be at the forefront of an area that's only going to expand with a product visionary for a CEO. Images, whether it's augmented reality, virtual reality, moving or static, are humanity's future. All you have to do is just look at the popularity of Instagram to see why. Snap, with Snapchat, its burgeoning hardware portfolio and most importantly Spiegel, is poised to be at the forefront of this trend for many years to come.

Millions. And millions more. Here's what investors should know about Buffett's bet on Apple stock. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Mar 3, 2017 at 9:16AM You've probably seen the headlines. Famed billionaire investor Warren Buffett has been loading up on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. But just how many shares has he bought through Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) (NYSE:BRK-A)? Millions of shares and billions of dollars A glance at Berkshire's most recent SEC filing with updates on the company's common stock investments reveals Apple has become one of Berkshire's largest positions, valued at over $7 billion. But Buffett didn't stop at the 61.2 million Apple shares reported in the annual 10-K filing. The Berkshire chairman and CEO has since more than doubled his position in Apple, growing Berkshire's slice of the tech giant to a whopping 133 million shares, Buffett said in a CNBC interview this week. This puts Berkshire's stake in the $729 billion company at about 2.5%. Image source: Apple. There's no doubt this investment in Apple is an important wager for Berkshire. With Apple stock trading at about $139 at the time of this writing, that's an $18.5 billion position, second only to Berkshire's $29 billion position in Wells Fargo and edging out Berkshire's $17 billion position in Coca-Cola. Berkshire's fourth, fifth, and sixth biggest holdings are IBM, American Express, and Phillips 66, valued at about $13 billion, $11 billion, and $6 billion, respectively. Still a fraction of Berkshire's whole business Despite being Berkshire's second-largest holding now, investors shouldn't expect Berkshire's performance to be heavily influenced by Apple stock. Berkshire is a large company in its own right, with a market capitalization of $432 billion. Further, Berkshire's results remain more closely tied to its wholly owned subsidiaries than its equities portfolio. First in importance at Berkshire is its wholly owned insurance businesses, which include giants Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, General Re, GEICO, and more. Together, Berkshire's insurance businesses ended 2016 with $91.5 billion of float, or premiums collected upfront that can be invested, and generated a combined underwriting profit of $2.1 billion. Then there's Berkshire's regulated, capital-intensive business, which includes BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (Berkshire's 90%-owned utility business). These two companies alone accounted for 33% of Berkshire's after-tax operating profits in 2016. Berkshire agreed to acquire BNSF in 2009 in a deal that valued the railway company at $34 billion. Image source: BNSF. And Berkshire's subsidiaries don't stop here. Berkshire's manufacturing, service, and retailing operations "sell products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes," Buffett said in his 2016 annual letter to shareholders. This "motley crew," as Buffett calls it, generated $5.6 billion in operating profits for Berkshire. Or, as explained in Berkshire's 10-K filing, their combined results can be summed up like this: Viewed as a single entity, the companies in the manufacturing, service and retailing group are an excellent business. They employed an average of $24 billion of net tangible assets during 2016 and, despite their holding large quantities of excess cash and carrying very little debt, earned 24% after-tax on that capital. Finally, Berkshire's finance and financial products businesses generated a nice $2.1 billion of net income for Berkshire in 2016. So, yes, Buffett's bet on Apple is massive next to Berkshire's other common stock investments. And the massive position is certainly a signal of Buffett's great confidence in the tech giant's long-term potential. But both Apple and Berkshire investors should keep in mind that Berkshire is still far more than an $18.5 billion bet on Apple. Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) Mar 3, 2017 at 8:11AM In the third quarter, just over a third of Qorvo's (NASDAQ:QRVO) revenue came from its largest customer. Though Qorvo didn't name this customer explicitly, it is widely believed the company's biggest account is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), to which it supplies radio frequency chips to enhance signals. This would make Qorvo one of the more diversified Apple suppliers, especially compared to Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) and Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ: CRUS), which are reportedly dependent on Apple for 40% and 85% of their revenues, respectively. In that light, Qorvo seems like a diversified bet. What's more, Qorvo's second-largest customer, with 11% of revenue, is the fast-growing Chinese smartphone player Huawei. Additionally, it counts Samsung (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) among its client list. All this diversification, however, couldn't save Qorvo from setting weak guidance for the fourth quarter. Qorvo expects its fourth-quarter revenue to be $630 million at the midpoint of its guidance range. This is much lower than the consensus revenue estimate of $719 million, and if Qorvo manages to hit the midpoint of its guidance, its revenue will increase just 3.6% from the prior-year period. Let's take a look at what's going on with the company and why investors should take note. Image source: Qorvo. The problems at Qorvo Qorvo's key smartphone clients are under pressure, and this is reflected in the company's guidance. CFO Mark Murphy had the following to say about the company's weak outlook during the Feb. 1 conference call (transcript via Seeking Alpha), "This guidance primarily reflects a greater than historical sequential decline in the March quarter, as two of our leading customers in China and a tier 1 customer in Korea delayed flagship smartphone launches." The delayed smartphone launch by Qorvo's Korean customer seems to be a reference to Samsung, since the Galaxy S8 won't be launched at the Mobile World Congress happening this week, as the S7 was last year. Samsung is reportedly going to launch its flagship in April instead, as it carries out intensive testing of the device to avoid a Note7-like fiasco. There's no doubt that this delay has pushed back Qorvo's potential revenue from Samsung by at least a quarter and led to a weak outlook. Meanwhile, Apple is believed to be slashing its iPhone production by roughly 10% in the current quarter, after producing more units than it sold during the holiday period. Supply chain data suggests that Apple placed orders to manufacture 89 million iPhone units in the December-ended quarter, while it sold only 78.3 million. This leaves Apple with a surplus of around 10 million iPhones for the current quarter, so it has reportedly decided to scale back production. In fact, Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities is of the opinion that iPhone production will decline throughout the first half of 2017, until the production cycle of the next model kicks in. So, it looks like Qorvo will not get any bump in its revenue from its largest customer in the first half of 2017. But is there more afoot here than just declining smartphone orders? Is Skyworks eating Qorvo's lunch? Qorvo is a direct competitor of Skyworks Solutions, as both companies make radio-frequency components for the same customers. However, Skyworks provided a strong outlook for the current quarter when it released results in January. Its revenue expectation of $840 million means that its top line could grow 8% from the prior-year period and exceed consensus analyst estimates of $818 million, while Qorvo's revenue is expected to increase just 3.6%. As Skyworks' outlook is rosier than Qorvo's, the former could be winning market share. Mike Walkley of Canaccord Genuity (via Barron's) has a similar opinion, writing: We also believe Skyworks is increasing content with Samsung and is well positioned for content growth with new Samsung products ramping in the upcoming quarters. We believe other Chinese OEMs will follow Huawei's leadership with increased RF content. Additionally, Skyworks CEO Liam Griffin said that his company has seen content wins in "multiple devices across Samsung's entire portfolio, and gained momentum in China, with key wins at market leaders Oppo, Vivo, Meizu, and Xiaomi." The comments made by Skyworks after its latest results indicate that it is winning a lot of content in the same areas where Qorvo is not feeling confident. In fact, Huawei has now become Skyworks' second-largest customer after Skyworks won almost all of the RF chip spots in Huawei's P9 flagship smartphones last year. On the other hand, Skyworks had reportedly won three spots in the iPhone 7, while Qorvo supplied two chips. In comparison, both companies had two chips each inside the iPhone 6s, according to a teardown of the device by Chipworks. The competition from Skyworks is a red flag that Qorvo investors should not ignore. Harsh Chauhan has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Credit: Apple More like this Apple’s Siri has a huge language advantage Apple is teaching Siri to learn new tricks Everything is a virtual assistant now Video Mingis on Tech: Self-driving cars, wireless charging -- and Wi-Fi lightbulbs? Google isn’t saying it will and Apple’s iOS developer guidelines say it can’t, but a senior Googler set the cat among the pigeons when he suggested the company would like to put its Assistant tech on iPhones. Fanning the flames It’s a rumor. Google product management director Gummi Hafsteinsson told Geekster, “I do not think we have anything to announce at this point, but I think the general philosophy is that we would like to have the Assistant available to as many people as possible." He was speaking at Mobile World Congress. It would not be possible for Google to make its Assistant tech available through an iOS app under Apple’s existing App Store rules. In part this is because Apple already offers its own system-level voice assistant, Siri; it is also because Google would need to secure permission to transmit your personal data as it sends your spoken question to its servers to get you a response. Google could introduce Google Assistant as a Web service, in which case iOS users could access it using a browser. Web search is heading in this direction: Korean search engine, Naver, recently made a strategic investment in SoundHound, for example. Contextual search Google Assistant supports sophisticated, context-based search. This means you can ask it a question such as “what movies are on at the local cinemas”, it will provide an answer, and you can then contextualise the search, for example by asking to limit the list to films on show in the area that feature a specific actor or director. The capacity for more intelligent spoken search is at present an advantage to Assistant. Google Assistant is now being extended to more Android devices, but is far from universal. Apple’s Siri isn’t as good at this – you must ask it a completely different search question and you cannot contexualize within the results. I do think Apple is working on this, as you can contextualize some searches when you use an Apple TV (“show me movies”, “just the good ones”). Siri also enjoys the huge advantage of being available across 90 percent of all iOS devices and useful to five times as many people as Assistant. (It’s also less sexist). A.I. smackdown Voice assistants started as a nice to have but are becoming a must have. Huawei, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Samsung and others all have one. Competition in the space is intense, and Google now knows it needs to fight to maintain a good share in the industry, particularly as key Android vendors (such as Samsung) deploy their own voice A.I., rather than Google’s. Another big player in voice, Amazon, is also staking space in mobile: Alexa will be on the Android-powered Huawei Mate 9 smartphone. Google sees smart assistants as “part of an ongoing conversation with users,” Google CEO, Sundar Pichai said this week. Within this it cannot ignore that the fragmented Android ecosystem and intense competition in this space is an existential threat for the search engine giant as consumers diversify the services they use for search. Apple’s turn We know Apple has been investing deeply in A.I. R&D at offices across the planet. We also expect significant improvements to Siri this June at WWDC. This means that in order to keep pace, Google must ensure its solution is not only better than the current iteration of Siri, Cortana, Alexa, et al., but that it is better than the versions that are to come. That’s going to be pretty hard to achieve when most of the global population speaks a different language, and Apple keeps its cards so close to its chest.

 Apple has 3 execs looking to make big TV deals — and it sounds like a total mess Kif Leswing Mar. 3, 2017, 9:36 AM 2,531 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook and SVP Eddy CueKevork Djansezian/Getty Images Apple has several executives leading negotiations with Hollywood companies for the rights to TV shows and movies, and potentially a big purchase of a content company, the New York Post reports. Apple execs have met with Paramount, and Sony's TV and film departments, according to the report. Previously, the Financial Times reported that Apple had entered into talks with Ron Howard's Imagine Entertainment.  These talks could've taken place last month, when Apple CEO Tim Cook and SVP Eddy Cue were in LA to attend both the Oscars and the Grammys.  But most interestingly, the Post's sources say Apple hasn't figured out who's leading the negotiations: sometimes it's Cue, sometimes it's his longtime lieutenant Robert Kondrk, and sometimes it's Jimmy Iovine, founder of Beats and music industry heavyweight. He doesn't have a title at Apple — it's just "Jimmy." The Post's Claire Atkinson writes: As Apple executives are busying looking to do business in Hollywood, entertainment industry insiders are scratching their heads over who, exactly, is driving the effort. “Robert Kondrk, Eddy Cue, Jimmy Iovine, everyone is trying to be the person,” one insider told The Post. “They each want to be the guy, and they’re telling people, don’t deal with the other one.” That sounds messy, and it's not the first time we've heard about this type of confusion in Apple. Last year, in an article about Apple Music's redesign and music content negotiations, Bloomberg reported:  While Iovine’s connections make him valuable, they’re also a source of friction inside Apple. There were times when they were in the middle of negotiations with an artist's managers and labels while, unbeknownst to them, Iovine was carrying out his own separate discussions, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple has long wanted to release a standout TV product, most likely along with a TV subscription service, but it has been stymied in negotiations with content producers before.  But Apple has made smaller bets on TV shows, including "Planet of the Apps" and "Carpool Karaoke," which will launch on Apple Music, Apple's music subscription service.  Currently, Apple TV, an internet-connected streaming box that plugs into TVs through an HDMI port, is seeing year-over-year declines in sales.  During Apple's most recent earnings call, Cook gave some color on the company's original content ambitions:  "In terms of original content, we have put our toe in the water doing some original content for Apple Music, and that will be rolling out through the year. We are learning from that, and we'll go from there. The way that we participate in the changes that are going on in the media industry — that I fully expect to accelerate from the cable bundle beginning to break down — is: 1. We started the new Apple TV a year ago, we're pleased on how that platform has come along. We have more things planned for it, but it's come a long way in a year, and it gives us a clear platform to build off of. 2. Embedded in the 150 million paid subscriptions that I mentioned in my opening comments, there's a number of third-party services that are a part of that, where we participate economically in some of that by offering our platform selling and distributing. 3. With our toe in the water we are learning a lot about the original content business, and thinking about ways that we could play in that."

I’ve also had the fun of contributing my $.02 on the topic at Computerworld, Engadget, Macworld, SlashGear and now iMore. Most recently I spent a few years at Apple as Sr. Director of Worldwide Product Marketing. On Twitter I’m an unverified @gartenberg. I still own some Apple stock. I loved the wearable category. And I still do... Sort of. Let's define a "smartwatch": For argument's sake, I'm defining the term as anything that functions like a watch, but needs to be recharged. It's a broad definition, I grant you, but it works for the most part. Apple Watch is a smartwatch; a Timex or a Rolex is not. Now let's define what Smartwatches aren't: watches. They're more like little computers, running an OS and using Apps but living on my arm instead of my pocket. They're also not timeless. My Omega Seamaster was passed on to my son, just like my father passed it on to me. My Breitlings have passed to my sons as well. My Apple Watch, however, will be recycled once the battery can no longer hold a charge. Despite this, I'm still a fan of smartwatches — but I also understand why they haven't cracked the true mainstream. I always felt the wrist was the perfect choice for a screen. After all, a watch delivers one or two bits of information, usually time and date. What a waste of space. It's like undeveloped beach front property. And as we well know, screens are important. Every screen a consumer interacts with can define a category: TVs, phones, PCs. But here's where I missed the ball: Those watches have to look great for users to even consider strapping it to their wrist. Some smartwatches are fashionable, such as Apple Watch or the Samsung Gear 2 (not 3). But most of them are big, clunky, skeuomorphic things that could make even a geek cry. Apple made Watch cool and hip and fashionable, which helps as an initial driver. It also wisely focused on health and fitness, as have other platforms. But it turns out that's not a driver for many consumers — those same consumers, after all, bought Fitbits and ended up tossing them in the drawer. Notifications are another great driver, and where I find that the Apple Watch really shines. But that's it: I can pitch someone on an Apple Watch, but I can only offer two major use cases, maybe three. I'll toss in checking the weather... but not "breaking news" from CNN. They're all good usage models, but none of them screams must-have the way the iPhone did before them; as such, I don't think any of them will push the category beyond a limited point. That doesn't mean that smartwatches are a failure: Devices like Apple Watch have their place on the wrist, and they've sold in quite impressive quantities over the last few years. But until Apple — or other companies — figure out the true mainstream use for the smartwatch, it shall remain a product for a specific niche. It may make that niche very happy, but to the general user, that happiness may be trickier to replicate. Like us! Share on Facebook Reader comments The pros and cons of smartwatches 12 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating KendallFawcett I was criticized quite a bit when I suggested, just after the Apple Watch was released, that it really isn't a watch. I think it's a little mini computer that ALSO displays the time. My observations were in response to the "I won't buy one unless it's round like a REAL watch," comments or, "It's ugly compared to my (fill in the blank with some expensive watch I've never heard of)." I don't really care that my $600 watch won't be passed down to someone else, just as I'm not concerned that my new washer and dryer won't be passed down to anyone. Let's face it, I'm sure LOTS of people have proudly presented their $5000 or $10000 watch to a child who looked at it, pretended to smile and then threw it in a drawer. I bought the Apple Watch for what it does, and it does it just fine for me. Oddly, what I like best about the Apple Watch is how easy it is to control the music, wirelessly at my Zumba classes. I say "oddly" because I don't pay any attention to the fitness tracking aspects. And, before you jump on me, which I'm sure will happen, I had a Pebble before and controlling the tracks AND volume was quite difficult. So, go ahead, hate me... 1 4 days ago Reply DannyJJK That's the exact reason it's not round; it's a mini computer. Normal watches are round because when the hands spin round, they form a circular rotation, and since a normal watch doesn't display anything else it makes sense to make it round. The Apple Watch on the other hand (no pun intended) displays information that a computer displays; text, UIs, photos etc. Computer screens aren't round because it wouldn't work, and in the same manner it doesn't really work for a smartwatch. I personally think the Apple Watch is a great looking device, if normal watches weren't round to begin with everyone would be loving how the Apple Watch looks. I bought the Apple Watch from day 1 when it first came out, and I haven't regretted it since. Still works like a dream and is incredibly helpful to me 🙂⌚️ 1 4 days ago Reply KendallFawcett Yup, and it's the reason that iPhones and computer monitors and laptops aren't round. Oh, and I don't care if my laptop gets passed on to someone else, either. 1 4 days ago Reply Ziich47 Smart watches are definitely not a failure but they are far from the finished product. It reminds me of the early days of android phones clunky and cumbersome. So far from what I have seen smart watches do not appeal to me as of yet. However, maybe in a couple years they will reach maturity and will be able to be both capable, durable and beautiful 0 4 days ago Reply DannyJJK The Apple Watch was a bit clunky when it first came out, suffering from being too slow, but on the latest watchOS version, it works pretty well. You should try one out in the Apple Store 0 4 days ago Reply KendallFawcett I would truly love a new one. My current AW (the first one out) was given as a birthday gift by my partner so it's kind of hard to go for a new one now... :-( #firstWorldProblem 1 4 days ago Reply paulxxwall Fossil has nice smartwatches and they look nice but wonder how compatible they are with iPhones . Always like fossils movados diesel watches those are nice the Apple watches..... meh. Sent from the iMore App 0 4 days ago Reply Chollatech I've been using various wearables with clients living with cognitive disabilities with some measurable success. We keep a narrow focus on personal time management and organization. A computer strapped to a wrist is superior to a smart phone because it cant be ignored or missed when properly set up. We work on simple scripts, "make me a reminder...", "make an appointment..." and keep it at that and that simple. As assistive technology wearable technology is a hit. Sent from the iMore App 0 4 days ago Reply danmart I think there are two evolutionary steps that are needed for the smart watch to really take off. The first is that they need a thinner option. Some people like 'big' watches (I don't personally think the Apple Watch is big, but it certainly isn't small) but many people really like slim watches. This is especially true (in my experience) of people with small wrists. Give people a slim option or an 'endurance' option with more battery and let them choose the look / capability mix that fits them best. The second is that the watches need to be able to do more without a tethered phone. My Series 0 Watch really struggles to function when outside of the same room as my iPhone, even though my house isn't huge and I have pervasive wifi. Part of the problem is that I have AC wifi but when the phone is on one band and the watch on another the wifi link doesn't seem to work well. If a new watch had superior connectivity through either wifi or mobile / cellular connectivity it would gain a more clear use-case. Currently when I am using my Watch I could probably take my phone out of a pocket instead, and given that the Watch is still a bit slow to carry out tasks getting the phone out would actually be quicker. This needs to change before the smart watch in general becomes more compelling. The best use case for my Watch is actually in the car. Whilst I have Bluetooth connectivity in my car, it doesn't give the best control options and choosing a track from my library of over 1000 albums is very difficult. The Watch gives me a very effective way of choosing music whilst driving (regular 'Hey Siri' doesn't work well in the car). When CarPlay become more ubiquitous this will be less relevant, but until then it's a very useful capability. 0 3 days ago Reply PoisonMaps Whether or not a smartwatch is useful to you is subjective. My partner (who is not a gadget fan) accidentally left her watch at home today and has texted to say that she feels lost without it. She sends texts and uses reminders all the time and frequently doesn’t have her phone on her (no pockets), but has it nearby, so it is great to still get notifications on the watch. She is also addicted to filling her activity rings, which is a good thing. I always have my phone in my pocket, so I don’t absolutely need the notifications, but do like the fact that I don’t have to dig my phone out (especially as it’s a 6S Plus). I don’t really care about the activity rings but use the watch obsessively when exercising (so much so that I am writing a workout app with an offline moving map for when I am hiking or mountain biking!).

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

The firm has around twice as many free subscribers, 100 million, and a handful of disgruntled artists including one called Taylor Swift. Spotify announced the 500 million number on Twitter, which is handy. Thank you to our 50 million subscribers. #Spotify50 pic.twitter.com/eXkOV71bwu — Spotify (@Spotify) March 2, 2017 Amusingly, the Tweet kicked off a series of complaints from users about missing content. One angered and impassioned Hilary Duff fan insisted on full discography satisfaction, and Spotify conceded that it has gaps in its inventory. We include it here in all its glory. @imMoisesO We understand. We'd love to have all of her stuff available, but we have some info about content at https://t.co/YlV1IAXwsi /AC — SpotifyCares (@SpotifyCares) March 3, 2017 It has taken some short time for Spotify to hit the 50 million number, and it seems apposite to mention how many users Apple Music has, for example. Well, late last year it was reported that the service had reached 20 million paying subscribers, but that was last year and Apple launched well behind Spotify. Both services have challenges to face in so much as they charge people and that does not always go down well on the internet. In October the results of a YouGov and Zuora survey showed that just 10 per cent of UK residents, or 5.2 million people, are signed up to a paid music streaming service. Apple and Spotify have not got on in the traditional sense and there has been some App Store controversy between the pair over pricing and competition. Spotify had baulked at the fact that in app payments get a 30 per cent App store deduction, and Apple told it to pay up or shut up. "We understand that you want special treatment and protections from competition, but we simply will not do that because we firmly adhere to the principle of treating all developers fairly and equitably," said Apple general counsel Bruce Sewell in a letter to the firm. Spotify shot back. "This latest episode raises serious concerns under US and EU competition law," wrote general counsel Horacio Gutierrez. "It continues a troubling pattern of behaviour by Apple to exclude and diminish the competitiveness of Spotify on iOS and as a rival to Apple Music, particularly when seen against the backdrop of Apple's previous anti-competitive conduct aimed at Spotify. We cannot stand by as Apple uses the App Store approval process as a weapon to harm competitors." Don't get us started on Taylor Swift. µ Tweet   Facebook   Google plus       Send to   Topics Communications Money internet SPOTIFY cloud computing INQ Latest Twitch warns users of potential unauthorised account access Amazon-owned gaming service resets some user passwords Security 07 March 2017 Galaxy S8 and S8+ specs, release date and price Release date reportedly pushed back to 28 April Phones 06 March 2017 Microsoft's UUP shrinks Windows 10 updates by 65 per cent for Insiders Firm promises a 35 per cent reduction for retail users Cloud 06 March 2017 Hackers find 85 vulnerabilities in WD My Cloud range So you think your files aren't safe online, huh?

While you and I may choose Apple products because we like the UI, the ecosystem and the designs, a large chunk of the company’s customer base automatically buys Apple simply because it is seen as the most premium brand. They may not know the specific benefits of Apple products, but they are – to quote an old ad slogan for a lager – reassuringly expensive. If they cost more, they must be better. Indeed, in many markets, being seen with an iPhone, iPad or Mac bestows social status for that very reason, making them aspirational products. Apple cannot afford to dent that premium image by offering low-end products, but at the same time it needs to bring in new customers to maintain growth. So far, its approach to doing this has seemed to me to be smart. But offering a 32GB iPhone 6 as an entry level iPhone in 2017? That I’m not so sure about … Amazon Prime, free delivery, free videos Apple’s approach to entry-level purchases has historically been twin-pronged. In Macs, it used to offer an 11-inch MacBook Air as a relatively affordable entry to the Mac world. The 11-inch Air is no more, but the 13-inch model at $999 still hits a price-point many will pay. In iPhones and iPads, the company has traditionally kept an older model in the line-up as the base product. Given that Apple typically continues to offer support for the latest version of iOS for years after release, that’s been a reasonable approach – though older iPhones do sometimes struggle when running the latest updates, a point I’ll return to shortly. Last year, however, Apple took a somewhat different approach, by launching a brand new affordable model: the iPhone SE. That struck me as a much smarter bet than continuing to sell old models. For the first time, those on a more constrained budget could buy a brand new iPhone, with almost all the features of the flagship model. They wouldn’t need to compromise on performance or longevity. Plus people like me – who want the latest tech but prefer it in a more compact format – also got what we wanted. Sure, we lost 3D Touch and a barometer, but mostly it was a top-spec phone in more affordable and pocketable form. By all accounts, the iPhone SE has been a huge success. Back in September, it was still the third-best-selling smartphone even in the USA. And if rumors of a 128GB model this year are true, it seems that Apple knows that the SE isn’t just being bought by those wanting a cheap iPhone. Continuing to update the SE strikes me as the smart move here, allowing people to buy a brand-new, up-to-date iPhone at a lower price. Offering them instead a 2.5-year old model strikes me as less smart. Those phones are going to date faster, see performance degradation earlier, and in short deliver a less satisfactory user experience. And Apple is doing this at a time when Chinese brands are really getting their act together in the premium handset segment. Perhaps Apple has no choice. Maybe in China or Taiwan, size trumps performance, and the company has to offer at least a 4.7-inch model to compete. But I think it’s a dangerous approach even then. Budget buyers tend to hang onto their phones for longer, so Apple needs to think about how the iPhone 6 will be performing three, four or even five years from now. If those buyers find that the answer is ‘not well,’ the chances of them buying an iPhone next time around – when they perhaps have more money to spend – seem slim.

The best sleep tracking apps for Apple Watch and iPhone The top stories of the week on iDB LiberTV jailbreak for Apple TV 4 running tvOS 9.1-10.1 released   skip to main content skip to main menu     DigiTimes: iPhone 8 with in-screen fingerprint sensor entering mass production in September By Christian Zibreg, Mar 3, 2017 Tweet 6 Comments Rather than use one of the few readily available off-the-shelf fingerprint scanners that can be integrated into a smartphone display, Apple’s iPhone 8 will sport biometric fingerprint recognition via a custom-designed sensor, also embedded into the display. In addition, according to DigiTimes’ report Friday, the built-in fingerprint sensor inside iPhone 8 will replace Apple’s capacitive-based Touch ID fingerprint reader, as previously rumored. The handset is expected to enter mass production in September, claimed industry sources cited in the report. As per the report, iPhone 8 won’t use solutions like the Natural ID touch fingerprint sensor from Synaptics or Qualcomm’s Sense ID fingerprint scanning technology. Instead, the phone will sport Apple’s own algorithm based on its 2012 AuthenTec purchase that paved the way for Touch ID technology, as we know it today. That proprietary algorithm is said to rely on Privaris glass identification technology and biometric authentication systems such as ultrasound, according to industry sources. Prior rumors have indicated that rather than replace Touch ID completely, iPhone 8 should combine fingerprint scanning and advanced facial recognition into a more secure two-step biometric verification system. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube Currently, Touch ID uses both a capacitive sensor that scans the finger touching the Home button and ultrasonic waves that read sub-epidermal skin layers. The new sensor for iPhone 8 should be manufactured on TSMC’s twelve-inch line using its 65-nanometer process technology (TSMC has been churning out existing Touch ID sensors). “Production for the new OLED iPhone is unlikely to start until September due to the redesigned fingerprint ID solution,” said the report. As for the iterative LCD-based iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus updates, they’ll enter volume production in July. It’s unclear from the report if the new sensor is limited to the rumored function area (imagined on images top of post) located at the bottom of iPhone 8’s display. Apple recently patented a solution that turns the entire screen into a fingerprint reader to keep the user automatically authenticated as he or she interacts with the touchscreen. It’s too early to tell if that technology will make its way into iPhone 8 because Apple often patents inventions that never see the light of day. Be that as it may, in-screen fingerprint sensors are now a reality. LG’s Innotek division, for example, revealed the world’s first commercial in-screen fingerprint sensor back in May 2016. As shown on the image above, cutting a shallow furrow of 0.01 inches (0.3 mm) thick on the lower backside of the cover glass has allowed LG’s engineers to install their fingerprint sensor behind the display. Leaked images and early hands-on videos of Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S8 reveal a smartphone with a nearly full-screen front face and no physical Home button, fueling speculation that the next Galaxy flagship will have a fingerprint sensor that’s either embedded into the display or relocated to the back of the device.

Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Apple Inc. sued Qualcomm Inc. in a U.K. court, adding to lawsuits across the globe in a sprawling battle over patents and licensing fees between the iPhone developer and the largest designer of mobile phone chips. A court document cites a claim on patents and registered designs. Court records don’t give further details on the patents involved or the company’s arguments. While court records indicated the filing was made March 2, Apple said the U.K. case was initially lodged Jan. 23. Qualcomm said it hadn’t seen the complaint and couldn’t comment on it. Apple is separately suing Qualcomm in California, accusing it of monopolizing the market for chips for wireless devices and withholding $1 billion in retaliation for cooperating with South Korean antitrust authorities. At the heart of the dispute between Apple and Qualcomm is a push by phone makers, with support of some regulators, to reduce the patent royalties Qualcomm charges. Qualcomm gets the bulk of its revenue from selling chips, but more than half of its profit from a separate licensing business. In response to a request for comment on Thursday’s legal filing, Apple referred to a statement the company issued when it filed the U.S. suit on Jan. 20, saying Qualcomm has for many years "unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with." "Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties,” Apple said in the January statement. “Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined.” The lawsuits add to a U.S. Federal Trade Commission antitrust suit against Qualcomm and investigations by the European Union and Taiwan. South Korea fined the company 1.03 trillion won ($902 million) in December over practices it said were monopolistic. Exclusive insights on technology around the world.

A more typical patent case would be for company A to file” cases in some countries “and then company B counter sues” in others. The U.K. case is: Apple Retail UK v.

Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sia is one of the most popular artists on Spotify Spotify has become the first music streaming service to pass 50 million paying customers. It reached the milestone after adding 10 million subscribers in less than six months, staying ahead of its closest rival, Apple Music. But Spotify - which costs £10 a month in the UK - faces competition from deep-pocketed tech giants Amazon and Google, as well as Apple. It is also yet to reach a new licensing deal with record labels, analysts say. Mark Mulligan, a music industry analyst at Midia Research, said: "Spotify is the standout success for streaming music globally - no one else comes close in terms of paid subscribers." Apple Music had about 20 million subscribers by December 2016, 18 months after launching. Lagging some distance behind are Deezer and Amazon Music, although the latter is "making up ground fast", Mr Mulligan said. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Rapper Wiz Khalifa performs at the Spotify best new artist awards The problem for Spotify is that Apple and Amazon have millions to spend on streaming and neither need to make a profit from the service, Mr Mulligan added. Google has also invested in its streaming service, Google Play Music, by making more songs available offline and using artificial intelligence to draw up better playlists. 'Tortuous talks' Spotify, which may list its shares on the stock market next year, is yet to post a profit despite reporting 80% growth in revenues in its latest annual results. The company is also still dealing with "tortuous" licensing negotiations with music companies, Mr Mulligan said. About 80% of Spotify's cash flow is currently spent on licensing payments to record labels, he said. "If it's going to IPO [initial public offering], it's at least got to have a good story about that." Image copyright Apple Music Image caption Apple Music has seen huge growth since it launched in June 2015 Spotify has rejected suggestions that its subscriber growth is slowing. The firm increased its paying customer base by a quarter between September 2015 and the start of this month, down from 33% in the previous six months. Spotify chief executive Daniel Ek said that needed to be "put in context". "More than absolute Netflix subs[criber] growth, and relative growth higher too," he wrote on Twitter on Friday. Netflix added 9.2 million paying members in the final six months of 2016, a growth rate of 11.5%. As Spotify expands, it will become more difficult to keep the growth rate up, but for now it is still enlarging the market and outpacing many of its rivals. "Spotify has a good shot at another really good year, but after that, growth might be harder," Mr Mulligan said.

Launched in 2008, Spotify had 40 million paid subscribers in September and the company tweeted the 50 million figure on Thursday, the same day messaging app company Snap Inc pulled off its massive share sale that bodes well for other technology companies considering a flotation. Apple, which launched its music service less than two years ago, had about 20 million subscribers in December and its entry looks to have done little to slow the rapid growth of its older Swedish-based rival. Spotify, which has yet to show a profit as it spends to grow internationally, is now looking at a possible stock market listing in the United States, online news portal TechCrunch said last month. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday on when it might seek a listing. But a partner at a leading investor in Spotify, venture capital firm Northzone, said late last year the company could start to become profitable as early as 2017 after years of focusing squarely on "growth, growth, growth". Spotify is the most highly valued venture backed start-up in Europe and according to media reports is considering a listing on Nasdaq and potentially a dual listing on the Nasdaq exchange in Stockholm, where the company is headquartered. It was last valued at $8.53 billion, according to venture capital market research firm CB Insights. That valuation alone would make a flotation Europe's biggest technology start-up listing since the market launch of German e-commerce investor Rocket Internet in 2014. While still loss-making, Spotify has posted rapid subscriber growth since it was created a decade ago by Swedish founders Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. Following its announcement on Thursday that it had reached 50 million paid subscribers, Ek made a point of retweeting a comment from Wall Street media analyst Rick Greenfield which pointed to how Spotify was adding subscribers at an increasingly rapid rate. The Stockholm-based company also announced a major expansion in New York last month. One of Europe's most highly valued venture-backed start-ups, Spotify will move its New York office to the World Trade Center from the Midtown area of Manhattan, adding more than 1,000 new jobs. In 2016 Americans used on-demand streaming platforms, such as Spotify, to listen to 431 billion music tracks, Nielsen said in its U.S. year-end report.

Apple Watch | 02 Mar 2017 | Print  | Comment (8) New Apple Watch Stand Looks Like the 128K Mac by Julio Ojeda-Zapata I hadn’t planned to write about Elago’s W3 Stand, an Apple Watch charging stand in the shape of a classic 128K Macintosh. I mean, what is there to say? “It’s an Apple Watch charging stand in the shape of a classic 128K Macintosh.” The end. But I realized Elago had concocted something brilliant when a buddy last week bestowed the product upon me — a thoughtful gesture after a recent death in my family — and other friends around a taproom table erupted with delight and a bit of envy. I was even more surprised later that day when my wife spotted the accessory on my desk and went gaga over it. You must understand a couple of things about my wife: She does not own an Apple Watch, has no interest in ever getting one, and has never been steeped in Apple lore. She adores her MacBook Air, but only in a utilitarian sense. Yet, hovering and cooing over the W3, she told me she wanted one – just because. So did I when I first heard about it. After all, I own a nonfunctional 128K Mac, a decorative prop that has a place of honor in my home office right near my Power Mac G4 Cube. The Elago W3 fits right in at Julio Geek Central. I have the $14.99 tan-colored model that approximates the color of the original Mac. Elago also sells a $15.99 dark-gray version, which is a strange color choice in the Mac sense, but matches darker-colored watches and straps. The stand is a simple yet substantial little thing made of soft, sturdy rubber. It’s a mini-Mac, but with a vertical slot for the Apple Watch to slide in. Within the stand, there’s a circular cutout for Apple’s watch charging pad. The W3’s cable threads downward through the accessory and out the back, mimicking the look of the classic Mac’s power cable. The stand’s screen is just a cutout, so when the Apple Watch drops into place, its face becomes the actual, functional “Mac” display. The Apple Watch sits on its side, which activates Nightstand mode and transforms the W3 into a nifty bedside clock with a classic-Mac look and feel. It even has details such as a faux floppy-disk slot, complete with a tiny paperclip-eject hole, but no Apple logo that might attract legal attention. I’m using the Elago in the bedroom with a first-generation Apple Watch (my Series 2 watch charges up in my home office on the far-more-utilitarian Griffin WatchStand Powered Charging Station that also charges my iPhone). I put the original Apple Watch on my night table in Airplane mode to keep activity to a minimum and left it there as a permanent fixture. In fact, I am experimenting with using the Apple Watch strapless to heighten the classic-Mac effect: But I suspect the mini-Mac clock will quietly migrate to my wife’s side of the bed before long. That’s fine, anything to foster marital bliss. I hope whomever came up with this cute product at Elago got a bonus. And I wonder if sequels might be in the works — a Bondi Blue iMac charging stand, perhaps?   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Reply Michelle Steiner  2017-03-02 22:14 I've had one for a few months.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Apple’s iPhone 8 will do the unthinkable Image Source: Moe Slah, ConceptsiPhone Zach Epstein @zacharye February 28th, 2017 at 10:58 AM Share Tweet There are so many things that come to mind when you think of Apple as a company. It was a pioneer in the personal computing space, the iPod was a total game-changer, it reinvented smartphones in 2007 with the original iPhone, and its laptops and tablets remain market leaders to this day. A number of common threads are woven through all of those achievements, and some are more appreciated than others by Apple fans around the world. One of Apple’s less appreciated characteristics is the company’s “courage.” The company has never been afraid to make design decisions that fly in the face of convention and ruffle feathers in the process. This manifested itself most recently in Apple’s decision to nix the standard 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which caused quite a bit of commotion ahead of the most recent iPhones’ debut last September. Now, however, a new reliable report suggests that Apple will walk back one of its recent courageous decisions with the iPhone 8. Don't Miss: WSJ says iPhone 8 will have a curved display, but I’m not buying it Early Tuesday morning, The Wall Street Journal issued a report that seemingly confirms one of the most widely reported rumors surrounding Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8. According to the paper, Apple will dump LCD display panels in its new flagship iPhone and instead utilize a flexible OLED display. While the headline of the report states conclusively that the iPhone 8 will feature a “curved display,” I personally don’t believe the speculation flying around right now is accurate, and I wrote about why earlier this morning. Moving beyond the iPhone 8’s display, there was another tidbit in the report that is, quite frankly, shocking if true. After switching from the company’s proprietary 30-pin connector to the newer Lightning connector less than five years ago beginning with the iPhone 5, the Journal says Apple is planning to dump the Lightning port on its new iPhone 8 and adopt the industry standard USB Type-C port instead. Woh. The move would obviously make plenty of sense. Apple now uses USB-C ports on its newer laptops for charging and other connectivity, and a USB-C port’s internal components are just as compact as the Lightning port. Apple could use USB-C in phones and tablets without having to worry about the devices being any thicker, and it would then have the same type of connector on its Mac and iOS devices. It just seems so odd considering the company’s history that Apple would actually adopt an industry standard. It’s almost unthinkable. But the WSJ has been a reliable source of Apple leaks in the past, and it would be fantastic to see the company finally adopt an industry standard so that accessories work across Apple devices and across other devices as well.

Shipments for the entire year grew 25% as new vendors entered the market and previous champions refreshed their product lineups.   "Like any technology market, the wearables market is changing," noted Ramon Llamas, research manager for IDC's Wearables team. "Basic wearables started out as single-purpose devices tracking footsteps and are morphing into multi-purpose wearable devices, fusing together multiple health and fitness capabilities and smartphone notifications. It's enough to blur the lines against most smart wearables, to the point where first generation smartwatches are no better than most fitness trackers.   "Meanwhile, smart wearables are also evolving," Llamas continued. "Health and fitness remains a major focus, but once these devices become connected to a cellular network, expect unique applications and communications capabilities to become available. This will also solve another key issue: freeing the device from the smartphone, creating a standalone experience."   Liamas added that "Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2 proved to be a magnificent success for the company as it was the company's best quarter ever in the wearables market. The lower entry price point and the inclusion of GPS on the Series 2 along with a completely revamped user interface have helped the company grow its presence. Apple is one of the few companies that has been able to quickly refocus its watch to gain traction in the consumer market and has also been leading the charge on introducing the smartwatch category to the commercial segment."   Apple's CEO told analysts during their financial conference call on January 31 that "It was also our best quarter ever for Apple Watch. Both units and revenues with holiday demand so strong that we couldn't make enough. Apple Watch is the bestselling smartwatch in the world and also the most loved with higher customer satisfaction in its category by a wide margin.   Apple Watch is the ultimate device for a healthy life and it's the gold standard for smartwatches. We couldn't be more excited about Apple Watch."   The IDC blurs the line between cheap basic wearables and Apple's upscale Apple Watch. In such a mixed report it's all about volume and not value or profitability. In the 'volume game' Fitbit sold 6.5 million units to take first place. Apple, even at substantially higher prices, was still able to capture third place with shipments of 4.6 million. Apple doesn't officially publish the sales/unit volume for Apple Watch as it does iPhones, iPads and Macs and seen in the Unaudited Summary Data for Q1 2017 (Q4 2016 calendar).     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Despite Kodi being an extremely popular media player app, it is imperative to install it via sideload method using Xcode, as it does not support traditional installation methods. The latest version of Kodi (Kodi 17) is compatible with the fourth-generation Apple TV aka Apple TV 4, which is running tvOS 9.0 or above. However, it is recommended to try installing it on the latest version of tvOS aka tvOS 10 for maximum compatibility. Users, who are running tvOS 9.1 or upwards on their Apple TV, will have to install Xcode 7.2 or higher on the Mac. On the contrary, you need at least tvOS 9.0 in order to install Xcode 7.1. Other versions of Xcode are recommended for this procedure. You will also need a USB-C to USB-A cable in order to connect your Apple TV 4 to your Mac computer via USB. Downloads Required Xcode for Apple TV 4 via Mac App Store iOS App Signer utility for Mac Kodi deb file for tvOS (latest version) Note: You can sideload apps using free versions of Apple Developer accounts, which will last for just one week. You will need to re-sign and re-sideload the app in order to continue using it after the expiry date. However, a full developer account ($99) will let you sign and sideload any app for up to one year. Steps to install or sideload Kodi on Apple TV 4 without jailbreaking Step 1: Connect your fourth-gen Apple TV to your Mac with USB-C to USB-A cable. Step 2: Open the Xcode app on your Mac and choose 'Create a new Xcode project' from the main Xcode screen. Now select tvOS > Application in the left menu and then choose Single View Application, and finally hit Next. Step 3: Type in the Product Name and Organisation Name of your choice and the bundle identifier field should auto-populate, once you have defined Organisation Identifier. For instance, you can enter "com.injen" as your Organisation Identifier field and the Bundle Identifier will now become "com.injen.kodipro" wherein kodirpro will be your product name. Step 4: After you have filled all the necessary fields, just hit Next to continue and then save the project to a desirable location like your computer's desktop. Step 5: On the main Xcode window below the Identity sub-section, you will notice an error message saying, "No matching provisioning profiles found." Just hit the Fix Issue button below the warning message and the issue will be resolved. Step 6: Now sign in to Xcode app using your Apple ID and password that's registered to your developer account. Now click the Add button once you have filled up your login credentials. If prompted, just select Apple ID from the drop-down box and click the Choose button to continue. Xcode will now process the data and create a provisioning profile. Step 7: Then choose Apple TV from the ensuing pop-up window and then launch the iOS App Signer app. Step 8: Once the App Signer app is open, choose an appropriate signing certificate. Then select the name of the project you created earlier using Xcode from the drop-down menu in the app. You can now browse and add the Kodi deb file. Step 9: App Display Name field can be left blank, if you do not wish to rename the app on tvOS Home screen. Step 10: Hit the Start button and the iOS App Signer will compress all necessary files together and generate an IPA file once the packaging process completes. Step 11: Return to Xcode main menu and then choose Devices option from the ensuing Window menu. Now select the connected Apple TV device from the left-hand section and hit the "+" button within the main interface under the Installed Apps heading. Step 12: Browse and select the Kodi IPA file which was created in Step 10, by using the iOS App Signer from Step 10. That's it. The package is now successfully installed on your Apple TV 4 and the Kodi app icon should appear on the home screen.

Clearly an OS that isn’t stable isn’t very useful even if it were packed with the latest features and cutting edge technology, and unfortunately this is something that Apple seems to be lacking according to a recent study. According to the latest Blancco’s State of Mobile Device Performance and Health report (via Cult of Mac), they have found that Apple’s iPhones seem to be increasing in their failure rates, while the opposite seems to be true of Google’s Android platform. According to the study, Apple’s failure rates in Q4 2016 was found to be at 62%, versus the same quarter the previous year where it was at a very acceptable and somewhat impressive 15%. It turns out that this is in part contributed by the likes of apps such as Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat, which are the three most used social media apps that also happen to be some of the most unreliable apps around and faced frequent crashes. Blancco is basing this data collected from millions of iOS devices that underwent diagnostics testing. As for Android, Google appears to be improving on the platform as it was found that it went from 85% in Q4 2015, to 44% in Q1 2016, and 35% in Q2 2016. Of course your mileage may vary but if you are thinking of switching platforms, these numbers might be of interest to you. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about iPhone.

This model is technically ‘new’ as Apple never sold the iPhone 6 in a 32 GB SKU before; it debuted with 16/64/128 GB options. The 32 GB iPhone 6 is going on sale at select carriers in Asia as a low-end model; the device is not sold by Apple retail. The device is launching on Taiwan Mobile on March 10 and has been quietly available in China since late February … Try Amazon Music Free Apple is not selling the 32 GB iPhone 6, which is only offered in a gold casing, at retail stores or on its website. It continues to sell the iPhone SE as its low-end option which has better internal components than the iPhone 6, but does not have a larger screen. Whilst Apple is keeping quiet, Taiwan Mobile is pushing the ‘new’ iPhone as a special limited-edition promotion. It is advertising it as the cheapest iPhone ever to be offered on its network and is already accepting pre-orders. The carrier is selling the device for ‘free’ with a NT$1,399/month contract plan (about $45 USD) that lasts for 30 months. To compare, the iPhone 6 can be bought unlocked for between $300-$400 today in the United States. Of course, it’s impossible to compare exactly as the 32 GB storage option has never been available domestically. It isn’t clear if the 32 GB iPhone 6 will also be available to buy on other carriers in Taiwan or if it really is exclusive to Taiwan Mobile. It appears to be on sale at just one online carrier in China. Given how Apple itself has not announced this, it seems very unlikely that the phone will be made available in developed countries like the United States. With the only color option being gold, it also implies a targeted launch for price-conscious Asian consumers.

Over the last three years, Apple's iPads and Mac notebooks - which accounted for about half of the mobile devices shipped to schools in the United States in 2013 - have steadily lost ground to Chromebooks, inexpensive laptops that run on Google's Chrome operating system and are produced by Samsung, Acer and other computer makers. Mobile devices that run on Apple's iOS and MacOS operating systems have now reached a new low, falling to third place behind both Google-powered laptops and Microsoft Windows devices, according to a report released on Thursday by Futuresource Consulting, a research company. That's got to sting. Out of the many reasons why ChromeBooks are way more successful than iPads in classrooms - they are cheaper, easier to manage, and so on - this is the one you're going to need to remember: Then there is the keyboard issue. While school administrators generally like the iPad’s touch screens for younger elementary school students, some said older students often needed laptops with built-in physical keyboards for writing and taking state assessment tests. My oh my, I wonder what Apple could do to remedy this.

The report describes the component as a ‘built-in’ sensor which very much implies that it is integrated into the screen. Rather than use Synaptic or Qualcomm technology, Apple will reportedly be building its own system using Authentec algorithms and Privaris glass tech. Strangely, the report also says that the iPhone 8 will not go into mass production until September … Try Amazon Music Free Usually, flagship iPhone models need months of leeway in production in order to accommodate the mass demand the devices bring; Apple usually sells 15 million new iPhones in the opening weekend of sales alone. A September date for mass production would therefore imply that the iPhone 8 might not go on sale until October or later; Digitimes explains that the Apple-custom fingerprint system is more complicated to manufacture. The ‘built-in’ component will apparently use biometric technologies such as ultrasound to work, rather than the capacitive sensor seen with Touch ID. It would likely be positioned in the ‘function area’ part of the screen, in roughly the same location as where a Touch ID button would go — if the space was not taken up by an OLED screen. The September mass production date should be taken with some skepticism. The last time Apple launched an iPhone in October was the iPhone 4s, so it would mean Apple falling out of its historical pattern significantly. Although the publication has a better hit rate with supply-chain related stories, Digitimes track record is nonetheless somewhat sketchy. There is a mitigating factor however. Apple is pretty much confirmed to be launching three new iPhone devices this year. The one that is getting the prime attention is the OLED iPhone, which will be a major radical redesign of the device with a 5.8 inch display, almost no bezels, and be about the same physical size as an iPhone 7. According to many reports, the other two devices are modest upgrades to the existing  iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, looking almost identical from the outside with several internal component upgrades, potentially including wireless charging functionality. Digitimes says these devices will go into mass production in July, which is about when we would normally expect a new iPhone to ramp in the supply chain for a September launch. Therefore, the implication is the iPhone 8 may not be available alongside the ‘iPhone 7s’ at first. Instead, Apple could announce all three at an event in September with availability for the OLED iPhone delayed slightly. The launch of the two iterative models would take up most of the sales slack in the meantime. With a rumoured $1000 price tag, Apple could also believe that initial demand for the iPhone 8 will be lower than normal — although this seems unlikely as so many people are interested in purchasing a new iPhone that ‘looks different’. With a fingerprint sensor integrated into the screen, the OLED iPhone is certainly living up to the ‘radically new’ hype. Are you excited for the new device? Let us know in the comments.

Latest: Analysts are arguing about whether Apple will tweak the Lightning port to add fast-charging capabilities, or replace the Lightning port with USB-C, while multiple sources predict that the iPhone 8 will miss its expected September launch by David Price | 06 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents Release date Design New features Specs UK price Leaked images and videos When will the new iPhone 8 be released in the UK, and how different will it be from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus? (Or will the next generation of Apple smartphones be called the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus?) And what tech specs and new features should we expect from Apple's new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus? The iPhone 8 rumour mill is heating up especially as 2017 is the 10th anniversary of the launch of the iPhone and as a result there are high hopes for the next model. Apple unveiled the new iPhone 7 alongside its bigger sibling the iPhone 7 Plus during a special event in September 2016, so we're now looking ahead to the next generation. In this article, we round up all the rumours about the iPhone 8: the iPhone 8's UK release date (and on sale date), iPhone 8 UK price, iPhone 8 specs and new features. There's a lot to cover, so let's get started. (We also look at the rumours surrounding the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus here.) For advice on the current iPhone range, read our iPhone buying guide and best cheap iPhone deals UK. Or, if you'd like to look even further into the future (covering tech developments that come perilously close to the realms of science-fiction), read iPhone 9 and beyond: From graphene to motion charging.

Recent updates Two separate sources suggest that the iPhone 8 launch may arrive later than September, in what would be a huge surprise The iPhone 8 will feature a curved OLED screen like the Samsung Galaxy Edge, apparently (but another researcher has contradicted this) Rumours that Lightning port will be replaced by USB-C (while others predict fast-charging via the existing Lightning port) Ming Chi Kuo predicts that the iPhone 8's screen will have a function area for virtual buttons, like the MacBook Pro's Touch Bar... ...as well as a monstrous screen pixel density of 521 pixels per inch, and a major increase in battery capacity The iPhone 8's lowest storage option will be 64GB (with 256GB as the alternative) Wireless charging rumours spread as Apple joins Wireless Power Consortium... ...but analysts predict wireless charging will require a separate accessory Possibility that there will be no physical buttons at all iPhone 8 expected to break thousand-dollar barrier for first time New predictions that Touch ID will be built into the iPhone 8's display and will be joined by a new security feature: facial recognition. Predictions that late 2017 will see the launch of an 'iPhone X'. iPhone 8 release date rumours: Release date The iPhone 8 is likely to be released in September 2017, but there are whispers of a delay. Before we think about new features you should expect in the iPhones of the future, let's talk about the likely release date schedule. Apple's latest batch of smartphones, the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, were released in the autumn of 2016. (Read more: iPhone 7 review and iPhone 7 Plus review.) Apple always releases new iPhones in September, and we assume this year will be the same. iPhone 8 release date rumours: Delays Logic and history both point to September, then, but multiple sources are suggesting that Apple may miss its usual date with smartphone destiny. Digitimes has predicted that "production for the new OLED iPhone is unlikely to start until September due to the redesigned fingerprint ID solution", and KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has stated that there will not be time to implement the expected new 3D camera system unless Apple pushes back the launch date of the new iPhones: "Unless production of the OLED iPhone (expected to begin in September) gets pushed back, there is virtually no time to make changes to the 3D camera system." Both via Business Insider. It would be a major surprise if September didn't include an iPhone launch event, but we'll keep our ears open for further whispers suggesting a delay. iPhone 8 release date rumours: Future release schedules After autumn 2017 it gets harder to predict. Based on the past few years of Apple launches, the generation after that logically ought to be an S update: the iPhone 7s and the iPhone 7s Plus, launched together in autumn 2017 (with the potential of an iPhone SE 2 in spring of 2017, or moved back to launch with them in the autumn). The iPhone 8 - as well as the iPhone 8 Plus - would then finally be unveiled in September 2018. Sept 2016: iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Mar 2017: iPhone SE 2 Sept 2017: iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus Mar 2018: iPhone SE 3 Sept 2018: iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus But it may not be that simple. And there are widespread rumours that Apple is going to miss out the iPhone 7s generation - or fold it in with the iPhone 8 launch, in autumn 2017. iPhone 8 release date rumours: The end of the iPhone 'S' convention It's possible that Apple won't continue the S generation strategy for much longer. Many of us have pointed out that this 'tick-tock' system is a risky policy, tacitly acknowledging that iPhone generations alternate between major and minor updates - to be especially harsh, you could say worthwhile and superfluous updates. When the average user hears that the new iPhone hasn't even been considered worthy of a full version number upgrade, they'll be put off from spending money on the new offering. Not to mention that an S update is more confusing for buyers: iPhone 6 followed by iPhone 7 would have been clear and easy to understand; but it's less obvious which out of the iPhone 6, 6s, 6 Plus and 6s Plus is the more advanced model. On this principle, therefore, we could see the iPhone 7 in autumn 2016 and the iPhone 8 the year after. At this point, nobody knows - but as soon as we hear more, we'll update this article. And in October 2016 a little extra weight was added to the 'iPhone 8 in 2017' theory. According to Business Insider, an Apple employee in Israel who solders components spoke to them about the next iPhone and referred to it as the iPhone 8 "unprompted in our conversation". The sourced added that the iPhone 8 would be "different" from the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7, and have a better camera - neither of which are particularly out-there predictions. Some pundits predicted that the iPhone 7 would sell comparatively poorly because of its perceived lack of major new features and design changes. But, they said, everything would change in 2017, when the iPhone 8 blows everyone away with a wide and radical range of enhancements. Pundits are increasingly predicting a big iPhone launch in 2017. Making predictions about the upcoming performance of Apple stock, analysts at Credit Suisse have forecast that the iPhone 8, to be released on the iPhone's 10-year anniversary in 2017 (skipping the 'S' generation in recognition of its major updates) will feature "significant innovations" such as a full-glass OLED screen, new and upgraded haptic feedback features, wireless charging and numerous major specs improvements including the camera and processor. Kulbinder Garcha, one of the company's analysts, was sufficiently confident about the iPhone 8's performance to predict sales of 250 million units in fiscal 2018 (despite launching in the calendar year 2017, the iPhone 8's sales will be reported in 2018), compared to 215 million in 2017. Garcha may be confident, but we're not so sure. Going three years between substantive updates to what remains by far its most profitable line in order to make a big launch match a big anniversary feels like a strange and risky strategy for Apple (we don't subscribe to Nikkei's theory that the company will follow a three-year cycle from now on), and with the Android sector pushing boundaries in a lot of ways this would inevitably result in accusations of stagnation - even more so than now. Read next: Best place to buy an iPhone in the UK But what happens after the blockbusting launch of the iPhone 8 (or Tenth Anniversary iPhone)? It might not get pretty, if some researchers are to be believed. One analyst, Andrew Uerkwitz, has predicted that the 2017 iPhone refresh will be the company's "last growth hurrah", before spiralling into a "decade-long malaise" as the market turns increasingly to lower-cost and second-hand phones. "The risks to the company have never been greater," Uerkwitz said to MarketWatch. Monness Crespi Hardt analyst James Cakmak echoed Uerkwitz's sentiments. "Apple won't have it easy again for a while, if ever," he said. 'iPhone 8 production ahead of schedule' According to BlueFin Research Partners, the production of the iPhone 8 is ramping up earlier than expected. "The most intriguing data points that we have uncovered suggests that AAPL is ramping the next generation iPhones earlier than historical norms," write analysts John Donovan and Steve Mullane, "although we have no indication that there has been any change in release plans for the iPhone 8/X. "Our present reads suggest a 300 percent increase in iPhone 8/X builds in the June quarter, now sitting at 9M... In the past, builds of upcoming releases began in earnest early in the September quarter, so this is a departure from AAPL's normal build cadence." As the analysts point out, this may not indicate an earlier release date for the iPhone 8. 'iPhone X' Here's a leftfield prediction: Apple may not call its late-2017 smartphone the iPhone 7s or the iPhone 8, but the iPhone X. Timothy Arcuri, an analyst at Cowen and Company, has sent out a research note to clients predicting among other things that the late-2017 iPhone update will be branded as iPhone X - X in this case evidently signifying the Roman numeral for 10, since the iPhone is celebrating its 10th birthday in 2017. With iPhone version numbers getting alarmingly high, it would make sense for Apple to switch to a different branding convention at some point - distracting customers, one might say, from quite how many of these things Apple has cranked out without fundamentally changing what it's offering. But to rebrand its biggest seller would still be a bold, bold move. We'll count this as unlikely until we hear evidence to back it up, even though it's not the worst idea in the world. Macworld poll: What do you think Apple will call its next iPhone? iPhone 8 release date rumours: Can Donald Trump persuade Apple to build iPhones in the US? Donald Trump spent much of his recent presidential campaign complaining about Apple and its offshore manufacturing operations, and promising he would make the company build its iPhones in the US. (The only major Apple product currently made on American shores is the Mac Pro.) Now, as President-Elect Trump, he's trying to make his promises a reality. Speaking to the New York Times, Trump claimed to have spoken on the phone with Tim Cook - implying, indeed, that Cook initiated the call - and reached what sounds like a degree of understanding you might not expect from two men with such different temperaments and political leanings. "I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.' He said, 'I understand that.'" Read next: Where are Apple products made? Apple has its reasons for building its smartphones in Asia, of course: labour costs are lower and there is, according to Cook, a shortage of relevant skills in the US. Moving manufacturing to America would lose Apple a lot of money. But Trump thinks he can sweeten the deal with tax cuts and changes to regulations. "I said: 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.' But we're going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether you're liberal or conservative, I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. It's gotten to be a free-for-all. And companies can't, they can't even start up, they can't expand, they're choking." What Trump did not claim - and past behaviour suggests he'd be singing it from the rooftops - is that Cook actually agreed to any of this, even in principle. He may understand where Trump is coming from, and Trump may have given him the hard sell, but it would be a huge step if Apple actually does move any kind of significant proportion of its device manufacture to the US. Since then, Trump has stated in an interview with Axios that Tim Cook has his "eyes open" to the idea of building iPhones in the US, and that he "really believes [Cook] loves this country and I think he'd like to do something major here", whatever that means. These statements read less like an update on the progress of negotiations and more like a public blackmail campaign, but it might just work. Trump has been underestimated before. Foxconn's US expansion There was another twist in this tale when it emerged on 7 December that iPhone manufacturer Foxconn is indeed pondering an expansion of its (currently relatively small-scale) US operations, in a move that is apparently expected to involve $7bn of investment and create 50,000 jobs. Strangely, nobody involved made much of a deal about this. But eagle-eyed journalists spotted that paperwork being shown off to publicise SoftBank's US investment deal (which Donald Trump has made a huge song and dance about) also featured Foxconn's logo, and appeared to suggest that the second figure in each pair of numbers referred to that company. (Picture credit: CNBC) Foxconn has since confirmed that it is in talks about expanding its US operations, although it has declined to comment on the figures given. "While the scope of the potential investment has not been determined, we will announce the details of any plans following the completion of direct discussions between our leadership and the relevant US officials," the firm said in a statement, according to Reuters. Other Apple products made in the US Apple does build some products in the US, if rarely, and only in the cases of far lower-volume products than the iPhone. It has made a lot out of its US Mac Pro assembly, for instance, but this is a niche product made in comparatively low numbers. In January 2017 - a couple of weeks ahead of Trump's inauguration - Apple applied to expand the use of a manufacturing facility it owns in Mesa, Arizona. Rather than iPhones or even recognisable consumer products, it was widely reported that Apple would be building data server cabinets for its own internal use, but the firm has since denied this, claiming it will only be using the facility as a hub for receiving, configuring and distributing servers rather than manufacturing any new product. Now, what new features and tech developments can we expect in the next few generations of Apple smartphone? iPhone 8 release date rumours UK | iPhone 8 specs: Design iPhones are that lethal combination of expensive and fragile that results in so much consumer heartache. The result is that each iPhone owner has to make their own deal with the devil: either wrapping it in a robust case, thereby masking the handsome design that they paid all that money for in the first place, or risk pavement damage every time they take the thing out of a pocket. But design changes may mean this is not the case in the future. Here are the design changes we expect in the iPhone 8. Read next: How to repair a cracked iPhone screen iPhone 8 design: OLED, curved display Wall Street Journal sources claim that the iPhone 8 will have a flexible curved display like the one featured on Samsung's Galaxy S6 Edge. The report is behind a paywall but can be read here. This model of the iPhone will apparently cost $1000 and will be a premium option, alongside the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. The OLED screens will be supplied by Samsung initially, according to the WSJ report. Apparently these screens will also be brighter and show colours better. A Business Korea report claims that Apple intends to move the line up to OLED displays as it would offer better colour saturation, accuracy, and brightness. Apparently this new phone won't arrive until 2018, though. This isn't the first report in the Wall Street Journal to claim that a curved screen iPhone could be in the works. Last November a similar report was published here, claiming that Apple's Asia suppliers had been asked to increase output of thinner organic light-emitting displays for the company. Later in February 2017, however, Research firm TrendForce contradicted this prediction. "Apple will not implement the curved display design for the high-end iPhone," said the firm, "because there are issues with the 3D glass in terms of production yield and drop test results." iPhone 8 design: USB-C The WSJ report cited above also claims that the new iPhone 8 will drop the Lightning port in favour of USB Type-C. This would be a huge call, so soon after Apple removed the headphone port on the principle that the Lightning port was a better alternative. And there are other reasons to be sceptical: Apple is rarely swayed by demands for universal rather than proprietary ports, and everybody yelled last time the company switched out the 30-pin connector in favour of Lightning - a lot of accessory makers (and accessory owners) would be sorely inconvenienced. We are not entirely convinced, to say the least. And neither is Ming Chi Kuo, who thinks the iPhone 8 will fast-charge through the Lightning port rather than bringing in USB-C. He predicts that Apple will tweak the underlying power management technology, adding "Type-C Power Delivery", rather than replacing the Lightning port altogether. iPhone 8 design: 10th-anniversary redesign will be 'a big f**king deal' The year 2017 (June the 29th, to be precise) marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and some suggest that Apple will want to come up with a real blockbuster of a redesign to celebrate. Noted tech blogger Robert Scoble has posted an exhaustive list of predictions for next year's iPhone, and he expects big things. "It's the 10th anniversary of the iPhone," he writes. "It's the first product introduction in Apple's new amazing headquarters. It's a big f**king deal and will change this industry deeply." (Those are Scoble's asterisks.) Design-wise, he expects that the iPhone 8 "will be, I am told, a clear piece of glass (er, Gorilla Glass sandwich with other polycarbonates for being pretty shatter resistant if dropped) with a next-generation OLED screen (I have several sources confirming this). You pop it into a headset which has eye sensors on it, which enables the next iPhone to have a higher apparent frame rate and polygon count than a PC with a Nvidia 1080 card in it." He also says to expect "battery and antennas to be hidden around the edges of the screen, which explains how Apple will fit in some of the pieces even while most of the chips that make up a phone are in a pack/strip at the bottom of the phone". But the range of features Scoble is expecting is overwhelming. You really need to read the post for yourself. Scoble isn't the only one predicting a big redesign for 2017. French site nowhereelse.fr has shared a leaked image (below), which appears to showcase the exact dimensions of the iPhone 7. These dimensions are identical to the ones found on the iPhone 6s, measuring 67.12mm wide and 138.3mm tall. Through this image, it would appear that there also won't be any change to the camera (there have been rumours about a dual camera system as you'll discover later in this article). The image has the OnLeaks stamp on it, and OnLeaks has been reliable with Apple leaks in the past. iPhone 8 design: Glass front and back, with stainless steel option 9to5Mac has got hold of a report from the ever-quotable and usually reliable Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities - a report that predicts, based on the popularity of the scratch-prone Jet Black iPhone 7, that the iPhone 8 will have a (more scratch-resistant) glass front and back. "If Apple does follow through with what KGI suggests, an all glass design could extend the glossy finish to all colours of the iPhone lineup depending on how Apple handles the design," 9to5mac says. DigiTimes (a Chinese-language website), predicts that the chassis of the iPhone 8 will be made of stainless steel and supplied by Jabil rather than the more usual manufacturing partner Foxconn, citing anonymous sources in the Asian /supply chain. The site later clarified that it expects the iPhone 8 to be made of glass and steel, but that the iPhone 7s may still have a body made of aluminium alloy. This would be something of a surprise, given Apple's clear recent preference for aluminium; the iPhone 4s had steel bands around a glass body, but it's been all aluminium ever since. And we're given to understand that the engineering method will be different this time: whereas the iPhone 4s was milled, the iPhone 7 metalwork will be forged, a technique that offers greater strength. iPhone 8 design: New colour options There have been various rumours about new colour finishes, focusing on two possibilities: dark blue, and red. According to a report from Macotakara, the iPhone 7 will come in Silver, Gold, Rose Gold and a new Deep Blue. This seems entirely possible. Samsung offers blue flagship phones that seem to be among the more popular options, so Apple might decide to follow Samsung's lead. Following the reports from Mac Otakara, designer Martin Hajek published some gorgeous concept images of a Deep Blue iPhone. See more over on Martin's website. (Shortly after the Deep Blue rumours emerged, a second colour rumour came to light on the same blog. Macotakara now said that Space Black would be introduced instead of Deep Blue to replace the current Space Grey option. And while the names were different - black and Jet Black, in fact - Apple did indeed replace Space Grey with black colour options. Does this leave Deep Blue for the next generation?) More recently, Macotakara has been reporting a new colour rumour, predicting that the 2017 iPhones will be available in red. iPhone 8 design: Apple Watch-style Digital Crown Some of the more out-there concept illustrators have considered the idea of Apple giving the iPhone 7 a rotating control, like the Digital Crown on the Apple Watch. But the rest of us thought it was a crazy idea. But it might just be so crazy that it actually happens, if a new Apple patent is anything to go by. The patent, spotted like so many of these things by Patently Apple, is illustrated with images of an iPad but is described in sufficiently broad terms that it could easily apply to an iPhone too. The patent suggests that the rotating control could to adjust volume, resize text and various other functions, and all of this makes a certain sense; but does anyone honestly think it's something Apple would really do with its elegant clean iPhone? Our strong suspicion is that this is one of those patents Apple and other tech companies periodically take out in order to mislead rivals and cover moonshot concepts that are extremely unlikely to lead anywhere. iPhone 8 design: No more bezels above and below screen Apple has been awarded a patent that covers the embedding of light sensors within the layers of a display, leading to speculation that the firm intends to remove the bezels from its next iPhone. Indeed, the patent - US Patent 9,466,653 - specifically describes the tiresome current necessity for bezels in the background section: "In a typical device, a light sensor is laterally displaced from an active display region of the display along a front face of the device. Additional space is therefore provided in common devices at the top, bottom, or side of the active display area to accommodate the light sensor." Instead, the patent proposes to integrate the sensor within the display: "The light sensor is a display-integrated light sensor that is integrated into the layers of the display. The light sensor may [be] interposed between the cover layer and another layer of the display such as the touch-sensitive layer, the light-generating layers, or another display layer." This is Fig. 11 of the patent's illustrations, showing "a display-integrated light sensor attached to a thin-film transistor layer of a bottom emission organic light-emitting diode display". In January 2017 yet another patent was added to the pile of evidence that Apple plans to give the iPhone 8 an edge-to-edge screen. Patent 9,543,364, granted on 10 January, covers "Electronic devices having displays with openings" and various means by which Apple would be able to hide cameras, sensors and controls behind the screen and still allow the user to access them. This in turn would allow Apple to expand the screen outwards to cover the full face of the device, since it wouldn't need to leave space around the edge for those various apertures and controls. Of course, another hardware element that's currently built into the bezel at the bottom of the iPhone is the Home button. Which leads to our next section... iPhone 8 design: No more physical home button (and Touch ID built into the display) Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster (a well-known industry pundit, but one who has come in for a fair amount of ribbing after regularly predicting that Apple would launch a television), suggested the iPhone 7 wouldn't have a Home button, thanks to the new 3D Touch technology introduced with the iPhone 6s. He felt that the new tech provides Apple with a way to eliminate the home button, instead using the additional space to make the screen bigger or the device smaller. The issue with Munster's theory is that the Touch ID would need to move, as it is currently situated beneath the home button on Apple's iPhones and iPads. However, as we discuss below, Apple has been investigating ways to build the Touch ID sensor into the screen itself. Munster's speculation about the iPhone 7 didn't prove to be true, but may yet happen on the iPhone 8, and there's now more evidence to back up his claims. You can read about Apple's new Touch ID-related patents below, but reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has supported Munster's prediction with claims that Apple's new Touch ID technology developments will mean it is indeed possible to put the sensor into the display itself. Kuo also claims Apple is going to add a facial recognition element into the mix. In the continuing march of miniaturisation, one of the elements of the iPhone design that's proved resistant to shrinkage is the bezel below the screen - it can't get much smaller than it already is because it needs to house the Home button. Which is why a recurring theory is that Apple will extend the screen down past the Home button, or even incorporate the Touch ID sensor that lives in the recent iPhones' Home button into the touchscreen. Technology that would facilitate such a development was recently announced by a biometric R&D company called Sonavation. The tech would enable Apple (which is known to use Gorilla Glass in its iPhones, even if the supplier is apparently not permitted to say this publicly) to run the screen vertically edge-to-edge, with no cut-out for the Home button. The Home button could occupy the same position but appear only when needed, much like the software keyboard; and the technology for Touch ID would be bonded to the underside of the screen at the appropriate point. Last year Apple filed a patent that appeared to back up the theory that it's looking into ideas like this. Patent application number 20150036065, for "a fingerprint sensor... incorporated in a display stack in an electronic device", was filed by a number of Apple's engineers in April 2014 and published recently. Here are some of the accompanying illustrations (although you should bear in mind that patent images are almost universally ugly, and shouldn't bear much resemblance to what the finished design would look like): The illustration in Fig. 1 above appears to show an iPhone that still has a Home button, and therefore doesn't increase the amount of screen area - what would be the point of that, you might wonder. But remember that this is to illustrate the concept, not to show what it would look like in practice. Apple has been granted a patent - a different one - that also appears to refer to a Touch ID fingerprint sensor that can work through a screen. Patent 9,460,332 describes a "Capacitive fingerprint sensor including an electrostatic lens": more intriguingly for our purposes, it states that "one or more other device components, such as a display stack and/or a touchscreen may be interposed between the contact surface of dielectric structure 202 and array 206 of capacitive sensing elements". Here's one more patent for you, this one published on 14 February 2017 (but filed back in 2013), that points to the Touch ID sensor being built into the screen. US patent 9,570,002, which is titled 'Interactive display panel with IR diodes', addresses methods for incorporating a light sensor into a screen, and the ways this could be used. It focuses on the idea of dual-purpose interactive pixels, "each interactive pixel comprising an infrared emitting light emitting diode (IR emitting LED) and a sensing infrared diode (sensing IR diode)". The display would thus be capable of both emitting and sensing light. The patent specifically discusses one instance where "the target object 1201 contains a fingerprint surface. When the fingerprint is placed upon the transparent substrate, the sensing IR diodes 1203 within the display panel 119 sense patterned IR light reflected off grooves of the fingerprint surface. This patterned IR light is relayed to the output processor 123 as a bitmap 1211 where it is processed to determine the fingerprint surface's unique pattern." iPhone 8 design: No physical buttons at all A February 2017 report by Fast Company, which famously predicted that the late-2017 iPhone could cost more than $1,000 mark for the first time, also raised the possibility that the device might not have any physical buttons. It cited "a source with knowledge of Apple's plans" for this prediction. "Apple has been working to remove the physical Home button from the iPhone," says the site. "It would become a button to touch, not press. There's even a chance that the physical buttons on the sides of the iPhone may go away, our source says, replaced by touch-sensitive inlays in the metal." iPhone 8 design: 'Touch Bar' style function area In February 2017 Ming Chi Kuo predicted in an investor's note that the iPhone 8 would have a function area, somewhat like the Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro. That might seem a bit odd, given that the Touch Bar adds an element of software customisability and touchscreen function to an otherwise static and hardware keyboard area, whereas the iPhone's screen is already touchscreen and software-based. But the function area will take the place of the (currently non-touchscreen) lower bezel and Home button, and be somehow ringfenced for specific functions and 'virtual button' which will vary according to the app being used. Let's have Kuo explain his reasoning: "We expect the OLED iPhone will adopt a 5.8-inch physical OLED panel. But the actual display area will be around 5.15 inches, and the rest will be an area for functions (e.g. allocation of virtual buttons)." iPhone 8 design: Touch ID sensors on the side of the device Korea Herald cites "a source familiar with the matter" when reporting that Apple is exploring "new sensing technologies" that could substantially change the way Touch ID works. "The upcoming iPhone may use new sensing technology," explains the site's source, "which enables the phone to respond when users touch any side of the device. But Apple may not adopt this technology." The source doesn't specify whether the new sensors are connected to Touch ID, but it seems likely: all the talk of removing bezels and physical Home buttons and expanding the screen is going to necessitate finding a new location for the fingerprint scanner. If the iPhone becomes able to sense and analyse fingerprints on any edge, that would even remove the need for a specific Touch ID 'action' - you'd just need to pick the phone up. iPhone 8 design: Changes to Home button Some rumours suggest Apple is working on keeping the Home button and adding more features to it. There are two patents that have sparked these rumours, so they're both something Apple has at least considered. The first is a dynamic home button that is sensitive to gestures: you'd be able to swipe across it, or lean a thumb in one direction to scroll the screen of a game, for example, that way.  The second is pretty far out there. Essentially the concept is this: the Home button on the iPhone would be able to 'pop up' on a little spring and turn into a sort of mini-joystick for playing games. There are plenty of iOS games that would benefit from a hardware controller (this explains the enduring popularity of Bluetooth gaming controller accessories) and this sounds like a lot of fun. But gamers remain only one section of the iPhone's audience, and it seems like a risky idea to potentially compromise the resilience of everyone's iPhone Home button (which has famously been very prone to breakage in the past) for a feature that would benefit only some users. Best iPhone (and iPad) games iPhone 8 design: A larger, longer earpiece While this may not be the most exciting rumour to hit the internet, the latest rumours suggest that the next iPhone is to feature a longer earpiece cutout. The rumour, first covered by Mac Otakara, states that in addition to a longer earpiece cutout, Apple is moving the ambient light sensor from the left-hand side to the right-hand side. The source is apparently manufacturers of LCD protective films on Alibaba.com that are apparently no longer receiving orders related to the upcoming iPhone.  While the rumour is unconfirmed and should be taken with a pinch of salt, but if true, it could mean that the iPhone 8 may not be compatible with iPhone 7 cases and screen protectors, even if the design is broadly the same. iPhone 8 design: Curved wraparound screen According to KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has often correctly predicted upcoming Apple products - the analyst think a forthcoming iPhone could feature a curved 5.8in AMOLED screen. If this rumour is to be true, there would be an understandable shift from Apple to get rid of the headphone jack and produce a smartphone which is immediately distinguishable over its competitors.  We're into the realm of patents here, which we would generally warn readers means we're talking about developments that could easily end up appearing in a shipped product several years down the line or not appearing at all - Apple, like most tech companies, routinely applies for far more patents than it's ever going to use. But this one has actually been granted (it was applied for a few years back) so it could be reasonably close to reality. Patent 9,146,590 refers to an "electronic device with wrap around display". And essentially it describes a curved screen that allows for more screen elements to be displayed without making the device significantly bigger. (Remember that the illustrations rarely represent what the designer has in mind. In theory the display could wrap entirely around the device, or at least extend over one edge like the Note Edge.) While the patent talks about a "flexible display assembly", it's important to note that this isn't a patent for a bendable screen: the flexible portion of the display is attached to the interior surface of the curved transparent housing, which "provides a rigid support structure that prevents deformation". Samsung Display could be set to make flexible OLED displays for the iPhone 8. The rumour stems from claims that Samsung is reaching out to display tech companies in South Korea that they're hoping will lend a hand with building the displays, as the order from Apple will be huge. Samsung may even be intending to invest billions in a new factory in which it'll manufacture the displays. At present, iPhones use LCD displays, but the Apple Watch uses a flexible OLED so it's certainly possible that Apple intends to bring the tech to the iPhone. We're not talking flexible in the same way as the patent above, though. It'll simply mean that the screen could curve around the design of the iPhone 8 more accurately, hinting further at an edge-to-edge display. It'll also likely be used to improve 3D Touch. In January 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that the screen maker Japan Display, which already works with Apple, is ready to start building flexible displays. (This is understood to mean 'curved' rather than 'actively bendable by the user'.) While the firm didn't name Apple, it did say it is building the screens for hardware partners, and the clues point to the iPhone maker. iPhone 8 design: Plastic screen The Korea Herald report we linked to earlier also discusses the screen, and the site's "source familiar with the matter" predicts that the iPhone 8 will have a display that is curved and OLED - both rumours that we've heard before - and made of plastic, which is a new one to us. "The OLED versions of the new iPhone will all have curved screens as Apple ordered only plastic OLED - not glass - from Samsung Display," reports the source. "Samsung is capable of supplying a little less than 100 million units of curved OLED displays to Apple." iPhone 8 design: Sapphire iPhone screens are already far tougher than your average piece of glass (they're made of a proprietary material called Gorilla Glass), but they do sometimes crack or even shatter when dropped. Sapphire screens would be more resistant still, and Apple is already using sapphire in the display of the Apple Watch: it's possible that the company is now ready to import this material into its smartphone line-up. Rumoured plans to rely on an Apple-backed sapphire plant in Arizona (which had the capacity to manufacture 200 million 5-inch iPhone displays per year) fell through. But more recent reports suggest that long-term Apple supplier Foxconn is gearing up to build its own sapphire plant in Taiwan at a cost of $2.6bn. In August 2016, it was reported by Patently Apple that Apple filed patents for a curved glass iPhone with virtual buttons on the sides. If accurate, this could be somewhat like the rumoured OLED bar on the expected new MacBook Pro, but time will tell. The patent images also show a curved glass screen similar to that which we have now seen made popular by Samsung's Galaxy S6 edge and S7 edge. This has helped to fuel the rumours that Apple is planning a major redesign for the iPhone 8 to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the iPhone. Either way, it'll have to be significantly different to Samsung's efforts to avoid Apple being accused of plagiarism. Then again, most smartphones of the past decade have aped the original iPhone, so we're sure that wouldn't prove problematic for Apple - particularly since these patents show its legal right to product the devices in this way. Read more: What is Sapphire glass, and why is it a good idea for the iPhone? iPhone 8 design: Project Phire Corning, the company that makes Gorilla Glass, responded to the looming threat of sapphire glass in early 2015 with the announcement of an ultra-hardened composite material codenamed Project Phire. James Clappin, president of Corning Glass Technologies, told investors: "We told you last year that sapphire was great for scratch performance but didn't fare well when dropped. So we created a product that offers the same superior damage resistance and drop performance of Gorilla Glass 4 with scratch resistance that approaches sapphire." Apple never discusses the materials it uses for iPhone screens, but it's great news for consumers that suppliers are jousting to provide the best and most durable screen glass. Read more about Project Phire here. iPhone 8 design: Graphene Sapphire glass is already being used on the non-Sport models of the Apple Watch, and Project Phire appears to be in a reasonably advanced state of development, but we're getting closer to the realms of science-fiction. Graphite, the material used in standard pencils, is made up of stacks of sheets of carbon, each one only a single atom thick. This is why it's so good for writing: the layers naturally slide off on to the paper. But graphene is a different matter. Graphene is what you get if you're clever enough to isolate one of the layers in graphite, leaving you with a substance that's effectively two-dimensional. It's the thinnest substance known to man, about a million times thinner than a human hair, and for that matter quite possibly the strongest (it's 100 times stronger than steel) and a phenomenally good electrical conductor - 1,000 times better than copper. Oh, and it's virtually transparent, too. All of which makes graphene an exciting prospect for tech manufacturers. Most obviously, it would make for a tremendously durable coating material for the screen (and would lend itself to bendable displays, too) or indeed any part of the device; but it could really appear in almost any of the sections of this article. Graphene would be a superior replacement for silicon in processor chips, or could be used to make more efficient batteries and solar cells. It's marvellous stuff. We're also pleased to report that graphene is British - sort of. It was discovered by the Soviet-born physicist Andre Geim at the University of Manchester, where it continues to be studied. (Entertainingly, Geim is the only scientist so far to be awarded both a Nobel and an Ig Nobel prize.) If you'd like to read more about graphene, I strongly recommend the New Yorker's article on the subject. iPhone 8 design: Viscoelastic material Let's move on from the screen and talk about new durable materials for the rest of the iPhone. How about a bit of drop-resistance? Based on patent activity, Apple is devising a viscoelastic material that would absorb impacts. The material would cover Apple devices and make them survive drops far better. The patent could make sense in all of Apple's mobile devices and laptops, but the iPhone is the obvious area to begin. iPhone 8 design: Flexible iPhone In January 2015 Apple was awarded a patent that suggests that the company is investigating the idea of a flexible iPhone (and we're not talking about the Bendgate kind). The patent suggests that, by making the iPhone flexible, Apple could unlock a new range of controls: the user could open an app by bending the device in a particular way, for example, or use the flexibility to control a game. It's an intriguing if seemingly far-fetched concept. Additionally, a flexible iPhone flexible ought to be more resistant to impacts and therefore more durable. But we'll discuss a key element in the idea of a flexible iPhone - a screen that can bend without breaking - in the screen tech section. iPhone 8 release date rumours UK | iPhone 8 specs: New features That covers design. But what new features should we expect in the iPhone 8? iPhone 8 new features: Fast charging According to Forbes citing infamous Apple leaker Sonny Dickson, the iPhone 8 could be the first entry in the iPhone series to feature fast charging technology. More specifically, Forbes claims that there will be a new "Tristar 3, Hydra" chip that manages the charging port. "In normal people words... [it] will include fast charging," Dickson claims.  However, it's worth noting that if fast charging tech is included in the upcoming iPhone, it may not be compatible with existing fast charging standards as the tech isn't being produced by Qualcomm, which provides "Quick Charge" for Android devices. But the feature has long been requested by users, and is one readily available on most if not all of Apple's Android-based competitors. In February 2017, analyst Ming Chi Kuo predicted that the iPhone 8 will feature fast-charging technology - delivering this, incidentally, via a tweaked version of the existing Lightning port rather than by bringing in USB-C as was previously expected. He predicts that Apple will add "Type-C Power Delivery" to the Lightning port's spec. iPhone 8 new features: Tap to wake According to Forbes, one of the three (yes, three) variants of iPhone 8 will feature 'tap to wake' technology that has been available for budget Android users for quite some time. While the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus (sporting the same design as the 6/7) will miss out on the technology, the all-new iPhone 8 should get the 'tap to wake' treatment. This strikes us as a little odd as it's a feature available on budget Android smartphones, so why wouldn't it be on Apple's flagship? Also, Forbes source claims that it's "currently on the roadmap" for the iPhone 8 only, so there's still a chance this may change before release later this year. iPhone 8 new features: Smart connector Could the iPhone 8 get a smart connector, like those used on the 9.7in and 12.9in iPad Pro collection? Of course, as with any rumour/leak it's best to take it with a pinch of salt but according to a report from Mac Otakara, a forthcoming iPhone will feature a smart connector. More recently, Logitech (or Logi?) has launched the Logi Base, the first accessory to utilise the iPad Pro smart connector for charging capabilities. As first reported by AppleInsider, the Base uses magnets to easily line up the iPad Pro with the charger, providing users with something close to wireless charging. It also means that you can pick up the iPad and walk away without needing to unplug it. While it's specific to the iPad Pro, it gives you an idea about what a smart connector on an iPhone could be used for.  iPhone 8 new features: Wireless charging Wireless charging didn't arrive with the iPhone 7 as some had predicted (it has also been predicted for previous iPhone models stretching back some years), even though Apple has been offering the feature for a while now in the form of the Apple Watch's inductive charging. As iMore's Rene Ritchie points out, inductive charging hasn't been practical for the iPhone in previous years because the technology available at the time didn't work through an aluminium backplate, but the Apple Watch can offer wireless charging because it has a ceramic back. In July 2015 Qualcomm announced a wireless charging breakthrough that does work through metal. This was obviously too late for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus which appeared only two months later, and didn't make it into the iPhone 7 either. But the technology may appear in the iPhone 8 generation. And the iPhone 8 may have a glass back in any case. So the iPhone's main obstacles to wireless charging are disappearing fast. Indeed, Foxconn - one of the large manufacturing firms that assembles iPhones for Apple - is reported to be testing wireless charging modules that will be included in some or all of the 2017 iPhones (it would make a neat point of differentiation for the iPhone 8 Plus) if the tests prove satisfactory. The questions at this point relate to yield rate and profitability: Foxconn is exploring the practicality of producing large batches of the component to a satisfactory standard. Further strong evidence was added to the chances of Apple bringing wireless charging to the next iPhone in February 2017, when it emerged that Apple has joined the Wireless Power Consortium industry group, as spotted by 9to5Mac. Speaking to Business Insider, an Apple representative said: "Apple is an active member of many standards development organisations, as both a leader and contributor. Apple is joining the Wireless Power Consortium to be able to participate and contribute ideas to the open, collaborative development of future wireless charging standards. We look forward to working together with the WPC and its members." The Wireless Power Consortium itself added a further statement. "The companies with the largest market share in mobile phones are now members of the WPC and discussing the standardisation of wireless charging," the group said. "As we have seen in the past year, Qi has become the de facto standard for wireless power, and this year we expect to see even more momentum by the entire ecosystem." Research & analysis firm KGI Securities, and their famous analyst Ming Chi Kuo in particular, released a report in February 2017 making a firm prediction that all three iPhone models to be released in autumn 2017 will feature wireless charging, although Kuo warned that the feature would increase production costs. The charging element will generate more heat inside the body of the device than traditional charging techniques, which means Apple will have to incorporate a new protective graphite layer so that the 3D Touch component isn't damaged. Wireless charging sounds amazing, but we should stress that at the moment inductive charging has a very short range; so you wouldn't be able to just sit at your desk and have your iPhone (in your pocket) charge from the plug several feet away. Rather, you'd place the device on a wired mat. Convenient, but not quite as space-age as it might have sounded when we talked about 'wireless charging'. If you can't wait until the iPhone 8 to start charging your iPhone wirelessly, read How to wirelessly charge your iPhone. Long-range wireless charging We say that inductive charging is disappointingly short-range, but Bloomberg reckons Apple is working on longer-range wireless charging, potentially charging at a distance of about 1 metre using near-field magnetic resonance. And while this seems more of a long shot, some cryptic comments from the CEO of a charging company suggest Apple may be planning something even more ambitious. Steve Rizzone, CEO of Energous, spoke to The Verge before CES 2017 and dropped some clanking great hints about the exclusive and secret "key strategic partnership" that the company signed a couple of years back and which has delayed the launch of its wireless charging tech... which has a range of 15 feet. "That 'key' partner is suspected to be Apple," observes The Verge, "and Energous - though declining to state its partner's name - is certainly happy to fuel the speculation. Rizzone says the partnership is with 'one of the largest consumer electronic companies in the world. I cannot tell you who it is, but I can virtual guarantee that you have products from this company on your person, sitting on your desk, or at home.'" Separate wireless charging accessory In November 2016, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted in one of his Apple Insight research notes that Apple will bring wireless charging capabilities to the autumn 2017 iPhone handsets, thanks to the all-glass design, but warned that the firm may bundle the wireless charger with more expensive models only. The firm envisions a wireless pad for charging the phones, somewhat like the inductive charger that comes with the Apple Watch. Business Insider offers slightly more detail of Ming-Chi Kuo's predictions, clarifying that Pegatron is expected to be "the exclusive supplier of the wireless charger". In February 2017 a report by Macotakara also predicted that wireless charging will require a separate accessory. "Information from Taiwan which we have confidence in... [is] saying that the model which uses glass on the back will be able to support wireless charging," the site reports. "Although it can support wireless charging, the same equipment for wireless charging as the Galaxy, which can support wireless charging, is not included in the package, and LUXSHARE-ICT is a separately manufactured accessory." Perhaps the iPhone 8 Plus will offer wireless charging out of the box, while iPhone 8 buyers will need to purchase the charging pad separately (in this scenario, obviously the phones would need to be chargeable via conventional means too); or it might be the lower storage capacity units that miss out on the bundled wireless charger. That's another accessory to put on your shopping list, then. iPhone 8 new features: Improved 3D Touch 3D Touch was introduced to the iPhone 6S in 2015, but we're hoping it'll get a lot better for the iPhone 8. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggests that Apple is working on just that. According to Kuo, Apple is improving 3D Touch with new technology that should make it more sensitive and potentially capable of more complicated gestures. iPhone 8 new features: Face-detection and iris-recognition In December 2014, USPTO awarded Apple a patent relating to a "personal computing device control using face detection and recognition". Current iPhones and iPads can be unlocked using just your fingerprint, thanks to the Touch ID sensor. But with this patent, future iPhones and other devices could be unlocked using facial recognition: effectively, your face becomes your password. More recently, DigiTimes has predicted - citing that old favourite, "industry sources" - that Apple is likely to launch iPhones equipped with iris-recognition technology in 2018, which should line up with the iPhone 8's launch. This rumour was reiterated at the end of August 2016 when DigiTimes reported that Taiwan-based Xintec is expected to provide iris scanners to Apple for the iPhone launching in 2017, and that this would help boost the company's revenues significantly next year. DigiTimes returned to the subject in February 2017 with further claims about iris scanning based on industry sources. Also in February, JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall backed up this theory with his own prediction that the iPhone 8 will have a 3D laser scanner for face recognition, replacing Touch ID. (Working on the current widespread belief that there will be three new iPhones in autumn 2017, Hall says the iPhone 8 will definitely get the scanner, while the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus may or may not.) Hall expects the scanner to add between $10 and $15 to the production costs per unit. Once this technology becomes widespread - and you should expect other firms to launch phones with the feature before Apple, with DigiTimes predicting that Samsung for one will get there in the second half of 2016 - you'll be able to unlock your iPhone by scanning your eye. Is that really more convenient than scanning a fingerprint, though? It's more excitingly futuristic, admittedly. iPhone 8 new features: Augmented reality and VR In the Facebook post by Robert Scoble we mentioned earlier, one of the more surprising and detailed predictions concerns augmented reality and VR. "Really amazing VR/AR/mixed reality is coming to a phone, and coming by the end of 2017," Scoble writes. "Apple's entrance into this new world is like when IBM came into the personal computing world. It is that important." He discusses the impact that a mixed-reality iPhone could have on the market, and predicts: "You'll look through the glass in mixed reality modes (think of a new kind of Pokemon game) either in the headset, or in your hand. Apple's purchase of Metaio is going to prove very key. I won't be shocked to learn that Peter Meier, CTO there, is in charge of the next iPhone strategy and has been for years." Scoble isn't the only pundit predicting that Apple - and the iPhone in particular - are about to plunge into the world of augmented reality. Business Insider claims that the company is already working on ways to integrate AR elements into the iPhone's Camera app. "By adding AR technology into the iPhone's camera software, Apple wants consumers to be able to point the phone at a real-world object and have it be recognised, according to Kris Kolo, director of the VR/AR Association and a board member of Flyby Media, an AR startup that was acquired by Apple earlier this year," writes the site. Business Insider further predicts that the iPhone's camera app will be able to recognise "and manipulate" faces in augmented reality. And we've spotted a recent Apple patent application that appears to back up all this speculation. Patent 9,488,488, for 'Augmented reality maps', describes the use of a mobile device to view live video of whatever is in front of the user, and to then superimpose images related to nearby places of interest on top of the video. "A user points a handheld communication device to capture and display a real-time video stream. The handheld communication device detects geographic position, camera direction, and tilt of the image capture device. The user sends a search request to a server for nearby points of interest. ... The handheld communication device visually augments the captured video stream with data related to each point of interest. The user then selects a point of interest to visit. The handheld communication device visually augments the captured video stream with a directional map to a selected point of interest in response to the user input." Numerous Wall Street analyst firms have dissected the state of augmented reality technology and the likely nature and impact of a mooted 3D camera/scanner appearing in the late-2017 iPhone. Stephen Milunovich of UBS strikes an optimistic note, predicting that "investors could be surprised at how AR could reinvigorate the iPhone/iPad and possibly result in new products" and citing Apple's hardware expertise and large coherent user base as reasons why it can make AR work. Morgan Stanley's researchers are less convinced, raising doubts over widespread consumer appeal (noting the rapid drop-off in interest seen even by Pokemon Go) and questioning whether smartphones will have sufficient processing power. And KGI's Ming Chi Kuo thinks developing successful AR applications will enable Apple to redefine currently popular products such as the iPhone, boost comparatively low-takeup products such as the Apple Watch and move into new areas such as car tech. For more detail on analysts' take on the mooted iPhone 3D scanner, we recommend Business Insider's comprehensive review of the material. Read more: Apple VR and augmented reality rumours iPhone 8 release date rumours UK | iPhone 8 specs: Specs It's hard to predict precise specs this far in advance, but it's possible to draw some broad conclusions about where Apple is headed. Let's start with... iPhone 8 specs: Screen resolution A report by the Wall Street Journal prophesies that Apple has big things up its sleeve for the next iPhone's screen, after turning out smartphones with lower resolutions than their rivals for some years. (If you compare the iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7, for example, you'll see that Apple managed only a 760 x 1334 resolution on its 4.7-inch screen, in comparison to the 1440 x 2560 5.1-inch screen that Samsung had to offer. Comparison possibly isn't the right word to use when the difference is as pronounced as that.) The iPhone 8 will sit in Samsung's shadows no longer, according to the WSJ, which says Apple has asked suppliers to "submit prototype screens with better resolution than ones from Samsung". If this is true - and if the suppliers are able to match Apple's stipulation without pushing up price, weight or dimension, or reducing battery life or fire safety, to a degree that Apple finds unacceptable - then this would imply more than a tripling of the pixel count from one iPhone generation to the next. In February 2017 Ming Chi Kuo predicted that the (5.15in) iPhone 8 will have a resolution of 2,436 x 1,125 and a pixel density of 521ppi, far higher than the iPhone 7's 326ppi. And the 5.8in version of the iPhone 8 - the iPhone 8 Plus, presumably - will have a resolution of 2,800 x 1,242 and a pixel density of 528ppi. iPhone 8 specs: Screen size What's more, word is that screens are getting bigger in 2017. In November 2016, Barclays Research - via MacRumors - released a report predicting that the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus would have 5-inch and 5.8-inch screens respectively, compared to the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The analysts based the prediction on the testimony of sources within Apple's Asian supply chain. It's still early days, though: the analysts warned that the design "didn't sound 100% locked down", so Apple may yet change its mind. In January 2017 this theory was backed up by a source in Asia. DigiTimes predicts that Apple will launch a 5.8-inch iPhone in the second half of 2017, citing anonymous sources in the Taiwanese supply chain. "Apple will launch 4.7-, 5.5- and 5.8-inch new iPhone models in the second half of 2017," the site writes, "with TFT-LCD panels to be used in the former two models and AMOLED for the 5.8-inch one." There remains some confusion, however, about whether that 5.8-inch measurement will take into account the extra space provided by the screen's predicted curved edges. Indeed, it's possible that this 5.8-inch phone's chassis will be the same size as that of current Plus models, gaining 0.3 inches of diagonal screen size through the curved edges and the lack of bottom bezel and Home button. Further weight has been added to the theory that one of the new iPhone models to be unveiled this autumn will have a bigger screen than ever before: a whopping 5.8 inches, if a report from Nikkei is to be believed. "The upcoming iPhone, to be launched this [autumn], will come in three configurations - two with liquid crystal displays and one with a 5.8-inch organic light-emitting diode display," the site predicts. If you're wondering how Apple will fit in that extra screen real estate - will the phones be bulkier than the current handsets? - then fear not. It's understood that the larger screens will fit in bodies with the same dimensions as the current generation of phones, thanks to a bezel-free design. This has been on the cards for a while. On 5 March 2015, indeed, Apple filed a patent that would allow for a bezel-free device. Similarly, according to a Wall Street Journal source, the iPhone 8 may feature an edgeless display - but what is that, exactly? According to the publication, Apple is to redesign the iPhone for the 10th anniversary and that the changes "could include an edge-to-edge organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen" without a physical Home button. John Gruber also commented on the upcoming redesign, claiming that Apple is to remove the bezels surrounding the display, providing users with an iPhone that looks almost like a sheet of glass. If Apple kills off the bezel, it will need to find a new place to put the Home button. On which topic, it's believed that Apple is investigating including the fingerprint scanner into the display of a smartphone or tablet. In fact, Apple filed a patent describing a Touch ID display back in January 2013.  This technology means that you could place your finger on the display to scan it, instead of the Home Button. We're not sure if this technology was an original variation to the Home Button scanner found on the iPhone 5s, or if it'll be combined with the Haptics & Tactile technology to remove the Home Button on a future iPhone and replace it with a virtual onscreen button. The Barclays Research report we mentioned earlier also predicts that the iPhone 8 will have a curved screen. This broadly fits in with earlier predictions. Some while back Nikkei predicted that autumn 2017 will see a massive triple iPhone launch, and that the flagship model of this trio will feature a curved OLED screen that curves down over the sides. This is something we've already seen on rival devices, such as Samsung's S7 Edge and Note 7; it enables more screen space to be squeezed on to a device without making it any bigger, and you can also have notifications designed to be seen or activated on the edge of the screen. "There will be a 4.7-inch model, another that will be 5.5-inches and a premium handset that will be either 5.5-inches or larger equipped with a screen bent on the two sides," said Nikkei's source, who was said to be "familiar with Apple's plans". A company named Applied Materials, which already works with Apple, has dropped strong hints about ramping display demand from the company heading towards 2017, and this has been taken as evidence for the iPhone 8 incorporating an OLED screen. "Applied Materials reported an almost fourfold leap in orders for equipment to make displays, an early sign producers are retooling their manufacturing to meet Apple's demand for a new kind of organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen," reports Bloomberg. This appeared to be confirmed on 29 October 2016 by Tai Jeng-wu, the president of Sharp, which makes smartphone displays for Apple. Tai, who was speaking to students at his old university, said: "The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS [low-temperature poly-silicon] to OLED panels. We don't know whether Apple's OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn't walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity." The OLED iPhone rumour has been knocking around for a while; in December 2015 it was predicted that OLED would come to the iPhone line in 2018 as a result of a partnership between Apple and Japan Display. Talking of Japan Display... that company uses a new technology that it calls "full active LCD", and some pundits believe that only one of the new iPhones next year will get OLED, while the other(s) have screens based on full-active LCD. The technology, which Japan Display describes as using "a new high-density wiring layout and new processing and module assembly technologies" is capable of making the bottom bezel of an iPhone "as narrow as the other three sides". Japan Display aims to start mass production by the end of March, 2017, according to Fool.com - in time for the iPhone 8 launch, then. iPhone 8 specs: Processor As everyone knows, the iPhones contain proprietary processor chips that you won't find in other smartphones: there's an A9 in the iPhone 6s, and we should get an A10 chip in the iPhone 7, for example. But while these are made to Apple's own design and specifications, several other companies are involved: they contain technology licensed from ARM, and are manufactured, at present, by Samsung and TSMC. But that could change by the time 2018 comes around. Intel has declared its intention of expanding its smartphone business, and is hot favourite to displace TSMC from the iPhone contract, according to the Nikkei Asian Review - an aim that may be more feasible thanks to the company's recently announced partnership with ARM. TSMC's ties with ARM have given it a competitive edge when it comes to securing the contract in the past. "Intel is definitely the most formidable challenger for TSMC," said an anonymous chip-industry executive. "There is no rivalry between Apple and Intel so it's really likely that Apple could shift some orders there. The move is also in line with Washington's policy to encourage US companies to make more products at home." iPhone 8 specs: RAM The iPhone 7 comes with 2GB RAM, while the iPhone 7 Plus offers 3GB. In February 2017 research firm TrendForce published a report predicting that the iPhone 8 (we assume they mean all models) will have 3GB RAM, which should provide a speed boost for the smaller-screen models. iPhone 8 specs: Storage The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus both comes in three storage configurations: 32GB, 198GB and 256GB. (The older iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are available with 32GB and 128GB only, whereas the iPhone SE offers 16GB or 64GB.) The TrendForce report linked above suggests that Apple may phase out the 32GB model for the iPhone 8 generation. The late-2017 iPhones will come in 64GB and 256GB configurations, the firm says. iPhone 8 specs: Camera The iPhone is one of the most widely used cameras in the world. What's in store for this vital element of the iPhone of the future? Lucky iPhone owners of the future may get their hands on a feature currently offered only by premium video cameras. In March 2015 Apple was granted a patent for a "digital camera with light splitter". Its project is to create a light splitter system (which for now exists only in high-end video camera) small enough to fit in an iPhone. In essence, a light splitter system consists of a cube that splits received light into three colours: red, green and blue. The cube provides three image sensors, each of which receives one colour component. In recent iPhones, the camera system is such that its pixels capture the three component colours which end up occupying only a single image sensor; this means that they can fill only one third of the image sensor and colours are not as accurate as they could be. The light splitter system would be a big coup for Apple. Its iPhone would be able to capture high-quality pictures with more precise colours, especially at night. Apple seems to be keen to improve the camera capabilities of its iOS devices, and one patent published by USPTO in May 2014 suggests we could soon see iPhones that are able to capture "Super-resolution" photos thanks to optical image stabilisation, which is already a feature of the iPhone 6 Plus. The patent describes a system that takes a series of photographs at slightly different angles and stitches them together to create a 'super resolution' photograph. Apple doesn't suggest a device would capture every photo this way. Instead, the user would have the option to turn super-resolution mode on, much like HDR and Panorama modes. Several rumours suggest that Apple plans to introduce a feature like this with an iPhone in the near future, with reports pointing to a 'DSLR-quality' capability that would represent the biggest camera jump in iPhone upgrade history. Finally, and related to the face-recognition tech we discussed earlier, Ming Chi Kuo thinks the anticipated front-facing 3D camera on the iPhone 8 will enable developers to come up with innovative new games and allow users to take 3D selfies. iPhone 8 specs: Battery Ming Chi Kuo has predicted that the iPhone 8 will squeeze a battery with a capacity to match the iPhone 7 Plus - 2,700mAH - into a chassis comparable to the iPhone 7. So we could see a significant battery life increase in the next generation of iPhones. Another rumour holds that Apple will take the battery developments it deployed in the 12-inch MacBook - whereby contoured, layered battery units are stacked inside the chassis in order to take up every possible inch of space - and use these to squeeze more battery volume inside the iPhone. (According to Wired's write-up, Apple actually claims to adjust its battery contours on a machine-by-machine basis, by photographing the inside of the chassis and modifying the battery stack to fit all the tiny imperfections - which, if it's true, is amazing.) Smartphone battery life is one of those things that everyone says is important, and once again Apple will hear many requests for improved battery life in the iPhone 8 - but you do wonder how much of a compromise the average Apple fan would be willing to make in return. What if, in order to achieve a superb battery life, the iPhone 8 was twice the weight, or cost significantly more? What if the screen was less powerful or the processor scaled back? Mirroring these thoughts somewhat, Jony Ive discussed battery life briefly in an interview with the Financial Times' 'How to spend it' supplement. And he gave fairly heavy hints that Apple doesn't think battery life is a high enough priority to make compromises in other areas worth it. "Talking of performance, when the issue of the frequent need to recharge the iPhone is raised, [Ive] answers that it's because it's so light and thin that we use it so much and therefore deplete the battery. With a bigger battery it would be heavier, more cumbersome, less 'compelling'." Apple is clearly aware that battery life is a concern for a lot of its customers, but battery life remains a question of compromises, such that increasing it always necessitates either making a device thicker, heavier or more expensive, or choosing not to make it thinner, lighter or cheaper when you could have done. I still believe that most people would rather have a thin, relatively cheap iPhone than a fat, more expensive iPhone with an extra two hours of battery life. And since the launch of the battery pack case, anyone who would be willing to make that compromise now has an officially sanctioned alternative: spend the extra money, make your phone fatter and uglier, and get the battery pack. iPhone 8 specs: LiFi A boring but important rumour about the iPhone 8's specs relates to LiFi, a new wireless standard that boasts 100x faster download speeds than conventional WiFi connections. LiFi uses visible light communication (VLC) instead of radio waves like conventional WiFi routers. Intrigued?

For comparison, in the US the 128GB cellular-equipped edition of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro costs $1,029; in the UK this model costs £939. The iPhone 7 Plus with 256GB of storage costs £919, or $969 in the US. iPhone 8 release date rumours UK: Leaked images and videos This is where we'll post leaked photos and video of the iPhone 8 and its components that we are able to dig up, as well as concept illustrations created by designers who are not affiliated with Apple. 'This is 8' concept Here's a lovely iPhone 8 concept - together with some fairly detailed specs - by Handy Abo Vergleich. Concept images & video of edge-to-edge screen With rumours of an edge-to-edge display proving popular, designer Thadeu Brandao got to work on a new concept for the iPhone 8.  Coined as "the next big step" in iPhone design, Brandao's renders look stunning, with the iPhone 8 sporting a nearly bezel-less display and an embedded Home button alongside a completely redesigned iOS 11. Of course, Brandao has no affiliation with Apple and the next iPhone might not look like this but hey, it's nice to imagine, right? Brandao's lovely concepts have been made into a video - an 'iPhone 8 commercial' - and posted on the YouTube channel ConceptsiPhone: Concept images of new colour options Designer Martin Hajek has published some gorgeous concept images of a Deep Blue colour option for the next iPhone. See more over on Martin's website. Leaked photo of iPhone with Smart Connector According to a report and alleged leak from Mac Otakara, a forthcoming iPhone will feature a smart connector. Mac Otakara claims "the possibility is great" that earlier leaked images are "the real thing", and even went on to claim that the next iPhone could be as thin as 6.1mm, although there was no source provided for this information. Bezel-free iPhone An image render and concept by Marek Weidlich shows us what the iPhone might look like if it were to have no bezels. The conceptual idea looks great and would show that Apple is still innovating in the smartphone space. Macworld poll - What do you want from your future iPhone? It's your turn.

By DianaFurchtgott-Roth Columnist People who watched President Trump’s address to Congress on Feb. 28 might have been forgiven for thinking Big Government was back in fashion, despite the Republican sweep of the White House and both chambers of Congress. Trump said he would make health-care insurance — and health care itself — affordable; he would make inner cities a place for opportunity; he would boost infrastructure spending; and on and on. Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan was sitting behind Trump, smiling and clapping, even though Ryan has always stood up for fiscal sobriety. But Trump’s plans do not have to increase spending. Better education, health care and infrastructure can be achieved at a lower cost to the Treasury. A more competitive corporate tax code can attract businesses back, even to inner cities. And Trump has already proposed some cuts: The same day as his speech, he suggested cutting the State Department budget by 37%. Of course, military spending, being in economic parlance a “public good,” is one of the few areas that spending would have to increase to get better results. But some former Army and Air Force officers I met this week from the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business told me that there is room for more efficiency in the military as well. Education Let’s start with education. Trump wants to achieve higher standards through school choice, including public schools and charter schools. Competition raises the quality of the service without additional funds because lower-quality schools go out of business. Simply allowing the funding to follow the children to the schools that their parents choose will raise standards. Competition in education has been shown to raise quality. In a study of charter schools in New York, Harvard professor Caroline Hoxby has shown the superior results of charter school education, accounting for the motivations of the parents. Going to a charter school from kindergarten through eighth grade closed the achievement gap between rich and poor students in mathematics, and eliminated two-thirds of the gap in English. To see why, think of the service you get at an Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.31%  store and the service you get at the Department of Motor Vehicles. You walk into an Apple store, and someone greets you with an iPad and asks how you can be helped. You are shown the product you want to buy, someone brings it and you can check out on the spot, without waiting in line for a cash register. In contrast, at the Department of Motor Vehicles in Maryland, you take a number, sit down and wait. Then, after about half an hour, someone might see you. You often have to wait in another line to finish a simple task, such as registering a car or getting a driver’s license. Apple knows it has to compete against other suppliers of computers and smartphones, and the late founder, Steve Jobs, insisted that the Apple store experience be carefully controlled to be what he considered optimum. The Department of Motor Vehicles has no competition. Former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels brought down waiting times at his Department of Motor Vehicles, but Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and many of his peers have not been as successful. Health care The same can be done for health care. Health care is another area where it is practically impossible to shop around and compare prices because people rarely pay out of their own pockets. Good luck finding out how much it costs for surgery ahead of time, or even right afterward. The bills trickle in, and each is more surprising than the last. The Affordable Care Act has exacerbated the problem by requiring a generous policy that includes mental health coverage, drug abuse coverage, unlimited lifetime coverage, pediatric dental care and maternity care — even for those without children who would prefer to buy a simple plan that insured against major problems and required the payment of routine expenses out of pocket. Replacing Obamacare with a tax credit that allows people to shop around for health insurance and some health services would raise the quality and lower the price. As evidence, consider health services that are purchased directly by individuals who pay out of their own pockets, such as Lasik eye surgery and cosmetic surgery. Prices are clearly displayed and doctors advertise lower prices to attract patients. Infrastructure Finally, take infrastructure. In his book, “Crippled America,” Donald Trump wrote that giving $1 trillion to politicians for infrastructure spending is a recipe for disaster. The private sector frequently wants to invest in infrastructure, but is prevented from doing so by complex regulations, including environmental impact statements that can run to hundreds of pages. We can learn from other countries. Airports can receive streams of private funding in the United Kingdom but not in the United States because U.K. airports are owned by private holding companies. Electric and diesel cars and trucks in New Zealand pay road user charges through “hubodometers,” which measure distance traveled and provide funding to build and maintain roads. When people hear that the government will provide them with better service, they naturally think it will cost more money. Aside from the military, this does not have to be so. Better service does not have to mean a bigger budget. More from MarketWatch Struggling shopping malls let high schools, doctors move in where Penney’s used to be Drowning in Charging Cables?

The Swedish company posted the figure on Twitter. Apple Music, its closest competitor, said in December that it had 20 million subscribers.

Spotify said in June that it had a total of 100 million users, including on its free, advertising-backed tier which is the bane of some record executives. Spotify has maintained its edge despite concerted efforts from competitors. Apple, which launched its streaming service in 2015, and rap mogul Jay Z's upstart Tidal have both tried to woo listeners by offering exclusive material. Online retail giant Amazon in October entered the streaming war by giving a discount rate to subscribers who use the company's speakers. Other competitors include Paris-based Deezer, whose strength lies in Europe, and Seattle streaming pioneer Rhapsody. Streaming of unlimited, on-demand music online has rapidly grown in recent years, transforming the music industry. The number of paid subscriptions to streaming services more than doubled in the United States last year alone. Streaming has helped bring the first substantial growth to the recording industry since the dawn of online music, although some artists complain that far too little goes back to them. Spotify's model includes a service that is easy to use and makes the most music available rather than seeking out exclusives. However, in a turn towards original material, Spotify said last week that it was starting three podcasts.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Fitbit grabs the top position followed by Xiaomi and Apple in the wearable segment, as shipments for wearables reached 33.9 million units in the fourth quarter of 2016 (4Q16) which is about 16.9% year-over-year growth, according to the latest IDC report.   Starting with Fitbit, the company managed to retain its dominance in the wearable market despite facing one of its largest declines ever. The market share fell from 29 per cent in Q4 2015 to just 19.2 per cent, registering a 22.7 per cent year-over-year decline. The main reason for this decline can be attributed to the company's decision of focusing the US market heavily, which is on a verge of saturation.   Meanwhile, Xiaomi has registered a steep rise in the market share, as it now captures 15.2 per cent of market share as opposed to 9.1 per cent of last year in the same quarter. The company has registered year-over-year growth of 96.2 per cent majorly because of the low-cost wearables it offers, but still, according to IDC, it lacks the expertise and brand recognition to expand beyond its native borders in China.   Apple on the other hand, with its Series 1 and Series 2 watches has proved to be a success for the company as it was the company's best quarter ever in the wearables market. The lower entry price point and the inclusion of GPS on the Series 2 along with a completely revamped user interface have helped the company grow its presence. The company holds a market share of 13.6 per cent and has gained a y-o-y growth of 13 per cent.   Other than this, Garmin and Samsung were able to capture 6.2 per cent and 5.6 per cent of market share in the wearable segment. Samsung remains the only major company offering cellular-enabled wearables. LTE connectivity has been a key differentiator for Samsung's watches as it has helped decouple them from smartphones, but more importantly, it has opened up a new channel (telcos) to help promote the Samsung watches, the report added.

Apple iPhone 8 to Feature a Redesigned Fingerprint Sensor GO Industry sources say Apple redesigned the fingerprint sensor Mar 3, 2017 11:37 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Apple is expected to introduce a new design with the iPhone 8 and even offer a new fingerprint ID solution. There have been multiple talks about the new technology, and the latest report quotes industry sources saying that Apple has already selected the new solution. Apple has decided to go with its own Authentec algorithm combined with Privaris glass identification technology for its new fingerprint ID solution.  Apparently, Apple didn’t pick Synaptics' Natural ID touch fingerprint sensor nor Qualcomm's Sense ID fingerprint technology for its upcoming iPhone 8. Apple’s Touch ID technology originally came from AuthenTec, the company that Apple bought in 2012. Three years later, the Cupertino company bought a number of patents relating to fingerprint and touchscreen technology, from Privaris. Production of the iPhone 8 could start in September The report adds that Apple’s new technology will be developed at TSMC’s 12-inch line using 65nm process technology. Production isn’t expected to start until September due to the redesigned fingerprint ID solution. Previous reports stated that Apple could start production of new iPhones in July, but the latest suggests that the date only applies to the other two iPhones. The iPhone 8 with OLED display would hit mass production in September. Finally, the report mentions that the iPhone 8 will feature biometric authentication systems like ultrasound, aside from the rumored facial recognition and iris scanning technologies. Wireless charging will also come to the iPhone 8, together with an edge-to-edge OLED display made by Samsung. Apple has filed multiple patents for fingerprint sensors built into the display, which would make it easier for users to authenticate and smartphone makers to create thinner phones with smaller bezels. There have been a number of companies like CrucialTec and Goodix that already developed the technology and will feature it on new phones to be launched this year. It remains to be seen what capabilities Apple’s new fingerprint ID solution will have. #Apple#iPhone 8#Fingerprint ID#Touch ID#Synaptics subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple's 2017 iPhones to Feature Lightning Ports, Not USB Type-C Apple Might Announce New iPhone SE with 128GB This Month Apple’s Next iPhone Could Come with AR Features - Report Apple and Samsung Reputations Declined Dramatically in the Past Year Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1 Google Play Celebrates Five Years, Here Are the Most Downloaded Games and Apps Samsung Confirms Delay of Android Nougat Update to Galaxy S6 and S6 edge Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1    iPhone 8 concept new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple Launches a Gold 32GB iPhone 6 Variant for Asian Markets more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

By: Reuters | Updated: March 3, 2017 5:36 pm The showstopper at this year’s main European technology trade fair was a revival of the Nokia 3310. (Image for representation, Source: Nokia) Once famous mobile phones such as Nokia’s classic 3310 from the turn of the century have been given a new lease of life as Chinese manufacturers revive Western brands to get an edge in an increasingly cut-throat handset market. Apple and Samsung lead the smartphone pack worldwide but impressive growth in the Chinese market has left room for a host of home-grown manufacturers to come to the fore, with China’s Huawei now third in the world. Watch all our videos from Express Technology Within China, Oppo surged to become market leader last year and it is expanding rapidly in Asia to stand fourth in the world rankings, even if its brand is little known in developed and increasingly stagnant Western markets. A closely related Chinese brand, Vivo, has muscled its way into fifth place globally. What this means, though, is that former Chinese market leaders, such as Lenovo and TCL Communications , are losing ground, and some are counting on retro Western brands to revive their fortunes at home and abroad. Emerging from a sea of indistinguishable smartphones, the showstopper at this year’s main European technology trade fair was a revival of the Nokia 3310, its brightly coloured cases and month-long battery life tugging at the heartstrings of erstwhile fans in search of a digital detox. The new phone was launched by Finnish firm HMD Global, led by former Nokia executives and backed financially by Chinese electronics giant Foxconn, which makes devices for Apple and Sony, among others. Priced at 49 euros, the 3310 is meant to appeal to old fans in the West as well as finding a new generation of younger users in emerging markets looking for a good-looking reliable phone. The BlackBerry made a splash at the Barcelona trade fair too thanks to China’s TCL Communication.(Image for representation, source: Press photo) The BlackBerry made a splash at the Barcelona trade fair too thanks to China’s TCL Communication , which unveiled a BlackBerry-licensed handset with the physical keyboard many professionals clung onto even as Apple’s iPhone revolutionised the smartphone market. BlackBerry Ltd supplies the phone’s security software. TCL, which is part of a group that makes appliances ranging from TVs to washing machines, has kept France’s Alcatel brand alive for a decade. TCL-Alcatel is now the world’s 10th biggest smartphone maker, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION Lenovo, the world’s third largest mobile phone supplier in 2014 when it acquired U.S. cellphone pioneer Motorola, has subsequently sunk to ninth globally but is counting on Motorola as its premium smartphone brand to battle back. The Chinese firm is even open to following in Nokia’s footsteps and reviving the retro, flip-top Motorola Razr, which was the second best selling phone in the world in 2004 and 2005. Lenovo Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing told CNBC this week that launching a revamped Razr could be a way of bringing customers back to the Motorola brand as it tries to drive into developed markets such as the United States. The Philips handset brand also lives on in India and China after the Dutch firm licenced its brand to Sang Fei, a subsidiary of TPV Technology, which also makes Philips television sets. For now, though, the top Chinese phone makers such as Huawei , Oppo and Vivo, look set on developing their own brands in a domestic market that is still growing even as demand in developed economies plateaus. China accounted for more than a third of the world’s mobile phones shipped last year and domestic firms still had 90 percent of sales, according to a government report (Image for representation, Source: Press photo) China accounted for more than a third of the world’s mobile phones shipped last year and domestic firms still had 90 percent of sales, according to a government report. But as the market becomes overrun with me-too smartphones and margins evaporate, rivals may spot more opportunities to leapfrog rivals by capitalising on familiar Western brands, said Strategy Analytics analyst Neil Mawston. “As the Chinese market peaks and organic growth becomes harder, these brands may consider takeovers as the fastest way to speed up their expansion,” he said, refering to moves overseas. “At some point, either Huawei, Vivo or Oppo may come to the point where buying an existing international brand is their best way to expand,” Mawston said. Analyst say possible targets could include famous phone brands fallen on hard times including Japan’s Sony or Taiwan’s HTC.”It could well be that we see more brands of yesteryear picked up by Chinese brands,” said phone industry analyst Ben Wood of CCS Insight.

YouTube blogger Elijah Quashie ditched his local chicken shops in his latest video, heading across the Atlantic to check out the finger-licking wings and burgers in New York. YouTube/Chicken Connoisser 5 The Chicken Connoisseur was not impressed with the restaurants he visited in New York But the 23-year-old, who describes himself as “a food critic for mandem who care to know what the finest chicken restaurants in London are and where to find them“, was not impressed by the food on offer in the Big Apple. Instead, The Pengest Munch reviewer barely gave two of the chicken shops he visited a rating of 2, with just one making it above a 4. YouTube/Chicken Connoisser 5 The reviewer visited New York to check out the chicken shops across the Atlantic First visiting in Harlem, the fried chicken expert was blown away by the quality of the fries, giving them a 4.2 for their crispiness. The favourable review continued with the wings stamped with a 3.9 approval and the burger praised for not going “skimpy” on the paprika. But the tour through the City that Never Sleeps went downhill after visiting Kennedy Chicken in the Bronx. Despite the cheap price – of USD$8.75 (£7.15) – the hungry reviewer was left disappointed with the greasy chips and tough burger – abandoning the bun after just one bite. Throughout the tour, he was joined by musician A$AP Bari, a member of the hip hop collective ASAP Mob formed in Harlem, New York in 2006. MOST READ IN NEWS 'MUMMY, WE'RE GOING TO DIE!'

The finale of the review came when the chicken connoisseur visited the Crown Fried Chicken in Brooklyn – the former employee of rapper Jay Z. Heaping praise on the fries, with Quashie saying he had never had better chips, the critic was left disappointed with the bland wings, crispy burger and disappointing atmosphere. YouTube/Chicken Connoisser 5 He visited one chicken shop where rapper Jay Z used to work YouTube/Chicken Connoisser 5 The reviewer checked out Texas, giving it a favourable rating YouTube/Chicken Connoisser 5 The chicken fan slammed some food he was served at a New York Restaurant as dry The video is one of the first to be released after the connoisseur made headlines after it was revealed one of his videos featured Bonkaz, real name Taylor Harris, who was convicted of groping a 13-year-old girl in 2010 and ordered to sign the sex offenders register. The video featuring Harris saw the online critic and Bonkaz travel to Thornton Heath, south London, where they ate together at Morley’s fast food restaurant. YouTuber Chicken Connoisseur joined by convicted sex offender in video But furious fans slammed him for “the worst episode yet” and urged him to get rid of Harris and “stick to the basics”. Harris later tweeted he did not commit sexual assault and blamed “poor legal advice” for his conviction. Elijah Quashie's reviews have also caused controversy after it was revealed that his comments often led to price hikes at restaurants who received a favourable rating. Feathers were ruffled over the price hikes, with locals annoyed that hipsters were descending on restaurants that had been given 5 stars. We pay for your stories!

 Apple CEO Tim Cook gave a speech before a screening of Al Gore's new climate change film Hannah Roberts Mar. 3, 2017, 6:32 AM 1,333 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during an event at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California March 21, 2016.REUTERS/Stephan Lam Apple CEO Tim Cook attended a screening of Apple board member and former US Vice President Al Gore's new documentary "An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power" on Thursday, Apple Insider reports. The sequel expands on its predecessor — Gore's 2006 Oscar-winning documentary "An Inconvenient Truth," which was meant to lead people who had denied climate change to rethink. And the sequel shows Gore visiting President-elect Donald Trump to talk about climate change back in December. Cook was one member of a select audience in Silicon Valley invited to the sequel's screening, and before it began, he stood up and made a speech to introduce the film (which you can watch in full below). The video of Cook's speech shows he says: "...10 years later, there's still signs all around us of the climate crisis but there's also great reasons for optimism ... markets are rewarding renewable energy everywhere, but of course the clock still runs, and the urgency has never been greater, and so I think there has never been a better time for this film, and I'd like to recognise the folks that created it, starting with Al Gore." At the end of the screening, in a panel discussion, Gore talked about Apple's achievements in renewable energy, saying, "it's important to know that Apple is 100% renewable energy in the US, 93% worldwide," according to the video. Venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson, one of the screening's attendees, captured Cook's introduction and the panel discussion and posted in on YouTube: The documentary is set for wide release on July 28, according to Apple Insider.

Millions of mobile devices get lost or stolen every year. In fact, between January 1 and September 23 of 2012, 11,447 devices were reported stolen in New York City alone. Usually, if you lose your device, there’s not much you can do about it other than to try and go back and find it. If it’s stolen, you’re kind of out of luck, unless you can find a way to somehow locate it and get it back from the perpetrator. Luckily, device manufacturers are adding ways for owners to track and manage their devices if they ever do get lost or stolen, giving users a fighting chance at least. There are a handful of things that you’ll need to keep in mind and make sure that you do whenever your iPad does end up stolen. Many users simply resort to tracking their stolen device using Find My iPhone, but don’t spend too much time trying to track down the device and the criminal, as there are other tasks that you need to do if you’re iPad gets stolen. Here’s a list of tasks that you should do (in no particular order) when you discover that your iPad has been stolen. Track It with Find My iPhone Find My iPhone is a service that comes free with every iOS device and Mac computer, and it allows you to track your iPhone or iPad, whether it was lost or stolen. Of course, it only works when the device is on and it has a signal, so if your iPad gets stolen and the thief was smart enough to turn off the device or put it in Airplane Mode, Find My iPhone won’t work, but it’ll at least give you a fighting chance in case the thief isn’t that smart. Here’s how to use it. Head to iCloud.com and log in using your Apple ID information. You’ll be greeted with a handful of apps arranged similarly to how your iPad home screen is laid out. Click on the Find My iPhone icon and you’ll be taken to a full-screen map with dots representing where your various Apple devices are located (including Mac computers, if you have any). You can click on Devices at the top to view all of your Apple devices, and when you select your stolen one, you’ll have the same three options as the Find My iPhone app: Play Sounds, Lost Mode and Erase iPad. Personally, using Find My iPhone would be the first thing I do, but again, don’t spend a lot of time fiddling around with it. Instead, quickly log on and see if you can track your iPad. If you know it’s location, close out of Find My iPhone and move on to the next step. Call the Police & File a Report Be sure to call the police and not only file a report, but also tell them that you know the location of the stolen device if you know where it is from using Find My iPhone. If that’s the case, they’ll usually send an officer out to help retrieve the stolen iPad and catch the perp. Under no circumstances should you pursue the perp on your own, as you have no idea what they’re capable of. Let the police handle it. Otherwise, there is very little that the police can do if you don’t know the location of the stolen device, but filing a report can help when dealing with Apple or your insurance company. Remotely Erase Your Stolen iPad At this point, if you can’t locate your stolen iPad and the police can’t help you find it, you’re probably at the point where you’ll never see it again, which is why it would be a good time to remotely wipe your stolen iPad if you can using iCloud and Find My iPhone. Like before when you logged into iCloud.com to try and locate your stolen iPad, there is an option to remotely wipe your device, called Erase iPad. Clicking that will remotely wipe your device so that the thief can’t access any personal information. This is ideal if you have sensitive information on your iPad. While most thieves aren’t really interested in your personal information anyway, it’s still a good step to take whenever one of your devices gets stolen. However, keep in mind that erasing your stolen iPad will prevent you from using Find My iPhone to locate the device in the future. At this point, it’s officially time to say, “bye bye.” Call Your Carrier After you remotely wiped your iPad, be sure to call your mobile carrier to cancel service on the iPad, if you have an LTE model, that way if the thief can access your device, you won’t rack up any charges for data usage, and will instead shut down service and prevent him from using the LTE. Plus, if you have a police report that you can show the carrier, they’ll be more likely to work with you and take action quicker than they would normally. You usually have to prove it was stolen anyway in order for the carrier to take action, and the police report you filed will do the trick. 5 Responses 06/01/2015 Elisha Joshua kabenla Reply My iPad has stolen in Ghana, I have icloud but find my iPad is not on , teaf can wipe my iPad ? 08/23/2015 Lima Reply Wouldn’t it be better to lock it so that even if you can’t have it back, they won’t be able to enjoy ‘their’ iPad either.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 3 March 2017 | MYT 4:43 PM Apple’s UK suit against Qualcomm adds to global patent war by aoife white Litigation-happy: Apple is separately suing Qualcomm in California, accusing it of monopolising the market for chips for wireless devices and withholding US$1bil (RM4.44bil) in retaliation for cooperating with South Korean antitrust authorities. — AFP Apple Inc sued Qualcomm Inc in a UK court, adding to lawsuits across the globe in a sprawling battle over patents and licensing fees between the iPhone developer and the largest designer of mobile phone chips.  A court document cites a claim on patents and registered designs. Court records don’t give further details on the patents involved or the company’s arguments. While court records indicated the filing was made March 2, Apple said the UK case was initially lodged Jan 23. Qualcomm said it hadn’t seen the complaint and couldn’t comment on it.  Apple is separately suing Qualcomm in California, accusing it of monopolising the market for chips for wireless devices and withholding US$1bil (RM4.44bil) in retaliation for cooperating with South Korean antitrust authorities.  At the heart of the dispute between Apple and Qualcomm is a push by phone makers, with support of some regulators, to reduce the patent royalties Qualcomm charges. Qualcomm gets the bulk of its revenue from selling chips, but more than half of its profit from a separate licensing business.  In response to a request for comment on the March 2 legal filing, Apple referred to a statement the company issued when it filed the US suit on Jan 20, saying Qualcomm has for many years “unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with.”  ”Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties,” Apple said in the January statement. “Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined.”  The lawsuits add to a US Federal Trade Commission antitrust suit against Qualcomm and investigations by the European Union and Taiwan. South Korea fined the company 1.03tril won (RM3.96bil) in December over practices it said were monopolistic.  “It’s not surprising in big global cases for there to be parallel litigation that breaks out in many different jurisdictions,” said Sophie Lawrance, a partner specializing in competition law at Bristows LLP in London.  “This one is perhaps slightly different, in that it seems to be Apple that’s bringing all the actions. A more typical patent case would be for company A to file” cases in some countries “and then company B counter sues” in others. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Malaysian shuttlers safe after an eventful flight to Birmingham Pyongyang bans Malaysians from leaving N.

Both Apple iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus are available at a cashback discount of Rs 7,000. The company's older-generation iPhone 5S too is available at a cashback discount of Rs 5,000. View As Photolist » 10 things Apple didn't tell you about iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus 111 10 things Apple didn't tell you about iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus Wonder what's inside Apple's new iPhones? The innards that make the world's 'favourite gadgets' what they are? Recent teardowns reports by Chipworks, teardown.com and iFixit.com have revealed the names of the companies that provide some of the most important components of these smartphones. Also, Apple traditionally never discloses the battery, RAM and other such details too of iPhones. These teardowns reveal such specifications too. So, read on to know the 10 things that Apple didn't tell you about its all-new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.. Intel inside Apple's latest iPhones officially have Intel inside. According to a teardown by research companies Chipworks and teardown.com, both owned by TechInsights, Intel is the key supplier of LTE modems in the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Intel reportedly has four components: baseband LTE modem, two transceivers and a power management chip. Qualcomm modems However, since Intel modems don't support CDMA, iPhone 7 versions using this technology sport Qualcomm's modems, according to Chipworks. As per a report in Forbes, "It appears that Qualcomm-equipped phones will be sold in the US (Verizon and Sprint), China, Hong Kong, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. Meanwhile, Intel-equipped phones will be sold in the US (AT&T and T-Mobile) and most other countries in the world." TSMC processor The A10 Fusion processor in the iPhone 7 is being single sourced from TSMC. According to Chipworks, Apple's part number for the A10 is APL1W24, 339S00255 vs the Apple A9, which was APL1022, 339S00129. Microphones iPhone 7 has three microphones, one at the bottom of the phone and two at the top. The microphones at the bottom are said to have been sourced by Goertek and Knowles. As per iFixit teardown of iPhone 7 Plus, STMicroelectronics has also "scored design wins" into the device. Flash memory from SK Hynix and Toshiba As for flash memory, teardowns reveals marks of SK Hynix and Toshiba. iSight camera: Sony iPhone 7's iSight camera has a larger, F/1.8 aperture, as compared to the F/2.2 aperture used for iPhone 6s/6s Plus. The iSight camera chip was sourced from Sony and fabricated using its Exmor RS technology platform. Touch-screen controller According to Chipworks, the Touch Controller for iPhone 7 is manufactured by Universal Scientific Industries (USI) with markings O1 1R. It is the same as the iPhone 6S -- a pressure-sensitive 3D Touch layer that buzzes slightly when you press and hold the screen/static home button. Chipworks says that though no markings were found on the IC, it is believed to be of Analog Devices. Wi-Fi: Murata The Wi-Fi/Bluetooth socket has been won by Murata with a module part number 339S00199 as per Chipworks. GPS: Broadcom Broadcom too wins a slot in the iPhone 7 as per Chipworks. It possibly contains Sensor Hub functionality as well like BCM4773 & BCM4774 seen in Samsung devices. Battery According to iFixit's teardown, the battery is rated at 3.82 V and 2900mAh, for a total of 11.1 Wh, a slight upgrade over the 10.45 Wh (3.8 V, 2750mAh) of the 6s Plus, and on par with the 11.1 Wh, 2915mAh cell found in the 6 Plus. This is a limited period offer and is is not available online. Interested buyers can avail the offer at brick-and-mortar retail stores only. The cashback offer is valid on full-swipe transactions (i.e non-EMI/financing options) of select banks' debit and credit cards and cannot be combined with any other offer. The banks include American Express, HDFC Bank, HSBC Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, RBL Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Yes Bank, Union Bank and more. Apple launched iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus in India in October 2015. Both the iPhone models come with 3D Touch and 2GB RAM. The Apple smartphones sport 12-megapixel iSight camera, capable of shooting 4K videos. The front FaceTime camera is 5-megapixels. The duo feature faster-second-generation TouchID sensor and are made of tough aircraft grade aluminium, same as Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge . Under the hood is the new 64-bit A9 chipset that is claimed to be 70% faster at carrying out processes than the one in iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus smartphones. Similarly, the graphics processing too is said to have jumped 90% aided by a new graphics processor versus previous-generation models. In September 2016, Apple India slashed the prices of both iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus smartphones by as much as Rs 22,000. However, the price cuts were announced only for the top-end storage (128GB) variants of the two smartphones. Apple iPhone users, you may need to 'throw away' your Lightning cables The report also says that the upcoming iPhone models will feature a bigger OLED curved display and will be without a home button. Apple appears to be doing well in the top-end segment in the Indian market. According to a recent report by market research firm Counterpoint, in FY16, the company sold over 2.5 million iPhones. Globally too, Apple beat Samsung to emerge as the top smartphone brand in the world during the last quarter of the year 2016. The company ended Samsung's reign at top after five years.

Then in June 2016 Apple quietly created an energy subsidiary called 'Apple Energy.' So it was anything but a surprise to learn that Apple's CEO introduced an advanced screening of the new film by Al Gore last night to a Silicon Valley audience.   Prior to last night's event, the news of the new project surfaced at the Sundance film festival in January. In 2006, "An Inconvenient Truth" propelled Al Gore's climate change activism to a new level of awareness, proving that distilling a PowerPoint to a feature-length format doesn't have to make great cinema to achieve its goals. A decade later, "An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power" does it all over again, with somewhat more engaging filmmaking and a far greater sense of urgency.   Co-directed by Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk (taking the reigns from "Truth" director Davis Guggenheim), the filmmakers manage to improve on the limitations of the original by showing more of Gore's resilience in the field. For more on this story, see Indiewire's original report.     Apple's CEO Introduces Al Gore at Silicon Valley Event   Those interested in this subject can buy Al Gore's book on Amazon here.     For more reviews from Rotten Tomatoes, click here.

Apple's upcoming "iPhone 8" is expected to feature a virtual home button embedded in the display, but questions persist over the role of Touch ID in such a radical redesign, as conflicting reports from analysts, rumors of biometric alternatives, and Apple patents abound. Today, DigiTimes cited industry sources claiming that an Apple-designed "built-in fingerprint sensor device" is indeed on the way, and will replace the traditional capacitive touch technology known as Touch ID. Apple has selected neither Synaptics' Natural ID touch fingerprint sensor nor Qualcomm's Sense ID fingerprint technology for its new OLED iPhones, and decided to use its own Authentec algorithm combined with Privaris glass identification technology to redesign a new fingerprint ID solution, according to industry sources.Apple's Touch ID fingerprint sensor technology originally came from AuthenTec, which Cupertino acquired in 2012, while the Privaris reference harks back to a patent portfolio Apple bought from the closed biometric security firm in June 2015 that included dozens of patents relating to fingerprint and touchscreen technology, including – in at least one example – the ability to use a touchscreen and fingerprint reader at the same time. DigiTimes has sources within Apple's supply chain, but it has a mixed track record at reporting on Apple's unannounced product plans, so this latest report should be treated with caution. That said, additional claims made in the article potentially clarify mixed messages regarding production timelines for this year's iPhone line-up: Apple's in-house developed fingerprint ID solution will be fabricated at TSMC's 12-inch line using 65nm process technology, said the sources, adding that production for the new OLED iPhone is unlikely to start until September due to the redesigned fingerprint ID solution.Information gathered previously by other sources from the supply chain suggested that Apple plans to ramp up iPhone 8 production in June, because that would allow Apple to work out any manufacturing issues in the design and lead to better supply in preparation for a September launch. However, according to DigiTimes' sources, Apple will enter volume production in July only for "two other new iPhones, which will retain LCD for their displays" – suggesting reports of an early summer ramp-up relate exclusively to the two "S" cycle iPhones that Apple is also rumored to be launching this year. What that could mean for the fate of the "iPhone 8" remains unclear, but not starting production until September would leave supplies limited for a fall launch. Finally, the report goes on to claim that the tenth-anniversary edition iPhone will use "biometric authentication systems such as ultrasound", adding to the possible mix of facial recognition and iris scanning technologies also rumored to be in the works. Apart from the edge-to-edge display supplied by Samsung, other features more widely expected for the "iPhone 8" include some form of wireless charging and a glass body.

But put it in the top corner opposite the camera. That is a more natural spot to reach than the middle. I don't think anything about the fingerprint sensor being on the back is convenient or natural. There are literally thousands of times I have unlocked my phone using touch ID while it is sitting on my desk or a table, something not possible with the sensor on the back. The front is the way to go, in my opinion. Rating: 24 Votes Appleaker 4 days ago at 03:08 am This makes more sense than abandoning Touch ID.

That is a more natural spot to reach than the middle. This would suck. you would have to reach to high to get to touch ID. The below image shows where it gets tricky to reach in terms of just the screen. The problem increases with the size of the device. So even if this is device is the same as the 6, having touch ID higher than the actual screen would make the stretch far too great for the majority of users. Rating: 9 Votes dannys1 4 days ago at 03:09 am I really wish MacRumors had split notifications for iOS blog, Mac stuff etc. I find the iPhone rumours tediously dull. I'd enjoy the iPhone reveal a lot more not knowing what was going to be in it, but ever year we've basically seen every single part of it leak first - no wonder it's not a surprise. But hey, it's a rumours site, that's cool, I know people like this sort of stuff - I just wish the brilliant notifications could be split up so I can see when new Mac hardware is due, macOS updates launch and all that jazz without every iPhone part and rumour too. (P.S. I also find all the iPhone rumours painfully obvious anyway.

Apple's in-house developed fingerprint ID solution will be fabricated at TSMC's 12-inch line using 65nm process technology, said the sources, adding that production for the new OLED iPhone is unlikely to start until September due to the redesigned fingerprint ID solution. Apple is reportedly looking to introduce a major redesign of its flagship smartphone series for 2017 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. In addition to the removal of the home button, the model will be the first iPhone to have an OLED display. The upcoming OLED iPhone will also feature a built-in fingerprint sensor device, instead of traditional capacitive touch technology, and use biometric authentication systems such as ultrasound, the sources indicated. Apple is expected to enter volume production for two other new iPhones, which will retain LCD for their displays, in July, the sources said.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Quick Thinking Saves 2015 MacBook Pro Owner As Notebook Explodes Melting Motherboard And Fans By Ramish Zafar Feb 28, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Ah technology. It’s a bliss. Our gadgets have made sure that connectivity , work and lay are a lot easier to achieve even from our homes. For the 21st century, silicon is akin to the invention of the wheel. However, even as it’s become a constant part of our lives, using gadgets comes with its own sets of risks. Our electronics are a careful balance of chemicals that can produce disastrous results should things go wrong. Today, we’ve got just that case for you. A 2015 Apple MacBook Pro has exploded, with its user staying safe. Take a look below for more. Apple MacBook Pro Explodes Due To Battery Malfunction; Notebook Completely Destroyed Samsung’s set a bad precedent for the tech media. The Galaxy Note 7’s exploding batteries have not only left the Korean tech giant red faced, but they’ve also made users ultra sensitive to any similar reports. Apple isn’t safe from explosions either, as we’ve seen a lot of reports surface for the iPhone 6 lineup. In fact, the iPhone 6 Plus developed strange battery issues a while back, which Apple has solved recently. Advertisement Now, today’s report of a MacBook Pro exploding is very disconcerting. As common sense dictates, laptops are much bigger than smartphones. Therefor, the chances of damage from such malfunction on them also increase as size increases. User Daniel Dourvaris was saved by some quick thinking, as his notebook started to hiss fire while on battery power. Dourvaris was using his MacBook lying on his bed when it started to hiss smoke. He got up and ran to his bathroom, to drop the device on ceramic tiles. The heat emanating front he MacBook was so severe that it burned his fingers as well. As he stepped away, there was a band and the notebook continued to hiss acidic smoke. The laptop was completely destroyed and Dourvaris doesn’t think that his hard disk survived either. The fire melted entire right side of the motherboard and fans. You can gauge the intensity of the fire by taking a look at the MacBook’s backplate in the last image above. We’re glad that Dourvaris wasn’t away from his laptop at the time of explosion. After all, had it caught fire on flammable materials, it would have resulted in very different outcomes. You can take a look at the complete account here. Thoughts? Let us know what you think in the comments section below and stay tuned. We’ll keep you updated on the latest.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software 1,000 Apple Engineers Are Working on AR – Could Debut with iPhone 8 By Uzair Ghani Feb 28, 2017 10Shares Share Tweet Submit A new research note suggests that Apple is taking augmented reality (AR) pretty seriously as the company has 1,000 engineers working on the tech. Augmented Reality Could Debut with the iPhone 8, But How Will it Work? Apple is not shy to admit that AR is the next big thing. In fact, Tim Cook went on record to state that the tech could be as big as the iPhone itself. And to further add fuel to an already blazing fire that Apple is very much interested in this field, a research note from UBS confirms that notion. According to it, Apple has 1,000 engineers working on AR and its first traces could debut with this year’s monumental smartphone, the iPhone 8. The engineers are believed to be working on the tech in Israel, according to BusinessInsider, who claim to have seen the research note. Advertisement In a research note seen by Business Insider, Milunovich writes that Apple CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly “broken the silence on future products with regards to AR,” citing numerous comments he has made about AR as evidence that the company is pursuing it as the next big thing. The reason why Apple went ahead with AR instead of VR is interesting as well. In VR, a person is completely isolated from the outside world in order to experience something. Whereas in AR, people connect with each other without any sort of boundaries in between. Basically, Apple wants to deliver a more open experience rather than something that blocks out the outside world. Milunovich notes that Apple appears more interested in AR rather than virtual reality (VR), because the former connects people whereas the latter is often an isolating experience involving a headset that renders the user blind to the real world. How Apple aims to pull off its AR related tricks is absolutely unknown at this point. But there have been reports that the iPhone 8 will come packed with a depth sensing camera, which might end up being used as a key driver in Apple’s endeavors into the augmented reality space. But of course, that remains to be seen. We will keep our readers updated if there’s more news from this front.

  SOFTPEDIA®   Windows   Drivers   Games   Mac   Android   Linux   News Softpedia > News > Wearable Tech FLASH SALE: Driver Booster 4      40% OFF! Apple Watch Records Best Quarter and Lands on the Podium in the Wearables Market GO The global wearables market reached a new all-time high Mar 3, 2017 07:07 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  The worldwide wearables market reached a new all-time high of 33.9 million units shipped in the last quarter of 2016, according to a new study by research firm IDC. The market grew 16.9% year over year, while 102.4 million devices were shipped in 2016, 25% more compared to the previous year. Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2 recorded the best quarter ever, as Apple shipped an estimated 4.6 million Apple Watch devices in Q4, up from 4.1 million in Q4 2015. The company landed on the third place in the last quarter of 2016, aided by the lower entry price and the inclusion of GPS on the Series 2. “Apple is one of the few companies that has been able to quickly refocus its watch to gain traction in the consumer market and has also been leading the charge on introducing the smartwatch category to the commercial segment,” the report says. Fitbit continues to hold the lead position, followed by Xiaomi Fitbit recorded one of the largest declines ever in the fourth quarter, after shipping 6.5 million units, down from 8.4 million in Q4 2015. The company’s market share dropped from 29% to 19.2%, while Xiaomi managed to capture a market share of 15.4%. Xiaomi managed to ship 5.2 million units and increased its market share from 9.1% in the last quarter of 2015. Top five wearables vendors in Q4 2016 Samsung was the fifth largest wearables vendor in the market with 1.9 million shipments and 5.6% market share. Its Gear S3 Classic and Frontier devices managed to raise the company’s market share from 4.7% in 2015, recording a 37.9% year-on-year growth. Samsung is the only major company that offers cellular-enabled wearables, which certainly increased the company’s sales. The South Korean company also sells the Gear Fit 2 and IconX, but these two wearables recorded lower than expected shipment volumes. Garmin recorded a slight decline and landed on the fourth position in Q4 2016, with a 6.2% market share and 2.1 million shipped units.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (3 Images) #Apple#Watch Series 1#Warch Series 2#Gear S3 Classic#Gear S3 Frontier subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (3 Images) 01 02 03 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Fitbit Might Lay Off Up to 10% of Its Staff Huawei Watch 2 with Cellular Connectivity Reportedly Coming Next Month Two Android Wear 2.0 Google Smartwatches Might Arrive in Early 2017 HTC’s Halfbeak Smartwatch Running Android Wear Leaks in Photos Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1 Google Play Celebrates Five Years, Here Are the Most Downloaded Games and Apps Samsung Confirms Delay of Android Nougat Update to Galaxy S6 and S6 edge Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1 3 photos    Apple Watch Series 2 New Apps Vectr: Seamlessly develop graphic elements that you can use for your website, business-card, T-shirt or applications using this intuitive program Arclab Website Link Analyzer: SEO optimization tool that can analyze a website to help you find broken links and other problems that might result in a lower search engine ranking Reimage: Assess you computer's stability and discover any possible security issues with the help of this PC repair tool that improves your machine's performance A1 Website Scraper: Scrape information from websites by using crawlers that can be customized to extract the specified type of data and save the results on your local drive A1 Sitemap Generator: An efficient and reliable application that performs various automatic tasks such as scan website, build sitemap and FTP sitemap upload Stellar Phoenix Mailbox Exchange Recovery: A comprehensive application that enables you to recover EDB files from corrupt or damaged servers, in a quick and effortless manner Fast Video Downloader: A lightweight and straightforward application that allows you to download your favorite videos from several online hosting websites Reader comments Xiaomi's Huami Unveils Amazfit Sports Smartwatch more on: Xiaomi i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Apple continues legal battle with Qualcomm, files new lawsuit in U.K. Apple has expanded its ongoing legal battle against Qualcomm by adding a new lawsuit in the U.K, according to a report from Bloomberg.  This is the third patent lawsuit by Apple against Qualcomm this year. At the beginning of this year, Apple filed a $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm saying that Qualcomm has been charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with. In the same month, the company filed second lawsuit against Qualcomm at the Beijing Intellectual Property Court in China seeking 1 billion yuan ($145.32 million) in damages. The details about the latest UK lawsuit are minimal at the moment but as per the report are related to patents and design. Apple did not say anything about the latest lawsuit and provided the same statement as January. Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties. Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined.

Apple's 2017 iPhones to Feature Lightning Ports, Not USB Type-C GO Apple is not giving up on the Lightning port Mar 3, 2017 06:18 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Reports from a few days ago revealed that Apple might be making another major change to its iPhone devices and replace the Lightning port with USB Type-C on upcoming units. The move was said to be made on the iPhone 8, the phone that will mark the ten-year anniversary since the first iPhone was announced. The move wouldn’t have been that surprising, considering that Apple unexpectedly ditched the 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7 launched last year. It would have certainly caught the attention of the market and Apple’s upcoming phones would have followed the trend to adopt USB Type-C ports, found on the company’s latest MacBooks. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has stated for Apple Insider that the Lightning port will remain on all of Apple’s three new iPhones that will be announced later this year. Fast charging Lightning port to remain on the iPhone 8 The analyst says that Apple will most likely keep the fast charging Lightning port on the iPhone 8. The Lightning port is slightly thinner than USB Type-C and one advantage of switching to this new option is high-speed data transmission. However, Kuo says that this is a “niche application” for the iPhone, and many users prefer to sync data through the cloud. The analyst says that rather than changing the charging port on the upcoming iPhone, Apple would most likely modify the cable. The iPhone will still feature a Lightning port, but with a USB Type-C cable on the other end, in order to benefit from fast charging capabilities. The new iPhones would feature “Type-C Power Delivery,” as well as power management technology from Texas Instruments and power delivery chips from Cypress. The anniversary iPhone could also come with faster charging using the new “2-cell L-shaped battery pack design,” according to the report. Aside from fast charging, the new Apple iPhones are also expected to feature contact-based wireless charging. #Apple#iPhone 8#Lightning port#USB Type-C#Fast charging subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Might Announce New iPhone SE with 128GB This Month Apple Files Patent for Scroll-like iPhone with Retractable Display Apple’s Next iPhone Could Come with AR Features - Report Fingerprint Wars: iPhone 8 Makes More Sense than the Galaxy S8 in So Many Ways Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1 Google Play Celebrates Five Years, Here Are the Most Downloaded Games and Apps Samsung Confirms Delay of Android Nougat Update to Galaxy S6 and S6 edge Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1    Lightning port on iPhone 7 Plus new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple iPhone 8 to Feature a Redesigned Fingerprint Sensor more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

 This Chinese tech company wants Apple to build its own in-display fingerprint sensor James Cook Feb. 28, 2017, 10:38 AM 1,241 facebook linkedin twitter email print Goodix's in-display fingerprint sensor. Business Insider/James Cook BARCELONA, Spain — Goodix, a Chinese technology manufacturer that has released a fingerprint reader that can be embedded within the screens of smartphones, wants Apple to produce its own version of the feature for the iPhone 8. That's a surprising statement — once Apple releases its own version of an in-display fingerprint sensor, Goodix's product is no longer new and innovative. But CTO Bo Pi told Business Insider at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona that Apple launching its own sensor will likely lead to even more Android phone manufacturers wanting to buy Goodix's sensor. Goodix's product is sold directly to Android phone manufacturers who can use it in their own devices. It means that people don't have to rest their thumb or finger on a physical button, but instead can unlock their phone by placing a finger directly on the screen at a designated point. Goodix fingerprint sensors are currently found in Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, ZTE, LG, Nokia, and ASUS phones, the company said. But it expects demand to increase when Apple builds its own version. Apple is rumoured to be working on its own in-display fingerprint sensor for the upcoming iPhone 8. It is expected that Apple will remove the physical home button entirely, instead increasing the screen size of the device. Fast Company reports that Apple may even remove the power and volume buttons, which would mean the iPhone 8 will have no physical buttons.

By Lucas Shaw. Added by Agency Staff on 3 March 2017. Saved under Top, World Tags: Apple, Google, SoundCloud, Spotify Tweet Spotify has surpassed 50m subscribers, extending its lead over rivals Apple Music, SoundCloud and Google as the world’s largest paid music streaming service. The service, owned by Stockholm-based Spotify, has been growing at a breakneck pace. The company said it had 30m subscribers less than a year ago, and 40m subscribers in September. Apple, owner of the second-largest paid service, said last month its streaming service has more than 20m customers. Adding paying customers will help Spotify pitch investors, who expect the company to file for an initial public offering and are looking for signs the company can convert its growing subscriber base into a sustainable business. Spotify, which is unprofitable, generates almost all of its sales from subscriptions, though the music service also has tens of millions of additional users who listen for free, supported by advertising. Spotify charges a standard rate of US$9,99/month and also offers promotions and discounts, including a $4,99 plan for students. (The service is not available yet in South Africa.) Spotify and other paid streaming services have boosted the entire record industry. Recorded music sales grew 7% in 2016, the fastest pace since piracy obliterated sales nearly 20 years ago, according to a report from Midia, a media research firm. Streaming accounted for $5,4bn of $16,1bn in global record sales. While the growth has been good for most holders of music rights, it has also emboldened Spotify in negotiations with record labels. Spotify hasn’t had long-term deals with any of the three major labels for months, and recent talks have reached a standstill, according to people familiar with the discussions who asked not to be identified discussing private business matters. Spotify does face some pressure to make a deal with labels to help reassure IPO investors. And the clock is ticking. Investors in a previous fundraising round have the right to turn their stakes into shares at a discount to the IPO price, with the discount growing if Spotify takes longer to go public. On the other hand, the longer the labels wait to strike a deal with Spotify, the more users the service adds and the bigger its clout grows.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 9Is it all over for Internet banking? 6Zuma orders welfare grants be paid 6Chaos as welfare payments crisis deepens 5Bank of Baroda ‘closing’ Gupta accounts 5SqwidNet IoT network now live in Gauteng Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

However, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo clarifies that all the three devices slated to release this year will continue to sport the Lightning port, but Apple looks to deploy the 'USB Type-C Power Delivery' technology in the power chord to adopt fast charging. MacRumors got hold of Kuo's research note, and he clarifies that Apple will stick to its Lightning port on the iPhone 8 and its other two phones. "We believe all three new iPhones launching in 2H17 will support fast charging by the adoption of Type-C Power Delivery technology (while still retaining the Lightning port)," says Kuo in his research note. Apple iPhone 8 Specifications, Release Date, and More - Leaks and Rumours So Far This means that Apple will tweak on the internal components to integrate the USB Type-C port's 'Type C Power Delivery', but will retain the physical Lightning connector. These new components are reportedly going to be sourced from Texas Instruments and Cypress. This, along with Apple's earlier rumoured 2-cell L shaped battery will allow it to charge really fast. Maybe, this shift also has something to do with wireless charging integration, however that is pure speculation. Also, this essentially means that you could plug the new USB Type-C power cord into the latest MacBook Pro, however, connecting to older MacBooks and PCs still remains a problem. The Lightning connector isn't going anywhere, and Apple can't afford to replace it with a USB Type-C port if it intends to keep the iPhone very slim. The former is smaller than the other, and knowing Apple's aggressive design strategy, that move makes no sense. The iPhone 8 is largely rumoured to sport an all-glass back, a bezel-less OLED display, and no Home Button. There's expected to also be an improved Touch ID technology and an improved 3D Touch functionality as well.

The decision comes two years after a federal court in Texas ordered Apple to pay the award to the little-known firm Smartflash LLC, which sued claiming the technology giant infringed on patents for flash memory technology used in the iTunes music store. Chief Judge Sharon Prost at the US Court of Appeals Federal Circuit in Washington, which handles patent cases, said in the opinion that Smartflash did not create any new technology that was eligible for a patent. The claims by Smartflash “are all directed to the abstract idea of conditioning and controlling access to data based on payment, and fail to recite any inventive concepts sufficient to transform the abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention,” the judge said in the 14-page order. “The Supreme Court and this court… have previously held that such routine computer activities are insufficient for conferring patent eligibility.” Neither company offered any immediate comment on the decision. In 2015, Apple announced it would appeal the award, stating that “Smartflash makes no products, has no employees, creates no jobs, has no US presence, and is exploiting our patent system to seek royalties for technology Apple invented.” Smartflash claimed in the 2013 lawsuit filed in Texas federal court that it held patents to “data storage and access systems” used by Apple’s iTunes store. The technology is used to manage access to digital content and payment information. The case is one of many patent suits from licensing firms that make no products but hold rights to certain technologies. Critics call these firms “patent trolls.” AFP Tags: Apple, federal court, iTunes, Patent, Smartflash, Storage, U.S.A., United States, verdict Also read Apple spent $50 billion in 2016 buying supplies from U.S based suppliers Apple’s Lightning port is here to stay, says analyst; new iPhones to support USB-C charging X Recommended For You Apple files patent for Pencil holder for iPad and iPhone Smart Covers Apple iPhone 8 to launch this year with a 5.8-inch display according to Japanese news agency Nikkei Convertibles and 2-in-1 tablets are still in demand, says IDC Apple iPhone 6 32GB Space Grey variant available for Rs 28,999 on Amazon Subscribe to our newsletter GO You are Now Subscribed to our Newsletter - Stay Tuned !

Apple and Samsung lead the smartphone pack worldwide but impressive growth in the Chinese market has left room for a host of home-grown manufacturers to come to the fore, with China’s Huawei now third in the world. Within China, Oppo surged to become market leader last year and it is expanding rapidly in Asia to stand fourth in the world rankings, even if its brand is little known in developed and increasingly stagnant Western markets. A closely related Chinese brand, Vivo, has muscled its way into fifth place globally. What this means, though, is that former Chinese market leaders, such as Lenovo and TCL Communications, are losing ground, and some are counting on retro Western brands to revive their fortunes at home and abroad. Emerging from a sea of indistinguishable smartphones, the showstopper at this year’s main European technology trade fair was a revival of the Nokia 3310, its brightly coloured cases and month-long battery life tugging at the heartstrings of erstwhile fans in search of a digital detox. Read | Nokia 3310 is back. Here are 5 things you need to know The new phone was launched by Finnish firm HMD Global, led by former Nokia executives and backed financially by Chinese electronics giant Foxconn, which makes devices for Apple and Sony, among others. Priced at 49 euros, the 3310 is meant to appeal to old fans in the West as well as finding a new generation of younger users in emerging markets looking for a good-looking reliable phone. The BlackBerry made a splash at the Barcelona trade fair too thanks to China’s TCL Communication, which unveiled a BlackBerry-licensed handset with the physical keyboard many professionals clung onto even as Apple’s iPhone revolutionised the smartphone market. BlackBerry Ltd supplies the phone’s security software. TCL, which is part of a group that makes appliances ranging from TVs to washing machines, has kept France’s Alcatel brand alive for a decade. TCL-Alcatel is now the world’s 10th biggest smartphone maker, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. International expansion Lenovo, the world’s third largest mobile phone supplier in 2014 when it acquired U.S. cellphone pioneer Motorola, has subsequently sunk to ninth globally but is counting on Motorola as its premium smartphone brand to battle back. The Chinese firm is even open to following in Nokia’s footsteps and reviving the retro, flip-top Motorola Razr, which was the second best selling phone in the world in 2004 and 2005. Lenovo Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing told CNBC this week that launching a revamped Razr could be a way of bringing customers back to the Motorola brand as it tries to drive into developed markets such as the United States. Read | BlackBerry’s new KEYone smartphone could boost company’s fortunes The Philips handset brand also lives on in India and China after the Dutch firm licenced its brand to Sang Fei, a subsidiary of TPV Technology, which also makes Philips television sets. For now, though, the top Chinese phone makers such as Huawei, Oppo and Vivo, look set on developing their own brands in a domestic market that is still growing even as demand in developed economies plateaus. China accounted for more than a third of the world’s mobile phones shipped last year and domestic firms still had 90 percent of sales, according to a government report. But as the market becomes overrun with me-too smartphones and margins evaporate, rivals may spot more opportunities to leapfrog rivals by capitalising on familiar Western brands, said Strategy Analytics analyst Neil Mawston. “As the Chinese market peaks and organic growth becomes harder, these brands may consider takeovers as the fastest way to speed up their expansion,” he said, refering to moves overseas. “At some point, either Huawei, Vivo or Oppo may come to the point where buying an existing international brand is their best way to expand,” Mawston said.

Instead, the Big A will likely introduce a series of internal changes to accommodate the much-desired fast charging capability. The hardware tweaks will ultimately enable Apple to replicate some of the power benefits that come with USB Type-C and still maintain its signature Lightning connector. As 9to5Mac remarks, it remains unclear whether this rumor has any relation to previous reports about wireless charging. Kuo further noted that although USB-C would certainly trump the capabilities of the Lightning connector, the Cupertino heavyweight has little incentive to make the transition. The report makes no reference as to how the possible adoption of USB-C fits in with the rest of the Apple ecosystem and upcoming iPad lineup. As of now, the two primary reasons Kuo lists for sticking with Lightning are royalties from licensing deals as well as the compact size of the technology, which allows Apple to cram more tech into a smaller body. As we mentioned in our initial coverage, while Apple would indeed lose some revenue from licensing deals, the transition to USB-C makes sense in light of the latest lineup of MacBook Pros – especially since the switch will enable customers to use the same cable for both their phones and laptops. In any case, chances are we’ll likely have to wait at least one more year until Apple finally decides to make a radical design change in the iPhone that also happens to be user-friendly.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Magnus Jonasson The Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8 might both be impossible to buy at launch Chris Smith @chris_writes March 2nd, 2017 at 7:01 PM Share Tweet With Mobile World Congress now over, it’s pretty clear that the Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8 will be two of the top handsets of the year. Samsung will unveil its next flagship in late March and launch it sometime in April, while Apple will announce and release its next-gen iPhones in September. But a new report hints that shortages might be in stores for both handsets, and the Galaxy S8 might suffer more than the iPhone 8. Don't Miss: Exclusive: This is the Galaxy S8 It turns out that component suppliers aren’t able to meet demands for the next-gen 10nm chips that are supposed to power both Samsung and Apple’s next phones. The iPhone 8 is expected to feature an A11 chip built on TSMC’s 10nm process. The Galaxy S8, meanwhile, will have 10nm chips from Qualcomm (the Snapdragon 835) and Samsung (the Exynos 8995), both manufactured by Samsung. But Digitimes’ supply chain sources say that 10nm yield rates don’t look promising at all. The sources say that yield rates have pushed back schedules to launch next-gen products — such is the case with the Galaxy S8, which was reportedly delayed in part because of production issues with the Snapdragon 835. TSMC’s 10nm yields have “been too low to boost the process to economies of scale,” the report notes. The next-gen iPhone chip isn’t specifically mentioned, but there’s one piece of evidence that seems to also indicate Apple might be affected. A few days ago, news broke out that Apple’s 2017 iPads would launch in May or June, much later than the anticipated March window. Are low 10nm chip yields to blame? Digitimes does mention one TSMC client that’ll be directly affected by the delays: MediaTek. The company’s Helio X30, a 10nm chip, was delayed as well. MediaTek expects to provide Helio X30 chips to handset makers in the second half of the year. MediaTek co-COO Jeffrey Ju confirmed the news to Nikkei, saying that the chip “a bit delayed because the yield rate of 10nm process technology has not yet reached a satisfactory level.” If foundries are able to improve 10nm yield rates in the second quarter, smartphones using the new chips will account for 10% of the overall shipments during the quarter, the report says.

The Lightning port itself will remain on the iPhone. A misinterpreted Wall Street Journal report suggested that Apple will ditch the Lightning port for USB-C, but as we pointed out, such a move, while welcome, would make little sense from Apple’s perspective. Lightning is slimmer than USB-C, Apple’s Lightning headphones and accessories will become redundant and Apple will lose the revenue it gets from licensing the port. It does make sense that Apple replaces the older USB-A to Lightning cables for USB-C to Lightning ones. While faster than USB-A, USB-C’s main advantage is its enhanced power handling capabilities. Apple has also ditched the USB-A ports on its refreshed MacBook lineup and left dedicated Apple users with no option but to purchase USB-C to USB-A adapters. The iPhone maker is expected to ship three new phones later this year. New iPads and a slightly refreshed Mac lineup are expected later this month. Obviously, we would much prefer it if Apple did indeed adopt USB-C universally. Imagine a world where you only need one cable and one charger. That would be bliss. But Apple will never have the courage to do something like that.

According to the report, Apple is planning on ditching the Lightning port altogether in favor of the USB Type-C. Many consumers got a bit excited because the shift will bring forth much compatibility with Apple’s entire ecosystem. However, to some, the news did not come across as amusing but rather perplexing. Since initial rumors of the iPhone 8 broke out, there have been no mention of the change from Lightning to USB. Even Mac Otakara, who reported last year that Apple will ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack, did not touch the subject. And now, Ming-Chi Kuo, a very well-known analyst from KGI Securities, boldly disputed the rumours about the Lightning to USB shift. According to Kuo, it is highly unlikely that Apple will get rid of the Lightning port anytime soon. To Kuo, there are a number of reasons why Apple will not do the switch, top of which is royalty. Apple owns the patent for the Lightning port. Because of this, anyone who uses the interface would have to pay Apple a sum of money in accordance to the MFi agreement. Apple would want to milk as much profit from the technology like it did for the now defunct 30-pin dock connector. iPhone Lightning port (via arstechnica.com) Another reason is the size. USB Type-C interface is physically bigger than the Lightning port connector or interface. As many would know by now, Apple is very particular with what it uses on the iPhone due to space constraints. In addition to disputing the rumor, Kuo added that instead of getting rid of the Lightning port, Apple will introduce some improvements to it. The improvement will come in the form of fast charging, something similar to the USC Type-C standard. Kuo still maintained that Apple will release three new iPhones this year. Two of these will be the update of the current iteration, the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. Meanwhile, the main highlight of the September event will be the iPhone 8. This new iPhone is rumoured to have a 5-inch curved OLED display in addition to a plethora of upgrades. For more updates on the iPhone 8, be sure to check out TheBitbag.

KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo says that all three models of the iPhone (dubbed iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone 8) will retain the existing Lightning port. However, Apple will make internal upgrades that will add fast charging capabilities. Apparently, Apple will be modifying the power management technologies in the iPhone that will add new ‘fast charging’ capabilities. This would bring the same USB-C power delivery features without changing the physical connector from Lightning to USB-C. To accomplish this, Apple will be sourcing new components from Texas Instruments and Cypress. Also, the new L-shaped battery technology in the iPhone 8 will enable faster charging as well. Kuo says that whilst he USB-C port would be capable of providing faster charging than the current maximum speed of Lightning USB 3, it’s not a big enough reason for Apple to change the connector on the iPhone, stating that it’s a ‘niche application’. KGI says that there are two reasons why Apple is holding back on switching to USB-C: MFi royalties from the iOS accessory ecosystem, and form factor. The USB-C port is larger than the Lightning port.

Apple CEO Tim Cook and Senior Vice President of Environmental Policy Lisa Jackson were also in attendance, with Cook delivering an introduction for the film that was recorded by venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson (via 9to5Mac). In his opening remarks, Cook said while there are signs "all around us of the climate crisis" there's also plenty of reason to be optimistic about the future. Cook points out that renewable energies have been developed and deployed around the world in the past couple of years, and that "almost every country" in the world has agreed to combat climate change and reward renewable energy use. After the screening, Gore went on to praise Apple, commending them for using 100 percent renewable energy in some countries and pushing hard to do the same on a global scale. He calls Apple the most environmentally friendly company in the world, and praises the Cupertino company for showing other companies that it's possible to be profitable and invests in renewable energy at the same time. In January, Greenpeace declared Apple the "Greenest Tech Company" for the third straight year. "An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power" opens in theaters July 28, 2017.

Now how about cut back recycling programs by making machines serviceable and upgradable. Use less glue and more screws. Planet before profits, Tim. This. For all Apple talks about the virtues of renewable energy and such, it ignores the virtues of creating products whose lifetimes can be extended through re-use/re-purposing/repair (which would reduce e-waste), probably because this would inconveniently interfere with its bottom line. Rating: 20 Votes ChrisMoBro 4 days ago at 11:53 pm The true title is A Convenient Farce: How Al Gore Makes Billions off the backs of junk science. Here we go, all the "geniuses" who think global warming is a lie. Of course you know more than some of the smartest scientists on the planet with your basic education. Rating: 20 Votes MacsRgr8 4 days ago at 09:56 pm The real inconvenient truth is that we are most likely too late to stop global climate change. You think global climate change is man-made only? Has there never been global climate change before? Of course, man should minimise pollution and waste, but let's not panic about it. Rating: 13 Votes GrumpyMom 4 days ago at 06:09 am All this talk of climate change, which the fossil records show happens on a cyclical basis and planetary science demonstrates happens to lifeless planets, too...yet nobody, not Al Gore, not all the billionaire philanthropists, not Tim ever talks about doing something about the giant, and I mean GIANT masses of plastic garbage floating out in our oceans, killing our sea life. Nobody wants to claim that mess. Or if there are people working on it, their efforts aren't getting the same press that global warming is. There's no way of manipulating economies in tackling it, so year by year it grows. Everyone goes on and on about the oil companies but nobody wants to own the absolute mess we individuals make with our laziness, throwing non biodegradable plastic trash out onto the streets or not cleaning up after a wind storm blows our recycling out onto the street. In my prior neighborhood, I once had to clean up all of my neighbors plastic waste after a wind storm because they were just too busy and important to do it even if our expensive cul de sac looked like a dump. And meanwhile idiots throw plastic trash out of their cars or along their jog paths. I know because I go out with my dog and gloves and I pick all of that crap up before it can end up in our storm drains. I've seen these health nuts on their jogs finish up their water and just dump the bottle on the side of the path. They care enough about their health to jog and probably look down their noses at me for merely plodding along slowly, but they don't care about the health of their environment. Black, white, rich, poor, doesn't matter what demographic you choose, there are litter bugs in every one. I see plastic bottles everywhere, even in front of the lawns of houses that cost almost a million dollars. People walk by it. Homeowners seem blind to it even though it's littering their property. It's like everyone feels they're too good or it's too much bother to bend over and pick up some trash. Yet these are likely to be the same people who make a big noise about climate change. I just don't get it. Don't get me wrong, I am all for curbing emissions and pollution of ANY kind. But I do think some aspects of pollution are more heavily politicized while others are practically ignored. Rating: 10 Votes MH01 4 days ago at 12:02 am Tim political trolling again. While making his products less and less repairable each year resulting in greater waste. Every single pre Tim mac I own has been repaired or upgraded, this Tim is how you contribute to being green. Not by glueing you products and creating waste. Anything....anything goes wrong in the new MacBooks, it's a complete logic board replacement .

The movie comes as a sequel to the original film debuted in 2006. In attendance of the debut in Silicon Valley today were Apple CEO Tim Cook and VP of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives Lisa Jackson… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Cook gave the introduction for the film, talking about climate change as a whole and initiatives currently in place to combat it. The Apple CEO explained that countries are coming together to push towards a cleaner environment and that there are a lot of reasons for optimism: “There are signs all around us of the climate crisis, but there’s also great reasons for optimism. There’s renewable energies that have been developed and are being widely deployed. Almost every country in the world has agreed to do certain things and markets are rewarding renewable energy everywhere.” “There’s a lot of reasons for optimism. But of course the clock still runs and the urgency has never been greater. So I think there’s never been a better time for this film.” After his short opening speech, Cook introduced Al Gore and some of the brains behind the film before the viewing. After the film was shown, Lisa Jackson joined Al Gore and Jeff Skoll on stage for a brief discussion on climate change and the film. For those unfamiliar, “An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power” centers on Gore’s push to battle climate change and follows him from 2006, where the first film left off, up until 2016. Companies like SolarCity are central points of the film. A decade after An Inconvenient Truth brought climate change into the heart of popular culture comes the follow-up that shows just how close we are to a real energy revolution. Apple has been a big proponent of renewable energy. The company powers its operations in the United States, China, and 21 countries by 100 percent renewable, while it hopes to power its worldwide operations by renewable energy eventually. The film is set to be released on July 28th of this year. A brief clip of the film can be seen below, as can Cook’s introductory speech at the viewing.

The fourth macOS Sierra 10.12.4 beta is available for download through the Apple Developer Center or the software update mechanism in the Mac App Store for those who have previously installed a beta. macOS Sierra 10.12.4 brings iOS's Night Shift mode to the Mac for the first time. First introduced on iOS devices with iOS 9.3, Night Shift is designed to gradually shift the display of a device from blue to yellow, cutting down on exposure to blue light. Blue light is said to disrupt the circadian rhythm and is believed to interrupt sleeping patterns. Night Shift can be activated through the Displays section of System Preferences, where a setting to have it come on at sunset and turn off at sunrise is available. Night Shift can also be toggled on manually through the Notification Center or via Siri. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. The 10.12.4 update focuses mainly on Night Shift, but also includes dictation support for Shanghainese, cricket scores for Siri, improved PDFKit APIs, and iCloud Analytics options. Update: Apple has seeded the fourth macOS Sierra 10.12.4 beta to public beta testers.

Me too, I don't get f.lux nor nightshift, colours are all off, don't want to surf the web with less than natural colours. Think I got new firmware on my 2012 MBP, it just restarted when installing. Edit: Yup, both my 2012 MBP and Mac Mini got a firmware update. It's something that helps some to a noticeable degree, while just making things a bit easier for the eyes when it comes to to others. And of course there are others still that don't really get much from it one way or another or don't even want/like it. The good thing is that things of this nature are purely optional, so it kind of works out that way. [doublepost=1488224919][/doublepost] Isn't this video and the one for iOS ones that MR has posted before? I could have sworn these are repeats. I think they include the video for those who might not really have read up much about the previous betas and just come across a particular beta article so that way they can see what's new when it comes to betas/release for that particular iOS version.

First, The Wall Street Journal reported that the upcoming iPhone will feature USB-C, with Apple shifting away from Lightning. Then, earlier today, KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo reported that the iPhone 8 will feature Lightning connectivity with internal changes to support a faster charging. Who do you believe? Take Our Poll Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Kuo generally has a strong track record with these sort of big picture ideas and feature changes, though he’s usually a little less reliable with the smaller details. Kuo, however, has issued a multitude of predictions for the iPhone 8 thus far and seems to have a strong grasp on what exactly the device will feature. On the surface, it’s obvious as to why Apple would switch the iPhone 8 to USB-C. The new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar features four USB-C ports and Apple has heavily touted how the connection has a multitude of different functionalities. If the iPhone 8 featured USB-C, Apple could theoretically produce one USB-C to USB-C for a host of different purposes, including to ship with the iPhone 8. On the other hand, there are some obvious reasons as to why Apple wouldn’t switch to USB-C with the iPhone quite yet, or at all. For one, regulating USB-C accessories is much harder as it is an open standard. Lightning, however, is Apple’s own standard and thus it can more strictly regulate what type of accessories are produced using the connection. Apple also, of course, collects royalties on all certified Lightning accessories. Personally, I’m of the belief that the iPhone 8 will continue to use Lightning, but that what will be included in the box is a USB-C wall adapter and USB-C to Lightning cable. This setup, as it seems right now, offers the best of both worlds for Apple. The Lightning standard and all of its benefits remain, but the added power of USB and easy compatibility with recent MacBooks makes it slightly more modern. What do you think? Will the iPhone 8 feature USB-C or Lightning connectivity? In other words, do you believe KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo or The Wall Street Journal? Let us know in the poll above and in the comments below.

Google Assistant Could Soon Arrive on Apple's iPhone GO Google official hints at a possible release on iOS Mar 3, 2017 02:48 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  The personal digital assistant market is very competitive, as it's not just handset makers that are trying to get a piece of the pie but also giants like Amazon. Google's Assistant, Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, Amazon's Alexa and soon Samsung's Bixby (or whatever the name) are fighting each other for market share. It appears that Google will soon have the upper hand, as the search giant has announced its digital assistant will be rolled out to all supported handsets powered by Android Nougat and Marshmallow. The move is meant to grab as much market share as possible before other major players in the industry could strike deals with handset manufacturers for the addition of their own AI's on their products. But Google might not just stop here. A new report claims Google is seriously taking into consideration putting Google Assistant on the iPhone. Unfortunately, there's no clear answer to this rumor, just a vague statement from a Google official. Play Video Geekster reports Google's product management director Gummi Hafsteinsson has said that his company has nothing to announce at this point in regard to the availability of Google Assistant on the iPhone, but that they “would like to have the Assistant available to as many people as possible.” Could Apple really give up Siri in favor of its rival, Google Assistant? That seems very hard to believe at the moment, but not impossible. Even though Google Assistant is considered by many more advanced than Apple's Siri, the latter features support for a lot more languages than the former. Apple fans can already get a taste of Google Assistant if they're using Allo, since the application features limited integration with the personal digital assistant. Google Assistant is currently available on the Pixel smartphones, but will soon be included on many other Android Nougat and Marshmallow handsets. The AI is also part of Android Wear 2.0, Google Home, and Android TV. #Google Assistant#Apple Siri#digital assistant#Amazon Alexa#Samsung Bixby subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Allo Update Adds Animated Emojis, Google Assistant Button, More Google Assistant Starts Arriving on Eligible Nougat and Marshmallow Devices Google Assistant Confirmed to Arrive on All Nougat and Marshmallow Smartphones Apple Releases macOS 10.12.4 Beta 2 to Developers, iOS 10.3 Public Beta 2 Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1 Google Play Celebrates Five Years, Here Are the Most Downloaded Games and Apps Samsung Confirms Delay of Android Nougat Update to Galaxy S6 and S6 edge Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1    Google Assistant New Android APKs SecondScreen APK: Updated March 7th, 08:29 GMT NHL APK: Updated March 7th, 08:14 GMT Wire APK: Updated March 7th, 08:12 GMT Curiosity APK: Updated March 7th, 08:11 GMT Bubble Witch 3 Saga APK: Updated March 7th, 08:09 GMT Network Signal Guru APK: Updated March 7th, 08:07 GMT Wireless Audio-Multiroom (Tab) APK: Updated March 7th, 08:00 GMT Reader comments Samsung Reportedly Showcased the Galaxy S8 to Select Partners at MWC 2017 more on: Samsung i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

More On: apple Apple will no longer be the world's most valuable company The new iPhone is coming with some big changes Apple probes iPhone 7 Plus explosion Warren Buffett almost triples Apple stake Senior Apple executives have reached out to some of Hollywood’s most successful TV and film producers in the last couple of weeks about going to work for the tech giant, The Post has learned. While at least one of the discussions between Apple and an executive was vague when it came to the tech company’s ultimate goal, the executive was left with the impression that the Cupertino, Calif., company is looking for a transformative acquisition and not just a deal to buy TV shows. There have been reports in recent weeks about Apple looking to kick-start a business in original TV programming. But the meetings last week — including sit-downs between Apple SVP Eddy Cue and Paramount Pictures and with Sony TV and film units — make it appear as though Apple may be aiming at a bigger deal. The move comes as sales of Apple’s profitable iPhone slow. Apple has recently made some small bets on popular culture shows, such as producer Ben Silverman’s “Planet of the Apps” and “Carpool Karaoke,” which it will offer via an Apple Music subscription, “They talked to Sony and Paramount last week. They are preparing something big,” a source told The Post. Whether Apple will pull the trigger on anything s remains to be seen, but time might be running out. Consumers are flocking to alternative streaming services, and Netflix, Amazon and Google are all making a play for filmmakers. Last week, Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos got a seat at the Academy Awards for his company’s best picture nominee, “Manchester by the Sea.” Google’s YouTube announced its own streaming cable TV bundle on Tuesday, a project that Apple had failed to create under Steve Jobs, despite many efforts. Even Sony has its own streaming video bundle, Sony PlayStation Vue. And Netflix, often touted as a potential Apple acquisition, is set to hire its first movie boss and is expanding into reality television shows. “They [Apple] seem to have a lot of trepidation about this world,” said a Hollywood source. Indeed surprisingly, Apple considered acquiring Time Warner but ultimately passed, leaving the field clear for AT&T’s buy. As Apple executives are busying looking to do business in Hollywood, entertainment industry insiders are scratching their heads over who, exactly, is driving the effort. “Robert Kondrk, Eddy Cue, Jimmy Iovine, everyone is trying to be the person,” one insider told The Post. “They each want to be the guy, and they’re telling people, don’t deal with the other one.” “Eddy is talking to some people. Jimmy is talking to others,” noted a second insider. “They just haven’t figured it out.” A third Hollywood insider, familiar with Apple’s thinking, told The Post he didn’t know “if Apple is fully committed … I don’t see them doing this as a startup. It’s too small. It’s too hard. I see them buying something first.” Apple is frequently mentioned as a potential partner for Disney. The two have a common shareholder in Jobs’ widow, Laurene Powell Jobs. Apple, through a spokesman, declined comment.

Reuters/Stephen Lam Good news, Apple fans. The Mac maker could be launching a new iPhone SE this year. Previous reports indicate that the company isn’t releasing an iPhone SE 2017 model, but a new one suggests that a new variant of the miniature Apple smartphone may indeed see the light of day this year. There’s a possibility that Apple may reveal the 2017 iPhone SE at a rumoured March event, a new report suggests. Speculations that the 4-inch iPhone is getting a refresh started due to the fact that the current model is up for inventory clearance at US retailer Target. The giant retailer reportedly received a memo on Wednesday to return its stocked iPhone SE units, which include unlocked 16 GB and 64 GB variants in all four colour choices (gold, rose gold, silver and space grey) plus two Sprint handsets, back to their maker. An anonymous Target employee also reportedly revealed that her store has not received new iPhone SE stocks ever since the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were launched back in September 2016. The timing of the inventory clearance of the current iPhone SE models is somehow thought-provoking. Although there are a lot of likely reasons why the second largest discount store retailer in the US is sending back its iPhone SE stocks – like inadequate sales of certain models, for instance – the clearance comes rather closely ahead of the Cupertino, California-based tech titan’s supposed March conference. Apple may reportedly announce an iPhone SE with 128 GB storage at the event, although no other hardware modifications have been speculated. According to MacRumors, one possible development that could happen in the near future is that Apple starts selling the iPhone SE in 32 GB and 128 GB storage options, boosting the internal memory of the current 16 GB and 64 GB SE units. The mini iPhone SE is an excellent and affordable alternative to significantly more expensive smartphones that are currently available in today’s market, although it has a shortage of features that make other handsets better. Apple senior vice president of marketing Phil Schiller previously said that the iPhone SE is named as such because it is a “special edition” handset, which is the reason why it was initially thought that the company may never release another phone like it ever again. The iPhone SE is a superb choice for Apple fans who want to get an iPhone at a much lower price.

Adam Turner Mar 3, 2017, 1:00pm ⋅ Filed to:  Australian Stories blackberry smh Share This week, a new smartphone brandishing the Blackberry name was unveiled at Mobile World Congress. By all accounts, it looks and feels just like an old Blackberry, albeit running Android in lieu of BlackberryOS. The iPhone and Android generation has grown up with onscreen keyboards, but do old-school smartphone users still pine for their old Blackberry's physical keyboard? Ten years ago, before Apple and Android devices stole the show, RIM's Blackberry was the go-to phone for people who needed to stay productive on the road. They weren't only for business executives, Blackberrys even became fashionable amongst the young starlets of the day who wanted to fire off messages without using the painfully cumbersome T9 predictive text which lets you type on a ten-digit keypad. Blackberry's domination as a portable productivity tool was occasionally challenged by other smartphones with a tiny physical QWERTY keyboard, such as the Palm Treo, HP iPaq Mobile Messenger, Nokia E61 or – my smartphone of choice at the time – a chunky iMate JasJam running Windows Mobile. While the JasJam was a touchscreen device, you could turn the phone sideways and slide the screen up with your thumbs to reveal a physical keyboard – a godsend for wordsmiths on the go. The 3G-capable JasJam was one of Australia's hottest phones of 2007, I think the first to support Telstra's new 850 MHz 3G network. I wore my JasJam clipped to my belt like a pager, along with an onion, which was the style at the time. I got good at bashing out text messages and even short articles on the JasJam's tiny keyboard, especially when flying cattle class where limited elbow room made it impractical to use my IBM ThinkPad. When the iPhone first arrived on the scene it turned heads but was shunned as a productivity tool, largely because it relied on a touchscreen virtual keyboard which was smaller than most smartphone keyboards. Worse yet, the iPhone's onscreen keyboard lacked that tactile feedback of a physical keyboard which many typists value. Real buttons which you can feel let you type more quickly and accurately because there's less chance of accidentally hitting the wrong key and then needing to fight with auto-correct. As usual, Steve Jobs took an Apple-knows-best approach and stuck to his guns, refusing to release an iPhone with a physical keyboard despite the pleas of Crackberry users and travelling wordsmiths who were tempted by Apple's slick iOS. I was determined to stick with my clunky JasJam until I spent time with an iPhone 2G, imported from the US before Apple's new wunderphone was available in Australia. The revolutionary interface and highly responsive touchscreen were such a breath of fresh air that I soon decided to abandon my faithful JasJam and import an iPhone 2G of my own, which I then needed to jailbreak before it would work in Australia. Had there been the option of an iPhone with a built-in keyboard I would have gladly paid extra, but Apple refused to cave in and Android followed suit. Over time I've come to terms with the loss of the physical keyboard, as have most other smartphone users – otherwise third-party keyboard covers for iOS and Android smartphones would have taken off, as they have for tablets. Ten years later we've seen a Blackberry revival at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, albeit from a different manufacturer and now running Android rather than BlackberryOS. Blackberry is no longer cool, except perhaps in the retro way that the Nokia 3310 revival is cool, but Blackberry is still a trusted name in business circles. Considering that it runs Android, it's the physical keyboard which will help the new Blackberry stand out from the crowd. If you don't care about the keyboard then the Blackberry might look like just another also-ran in the cut throat Android market but, in Blackberry's defence, it's also aiming to offer business-grade security features. The big question is, are there enough closet keyboard junkies who are still pining for a Blackberry-style phone? If they're not happy with an onscreen keyboard they've probably embraced the new generation of portable devices such as tablets, Ultrabooks and 2-in-1 devices. Is the new Blackberry the smartphone you've been waiting for? Hands On With The New Nokia 3310 Ever since Nokia introduced the new iteration of its classic 3310 there's been an intense debate going on in my head. Read more Blackberry Returns With The KEYone I feel weird saying this. I really like BlackBerry's new KEYone smartphone. I don't like that I like it, and I don't like the name. I can't change the fact that I want one. This is something I need to accept about myself.

Comments -J Guest Mar 3, 2017, 1:24pm I love a physical keyboard! But a horizontal flipout when you need it makes much more sense to me. The moment they do that, I'll ditch any other device for a keyboard. Reply 0 jaedee884 @jaedee884 Mar 3, 2017, 1:48pm Oh God the imate jasjam. That brings back memories, was my first smart phone, and still to this day I have a love. Of physical keyboards, my favourite two phones was the htc touch dual 850 with its half qwerty keyboard. Instead of a full qwerty or a t9, and the htc desire Z, still dunno why the slider died it was perfect, candy bar layout for quick messages, and full qwerty with symbols and number row for more detailed typing. It was a master piece that was ruined by a subpar battery even back then, and a gimped version of the 1ghz dragon CPU that featured in the htc nexus/desire Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Chris Jager 06 Mar 2017 1:30 PM Dear Lifehacker, I've been a smoker since I was 14. I'm now 22 and I consider myself to be smoking hot (pun intended). I've heard that smoking cigarettes can age you prematurely. However, judging by the before-and-after photos I've seen, most of these people were pretty rough to begin with! Will smoking really ruin my good looks, or will I just go from a 9 to an 8.5? (I whiten my teeth professionally, so that's not a problem.)

The total number of shipments for the quarter reached 33.9 million, an increase of 16.9% year-over-year, with shipments for the full year growing by 25%. The year ended with 102.4 million devices shipped, data from IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker. While Fitbit kept the top spot, it faced one of its largest declines as it kept its focus on the US market. IDC said low-cost competitors were eating away at its share. In the case of Xiaomi, it had adhered to a low-cost strategy and slowly trying to move upwards in terms of pricing, launching new devices with heart-rate monitoring and a slightly higher price. However, IDC said, Xiaomi had little brand recognition outside the China market. Apple had great success, IDC commented, with both its Watch Series 1 and 2, experiencing its best quarter in the wearables market. "The lower entry price point and the inclusion of GPS on the Series 2, along with a completely revamped user interface have helped the company grow its presence," IDC said. "Apple is one of the few companies that has been able to quickly refocus its watch to gain traction in the consumer market and has also been leading the charge on introducing the smartwatch category to the commercial segment." While Garmin, fourth in the market for the quarter, saw a decline of 4%, it managed to raise its selling price to an average of US$258 in the fourth quarter from US$200 last year. Samsung rounded out the top five, with two new models, Gear S3 Classic and Frontier and was still the only wearables manufacturers with cellular connectivity. "Outside of watches, Samsung's portfolio also includes the Gear Fit 2 and the Icon X, though without any smartphone bundles, volumes for these wearables were lower than expected," IDC commented. Ramon Llamas, research manager for IDC's wearables team, said: "Like any technology market, the wearables market is changing. Basic wearables started out as single-purpose devices tracking footsteps and are morphing into multi-purpose wearable devices, fusing together multiple health and fitness capabilities and smartphone notifications. "It's enough to blur the lines against most smart wearables, to the point where first generation smartwatches are no better than most fitness trackers. "Meanwhile, smart wearables are also evolving. Health and fitness remains a major focus, but once these devices become connected to a cellular network, expect unique applications and communications capabilities to become available. This will also solve another key issue: freeing the device from the smartphone, creating a standalone experience."

Mobile by Chris Matyszczyk February 26, 2017 6:59 PM PST @ChrisMatyszczyk Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives. Enlarge Image Casey Neistat, man of the (YouTube) people. Samsung has Oscars history. Its Oscars night all-star selfie featuring almost everyone who believe they're anyone even made the president jealous. President Obama, that is. On Sunday, Samsung tried to ensure it's seen as cool again -- and certainly cooler than Apple. For here was an ad featuring, of all people renowned vlogger -- and not exactly always an Apple fanperson -- Casey Neistat. In this Samsung ad, Neistat explained that he represented "the creators of this generation." These are the people who "don't have big awards shows or fancy cameras." They merely have phones, duct tapes, parking lots and guts. Oh, and an idea that needs to be told. Strange ideas, silly ideas, but, at least for some, uplifting, crazy, educational and life-affirming ideas. His is the generation of can-dos, those who won't be told they can't. Indeed, the tagline to this opus is "Do What You Can't." Should you not have been alive in 2003, Neistat rose to online fame with a little movie entitled "iPod's Dirty Secret." In it, he revealed that the iPod's battery only lasted 18 months. He's been a tiny thorn in Apple's love-handles on occasion since then. In 2013, for example, he mused: "I am so disappointed in Apple. I don't even use an iPhone anymore. Their marketing sucks. It's embarrassing. It's just garbage. If you had asked me the day Steve Jobs died, 'What's the biggest fear for what might happen with Apple?' I would have described to you what's happening right now." More Technically Incorrect Microsoft CEO condemns bigotry after Indian engineer's death Trump tweets scorn for NY Times Oscars ad (ad goes viral) Cadillac addresses 'a nation divided' in Oscars ad And surely you've seen his witty excoriation of the gold Apple Watch. Samsung has succeeded in recent times with its ads often becoming more virally popular than Apple's. After the Note 7 debacle, it seems clear that it's still trying to make inroads by presenting itself as younger and cooler than Cupertino -- which has become more of a global establishment brand than ever. Still, the iPhone is still favored by more than 75 percent of teens, according to one study. With this ad, Samsung is using a creative stage to declare itself the brand of the people. The young people, that is. Of course, some watching this ad will have no idea who Neistat is. And that's the point.

This iPhone manual is designed for iOS 8 on the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and other iPhones. Even if this isn’t your first iPhone, you’ll learn something new in this iPhone 6 manual. Apple calls this the iPhone User Guide for iOS 8, but it’s as close to an iPhone 6 manual as you’ll get. With over 32 chapters on how to use the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, as well as other iOS 8 features found on the iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, iPhone 5 and iPhone 4s. Download the iPhone 6 manual to learn how to use the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 plus and other iOS 8 devices. There are special sections explaining how to use the iPhone 6 in business, how to add a new keyboard language and the many iOS 8 and iPhone 6 accessibility options available. In this 180 page iPhone 6 manual you’ll learn how to be a master of your new iPhone. Users can learn how to use all the new iOS 8 features and the iPhone 6 features that are not on the older devices. There are also some added areas for the iPhone 6 Plus features like landscape mode. Keep this in mind as you read the iPhone 6 manual, or is you download this as your iOS 8 manual on an older device. Apple calls out features that are not on every device, so look for that if something you try is not working. iPhone 6 Manual Download The easiest thing to do is download the iPhone 6 manual to your new iPhone so you can search it and read it as you need to learn how to perform a task. You don’t need to pay for an iPhone 6 manual download, as Apple offers a free user guide. You just need to know where to look and how to save it to your iPhone, iPad or computer. It is a PDF, so you can open it on pretty much any device, or you can print it if you feel the need to use almost 200 pages of paper. Manual for iPhone 6 Download the iPhone 6 manual by opening the PDF in your Safari browser on the iPhone or iPad. You can read it in Safari, but if you want to use it more than once, the best thing to do is tap on Open in iBooks in the upper right to save the iPhone 6 manual to the iPhone or iPad. Download and save the iPhone 6 manual for use later. If you are on a Mac, PC or Android device you should see a download option available somewhere on the page, you may need right-click to save the iPhone 6 manual PDF to your computer. Not everyone will read the iPhone 6 manual, but it really is a great way to learn everything the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus can do. Since this is also an iOS 8 manual you can use these guides to do more with your current phone on the new iOS 8 software. You can also check out our iOS 8 and iPhone 6 how to articles, like the iPhone 6 setup guide above, which shows you how to set up the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus right out of the box. Each of these sections in the iPhone 6 manual includes details about the iPhone 6 settings that you can adjust to customize the iPhone to fit your needs and use. The slide show below includes a walk-through of the new iOS 8 features. What’s New in iOS 8 iOS 8 vs iOS 7 Walkthrough - Home Screen   1 / 19 We start our iOS 8 vs iOS 7 walkthrough with the iPhone home screen, which is where you'll start your iOS 8 experience after an update this fall.  These screens are incredibly important as you see them anytime you turn on the iPhone or need to choose an app to launch. There is no way around using them, so Apple needs to make sure they work just right.  As you can see in the iOS 8 vs iOS 7 comparison above, there is no change between the home screen in the new iPhone software. Apple changed the status bar and some other small visual changes in iOS 7, but there are no updates for iOS 8.   We could see Apple change the home screen slightly for iOS 8 for the iPhone 6. The new iPhone will feature a larger 4.7-inch display with a higher resolution. This is something Apple may use to add more icons to the screen. Or they could stick with the current layout, it's tough to tell.     1 / 19 18 Responses 10/19/2014 Kaye Wiskich Reply I want a copy of the manual on how to use the Iphone6 unabl;e to download and print 06/22/2015 Rajendra Dheer Reply Tell me how can I download on my Macmini? 08/05/2015 thompson Reply How do you download manual? . this is so cheap I paid 850.00 for a phone without a manual. give me a break.. 08/26/2015 Freedom Hacks (@FreedomHacks) Reply iPhone is a breeze to use.

The Apple Watch is running strong. Image: Jose Sanchez/AP/REX/Shutterstock By Brett Williams2017-03-03 00:44:15 UTC With the downfall of Pebble late last year, it looked like the wearables market could be in trouble.  Nope. It hit an all-time high with 33.9 million units shipped in the fourth quarter of 2016, growing 16.9 percent year over year, according to the latest data from analytics firm IDC.  SEE ALSO: This gaming smartwatch has Atari classics built right in The report revealed the diverging paths of two of the most recognizable names in the game: Fitbit and Apple.  Fitbit held onto its perch atop the wearables food chain, but it's slipping. Meanwhile, the Apple Watch had its most successful showing since entering the space in April 2015. It's a big reversal from Apple's decline in Q3 2016 — and it shows the wearables market could be in the midst of another shift.     SEE ALSO: If Steve Jobs was still alive he'd totally be wearing this 3-decade-old watch As for Fitbit, it dropped from owning 23 percent of the wearables market last quarter to 19.2 percent now.   This comes as no surprise, since the company acknowledged its disappointing Q4 2016 performance — and laid off 6 percent of its workforce — at the end of January.        The Apple Watch, on the other hand, had a huge resurgence at the end of 2016. While the company doesn't disclose exact sales numbers, other projections held that Apple's devices dominated the smartwatch market during the quarter, accounting for nearly half the units shipped. IDC's numbers show similar results. Apple accounted for 13.6 percent of the wearables market in Q4 2016, making up a ton of ground from when it held just a 4.9 percent share the period before. The report cited the Apple Watch's introduction of GPS and more fitness-centric features, along with the timing of the Series 2 release, as the cause for its success.     So why is Apple rising by embracing fitness applications while Fitbit, which specializes in activity tracking, stumbles?  Having a shiny new version of the Apple Watch definitely didn't hurt — but the device's superior connection to the iPhone could be another big draw. Until wearables become dependable standalone gadgets, their usefulness beyond basic fitness tracking will be the best way to demonstrate their worth to consumers.         BONUS: This wearable Bluetooth device will turn any surface into a keyboard Topics: Apple, Apple Watch , fitbit, Gadgets, market, report, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

If it does, things could get way, way better for anyone who ever has to charge anything. Imagine: one cord to rule them all. A few years back, when Apple phased out the trusty 30-pin dock connector of its early iPods and iPhones, it did so because the new Lightning port had a lot of advantages over both its predecessor and the competition. Lightning is small and reversible, something you can't say about 30-pin or microUSB cables. The problem is, it's proprietary. Outside the Apple universe, USB Type-C has risen up in the years since to match Lightning in form and beat it in ubiquity. USB Type-C is the ascending standard, and it's only spreading. It's even spreading to Apple devices, as a matter of fact. Type-C first showed up on 2015's 12-inch MacBook, where it served not only as a data port, much like the normal USB ports you find on any laptop, but also as the charging port, replacing Apple's proprietary (and terrific) MagSafe adapters. The most recent MacBook Pro continued this trend, essentially killing MagSafe for good. The fact that Apple has embraced Type-C on MacBooks but continued to use Lighting cables on iPhones has manifested in some real awkwardness. For example, the headphones that come with the iPhone 7 (which have a Lightning connection because the 7 did away with the headphone jack) don't plug into a new Macbook Pro. Plus, today's iPhone users carry around a Lightning cable that's good for charging their phone, but nothing else, whereas a Type-C cable is a multi-tasker. If iPhones were to adopt Type-C, the move would usher in an unprecedented uniform charging standard in the world of phones. And Type-C isn't just a charging standard-it's ridiculously capable. It can transmit video, which could let it replace HDMI and other specialized video cables. It can transmit audio too. There is virtually nothing this cable can't do if you let it. If the iPhone 8 has a Type-C port, then it's quite possible you could use the very same cord to charge a Windows laptop, a Macbook, an Android phone, an iPhone, connect an external monitor to your laptop, or connect your computer to a TV.What's more, it's a tipping point that could drag other stragglers along. Being able to charge the same way an iPhone does is a huge incentive for smaller companies to ditch their proprietary charges for the open standard. We may not have to wait long to find out. The original iPhone was released on June 29, 2007, which means the 10th anniversary is mere months away. The tech world presumes the iPhone 8 will arrive around this time to mark the occasion. If the rumors are true, it will have flashy features like a curved OLED screen made my Samsung-and retail for up to $1,000. But keep your eye on that port. That's where the magic just might happen.

That last prospect was highlighted this week by the Wall Street Journal, which also predicted Apple would source OLED screens for the new iPhone from Samsung. [ Related: Video review: Apple's new AirPods ] While Apple might well be planning to introduce OLED displays, eliminating the Lightning connector and replacing it with USB-C won't happen. Here's my thinking. How Apple operates The decisions Apple makes when designing new products are always scrutinized, which means when it comes to aesthetics and technologies, there is always something to nitpick. As Apple moves to minimize appearance and ornamentation -- the result of its ongoing focus on mobility in smaller, lighter, and thinner devices -- traditional features get the axe. Most recently, with the arrival of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus last year, Apple did away with the traditional headphone jack -- moving that feature to the Lightning port and causing consternation among Apple users. Over the years, the variety of physical connections available on Apple products has dwindled, meaning that the ports and connections that remain must, by default, take on new duties. This is especially true for Apple's laptops, which over the years have lost a variety of ports, including everything from Ethernet to USB 1.0, SD card slots and Apple-specific power ports like Mag-Safe. In Apple's latest laptops, the MacBook and MacBook Pro, they've all been replaced by USB-C ports -- a move that last year prompted an outcry from Mac users annoyed that they would need new cables and dongles to connect older hardware. (At least the newest laptops still have the traditional headphone jack. Yay?) With Apple's clear interest in USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports, it's no surprise that speculation would arise that the company might turn to it for the upcoming iPhone. USB-C, as implemented in Apple's hardware, is versatile, provides power to the laptop, allows for fast data transfer speeds for external storage drives and can even drive multiple monitors. Despite the Wall Street Journal report, I'm willing to bet a lot of money that the next generation iPhone (as well as any new iPads and iPod touch devices rolled out this year) will retain the now-traditional Lightning connection. Why Lighting isn't going away There are a variety of reasons I believe this, chief among them: compatibility with existing products and Lightning's relatively recent arrival as a replacement for the old 30-pin connector. But the main reason is simple; It's about keeping control and making money. Apple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs once said: "I've always wanted to own and control the primary technology in everything we do." While CEO Tim Cook hasn't always followed the path set by his predecessor, who died in 2011, in this case control does play an integral role in what Apple will do. As of the iPhone 7 series, released last September, the Lightning connection is the only way to physically plug in another device to the phone. Do you really believe that Apple will give up control over the single existing physical connection to its most popular device -- especially when Apple holds all of the access keys to said connection? The Lightning connector is proprietary for Apple. It brings in good money via licensing fees, since if you need to physically connect to an i-Device, you have no choice but to use Lightning. Apple execs aren't going to walk away from that advantage. Lightning is also relatively new -- it's only been around since 2012. And having largely moved third-party manufacturers to it Apple isn't about to force them to move to USB-C. Doing so would mean giving up control and cost the company money at the same time. (I'm not the only one to push back on the Journal report. Now, that doesn't mean Apple won't give the wall adapter for the next iPhone the USB-C treatment, which means devices would ship with a USB-C-to-Lightning cord like the one the MacBook Pro uses now. But the iPhone (and iPad and iPod touch) will keep the Lightning port. You can make an argument for a straight USB-C connection on an iPhone or iPad -- standardization across Apple's devices stands out, for instance. But the advantages of retaining full control over the only physical connection on Apple's best-selling and most profitable piece of hardware outweighs any such move this year or for the foreseeable future. Your Lightning-based iPhone accessories and cables are safe. Apple will not cede its role as gatekeeper to a gold mine. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

The Swedish streaming firm today revealed it has hit 50 million subscribers worldwide - more that double the number arch rival Apple Music has. The firm is also believed to be preparing to introduce a new 'hi-fi' streaming service with far better sound quality than its current offering. Scroll down for video  The Swedish streaming firm today revealed it has hit 50 million subscribers worldwide - more that double the number arch rival Apple Music has. Apple Music, its closest competitor, said in December that it had 20 million subscribers. The Swedish company posted the figure on Twitter.  Apple Music, its closest competitor, said in December that it had 20 million subscribers. The update was the first from privately held Spotify since September.  Spotify said in June that it had a total of 100 million users, including on its free, advertising-backed tier which is the bane of some record executives.

Apple, which launched its streaming service in 2015, and rap mogul Jay Z's upstart Tidal have both tried to woo listeners by offering exclusive material. Online retail giant Amazon in October entered the streaming war by giving a discount rate to subscribers who use the company's speakers. Spotify said in June that it had a total of 100 million users, including on its free, advertising-backed tier which is the bane of some record executives. Other competitors include Paris-based Deezer, whose strength lies in Europe, and Seattle streaming pioneer Rhapsody. Streaming of unlimited, on-demand music online has rapidly grown in recent years, transforming the music industry. The number of paid subscriptions to streaming services more than doubled in the United States last year alone.

Get ready for the 'ScrollPhone': Apple patents... Amazon reveals a simple TYPO caused massive server crash... Share this article Share Streaming has helped bring the first substantial growth to the recording industry since the dawn of online music, although some artists complain that far too little goes back to them. Spotify's model includes a service that is easy to use and makes the most music available rather than seeking out exclusives. However, in a turn towards original material, Spotify said last week that it was starting three podcasts. Apple meanwhile, is developing several TV shows, including Carpool Karaoke and Planet of the Apps to try and compete.  HOW THE STREAMING SERVICES COMPARE Service  Cost  Apple Music  Apple Music will cost $9.99 a month or $14.99 for a family plan (up to six family members) - both with a three-month free trial Tidal $9.95-a-month for standard sound quality and $19.99-a-month for 'lossless high fidelity sound quality' (£9.99 and £19.99 in the UK) Spotify   Free level with adverts, Premium $9.99-a-month service (£9.99 in the UK) Beats Music   $9.99-a-month or $99 per year Pandora  $4.99-a-month for Pandora's ad-free internet radio service Deezer  Free with adverts, $9.99-a-month for Premium+ (£9.99 in the UK) Rdio  Free with adverts, Rdio Unlimited costs $9.99 (£9.99 in the UK) and US users can also get Rdio Select for $3.99 a month with limited downloads Canadian rapper Drake helped music streaming services explode in 2016, rising by 76 percent in the United States to overtake digital sales of music for the first time in history, Nielsen Music said on Thursday. Americans used on demand streaming platforms, such as Apple Music, Google Play, Spotify, Pandora and Amazon Music, to listen to 431 billion songs in 2016, led by hip hop and R&B artists like Drake, The Weeknd, Kanye West and Rihanna, Nielsen said in its 2016 U.S. year-end report. Some six songs, including New York rapper Desiiigner's 'Panda' and Rihanna's 'Work,' surpassed 500 million total on demand streams in 2016, compared with just three that hit that mark in 2015. Canadian rapper Drake helped music streaming services explode in 2016, rising by 76 percent in the United States to overtake digital sales for the first time in history, Nielsen Music has revealed. The growth in streaming was more than enough to offset declines in other formats, particularly digital sales, leading to an overall 3 percent increase in music consumption compared with 2015, the report said. 'The music industry continues to grow at a healthy rate, and 2016 showed us that the landscape is evolving even more quickly than we have seen with other format shifts,' said David Bakula, senior vice president of industry insights at Nielsen Music.

Apple is losing its grip on American classrooms, which technology companies have long used to hook students on their brands for life. Over the last three years, Apple’s iPads and Mac notebooks — which accounted for about half of the mobile devices shipped to schools in the United States in 2013 — have steadily lost ground to Chromebooks, inexpensive laptops that run on Google’s Chrome operating system and are produced by Samsung, Acer and other computer makers.

Of the 12.6 million mobile devices shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States in 2016, Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the market, up from 50 percent in 2015, according to the report. School shipments of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 19 percent, from about 25 percent, over the same period. Microsoft Windows laptops and tablets remained relatively stable at about 22 percent, Futuresource said. “Apple is struggling,” said Mike Fisher, an education technology analyst at Futuresource. Apple said education was a long-standing value for the company. “Mac and iPad are the best tools in education to help teachers teach and students learn,” Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of product marketing, wrote in an email. “We’re incredibly passionate about education and new programs like Apple Teacher,” a site for teachers who want to learn how to more creatively use Apple tools with their students, she said. The rise of Google’s Chromebooks has disrupted the momentum of Apple, which has been marketing its computers to schools for some 40 years. Apple has recently widened its education offerings. Last year, it introduced an app, called Classroom, to help teachers see and manage their students’ activities on iPads. It also created a free iPad app, called Swift Playgrounds, that introduces students to writing computer code. The shift toward Google-powered devices is hurting Apple’s revenue. Of the $7.35 billion that schools, colleges and universities spent on mobile and desktop computers in 2016, sales of Apple devices fell to $2.8 billion in 2016, from about $3.2 billion in 2015, according to IDC, a market research firm. Windows devices generated $2.5 billion in 2016, up from $2.1 billion in 2015, while Chrome devices reached $1.9 billion, up from $1.4 billion. © Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times Logan Lowry, left, and Douglas Corales, both 6, play a game on Chromebooks in Glenn Burnie, Md. The Chromebook has beaten out classroom competitors on pricing, usability and other factors. Chromebooks run apps through Google’s cloud-based Chrome operating system, making them cheaper — and often faster to boot up — than traditional laptops that rely on hard drives. Because Chromebooks store documents in the cloud, they can be shared among students, who can grab any school device to access their class work. Google also provides school administrators with an online dashboard to remotely manage thousands of the laptops at once. Then there is the keyboard issue. While school administrators generally like the iPad’s touch screens for younger elementary school students, some said older students often needed laptops with built-in physical keyboards for writing and taking state assessment tests. The public school system in Eudora, Kan., for instance, used to have rolling carts of iPads for elementary school classrooms and MacBook carts for older students to share. But last year, when administrators wanted to provide a laptop for each high school student, the district bought 500 Chromebooks at about $230 each. “At the end of the day, I can get three Chromebooks for each of the Mac devices I would have purchased,” said Steve Splichal, the superintendent of Eudora Public Schools. He added that Eudora students continued to use MacBooks for certain creative courses and that first graders and younger students still used iPads. To compete with Chromebooks, Microsoft announced last month that it had worked with Acer, HP and Lenovo to develop low-cost Windows laptops for schools, with prices starting at $189. The company also introduced an app, called Microsoft Intune for Education, to enable schools to more easily set up and manage their Windows devices. Google, for its part, announced last month that it had worked with Asus and Acer to develop for schools new Chromebooks that can also convert to tablets. Follow Natasha Singer on Twitter @natashanyt.

This week it was speculated that Apple was set to drop the current Lightning connector in favor of the USB format – sending some fans into an uproar. However, the latest news about the iPhone 8 has suggested that it will keep the Lightning connector and add a USB-C Power Delivery for faster charging abilities. Scroll down for video  This week it was speculated that Apple was set to drop the current Lightning connector in favor of the USB format. Thee latest news about the iPhone 8 has suggested that the design will keep Lightning connector and add a USB-C Power Delivery (artist impression) WHAT IS A USB-C? The USB Type-C connector was created for use with thinner, sleeker devices, such as tablets and ultra-books. It claims to be robust enough for laptops and slim enough for smartphones. It was built on existing USB 3.1 and USB 2.0 technologies. The plug is smaller than previous connectors, and more closely resembles the size of Micro USB 2.0 Crucially, it is reversible, meaning it will work whichever way it is plugged in. The statement was shared by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo with MacRumors, who also revealed that all of the iPhones launching this year will support fast charging, as they will be fitted with a ‘larger L-shaped battery’ - a prediction Kuo has shared before. ‘New 2H17 models may all support fast charging. We believe all three new iPhones launching in 2H17 will support fast charging by the adoption of Type-C Power Delivery technology (while still retaining the Lightning port),’ Kuo explained in a research note obtained by MacRumors. ‘A key technical challenge lies with ensuring product safety and stable data transmission during a fast charge.’ ‘In order to achieve that goal, we think Apple will adopt TI's power management and Cypress's Power Delivery chip solutions for the new iPhone models. ‘We note the OLED version may have a faster charging speed thanks to a 2-cell L shaped battery pack design.’ RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Apple patents 'roman scroll' iPhone design that can be... Share this article Share However, on Tuesday, an anonymous source outraged many iOS users when they told The Wall Street Journal that the tech giant was considering ditching the connector in favor of the USB-C port in its 10th-anniversary handset. USB-C and Lightning allow for transmitting both data and power and have no up or down facing direction like more traditional USB cables, and so can be plugged in from any direction. On Tuesday, an anonymous source outraged many iOS users when they told The Wall Street Journal that the tech giant was considering ditching the connector in favor of the USB-C port in its 10th-anniversary handset USB-C (pictured) and Lightning allow for transmitting both data and power and have no up or down facing direction like more traditional USB cables, and so can be plugged in from any direction A step towards a universal connection type would be beneficial for all technology users in the long run. But the short-term and potentially costly consequence of switching formats once more is likely to provoke the ire of some. Following the emergence of the news, a number of users took to Twitter to vent their frustration. User Hilde Gerhard Bürgel expressed what is likely to be a common reaction. She said: 'Rumors about iPhone with USB C. Really Apple?! Do we have to throw away lightning or buy expensive adapters? Again??!! I’m out.' As of Thursday, it seems users can rest assure that Apple will most-likely not toss out the Lightning port. Sticking with the Lightning port allows Apple to keep its slightly slimmer designed IPHONE 8 RUMOURS  Several rumors have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have:   - Dual-lens 3D camera  - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings  - Curved glass casing  - Plastic OLED screen  - Wireless charging  - A folding element  - Removal of the home button  - New 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimeter) model, which will have a wraparound OLED screen  - 5.8 inch will be designed with the Touch ID finger print sensor 'under the glass and in the active display area'  - A new 'pure white' model  - Aluminium back will be replaced with two reinforced glass panes and a metal frame in the middle  - Facial recognition Another user Daniel Ensign expressed similar concerns. He said: 'Pretty stoked about the switch to OLED but why the switch to USB C. Apple just made us get new headphones.' But not everyone is convinced that Apple will make the switch. John Christensen said: 'So the next iPhone redesign is gonna have USB C instead of lighting? I'm gonna call bull****.' As of Thursday, it seems users can rest assure that Apple will most-likely not toss out the Lightning port. Kuo also shared with MacRumors that sticking with the Lightning port allows Apple to keep its slightly slimmer designed – compared to if they would have replaced it with a USB-C port. He also suggested that Apple will take this route to ‘sustain MFI program licensing income from Lightning accessories and because he believes USB-C’s high-speed data transmissions is ‘still in niche application’ for iPhone’, reports Joe Rossignol with MacRumors. Earlier this month Kuo also made a prediction that Apple is planning to pack a larger battery inside its highly-anticipated iPhone 8. A 2,700 mAh battery is set to be used in the 4.7-inch handset – putting the battery capacity on par with the firm's current iPhone 7 Plus. By keeping the Lightning connector and adding a USB-C Power Delivery, the iPhone 8 will be designing with faster charging abilities COULD THE IPHONE 8 HAVE A LARGER BATTERY?  Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has revealed to 9to5Mac that Apple plans to put a larger battery in the 4.7-inch iPhone 8.  Kuo explained that it will be designed with a 2,700 mAh battery - putting its battery capacity on par with the iPhone 7 Plus.  The iPhones launching this year will support fast charging, as they will be fitted with a ‘larger L-shaped battery’ (middle) Will use a 'substrate-like PCB mainboard', which will allow the firm to implement an OLED display in the flagship handset.  The new components are believed to be much more expensive in anything used in an iPhone before, which could increase manufacturing costs by 80 percent.  However, it was revealed last week that iOS users should expect to pay a hefty price tag for their next iPhone. The report said that the new lower end handsets, which could be called the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, will use a new 'stacked' motherboard, which is smaller - leaving more room for a battery. This will 'make it comparable to their iPhone 7 and 7 Plus counterparts,' reports 9to5Mac. Thanks to stacked SLP, we expect the OLED iPhone to have similar dimensions to a 4.7' TFT-LCD iPhone, and have comparable battery capacity (equipped with around 2,700 mAh L-shaped 2-cell battery pack) to a 5.5' TFT-LCD iPhone.' 'The battery life of the OLED iPhone could be better than that of the 5.5' TFT-LCD model as OLED panels are more energy-efficient than their TFT-LCD counterparts.'   Read more: Apple¿s Philip Schiller talks computers, touchscreens and voice on the new MacBook Pro | The Independent Apple News on iPhone, iPad and Macbooks | Daily Mail Online iPhone 8 Will Have Curved OLED Screen and USB-C Connector - Mac Rumors Apple¿s Next iPhone Will Have a Curved Screen - WSJ Ming-Chi Kuo Says All 2017 iPhones Will Have Lightning Connectors With USB-C Fast Charging - Mac Rumors Share or comment on this article e-mail 16 shares Most watched News videos Leopards attack giant Rock Python in Kruger National Park The Walking Dead: New strain of spice turns homeless into zombies Woman stops car to beat passenger senseless on the road Louis Tomlinson challenges photographer before taking out fan Shocking video shows moment teenager is stabbed in South Norwood Droning on!: Neighbour tries to shoot down spying drone Violent brawl breaks out after man is savagely headbutted to floor Shocking video shows why Coke Zero really is better for you The Manly ferry tackles huge swells over the weekend Dash cam captures close drive-By shooting in Kansas Avalanche crashes down mountain at Russian ski resort Clever dog says 'I love you' to its owner to get treat PIERS MORGAN: Sorry Emma, but you haven’t done yourself...

According to a report from Bloomberg, Apple has now sued Qualcomm in a U.K. court over the same patent and royalty dispute that prompted lawsuits in other countries, including the United States. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The report notes that the lawsuit was filed today and cites a claim on patents and registered designs. At this point, however, there aren’t any specific details as to how broad Apple’s lawsuit against Qualcomm is in the U.K. Apple first sued Qualcomm for $1 billion in the United States last month. Apple’s suit against the company came following an FTC complaint alleging that Qualcomm engaged in monopolistic practices to prevent Apple from sourcing key components from competitors. When asked for comment, Apple cited the same statement it released at the beginning of the battle back in January: “Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties,” Apple said in the January statement. “Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined.” The main point of Apple’s argument is that Qualcomm has been charging royalties for “technologies they have nothing to do with. Apple has also alleged that Qualcomm withheld a $1 billion rebate from Apple in retaliation for it working with South Korean authorities. Qualcomm was recently found to be engaging in anti-competitive behavior in South Korea. Tim Cook put it like this: It’s somewhat like buying a sofa and you charge a different price depending upon the price of the house that it goes into. From our point of view, this doesn’t make sense, and we don’t believe it will pass muster in the courts. Likewise, Apple is suing Qualcomm in China over the same patent and royalty disputes. That suit is worth 1 billion yuan, or around $140 million. As part of that claim, Apple claimed that Qualcomm is in violation of China’s Anti-Monopoly Law. Tim Cook referred to Apple’s legal battle with Qualcomm during the company’s recent earnings call, explaining that he sees litigation as a last resort and is therefore open to settling the lawsuit. In the end, though, Cook expects it to be a lengthy battle. I don’t like litigation, and so if there’s another way, then that would be great, but at this point I don’t see it. I fully expect at this point in time that it will take some time, but in the end, I think common sense will prevail, and the courts will see it for what it is. So that’s the way I see it.   Chance Miller @ChanceHMiller Chance covers Apple for 9to5Mac and contributes to 9to5Google, Electrek, and 9to5Toys. He runs the weekly EduTech series.

It includes a brief video that shows the power of HomeKit automation with iOS 10. Examples in the video include lights, window shades, coffee makers, door locks and thermostats. Apple also has several sections that give details of different areas of the Home app. HomeKit Automation For Your Home The page provides a link to the full list of devices that are on sale or announce for a future release. The devices can fall under 17 categories, like outlets, lights, doorbells, cameras, and even bridges and range extenders. Apple has a new “Works with Apple HomeKit” badge to display on relevant products. Control your home on multiple devices Another section shows how you can control your home with Siri. Examples commands include: “Turn on the upstairs lights” “Is the front door locked?” “Show me the outdoor camera” “Set my Bedtime scene” To automate your home, you create Scenes with the Home app. For example, selecting Good Morning can warm up your house, open window blinds and start your coffee maker. After work, you can tap I’m Home to open your garage, unlock your door and turn on the lights. HomeKit categories Finally, the webpage has a section that reminds people how your Apple TV can act as a hub. An Apple TV can bring even more HomeKit automation, and trigger accessories or scenes based on time of day, your location and sensor detection. More and more HomeKit-enabled products are hitting the market ever since HomeKit’s release at WWDC 2014. We look forward to WWDC 2017 to see if more HomeKit products and technologies are announced.

While the second-generation Apple TV is well out of warranty coverage, Apple still continues to provide parts and repair services for its products for a period of 5-7 years after the last date of manufacture. The “vintage” designation for the second-generation Apple TV applies only in California and Turkey, where Apple is required by law to provide service for up to 7 years; in all other parts of the world, the device has been declared “obsolete” and is no longer eligible for any kind of hardware service. Apple typically declares products Vintage” when they have not been manufactured for more than five years, but less than seven. “Obsolete” products are those that have not been manufactured for more than seven years. [via AppleInsider] Comments "The Flashlight That Won The Best 2016" is a SCAM!!!! I have went on their website where it was advertised the flash light is on discount @ USD19.95! After I have entered my credit card details and pressed next it diverted me to a page requiring me to pick option parts for the flash light, without an choice of not taking this option parts. So I closed the browser. Next you know I received 2 confirmation email from them. 1 claiming I have made the purchase and was charged USD 59.9 where the flash light cost USD39.9 intead of USD19.9 as listed on the page. The next email confirmation is more absurd, it claimed that I have joined a monthly subscription USD 8.95 per month to a discount campaign! This is a SCAM from the beginning! Strongly advise people to stay away from it! I have emailed their customer service email but no one ever replied back to me! After 2 weeks, the product arrived, the packaging looks flimsy, the torch isn't even working! Save your money and stay the F away from this site!

Without an Apple TV, you could control your HomeKit accessories directly from an iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch that’s in Wi-Fi or Bluetooth range, but when away from home, you’d have no ability to control or even monitor the status of your HomeKit devices — for that you’ll need a HomeKit hub, which was originally a role limited to the Apple TV. While the third-generation Apple TV originally filled this role — and still can in a limited capacity — the stakes went up with iOS 10 and tvOS 10 last year, leaving the older third-gen model out of the HomeKit party for features like streaming video from HomeKit cameras, running automation routines, and accessing more advanced permissions for your secondary HomeKit users. Fortunately, with iOS 10 Apple provided another way for users who may not be eager to jump into Apple’s “big screen” ecosystem: If you already have an iPad capable of running iOS 10, you can use that as your home hub instead, as long as it remains at home, powered on, and connected to your Wi-Fi network. Setting this up is as simple as going into the Settings app on your iPad and switching on the option to “Use this iPad as a Home Hub.” Note that you can have more than one Home Hub in your HomeKit system, so even if you’ve already got an Apple TV already, it can be worth setting up your iPad to act as a Home Hub as well — if you’re only using a third-generation Apple TV, you’ll gain support for the full set of HomeKit automation features, and even if you’ve already got a fourth-generation Apple TV, your iPad can act as a secondary/backup Home Hub, and can be used to provide better coverage if you’ve got Bluetooth-based HomeKit accessories that might be out of range of your Apple TV.
