Email | 03 Oct 2016 | Print  ExtraBITS for 3 October 2016 by TidBITS Staff In ExtraBITS this week, Apple legend Bill Atkinson explains why he’s excited about having Siri accessible via the forthcoming AirPods, The Intercept reveals a potential privacy loophole in iMessage, and Aetna is making a big investment in the Apple Watch. Why Siri and the AirPods Excite Bill Atkinson -- Bill Atkinson, the legendary developer behind the original Mac’s QuickDraw graphics system and classic Mac apps like MacPaint and HyperCard, has been waiting for Apple’s forthcoming AirPods for years. Back in 2011, he gave a Macworld Expo presentation in which he explained why Siri belongs in your ear, which the AirPods will provide. Atkinson cites the Jane artificial intelligence in Orson Scott Card’s “Ender’s Game” series as a model for Apple to follow. As for the future of Siri on the AirPods, Atkinson says, “Within a few years it’s going to be able to do lots of things: It will hear everything you hear, it’s going to be able to whisper in your ear.” For the moment, though, he’s realistic about Siri’s capabilities. “Siri is a bit of a joke now; it doesn’t really understand the meaning of conversations,” Atkinson admits. “That’s going to improve.” Read/post comments Apple Logs iMessage Contact Phone Numbers -- Apple touts the end-to-end encryption and overall privacy of its iMessage service, but Sam Biddle of The Intercept reveals a loophole: when you enter a phone number to start a conversation in Messages, the app contacts Apple’s servers to find out whether to send the message via iMessage or SMS. The problem is that Apple’s servers currently log the contact number, the date and time, and your IP address (which could disclose your general location). Apple has verified that it keeps these logs for 30 days and will give them to law enforcement if compelled by a court order. We hope these revelations will encourage Apple to reassess the privacy implications of this system. Read/post comments Aetna to Promote Apple Watches to Employees and Customers -- In an initiative to improve the health of its employees and customers, health insurance company Aetna is buying Apple Watches for its nearly 50,000 employees and will be offering subsidized Apple Watches to select large employers and individual customers in the upcoming enrollment period, with the remaining cost to be paid via a monthly payroll deduction. Aetna will be providing iOS apps to simplify and improve the healthcare process through care management and wellness, medication adherence, and health plan information and decision support. In addition, Aetna app users will be able to use Apple’s Wallet app to check their deductibles and pay bills. If implemented well, Aetna’s program could improve healthcare, reduce costs, and enhance the company’s ratings with its millions of members.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Best Buy Lists 27-inch iMac With Intel’s Kaby Lake Processor By Tyler Lee on 10/03/2016 16:49 PST It has been a while since the iMac has been refreshed. To be more specific it has nearly been a year since the last refresh, which means that it is possible that Apple could be announcing something soon, but could Best Buy have accidentally revealed what Apple has in store for the iMac refresh? Spotted on Best Buy’s website is a 27-inch iMac that is advertised as having an Intel Kaby Lake processor. Given that this Intel’s latest processor, it makes sense for Apple to include it in the refresh. However as pointed out by AppleInsider, there are some details that makes this listing a bit suspect. For example the price listed is $3,200, which makes it more expensive than the current iMacs with the same configuration which is priced at $3,150 on Apple’s website. It also lists its GPU as being the AMD Radeon R9 M380, which is odd since the current iMac features an AMD Radeon R9 M395, so obviously it doesn’t make sense for Apple to move backwards. In any case it is possible that maybe Best Buy is just using placeholder specs for its listing, hence the discrepancies. Apple is also rumored to be announcing new MacBook Pros later this month so perhaps we might get some iMac news as well, so stay tuned and check back with us at a later date for the details, if there any to be had.

You’re not alone. Nick Whighamnews.com.au Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend IF YOU own an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus have you experienced a problem with the functionality of the touch screen? Plenty of Apple customers have — and they’re certainly not happy about it. A number of people have complained about the diminishing sensitivity and spotty functionality of the touchscreen on their iPhone 6 device as it gets older. With an unresponsive touchscreen the phone effectively becomes frozen and can’t be used properly. The problem has been dubbed “touch disease” and according to the blog ifixit.org which coined the term, iPhone repair technicians are getting an increasing number of customers experiencing the annoying issue, which seems to be more common in the larger iPhone 6 Plus version. Aside from the obvious symptom of a frozen screen, touch disease is easy to diagnose because handsets will display a flickering grey bar at the top of the screen. The reason for this is that the two tiny “Touch IC” connectors, which translate the tapping and swiping of your fingers on the screen into a machine input, become slightly detached from the phone’s logic board. The result is often a progressive, and seemingly erratic, deterioration of touchscreen function. Apple has so far declined to officially acknowledge the issue but angry customers in North America have taken things into their own hands. A class action lawsuit has been filed in both the US and Canada complaining about the issue and even accusing Apple of covering it up. The country-wide lawsuit filed in the US in late August claims Apple concealed “a material design defect that causes the touchscreens on the iPhones to become unresponsive.” In an effort to make the handset slimmer, the tech giant failed to “properly (secure the touch IC chips) to the logic board and, as a result of foreseeable and reasonable use by consumers, fail from normal wear and tear,” the lawsuit states. Depending on your situation (the conditions of your contract or whether your phone is under warranty) Apple could charge hundreds of dollars to fix the issue. “Apple has long been aware of the defective iPhones. Yet, notwithstanding its longstanding knowledge of this design defect, Apple routinely has refused to repair the iPhones without charge when the defect manifests,” the suit says. Disgruntled folk in Canada have filed two lawsuits of their own over touch disease, one nation-wide complaint and another solely for Quebec residents. The lawyer of the Canada-wide suit Tony Merchant said since filing the complaint in September “we’ve had significant numbers of people contact us,” to complain of the issue, adding that Apple had “brushed it under the rug.” According to AppleInsider, touch disease now accounts for 11 per cent of all Apple store repairs, eclipsing all other problems. “In our notes, we started calling it by a specific name we made up at our store because we all knew it,” one Apple store worker told the site. “Management said we had to refer to it as flickering.” Have you experienced touch disease with your iPhone? If so, let us know @NNWhigham. iPhone 6 plus touch ic hell. Did this set of 6 today and sent 10 to Mark. I feel like I am Liam, Apple's recycling robot.

For the last several months, great care has been taken to remove false ceilings, partitions, floor coverings and decorative elements that were not part of the original building and the intended use of the three structures that make up the Apple Barn. Then, to make sure it wouldn’t fall apart as it was being moved, it had to be strengthened and then split into two for the trip. From its original use as hay storage and then an apple packing shed, it spent its next fifty years as the Antique Fair, a collection of sellers of used and antique furniture and interior decorations, the building sat at the edge of Trout Gulch Road. Now it is moving to be the centerpiece of the new Aptos Village as part of the New Leaf Community Market next to the Village Common. “The public will be able to see the original historical features of the barn,” such as the ceiling beams, the skylight/vents and its wooden floors,” said Mary Gourlay, Aptos Village development project manager for Barry Swenson Builder. The move is not a simple task as the building is 181 feet long by 100 feet wide. To move the two sections of the building into its final location, it must be rotated 160 degrees and moved a distance of 250 feet in several stages into place over about five weeks before the concrete footings can be poured. Then the concrete must be allowed to cure before the building can be lowered onto its new foundation. When asked if this was an unusually difficult move, Howard Kelly of Kelly Brothers House Movers said, “There is a growing effort to preserve our history in California so we are seeing more moves of this type. But because of the size and condition of the building, I would say yes.” The method of moving something heavy on rollers, which are moved from the back to the front as the object moves forward, has been in use for thousands of years. For the Apple Barn, the building was lifted by 25-ton jacks onto steel beams that are used to provide a solid, flat surface for the rollers. Winches pulling steel cables are used to move the building a foot or two forward at a time as workmen move the steel rollers the building is resting on from back to front on the steel beams. At some point in the moving process the building will be places on rubber-tired dollies for the trip over uneven ground. The road to developing a modern Aptos Village has been a long one. Historically, Aptos Village has been a hub of activity. It was a lumber town in the late 1800s and a commercial apple-processing center from 1900 to 1959. During the 1960s most of the buildings were torn down. The Aptos Village project replaces what has been torn down and will reestablish the Village as the heart of our community. Aptos Village had one of the first Community Design plans in the state and was adopted in 1979 and revised in 1985. The County Supervisors approved the current Aptos Village Plan unanimously in 2010. Barry Swenson Builder took on the challenge and designed a project to match the Aptos Village Plan. This was also approved unanimously in 2012. What is now a dusty, 8-acre empty lot will become during the next 18 months the first phase of Aptos Village. Phase one which includes construction of 17 town homes, 40 residential units, new streets called Parade Street, Granite Way and Aptos Village Way, seven buildings that include mixed-use retail and apartment buildings plus a restaurant with residential units above and the renovated Apple Barn and New Leaf Market as a mixed use office/market building. These will be centered around the 16,000 square-foot village common – an outdoor area with trees, bike parking, seating and a stage. Aptos Village (and barn) finally on a roll!

It’s absolutely free, unlike the Apple Developer Program, which requires you to pony up $99 on an yearly basis to keep things hot. Advertisement If you haven’t installed macOS 10.12.1 Beta on your Mac just yet, and are planning to do so, then please make sure you do it on a spare computer. Installing beta software on a primary work machine is not a good idea at all. After all, you are essentially dealing with beta software which is an unfinished product. There’s no indication at all where the software might end up becoming a roadblock in your day to day usage. Wrap Up We will dig into macOS 10.12.1 Beta 3 to see what Apple has packed under the hood. But given how the build is mainly focused towards bug fixes and performance enhancements, there’s no way Apple might have slipped in a huge surprise at this point. Anyhow, update to macOS 10.12.1 right away, and we will inform our readers about more updates as they arrive, so stay tuned.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Apple Watch Series 2 Not Expected To Boost Sales By Tyler Lee on 10/03/2016 16:15 PST So far according to the reviews, the Apple Watch Series 2 is the Apple Watch that many believe Apple should have launched at the start, but we suppose better late than never, right? Unfortunately in this case, that doesn’t hold true. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, he doesn’t expect the new Apple Watch to do much for the company. In an investor’s note obtained by Business Insider, Kuo seems to think that the Apple Watch Series 2 won’t help to boost the sales of the device. In fact if anything, he expects sales to decline. “Based on these considerations, we revise down our 2016F shipments projection for the entire Apple Watch line from 10.0-10.5mn units to 8.5-9.0mn units (vs. 10.4mn units in 2015). We now predict 2016F Apple Watch sales will decline from 2015 (with shorter selling time of eight months).” So why is this? Kuo identifies four main “problems” of the Apple Watch Series 2 that could impact its sales. One of those problems is the lack of killer applications. Granted there are many apps available, but none of them seem to be compelling enough to warrant customers to want to purchase an Apple Watch because of it. He also cites inadequate battery life, the fact that you still need to tether it to your iPhone, and that multi-touch is still probably not the best UI for wearables. Kuo is pretty well-known in the industry when it comes to his Apple predictions, so we wouldn’t be surprised if he latest predictions were to come true, but what do you guys think? Are you in agreement with Kuo’s predictions of the Apple Watch sales? Filed in Apple >Gadgets. Read more about Apple Watch, Smartwatch and Wearable Tech.

If you are, you might be interested to learn that Apple has officially launched the iTunes “Spoken Editions”, which is basically narrated content from a variety of online publishers that Apple has partnered up with. According to Apple’s description, “Too busy to read your favorite websites? Just Listen! These audio versions give you tons of great narrated stories. They’re perfect for getting the latest scoop when you’re driving, working out, or just feel like kicking back.” So who has Apple teamed up with for the Spoken Editions? TechCrunch points out a number of partnerships which include Huffington Post, Reuters, Slate. .Mic, Wired, IGN, Bustle, Fusion, Gizmodo, Jezebel, Lifehacker, TIME, Skift, and Playboy. It has also been noted that there are currently over 40 Spoken Editions available, and we expect that the number of publishers and content will be expanded as time goes on. It is interesting to note the launch of Spoken Editions, especially following the rumors that Apple is planning on launching a device similar to the Amazon Echo, except with Siri on board. Spoken Editions would make perfect sense and would be an ideal fit for such a device, don’t you think? Filed in Apple >Audio. Read more about iTunes.

Close share panel Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Too many apps? Maybe a friendly chatbot would make like easier Is the smartphone app doomed? To look at the stats you wouldn't think so: Apple has two million of them in its App Store and Google Play has a few hundred thousand more than that. Total app downloads have passed the 150 billion mark. But some are wondering whether apps are about to be replaced by something smaller, smarter and faster. Bots. These programs, thanks to AI [artificial intelligence] software in the cloud, can chat to humans via text, extract the meaning and then act on it. They are little digital helpers. Any time you see a live chat box open up on a retailer's website, or order a taxi or flowers through chat platforms such as WeChat and Facebook Messenger, you're most likely talking to a bot. App fatigue? Despite the vast choice of apps open to us, the average number we use is 27, according to research by Nielsen. This hasn't changed for years. And the problem with apps - and their seemingly endless updates - is that they eat up our smartphone storage capacity alarmingly quickly. Developers often get a raw deal as well. One estimate suggests that 94% of the cash generated by apps in Apple's App Store goes to just 1% of publishers, and those firms also get 70% of all downloads. Image copyright charles taylor Image caption Bots might soon be helping people interact with companies more intuitively "One of the worst things about the App Store is the App Store itself, because it's such a walled garden," says Ted Nash of Tapdaq, who was a veteran app developer while still a teenager. Apple's oversight of all apps slows down development and forces programmers to include specific chunks of code that look after adverts, usage statistics and other metrics, he says. Add to this the trouble of making apps work across lots of different devices and keeping up with changes to Apple software, and it's no wonder some people are disillusioned, he says. So is app fatigue setting in? The joy of text "Apps used to be the big thing," says Kriti Sharma, head of mobile development at accounting software firm Sage. "But many more people are messaging than are posting on social media these days." This is why she thinks bots are the natural successors to apps - the interface is instantly familiar to customers. Ms Sharma started her coding career at Barclays, where she co-created its Pingit banking app and oversaw its mobile portfolio. Image copyright PA Image caption Messaging apps have made people very familiar with text-based conversations For companies or brands that want meaningful interaction with customers, a conversation mediated by a bot could work well, she believes. Sage is developing a bot called Pegg that acts as a smart business assistant. It will help small business owners keep track of outgoings and expenses, making tracking cashflow easier. "Bots don't have to be super-complicated," says Ms Sharma. "But over time they must add a lot more value for a customer." Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption As people are used to chatting by text, bots should be easy to use, some argue Bots are more credible because good progress has been made in writing artificially intelligent software, she says. And also because many companies now have huge amounts of data they can use to fine-tune bot responses. Another advantage bots have over apps is the speed with which they can be developed, deployed and updated, she argues. 'Bots are the new black' This growing interest is being inflated by work at Facebook, Microsoft and Google, as well as by newer firms such as Slack and HipChat. And start-ups such as Begin, Growbot, Butter, Wisdom and Operator are also helping to take bots mainstream. One catalyst for the interest was Facebook's announcement earlier this year of a bot framework that streamlines the bot-creation process. One report suggests that this massive amount of interest has unleashed a $4bn (£3bn) flood of venture capital funding into big and small bot developers. "Bots are the new black," says Jon Moore, chief product officer at rail ticket booking service, The Trainline. Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Buying rail tickets is easy by app, but could a chatbot make planning a complex journey easier? Although most people now use The Trainline via a smartphone and many regular users have installed its app, the company is keen to investigate what bots can do, Mr Moore says. For booking train tickets, a website or an app is profoundly better than using a bot, he maintains, but there are times when an app falls short and a conversation handled by a bot may be better. "We're just at the point of saying it's another interesting piece of technology," he tells the BBC. "We expect that they are going to be useful to us, though it won't work for every context and circumstance." 'Immensely complicated' Tapdaq's Ted Nash warns that though bots might look straightforward, they're not necessarily an easier option. "A bot is a much more simple technology from a customer perspective, but the AI that powers it is immensely complicated to do," he says. That difficulty often means that bots are pretty crude. "A lot of them now have pre-defined inputs and responses," says Mr Nash. "The only way they are going to become truly ubiquitous is when they can respond as a human would." Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tech firms are interested in text chat because they may be able to monetise it, analysts say But even before they do that, says Nick Lane, chief analyst at consultancy MobileSquared, bots are likely to be useful for smoothing out the interactions between customers and companies. "We'll see bots helping out with customer engagement, queries and product enquiries," he says. But there is danger in relying too much on a technology still in the early stages of development, he warns. "Some companies are wondering if they can put their business and reputation in the hands of a computer program." There is another reason why technology firms are keen to use text-based chatbots, says Mr Lane. "It could be that they see this interaction as another form of data mining," he says. "People should ask how that information and conversation is going to be used. "One way or another there is a model evolving around that communication that will see it being monetised."

So much so, the tech giant will begin automatically downloading the update to your Mac starting today. Users who have automatic downloads enabled and have enough storage for the 4.77GB download will automatically get the macOS Sierra update "over the next week," according to The Loop. Although it may seem a bit aggressive for Apple to automatically download the operating system for you, it's by no means as heavy handed as Microsoft was with Windows 10. Apple will download the OS, yes, but it won't install without your approval. If you're running out of room on your drive, the download will automatically be deleted to allow more space for your files. If you don't want Apple to download macOS Sierra for you, head over to System Preferences on your Mac and click on the App Store. Then uncheck the option to download updates automatically. In our macOS Sierra review, we noted we liked that it finally brings Siri to the desktop as well as appreciated its iCloud Drive improvements.

While Apple has yet to confirm the issues, reports have been rolling in for nearly an hour now. Apple’s System Status page has not been updated and shows no issues, but that page is generally only updated after an outage is resolved. In a tweet, Apple Support said that the App Store, iTunes Store, and Apple Music were all up and running, but the tweet cited the System Status page. When attempting to access the App Store and iTunes Store, many users are receiving the “Unable to connect” error. For Apple Music, users are being signed out of their account and prompted to sign back in. Signing back in, however, doesn’t always work and sometimes errors out. Down Detector also reflects issues relating to Apple’s cloud services, as well. The most common reported problem is “sever connection,” while “log-in” and “website” are also reported issues.

Apple Untrusts WoSign Certificates After Mozilla's Damning Report GO The noose is tightening around WoSign's neck Oct 3, 2016 22:15 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Apple announced on Friday, September 30, plans to untrust digital certificates issued by Chinese Certificate Authority (CA) WoSign, following a report published by Mozilla last Monday. The report contained a list of incidents that involved WoSign and StartCom, an Israeli CA that WoSign bought last year. Mozilla engineers discovered that WoSign had back-dated SHA-1-signed certificates to December 2015 in an attempt to avoid a ban on SHA-1 certificates that became active starting January 1, 2016. Mozilla also found out that WoSign included arbitrary domain names in certificates without proper verification, and also hid the acquisition of StartCom, a company which began using its infrastructure, and also back-dated certificates as well. Mozilla still pondering a one-year ban for WoSign & StartCom Following the report, Mozilla announced it was planning to issue a one-year ban on WoSign and StartCom certificates, as punishment. The ban, if approved, would apply only to new WoSign and StartCom certificates, while the ones already in use would continue to work. The ban proposal, even if for a year, would be the equivalent of a death sentence for a CA, if adopted by other browser makers. Apple, who is also part of the CA/Browser Forum, was much more decisive than Mozilla. Instead of issuing veil threats to ban WoSign and StartCom certificates, the company just did it. Apple already banned intermediary WoSign certificates According to security alerts posted on its website, Apple said it untrusted all WoSign-related certificates issued after September 19. The ban affects only WoSign certificates in both iOS and OS X. Although Apple didn't trust WoSign root certificates, WoSign uses intermediary certificates issued by StartCom and Comodo to establish trust on Apple products. It's these "intermediary" certificates that Apple is banning. Additionally, the Apple alert doesn't mention untrusting StartCom certificates, which will be supported, for the time being. The ban will become active in Apple's next security update, scheduled for the second week of October. Apple didn't mention if the ban is permanent, or if it will be removed. Apple also doesn't exclude expanding the ban to other Apple products as the Mozilla investigation progresses. Mozilla is scheduled to meet with WoSign and StartCom representatives this week, in order to clarify recent events. Mozilla is expected to take a final decision on the one-year proposed ban after the meeting. In the meantime, WoSign, who's China's biggest CA, has publicly admitted to buying StartCom and is actively looking to mediate the issue and avoid Mozilla's ban, and for a good reason, since other browser makers like Google or Microsoft could follow suite and put the company's existence in danger. #Apple#WoSign#StartCom#Mozilla#ban subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news CloudFlare Looking Into New System That Removes CAPTCHAs for Tor Users Skype Video Calls Can Give Away What You're Typing Inside Other Apps If It Wanted, Google Could Deanonymize a Large Number of Tor Connections IPv4 Server Hacked in 12 Minutes While IPv6 Server Remained Untouched Three UK Hacked, Details of 6 Million Customers at Risk Microsoft Replaces Command Prompt with PowerShell in Latest Windows 10 Build Microsoft Can’t Kill Linux Right Now, The Linux Foundation Director Says iPhone 6 and 6 Plus “Touch Disease” Repairs Cost $149, Apple Says Hacker Breaks into Italian Government Website, 45,000 Users Exposed Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) Leaks in Press Render NVIDIA Makes Available New GeForce Graphics Hotfix Driver - Version 375.95 Three UK Hacked, Details of 6 Million Customers at Risk    Apple bans some WoSign certs Related Apps WFilter Enterprise: Monitor bandwidth, filter and block Internet activities on your network from a single computer via a web-based administration interface LastPass: The last password you'll have to remember - a web browser plugin for storing all user accounts in Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari Treek's Password Manager: Store your account credentials locally or in the cloud, synchronize your data and access passwords with a couple of mouse clicks, by using this lightweight application TunnelBear: VPN app for anonymous Internet connections to help you protect your identity, which lets you choose a fake IP address and examine network statistics VPN Gate Client Plug-in: A plugin for SoftEther VPN, whose main purpose is to easily hide your online identity via a network of relay proxy servers that conceal your IP address Net Monitor for Employees Pro: A cross-platform utility that helps users monitor and control multiple remote computers, as well as record screen activity to AVI files Farbar Recovery Scan Tool: Lightweight and efficient application that was designed to help you scan your computer for malware damage and resolve encountered issues Reader comments Bug in Mirai Source Code Could Stop Some DDoS Attacks Dead in Their Tracks more on: Mirai i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Being one of the biggest organizations in the world means that Apple faces more of these lawsuits than any other firm. Usually, the iPhone maker defeats the claims, but it's lost the latest battle; Apple has to pay more than $302 million in damages for infringing on patents in a case brought by VirnetX. Apple has been engaged in legal wranglings with VirnetX, which makes almost all of its money from patent licensing and lawsuits, since 2010. A court ruled in 2012 that Apple had infringed on VirnetX network patents with products such as FaceTime and iMessage, and was ordered to pay $368.2 million in damages. The Court of Appeals partially overturned that decision and ordered a new trial. In February this year, an East Texas court ordered Apple to pay VirnetX $625.6 million, but the ruling was voided after US District judge Robert Schroeder felt that combining two lawsuits (one over FaceTime and the other over VPN technology) into one trial created the "potential for juror confusion." He ruled that both cases needed to be trialed separately at a later date. In the latest trial, a jury had to determine damages on two VirnetX patents on which Apple has already been found to have infringed upon. It also had to rule on infringement and damages relating to two other patents. The $302.4 million award was a similar amount to what VirnetX had demanded. Apple could face paying out even more in damages if the court finds that it willfully infringed on the patents. It also has to deal with a second VirnetX lawsuit that claims patent violations in newer versions of Apple’s security features. Apple said it plans to appeal the latest verdict.

The site, which cites “reliable sources,” claims a new 7.9-inch Pro model will succeed the iPad mini 4. It’s rumored to have a Smart Connector like the one found on the current 9.7 and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models, a True Tone display, four speakers and a 12-megapixel rear camera. The report doesn’t mention support for the Apple Pencil although my guess is that it will support the stylus. The existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro will reportedly be bumped up to 10.1 inches and will pack a quad-microphone array as will the other two models. A refreshed 12.9-inch iPad Pro will also carry a True Tone display and a 12-megapixel rear-facing iSight camera with a True Tone flash. Unlike the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the next batch of iPad Pros will continue to offer a 3.5mm headphone jack. It’s a bit odd that Apple is pushing to eliminate the jack on its smartphones but keep it on the tablet. It’s unclear if Apple will replace the physical home button with a stationary one as it has done with the new iPhones. The report is somewhat in line with renowned Apple analyst Ming Chi-Kuo who says a 10.5-inch iPad Pro, not a 10.1-inch model, is inbound. No word yet on potential pricing or a solid launch date.

Roston - Oct 3, 2016 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Yes, passenger train rides in most of the U.S. are long, expensive, and sparse. That doesn’t stop some people from using them — especially those in the northeast corridor and other highly-serviced regions — and now Apple users can do so more easily than before. Apple Maps has been updated with Amtrak’s full nationwide routes, as well as some routes that head up into Canada, enabling users to plot their trips from the comfort of Apple’s own mapping app. Amtrak is arguably most popular in the northeast, where business travelers and others use the fast trains to jump between DC, NYC, Boston, and some other notable cities. Amtrak does have routes beyond those areas, though, and now Apple Maps shows them, too. This includes routes in the western parts of the US, the PNW, the midwest, and the southern states. For those heading into or out of Canada, there are also routes for Vancouver and Montreal. According to MacRumors, Apple Maps has added the following Amtrak routes: Midwest: – Blue Water operating between Chicago, Illinois and Port Huron, Michigan – Wolverine operating between Chicago, Illinois and Pontiac, Michigan – Cardinal operating between Chicago, Illinois and New York, New York – Southwest Chief operating between Chicago, Illinois and Los Angeles, California – Texas Eagle operating between Chicago, Illinois and San Antonio, Texas – California Zephyr operating between Chicago, Illinois and Emeryville, California – City of New Orleans operating between Chicago, Illinois and New Orleans, Louisiana – Empire Builder operating between Chicago, Illinois and Portland/Seattle – Illinois Service operating between Chicago, Illinois and Carbondale, Illinois – Pere Marquette operating between Grand Rapids, Michigan and Chicago, Illinois – Capitol Limited operating between Washington, D.C. and Chicago, Illinois – Hoosier State operating between Indianapolis, Indiana and Chicago, Illinois – Hiawatha operating between Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Chicago, Illinois – Missouri River Runner operating between St. Louis and Kansas City in Missouri California: – Capitol Corridor operating between Auburn, California and San Jose, California – Coast Starlight operating between Seattle, Washington and Los Angeles, California – Pacific Surfliner operating between San Luis Obispo and San Diego in California – San Joaquins operating between San Francisco area and Bakersfield area in California – Sunset Limited operating between New Orleans, Louisiana and Los Angeles, California South: – Auto Train operating between Lorton, Virginia and Sanford, Florida – Carolinian operating between New York, New York and Charlotte, North Carolina – Crescent operating between New York, New York and New Orleans, Louisiana – Silver Service/Palmetto operating between New York, New York and Tampa/Miami Northwest: Amtrak Cascades operating between Vancouver, B.C. and Eugene, Oregon West: Heartland Flyer operating between Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Fort Worth, Texas It’s good news for some, even for Amtrak, no doubt, which itself recently unveiled new next-generation high-speed trains coming to the northeast corridor by 2021. These trains will be faster and more modern, offering more seating space and more frequent rides between certain stations without sacrificing in space or amenities.

Don't Believe the Hype Sam Rutherford Staff Writer Tech Media Network (Tom's Guide)October 3, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Which?, the UK's version of Consumer Reports, is making headlines by claiming the iPhone 7’s battery life fared pretty poorly compared to a number of its major Android competitors. We thought those findings looked a little odd — Apple’s latest phones did pretty well in our battery tests — so we decided to take a closer look at what's going on. In both call time and web surfing tests, Which? found that Apple's iPhone 7 battery fared worse than the HTC 10, LG G5 and Samsung Galaxy S7. In that web surfing test, Which? said the iPhone 7 lasted 10 hours and 15 minutes, well behind the 13:10 pace set by the HTC 10. MORE: iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Review That’s quite different from what we noticed when testing the iPhone 7. We found the iPhone 7 lasted 9:03 when web surfing, beating out the G5's time of 7:57 and the S7's time of 8:43. However, similar to Which.co's results, our numbers for the HTC 10 (9:56) were the best of the bunch. So what gives? First, Which? tests its phones using a 3G network instead of 4G LTE like we do here at Tom's Guide. That’s probably a reflection of LTE networks in the UK — network testing firm OpenSignal says the UK has poor LTE coverage — this difference would impact any battery life testing. In general, browsing over 4G LTE is more efficient than 3G, and this difference may have put the iPhone 7 at a disadvantage thanks to its smaller (1,960 mAh) battery. Second, a big part of Which?'s testing involved measuring talk times over 3G, which isn’t that revealing a stat in our opinion. These devices may be called smartphones, but using them to make calls may be one of the least frequent tasks we use them for. How many people would ever be able to call someone for 12 hours straight, let alone the nearly 31 hours of call time that Which? got on the HTC 10? We also find it a big strange that Which? did not include numbers for the iPhone 7 Plus. It sports a 5.5-inch screen and a 2,900 mAh, making it a better comparison for the LG G5 (5.3-inch screen, 2,800 mAh battery) and the HTC 10 (5.2-inch screen, 3,000 mAh battery). It’s likely the iPhone 7 Plus would have fared better in a comparison with the S7, S7 Edge, LG G5, and the HTC 10. In our tests, the 7 Plus lasted 10:38, beating all those phones. The 7 Plus also topped the 5.5-inch Galaxy S7 Edge, which scored 10:09 on our battery test. So if you see headlines claiming the iPhone 7’s battery life lags behind other flagship phones, it’s worth taking a closer look at the numbers. You’ll find that the iPhone actually stacks up quite well against most competitors.

 How to tell if your iPhone suffers from so-called 'Touch Disease,' and what to do next Kif Leswing Oct. 3, 2016, 5:20 PM 110,970 facebook linkedin twitter email print YouTube/Rice Is For Dinner An increasing number of iPhone users are reporting an issue with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus phones freezing up and becoming unresponsive to touch. The issue even has a deadly sounding name: "Touch disease." UPDATE: Apple announced a repair program for touch disease on November 17. More details here.  There are a lot of iPhones out there, so a problem that affects a fraction of a percent of devices could potentially impact thousands of users. But there's some evidence that this particular issue is fairly widespread.  Apple has never officially acknowledged the problem, but independent iPhone repair vendors and Apple Store technicians have said that it is easily one of the most common issues that people need to fix. In August and September, customers in California and Canada have filed proposed class action suits over it. Is your iPhone 6 Plus on the fritz? Here's what you need to know about "touch disease." How can I tell if my phone has touch disease? The most visible symptom is a flickering grey bar at the top of your screen. It looks like this:  But the flickering screen isn't the only symptom. Frequently, users report that after the grey bar starts flickering, the screen becomes intermittently unresponsive across the entire display.  What phones are affected?  By far, the most commonly affected model is the iPhone 6 Plus that first went on sale in 2014. One of the most common theories behind "touch disease" is that certain contacts inside the phone are bending, which leads to them breaking. The theory goes, the iPhone 6 Plus had the most complaints about bent phones, so it's the one that's having the most issues with touch disease.  The issue has been reported in the iPhone 6, iPhone 6S ,and iPhone 6S Plus as well, but at lower rates.  How much does it cost to get fixed?  If you're out of warranty, Apple will quote you a $329 replacement cost. However, Motherboard talked to some current and former Apple Store technicians and reports that if your iPhone is only slightly out of warranty, then you might get a less expensive replacement cost — perhaps $100 — especially since Geniuses know it's not necessarily your fault. You could also go to a third-party repair shop and save some money, but be careful, because it's a very difficult repair. Having a repair done independently also means that an Apple Store won't even look at your phone for repairs going forward. Here's an example of a touch disease repair that wasn't done correctly:  Can I fix it myself? Unlikely, unless you're a very skilled solderer. Even iFixit doesn't recommend doing the repair in your home. as this video shows:   What should I know when I bring my phone into the Apple Store? If your phone is cracked, you may think those cracks are causing lack of responsiveness. But in fact, you could have touch disease as well. Simply replacing the cracked screen will not fix the problem if it's a touch disease issue — in fact, you might get a new screen that's still unresponsive to your touch.  Additionally, if Apple gives you a replacement device, it's probably a refurbished device, and it could be suffering from touch disease as well. Those refurbs only have a 90-day warranty, so understand that you need to flag touch disease problems before that warranty runs out.  What's the actual technical problem? The chips with red boxes are the IC chips Legal documents According to one recently filed class action lawsuit, which cites iFixit, the issue is with the phone's logic board — the main circuit board inside the iPhone which all of Apple's various chips use to talk to each other.   On that board. there are two "IC" chips that "convert the touches on the touchscreen into actions in Apple's iPhone software." Apparently the logic board bends during regular use, thanks to an engineering flaw on the iPhone 6 Plus, which means the connections between the two IC chips become separated from the logic board. The solder simply breaks.  So you can either replace the entire logic board, or to resolder the IC chips back onto the existing, possibly warped, logic board.  My phone's a lemon. Can I sue Apple?  Yes. Lawyers in both the United States and Canada have filed class action lawsuits over the issue. However, neither suit has been "certified" yet, which would be the first step towards a day in court. Also, class action suits like this seldom succeed, and take years to complete if they are successful. What has Apple said about the problem?  Apple has not publicly commented on the issue at all, although former Apple employees have said that the company appears to be aware based on internal recommendations for repairs.  Business Insider has contacted Apple for comment three times about this issue but has not received a response.  Did touch disease infect your phone? Are you a current Apple Store employee or third-party repairer who has experience with this issue? We'd love to hear your story.

According to an early report from Localytics, the iPhone 7's launch weekend sales may have been close to Apple’s record-breaking iPhone 6s launch, though Apple never released any sales figures for this year's models. The same marketing company analyzed data for the first two weeks following the iPhone 7’s launch, and its findings are very interesting. It would appear that the “boring” iPhone 7 is selling even better than the iPhone 6s during its first two weeks. DON’T MISS: A painful reminder of just how bad the iPhone 7’s battery life is Combined iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus market share of the total number of iPhones that Localytics tracks reached 3.6% after two weeks of sales. The iPhone 7 is at 2.7% share, up from 1% after the first weekend. The iPhone 7 Plus grew from 0.2% to 0.9%. iphone-7-iphone-6s-market-share-localytics-1More Comparatively, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus accounted for a 4% share of the iPhone market in 2014. After two weeks of sales, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus only reached 2.6%. We will remind you that these are just percentages, and the iPhone market isn’t the same from year to year. Localytics doesn’t offer any firm numbers and it can’t, since only Apple knows exactly how many iPhones are in use, and how many of them are brand-new iPhone 7 models. iphone-7-iphone-6s-sales-two-weeks-localytics-1More That said, the numbers seem to indicate that Apple may be looking forward to solid iPhone 7 sales this year. And while it might not set new quarterly records, Apple could still see some iPhone sales growth thanks to the iPhone 7 series. Localytics also analyzed iOS adoption trends for the same period and discovered that iOS 10 has a 40% share after two weeks, compared to 36% for iOS 8 and 47% for iOS 9 during the same span of time following their releases.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search Skip to Navigation Skip to Main Content Skip to Related Content 0 Mail News Home Follow Us US World Politics Tech Science Odd News ABC News Yahoo Originals Katie Couric Matt Bai Apparently, The Return Of Jay Z's 'Blueprint' Albums To Apple Music Was A Complete Accident Eddie UPROXXOctober 4, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Getty Image UPDATE: Just as quietly as they appeared, Jay’s albums have now disappeared from the service. A source close to the matter indicates the Blueprint projects were never supposed to be offered on Apple Music by design. At this time, Tidal remains the one and only place to listen to Hova’s music online. Jay Z fans who want to stream The Blueprint, The Blueprint 2, and The Blueprint 2.1 are no longer restricted to Tidal. As several outlets have reported, every of installment of the rapper-entrepreneurs’s Blueprint series — minus The Blueprint 3 — is now available for streaming on Apple Music and purchase via iTunes. However, the albums have not returned to Spotify or Google Play. Ordinarily, the reappearance of music on a streaming service wouldn’t be major news, but Jay Z is the face of Tidal, whose parent company reportedly posted a $28 million net loss in 2015 and has been the subject of Apple acquisition rumors recently. While Apple Music head Jimmy Iovine said “We’re not looking to acquire any streaming services” when he was contacted by BuzzFeed’s Reggie Ugwu following news of the loss, his statement leaves wiggle room for Apple to take an offer from a company like Tidal. Perhaps the return of The Blueprint series to Apple Music means nothing, but it could be an exploratory move on either or both sides to see how the albums perform on the streaming service. On a lesser level, it could be a peace offering from Jay Z to open up talks between the two parties. Despite what S. Carter said on his verse from Kanye West’s “Diamonds From Sierra Leone (Remix),” he is a businessman, and sometimes good business calls for making the first move. Both parties know a combined streaming service would make a bigger dent to Spotify’s 40 million paid subscriber customer base and more importantly, give it the definitive advantage of artist exclusives. Because despite what record labels may think, streaming exclusives do matter. As an Apple Music exclusive, Chance the Rapper’s Coloring Book proved an artist could debut high in the Billboard 200 entirely off streams alone and more importantly, do so without the help of a record label. The same goes for Frank Ocean’s Blonde, which soared to no. 1 on the chart without any support from his former label, Def Jam.

That general feeling could translate into an unexpected fall in sales across the whole range this year, according to noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via MacRumors). Related: Apple Watch Series 1 review He’s cut 2016 sales projections by 15-25 per cent, tipping sales of 8.5 million to 9 million, compared with an estimated 10.4m shipped last year. Of course, few outside of Infinite Loop know how many watches Apple sold last year, because the company doesn’t declare the figure. As a result estimates vary significantly, but Kuo points out the Apple Watch has not put a dent into Fitbit sales. Subjectively, he puts his projection down to the lack of a killer app, poor battery life and too great a reliance on the iPhone. Regardless, a fall in sales year on year would unlikely be what Apple had in mind with general consensus that people like to wait for the 2nd-gen of any Apple product.

Spoken Editions, for those unfamiliar, are narrated pieces of content from a variety of online publishers. Spoken Editions are available in iTunes on the Mac and PC as well as Apple’s first-party Podcasting app for iOS. As noted by TechCrunch, Apple is launching Spoken Edition in partnership with a variety of publications, including Huffington Post, Reuters, Slate. .Mic, Wired, IGN, Bustle, Fusion, Gizmodo, Jezebel, Lifehacker, TIME, Skift, and Playboy. There are currently over 40 Spoken Editions available. Apple touts that Spoken Editions are useful in situations where you’re too occupied to read content, but could be multitasking and listening: Too busy to read your favorite websites? Just Listen! These audio versions give you tons of great narrated stories. They’re perfect for getting the latest scoop when you’re driving, working out, or just feel like kicking back. Spoken Editions are divided into a handful of categories in iTunes, including “Briefings,” which are quick recaps of recent news, as well as “Millennial Mindset,” “Policy in Perspective,” “Inclusion and Identity,” “Money Talks,” and others. Apple’s Spoken Editions are powered by technology from SpokenLayer, a company that takes a publisher’s RSS feed and quickly turns the content into audio. SpokenLayer says that, as part of its partnership with Apple, it will produce “hundreds of episodes” per week for Spoken Editions. Spoken Editions come as Apple is believed to be developing a standalone Siri device similar to Amazon’s Echo. Spoken Editions would theoretically be valuable for such a device and would allow users to quickly get an audio recap of content. Spoken Editions can be found in Apple’s Podcasts app or via iTunes. They are free, with some being ad-supported.

The iPhone 7 isn’t Apple’s first foray into this area, as the MacBook line has taken a similar approach with its trackpad. But the iPhone is way more popular than the Mac and more people own and use iPhones when compared to the Mac. It’s common knowledge that the majority of Apple’s profits are generated by the iPhone, so a fundamental change to the device’s primary hardware input method wasn’t something for Apple hardware engineers to take lightly. The good news is that, despite initial criticism, the iPhone 7 Home button is actually quite good once you get used to it. While it does have a few downsides, the change has produced several new positive side effects as well. Positives The Home button won’t wear out The Touch ID Home button introduced with the iPhone 5s quelled much of the hardware issues with the Home button, but any time there’s a moving part, it elevates the risk of potential failure. The new Home button has no moving parts, which means that there are fewer potential points of failure. Instead, it uses the Taptic Engine to simulate clicks. How to customize the Home button on iPhone 7 The old Home button’s click occurred because you were physically moving the button upon pressing it. If you didn’t enjoy the way the click of the Home button felt, you just had to live with it. With the iPhone 7, this is no longer the case. When you go through iOS’ initial setup process on the iPhone 7, you’ll encounter a new setup screen for the Home button. It’s here where you can choose between three click sensitivity levels. After initial setup, you can go back to Settings →  General →  Home Button to alter click sensitivity. Hands on video Subscribe to our YouTube channel for more iPhone 7 content Fewer ingress points We can debate about Apple’s motivation to alter the Home button on the iPhone 7. Was it because it wanted to improve water resistance? Was it due to the way customers in Asia abstained from using the mechanical Home buttons on products past? Is Apple conditioning us for a radical new iPhone redesign for its 10th anniversary iPhone 8? A solid state Home button can only improve water resistance It’s possible that all three conjectures may be true. What we do know for sure, however, is that the iPhone 7 claims to be water resistant — a first for an iPhone. It goes without saying, then, that eliminating a physical Home button with more ingress points would go a long way towards shoring up the device against taking on water. It feels good One of the reasons that I love my MacBook’s Force Touch trackpad is because every click feels the same, no matter where you click on the trackpad’s surface. Because it’s no longer relying on mechanical parts, it can sense the same amount of pressure from anywhere on the trackpad. When it comes to a surface area as small as the iPhone 7’s Home button, such factors don’t come into play nearly as much, yet there’s more consistency when it comes to Home button presses. The Home button on the iPhone 7 feels more responsive than the old mechanical Home button, as long as you ensure that you make skin contact with it. Potential negatives Skin contact required Because the new solid state Home button requires skin contact to register presses, this makes interacting with the Home button through non-capacitive gloves or other barriers a non-starter. It also means that you can no longer click the Home button with your fingernail, a practice that many of us with soiled hands have relied on in the past. Yeah, that’s not going to work This is, indeed, an annoyance, but I don’t think it’s as annoying as it sounds on paper. It’s why Apple has developed features like Hey Siri to control and interact with the iPhone without needing to touch it. That said, you might want to buy a pair of touch screen gloves just in case. It feels…odd…at first After my initial hands-on with the iPhone 7, I caught myself nodding in agreement with early, somewhat-negative reports, about the new Home button. Initially, interacting with the new Home button feels…weird. It almost feels as if you’re clicking the entire bottom lip of the iPhone instead of just the Home button. This is something I heard repeatedly from individuals who went hands-on with the new device after the iPhone 7 keynote. To be honest, after more than a week it still sort of feels that way, but that doesn’t make it bad, just different. It will take some getting used to for sure, but once you do get used to it, using the iPhone 7 Home button becomes second nature. Other things to consider Force Restarts and Recovery Mode changes Because the new Home button is software-controlled, the method used for Force Restarts, and getting into Recovery Mode or DFU Mode had to change. With older iPhones, pressing the Home button + Sleep/Wake button would allow you to Force Restart, etc. With the iPhone 7, you’ll need to utilize the Volume Down button instead of the Home button. Conclusion Yes, the Home button has changed and the change may feel odd at first, but after you get used to it, it’s much better. Going back to the mechanical Home button on my iPhone 6s now feels weird. I’ve simply come to the realization that the new Home button isn’t bad at all, it’s just the way that a Home button on an iPhone 7 is supposed to feel.

Today, however, Apple updated its Investor News webpage to reveal that, due to a “scheduling conflict,” the earnings call and release have been moved up to Tuesday, October 25th. It’s unclear what has arisen to cause Apple to move the date of its earnings release. This isn’t the first time the company has done so, though. Earlier this year, Apple rescheduled its Q2 earnings call so executives could attend the memorial service of the late tech icon Bill Campbell. Apple is expected to offer an early look at iPhone 7 sales during its third quarter earnings call. For the first time ever, however, Apple has not provided opening weekend numbers for the iPhone 7 due to the supply constraints surrounding the launch. Last quarter, Apple reported revenue of $42.4 billion on sales of 40.4 million iPhones, 9.9 million iPads, and 4.2 million Macs. Below is the guidance Apple provided for its 2016 fiscal fourth quarter: revenue between $45.5 billion and $47.5 billion gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38 percent operating expenses between $6.05 billion and $6.15 billion other income/(expense) of $350 million tax rate of 25.5 percent The call will be held at the standard time of 2PM PT/5PM ET, with the actual earnings press release itself being sent out roughly thirty minutes before then. The live broadcast of the call will be available on Apple’s website and of course we will have live coverage, as well.

As announced last week, Apple originally had scheduled the call for Thursday, October 27. It is not clear what conflict has arisen that is causing the meeting to be moved to a new date. Apple's 4Q 2016 earnings report will provide a look at initial iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus sales, giving us our first hint at how well the two devices have sold compared to the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s Plus. Apple's guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 includes expected revenue of $45.5 to $47.5 billion and gross margin between 37.5 and 38 percent, well below the revenue of $51.5 billion it saw in 4Q 2015. Apple will release its quarterly earnings statement at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time (4:30 p.m. Eastern Time), with a conference call to follow at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 pm. Eastern Time). MacRumors will provide live coverage of the results and the call. 70 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) agustinbg 7 weeks ago I hope it's because of the announcement of new Macs.

Pretty much all products seem to be in decline except online services (see previous article about Apple Watch) and revenues and profit are dropping accordingly. Yet Apple stubbornly keeps its margins as high as ever. They won't reduce them even temporarily because that would produce an expectation to keep them at a lower rate. At a certain point though you have to wonder, are they happy to see volumes and revenue decline further? I think they'll be paying close attention to market share yet there's already evidence to suggest gains there have slowed or halted too and may even be going backwards in some categories. They'll need a knockout Mac refresh to bring some life and excitement back to the Apple ecosystem. And I think Tim and the rest of the board should be on notice. Expect the typical corporate non-speak and self-promotion at such events anyway. "No doubt they'll find a way to spin those numbers to make them sound positive." Funny.

Therefore a direct comparison won't be made against previous years to hide the poor sales of the iPhone 7. Or possibly for more emojis as noted above. [doublepost=1475530166][/doublepost]Also because it takes COURAGE to acknowledge a conflict in your schedule. What?? How would moving it from the 27th to the 25th allow MORE sales?? Rating: 3 Votes JackANSI 7 weeks ago I could see it going two ways... 1. Moved it because they want to drop some updates after the call where they will again point out all the "great innovations in the pipeline" so that becomes a little less of a punch line. Since this time there will actually be "innovation" coming out of that pipeline... 2. The high exec team didn't want to dampen the mood that day because they are going to the Kanye West tour stop at The Forum (in Inglewood, CA). They'll have a lot of tough questions to answer possibly and that might get in the way of a good time with Kanye later.

Anita Balakrishnan | @MsABalakrishnan Monday, 3 Oct 2016 | 4:37 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES Getty Images Tim Cook and Steve Jobs in 2007 The spirit of late co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs still guides Apple's now-CEO Tim Cook, but Cook said he's not sitting back and wondering, "What would Steve do?" when he makes decisions. "I really want [Jobs'] legacy to be with Apple 10 years from now, a hundred years from now, a thousand years from now," Cook said at an event in Utah on Friday. "Not for Apple to be constrained by it. We're not thinking, 'What would Steve do?' We're not thinking that. But we're very much married to his vision of making the best products." Cook made a public appearance at the Utah Tech Tour, where Senator Orrin Hatch led a wide-ranging question-and-answer session about Cook's decision to join Apple, what he looks for in employees, the iPhone 7 and Apple's philosophy about products. In the five years Cook has led Apple, many have looked to him to prove he can fill the shoes of the innovative, charismatic and iconic Jobs — as if leading the world's most valuable company wasn't enough. The company has shifted over that time, releasing the Apple Watch and growing its internet services. Cook told the audience he'd never dreamed he would become CEO of Apple, but he's able to block out the outside pressures to answer "the call of a lifetime." "There's so much noise in the world every day," Cook said. "People want us to do this or that or the other thing.... The feeling that [Jobs] always had of not accepting the status quo. The rebel. That's very much still the heartbeat of the company." Most recently, the company has invested heavily in the camera and software in the iPhone 7 — an example, Cook said, of Apple's "insanely great" integrated approach. For instance, Apple's new app, Memories, uses artificial intelligence to organize photos into videos and slideshows, working together with the camera to make people's lives simpler. "It'll really make your heart sing," Cook said. Some technologies that are now on Cook's mind include encryption and augmented reality, he told the audience. Despite increasingly large-scale cyberattacks, Cook said that he thinks Apple customers still have a reasonable expectation of privacy. He said he also thinks that users will someday find it hard to believe they ever lived without augmented reality technology. Jobs' spirit makes decisions easy, Cook said, because he's learned to focus on saying "no" to products that are cool but don't enrich people's lives. Cook has preserved Jobs' office at Apple. "From my point of view, Steve — his spirit will always be the DNA of the company," Cook said. "He embodied who we are. It was his vision that Apple should make the best products, and it was his vision that they should enrich people's lives. Lots of other things will change with Apple, but that will never change."

That new Jet Black color is particularly hot... at least, it is until it gets all scratched up. As great as Apple's newest iPhones are in the hardware design department, they fall painfully flat in one key area: wallpapers. But if you're looking to spice things up a bit on your new iPhone 7 — or on any older iPhone or Android phone, for that matter — you've come to the right place. MUST READ: A painful reminder of just how bad the iPhone 7’s battery life is Apple's selection of pre-installed wallpapers has never been particularly good, but this year things are particularly disappointing because there are so few new options in iOS 10. Meanwhile, Apple's new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus feature the best LCD displays the world has ever seen, and colors are more vivid than ever before. Your hot new iPhone 7 deserves some hot new wallpapers, and we've found what may very well be the best collection around. Reddit user "Haftydoesit" compiled a collection of more than 400 different wallpapers by digging around Reddit and elsewhere, assembling them all into a single iCloud album. The bad news is that sources aren't credited, but the good news is they're all obviously free downloads. You'll find a few samples from the album pictured below, and this link will take you to the album where you can browse the wallpapers and download as many as you want. img_0406More img_0422More img_0442More Read More img_0443More img_0474More Trending right now: A painful reminder of just how bad the iPhone 7’s battery life is The 10 best new movies and TV shows coming to Netflix in October PokeGOD might be the ultimate Pokemon Go cheat, and Apple let it into the App Store See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Best Buy’s pre-Black Friday 2016 sale is live right now – here are the 20 best deals BGR News China astronauts return from monthlong space station stay Associated Press iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech AirSelfie drone is small enough to stow away in a phone case Digital Trends New hybrid console takes Nintendo on the go Yahoo Tech Walmart’s pre-Black Friday sale starts right now – here are the best deals so far BGR News This smart crib will help your baby sleep safely through the night Yahoo Tech Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

Apple rumored to release 3 iPads next spring 0 Share: Tablets by Gordon Gottsegen October 3, 2016 12:47 PM PDT Up Next President Obama slams fake news for eroding democracy In March, Apple released a more portable 9.7-inch version of its powerhouse device, the iPad Pro. But the rumor mill is churning out new speculation that the company may release more iPad Pro models, this time from the Japanese Apple blog, Macotakara. Current iPad Pro modelsPhoto by Sarah Tew/CNET The post (written in Japanese) suggests that the iPad Pro will be incarnated in three different sizes and is scheduled for spring 2017. The smallest model will be a 7.9-inch iPad Pro, which can be viewed as an overhauled iPad Mini 4. This device is expected to have a Smart Connector, four audio speakers, a 12-megapixel camera with True Tone Flash and a True Tone Display. Macotakara also reported that a new 10.1-inch iPad Pro and an update to 2015's 12.9-inch model is in the works. Both of these iPad Pros are speculated to be equipped with a 12-megapixel iSight camera, True Tone Flash and True Tone Display. The iPads will include headphone jacks too, unlike Apple's current pair of flagship phones, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. This isn't the first time we heard of the possibility of incoming iPad Pro models. In August, MacRumors reported that a reliable KGI securities analyst predicts three Pro devices as well, and added that an iPad with a flexible screen may hit markets in 2018. Without any official word from Apple, however, these speculations will remain rumors until the company announces more details. CNET reached out to Apple for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

But now, it looks like a few of the Brooklynite’s previous albums have surfaced on another streaming site. Apple Music has seen a resurrection of The Blueprint, The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse and Blueprint 2.1 on their streaming services, Complex reports. READ: Jay Z’s Next Business Move Involves The TV And Film Industry Though many have opted to buy the physical copy of their favorite album not available on Spotify or Apple Music, many have taken the more convenient route of subscribing to Tidal. No one knows for sure why Jay is allowing his music to be streamed, but many did notice the absence of some of his greatest hits in their streaming playlists. Since Jay Z’s acquisition of Tidal, several music lovers have chosen to go with a more familiar or convenient option in Apple Music or Spotify. Although Tidal has seen a big increase in subscribers recently, it’s had trouble competing with other popular streaming services. READ: Jimmy Iovine Shuts Down Idea Of Apple Music Purchasing Tidal In the past months, there have been talks of Apple possibly buying out Tidal and even Mr. West tweeted his opinion saying, “Apple give Jay his check for Tidal now and stop trying to act like you Steve.” But to squash any reported negotiation talks, Apple Music executive Jimmy Iovine said, “We’re really running our own race, we’re not looking to acquire any streaming services.” Although this is a good sign for Apple Music users, Hov still didn’t give streamers access to Reasonable Doubt, his first studio album, or The Blueprint 3.

Ever Give Up on Numbered iPhones? This has to stop eventually. Better sooner than later. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 3, 2016 at 3:09PM Introducing iPhone 7, the 10th iPhone. Image source: Apple. Enough is enough. I know, I know -- I bring this up every year. But that's because Apple, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) ongoing practice of numbered iPhones gets more and more ridiculous every year. It used to kind of make a little bit of sense -- sort of. It started with the iPhone 4, which was actually the fourth-generation iPhone that Apple made. But over time and several iterations of Apple's borrowed tick-tock S cycles, it got out of hand. Quickly. Apple developed a habit of changing the numbering every other year, when it introduced iPhones with new industrial designs. In between those years, it appended S on for iterative spec bumps (S initially stood for "speed" back in 2009). Data source: Apple. Chart by author. That would have normally presented a dilemma for 2016, since for the first time this year's model used the same overall design for the third year running. But since "iPhone 6SS" is just plain absurd, Apple went ahead and added a number. But what does Apple do next year, when it is expected introduce a redesigned iPhone that is potentially made of glass and features a wraparound OLED display? 8 is not great The Apple media has already started casually referring to the 2017 iPhone as the iPhone 8, but Patently Apple has spotted some fresh evidence that Apple may indeed go this route. Apple has filed for a couple of figurative 8 trademarks in different countries, stylizing an 8 using the recognizable activity rings from Apple Watch. Apple does use this icon to represent activity sharing, which is a big part of the social push for Apple Watch, but there is also some speculation that Apple will use this icon to stylize iPhone 8 next year. It's not a matter of if, but when There should be no question that Apple must get away from the numbers eventually. I really hope we're not still having this conversation in five years, if Apple releases the iPhone 10 in 2021, the 15th-generation iPhone. If we accept that inevitability, then Apple should transition to a more sustainable branding system sooner rather than later. The iPhone SE has no number associated with it, which is progress. Apple is seemingly doing away with numbers in the iPad family as well, with the recent iPad Pros being denoted partially in the same way as Macs (display size). Apple needs to just shift to the same system that it uses in the Mac, identifying models by display size and year. Please stop, Apple. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

Many early users of Apple's iMessage stickers are pranksters, it seems. They helped push Phoneys, a stickers app that lets you replace your friends' messages with your own, to the No. 1 spot in the iMessage App Store. Now, Apple appears poised to remove it. The saga started all in good fun, when developer Adam Howell thought it would be cool to make an app that lets people prank their friends by taking advantage of Apple's new iMessage stickers feature. His $0.99 Phoneys app allows people to drag a pre-written blue bubble over their message. On the sender's device, it looks wrong, because a blue bubble shows up on the left-hand side of the screen. But on the recipient's device, the blue bubble shows up on the correct side, making it appear to be a message they sent. Howell came up with 28 sarcastic messages, like "You're so smart" and "How do you always look so amazing?" and submitted his app for Apple's approval on Sept. 21. He got an email less than 48 hours later, telling him that his app was approved. "My wife was surprised, she was sure it'd never get approved," he wrote in a Medium post. "I decided I'd officially release Phoneys after the weekend, and spent more late nights working on the landing page, app store screenshots, icons, and marketing copy." Howell's work paid off. Thanks in part to recognition from the Internet technorati, including a TechCrunch story and mentions from several influential Twitter users, Phoneys became the top paid app on the iMessage store last week. But Apple was not pleased. Howell received a call from a company representative, who said that Apple's lawyers weren't happy that Phoneys had gotten through the App Store approval process. The representative requested that Howell make several changes, but didn't say that Phoneys would be yanked. //Related Articles iMessage App Store Launches With Stickers, More "The stickers couldn't be blue or green, they couldn't use San Francisco [the official iOS font] as the typeface, and the app could no longer be marketed as a 'prank' app, because Apple doesn't approve prank apps," Howell wrote. As of last Friday, when he wrote the Medium post, he still wasn't sure if he was going to comply. "On the one hand, if I update the stickers over the next week like Apple has so generously allowed me to do, I will be 'breaking' Phoneys for everyone who has already bought it," he wrote. "On the other, if I don't make the updates, Phoneys will get pulled from the store next week, letting everyone who has already bought the stickers use them until they someday delete them, but upsetting all those who bought Phoneys thinking I'd update it with more stickers in the future." So if you're inclined to engage in a little iMessage pranking, it's best to download Phoneys before this Thursday, the deadline that Apple set for the app to be revised or banned.

According to Kuo, the new Series 1 and Series 2 Apple Watch models suffer from a lack of "killer" applications, inadequate battery life, a heavy reliance on the iPhone and a multi-touch UI that he does not feel will be the ideal solution for wearable devices. The Apple Watch, says Kuo, has failed to impact sales of the Fitbit, and he does not believe the more affordable Series 1 models will lead to a higher number of sales. As a result of these perceived shortcomings, Kuo has cut his estimates for 2016 Apple Watch shipments by 15 to 25 percent, projecting sales of 8.5 to 9 million units during fiscal 2016. Kuo made similar predictions in April of 2016. "Based on these considerations, we revise down our 2016F shipments projection for the entire Apple Watch line from 10.0-10.5mn units to 8.5-9.0mn units (vs. 10.4mn units in 2015)," writes Kuo. "We now predict 2016F Apple Watch sales will decline from 2015 (with shorter selling time of eight months)."Apple does not break down Apple Watch sales numbers and has never revealed how many of the wearable devices have sold since April of 2015, making it difficult to pin down just how well it's doing with customers. IDC estimates shared over the summer suggest Apple sold 1.6 million units during Q2 2016, down from 3.6 million estimated units in the second quarter of 2015, aligning with Kuo's prediction. It's important to note that estimates for Apple Watch sales sometimes vary wildly, however. For example, during the March quarter, Swiss bank UBS estimated sales of 1.6 million units, while Strategy Analytics estimated sales of 2.2 million. The new Apple Watch Series 2 looks identical to the Series 1 Apple Watch models but includes better waterproofing to make it suitable for use when swimming, GPS, a faster dual-core processor, and a brighter display. Series 1 models also feature a faster processor, but are otherwise unchanged from the original Apple Watch. More substantial changes are expected for the 2017 Apple Watch, including an exterior redesign.

Macs are neglected, iPhones are simply minute upgrades, Apple Watch is well blah (can we get better design and battery life?), and the Apple TV is still way behind the Roku lineup. I own all of the above Apple products, just in case you wanted to know. Overall, I love the Apple ecosystem and how, most of the time, it works really well together. But, I see Apple falling behind the curve if something doesn't change. I'm afraid they are going to end up making the mistake Microsoft did years ago with wanting to stay the same in phones and no longer innovate or see the changing market and become irrelevant. Just like Microsoft and mobile. Venting over with, I'm just frustrated with the current Apple product lineup that is so underwhelming.

Could Have 3 New iPads Up Its Sleeve A handful of iPad Pros may be on the horizon -- including a new display size. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 3, 2016 at 2:05PM CEO Tim Cook unveils the 9.7-inch iPad Pro in March 2016. Image source: Apple. For the past couple of years, Apple, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad product cycles have been a bit unpredictable. The company shifted away from annual releases a couple years ago, presumably because Apple realized that tablet upgrade cycles are longer and frequent redesigns and refreshes weren't as necessary. For instance, Apple only launched the 12.9-inch iPad Pro at its September 2015 event, alongside a refreshed iPad Mini 4 with internal spec bumps. Well, we could be in store for as many as three new iPads launching within a matter of months. Three's company Japanese blog Mac Otakara is reporting that Apple is preparing to introduce a handful of iPad Pros next spring, including a 7.9-inch version, a 10.1-inch version, and a 12.9-inch version. The 12.9-inch model is said to get a beefier 12-megapixel primary camera, alongside a True Tone display and wider color gamut like the one found in the newer 9.7-inch iPad Pro that launched earlier this year. The same is expected for a 7.9-inch iPad Pro, which would bring the Mini up to Pro specs, as well as add the four-speaker stereo sound system. Perhaps more interesting is the news of a possible 10.1-inch iPad Pro, which would represent a modest increase from the 9.7-inch display that Apple has always offered for the iPad, starting with the original. If true, this device would see a small increase in size in order to accommodate a larger display. All three tablets are expected to keep the 3.5-mm headphone jack for now, unlike the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The news follows a similar report in August from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo that predicted the mid-sized model would increase to a 10.5-inch display. The big push into enterprise tablet sales by targeting professional users seems to be paying off, so it makes plenty of sense why Apple may be doubling down on its Pro efforts for the iPad. Investors have been watching the iPad business decline for several years, as the upgrade priority is lower, which is why the upgrade cycles are longer than Apple initially expected. The good news is that the year-over-year declines are slowly improving, and last quarter's negative 9% growth was the best performance in two years. Data source: SEC filings. Calendar quarters shown. Chart by author. It's harder to know where the saturation limit is for the tablet market, since many people will decide that they don't need or want one. Roughly half of U.S. adults own a tablet, according to the Pew Research Center. In contrast, smartphone penetration in the U.S. is now around 80%, according to comScore. But the enterprise market still has a long way to go, which is precisely why Apple just partnered up with Deloitte to help sell more iOS devices there. Who knows, maybe we'll even see iPad units grow again in the near future. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Ever Give Up on Numbered iPhones? This has to stop eventually. Better sooner than later. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 3, 2016 at 3:09PM Introducing iPhone 7, the 10th iPhone. Image source: Apple. Enough is enough. I know, I know -- I bring this up every year. But that's because Apple, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) ongoing practice of numbered iPhones gets more and more ridiculous every year. It used to kind of make a little bit of sense -- sort of. It started with the iPhone 4, which was actually the fourth-generation iPhone that Apple made. But over time and several iterations of Apple's borrowed tick-tock S cycles, it got out of hand. Quickly. Apple developed a habit of changing the numbering every other year, when it introduced iPhones with new industrial designs. In between those years, it appended S on for iterative spec bumps (S initially stood for "speed" back in 2009). Data source: Apple. Chart by author. That would have normally presented a dilemma for 2016, since for the first time this year's model used the same overall design for the third year running. But since "iPhone 6SS" is just plain absurd, Apple went ahead and added a number. But what does Apple do next year, when it is expected introduce a redesigned iPhone that is potentially made of glass and features a wraparound OLED display? 8 is not great The Apple media has already started casually referring to the 2017 iPhone as the iPhone 8, but Patently Apple has spotted some fresh evidence that Apple may indeed go this route. Apple has filed for a couple of figurative 8 trademarks in different countries, stylizing an 8 using the recognizable activity rings from Apple Watch. Apple does use this icon to represent activity sharing, which is a big part of the social push for Apple Watch, but there is also some speculation that Apple will use this icon to stylize iPhone 8 next year. It's not a matter of if, but when There should be no question that Apple must get away from the numbers eventually. I really hope we're not still having this conversation in five years, if Apple releases the iPhone 10 in 2021, the 15th-generation iPhone. If we accept that inevitability, then Apple should transition to a more sustainable branding system sooner rather than later. The iPhone SE has no number associated with it, which is progress. Apple is seemingly doing away with numbers in the iPad family as well, with the recent iPad Pros being denoted partially in the same way as Macs (display size). Apple needs to just shift to the same system that it uses in the Mac, identifying models by display size and year. Please stop, Apple. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

(Christian Burkert) BY Ebenezer Samuel NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday, October 3, 2016, 2:47 PM Daniel Sennheiser knows exactly what he's up against. Along with his brother Andreas, Daniel Sennheiser runs the blossoming Sennheiser company, a blossoming audio business based in Germany. But he's watched and admired New York City for a long time, come to appreciate the business challenges of the Big Apple. And along the way, Sennheiser says, he's come to view New York City as a pivotal battleground for any business ready to go global. "New York has been the beginning of a lot of things," Sennheiser says. "This is a melting pot, that has brought up so many things, brought up Broadway. New York is very fast-living. And that's positive in a sense that they're quick to pick up new trends and things. U.S. Government returns to World Trade Center 15 years after 9/11 "But that also means you need to make a certain amount of noise." And now, it's time for Sennheiser to make some noise. In late October, the company will take up residence in the Big Apple, opening the Sennheiser Soundscape Showroom in the Westfield World Trade Center. It's a venue that will be filled with Sennheiser's unique products, but the focus isn't on selling. Instead, Sennheiser is focused on introducing New Yorkers to its distinctive audio, part of a first step in establishing the company as a sound powerhouse in a nation that's spent the last few years in the midst of a great headphone awakening. "We believe it's the right time for us to make a big splash to share our version of the future of audio with New York," says Andreas. It's an intriguing vision from a company that's long delivered high-quality sound but has consistently lacked the profile of the bigger names in the industry. Beats by Dre and Bose own the majority of U.S. mindshare, and both companies are highly visible, utilized by both celebrities and major sports franchises. 14 photos view gallery Westfield World Trade Center grand opening Sennheiser has never had such presence, and that's mostly by choice. Look closely during your next NBA on TNT broadcast, and you may notice Sennheiser headsets on the play-by-play guys. But the company has historically done little marketing, preferring to let its devices shine on their own merits. The Soundscape Showroom isn't the start of some massive ad campaign, either. But it is part of a company-wide initiative to be more visible in the United States, to draw more notice to an underrated line of products. Just a few years ago, the company set up a small pop-up store on the East Side. With the Soundscape Showroom, it's going bigger, aiming to be a national presence. "It's to raise a little awareness. We're just not present enough," Daniel says, before talking proudly of Sennheiser's lore. "Sennheiser is the inventor of the hi-fi headphone. Not a lot of people know that." Indeed, few realize just how potent Sennheiser products truly are. It was Sennheiser that released the first pair of open headphones way back in 1968, and it's Sennheiser that's continued to chase perfect, pure sound throughout the last few decades. And it's Sennheiser that last year debuted the HE1 Orpheus, a handcrafted set of headphones powered by a massive amplifier built from marble and driven by gold-vaporized electrodes and platinum vaporized-diaphragms. It's a device that costs tens of thousands of dollars and is hardly for use with your iPad on the train - but it's a device that showcases Sennheiser's pursuit of high-level sound. "Sennheiser has been on the forefront of audio strategy for years," says Daniel. "We just added the sexy aesthetics after we did the sound." Sound remains the company's top priority, but in recent years, it's been pushing to match the more attractive headphones delivered by the likes of Beats and Bose. There's the Momentum line of headphones, a sharp-looking line of headphones with rugged leather bands that seem tailor made for the stylish Manhattanite. And just this summer, Sennheiser released the PXC 550, a noise-canceling Bluetooth pair of cans designed to go head-to-head with Bose's QuietComfort line, but with touch controls built onto the earcups. "We believe it's the right time for us to make a big splash to share our version of the future of audio with New York," says Andreas. ((HANDOUT) ) These products, says Daniel Sennheiser, are examples of Sennheiser's ability to adapt to culture, proof that the company's products truly can fit the New Yorker. The Sennheiser aesthetic is unique, and the Momentums are especially eye-catching units, as fashion-conscious as they come. The hope is that consumers enter the Soundscape Showroom and see these products, falling in love with a new brand of headphone. "The qualities (of Sennheiser headphones) are great — the material, the leather, the steal," Daniel says. "But you also have to have the opportunity to touch it. In our experience, audio is something you can't describe. You have to put it on your head. "Sennheiser is not a brand for everyone. I think we're a brand for people who are in the know, who are creative, who really look for special things. That's why I think a place like New York is the place to be." And that's precisely why Sennheiser is finally here, with the Soundscape Showroom as its first truly potent portal in the United States. The goal is to build from here, Andreas says, to finally aggressively cultivate the Sennheiser brand in the U.S. It won't be easy, not with Beats and Bose dominant. But Sennheiser arrives prepared. "We have a serious plan, but we're also nimble enough to adjust," says Daniel. "As Frank Sinatra said, 'If you can make it here, you can make it everywhere.'"

On Monday, Apple risked incurring a similar wrath with its latest desktop software release. Just as Microsoft did following the launch of Windows 10, Apple is enabling automatic downloads of the new macOS Sierra OS, released last month. For customers with Auto Downloads enabled in the Mac App Store settings, the file will download in the background, providing the Mac meets the minimum spec requirement and has enough available storage space. Speaking to The Loop, Apple said it will not be installed without the user giving permission and will send them an alert when the download is complete. Related: macOS Sierra review Apple told the publication that if users begin to get low on storage space the Sierra install file will be deleted. The download can also be manually deleted. The situation creates a pickle for Mac owners like to have their Mac apps regularly updated without checking for updates, but don’t want to feel like a major OS update is being forced upon them. Of course, they can go into App Store settings and turn off automatic downloads, but this will remove those aforementioned benefits. macOS Sierra is a free upgrade bringing Siri, Apple Pay on the Web and a proximity unlock feature for Apple Watch owners.

Today, Fuze launched an intriguing Indiegogo campaign that promises to bring the audio port back to the iPhone 7. To achieve this, the company is taking Apple’s Lightning to 3.5mm adapter and building it straight into a case, where you can plug your headphones with “no dongles, no adapters, no problems.” In addition to the audio port, the Fuze Case will also serve as a battery pack as it adds 2,400mAh of extra battery life to the iPhone 7 and 3,600mAh to the 7 Plus. Fuze restores 3.5mm audio jack for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. It delivers a doubled battery life as well as scratch and shock protection, all while maintaining the iPhone’s compact profile. We need your help to bring back the jack. When you purchase Fuze, you purchase the freedom of choice. This is how the Fuze Case will look: Credit: Fuze / Indiegogo It will be available in five different colors including white, black, gold, rose gold and blue. The case is currently available for $49 to ‘super early bird’ backers, but will increase to $59 once more people have chipped in and will eventually sell for $69 in retail. The company expects to start shipping the accessory in December later this year. Head to the Indiegogo campaign for more details about the Fuze Case. via 9to5Mac Fuze Cases: Bringing Back the Audio Jack on IndieGogo Read next: How I fixed my Wi-Fi by ditching shitty consumer hardware GeariPhoneiPhone 7 Share on Facebook (210) Share on Twitter (284) Mix is a reporter from Amsterdam.

Based on that report, Samsung rushed through the process of getting the Galaxy Note 7 out into the real world, of which some units included a faulty battery under the hood. The reason? The “boring” iPhone 7. Samsung wanted to be on the market, with the genuinely eye-catching and features-packed Galaxy Note 7 before Apple got its own new flagship out into the real world. Samsung and Apple have been direct competitors for a long time now, so if that report is true, it wouldn’t be all that surprising. Samsung would have seen this year, and its Galaxy Note 7, its biggest push against Apple to this point. Samsung sells plenty of handsets all across the globe, but Apple is still Apple, and if the company was going to essentially “take this year off,” and launch a boring iPhone 7, well, Samsung would be silly not to capitalize, right? For better or worse, the Galaxy Note 7 launched with a rumored rushed process behind-the-scenes. Some might say better, because the Galaxy Note 7 earned almost global praise for its design, features, and camera. The Galaxy Note 7 earned those positive reviews, and Samsung should be, in all honesty, happy with the handset they launched. And others would say that a recall of that size, and with that much publicity, well, there might not be any coming back from that for the Galaxy Note 7. So it’s probably not at all surprising that Galaxy S8 rumors started to pick up steam after the recall was made official. And, soon enough, word on the street was that Samsung was working diligently to try and get the new smartphones out in the market as soon as possible. Maybe even sooner than we normally expect them to arrive. I can’t help but think that’s a bad idea, especially if that aforementioned report, where a rushed process led to the issues with the Galaxy Note 7, is true. It would certainly make sense that Samsung would want to take some of the attention off the Galaxy Note 7, and as soon as possible, but ultimately the company should be focused on replacing units right now, and showing that the new handsets, which have replaced faulty units, are safe. Samsung should not rush into the Galaxy S8 variants at all. It’s already October and talk about Samsung’s “exploding phone” is already starting to dwindle, just weeks after the issue really flared up. By the time 2017 rolls around, Samsung won’t be the top of the news cycle anymore, and neither will faulty Galaxy Note 7 units. (Unleash the replacement units continue to be an issue for some owners.) Rushing into the Galaxy S8 won’t help anything. It can, however, potentially make things a lot worse. Just imagine, for a second, that Samsung rushes through the process putting together and launching the Galaxy S8 and the handset has the same faulty battery issue the Galaxy Note 8 did. Or, worse, has some other major issue that forces Samsung to take drastic actions with yet another flagship smartphone. Samsung should be doing anything and everything in its power to make sure that there are no issues, especially major issues, that can harm the Galaxy S8 when it launches to the public. It’s not possible to make the device perfect, because it’s technology we’re working with here, but keep trying to get it as close as possible. Rushing should not be part of the conversation at all. Even if the Galaxy Note 7 hadn’t suffered a major recall, Samsung should follow its own yearly refresh cycle, make sure all the boxes are ticked, and then launch another eye-catching flagship. I honestly hope Samsung is taking its time, dotting all the i’s and crossing all the t’s this time around. Based on how great the Galaxy Note 7 is, and the features that are baked into it, and whatever new things Samsung has been working on with Android 7.0, I’m definitely looking forward to seeing what the Galaxy S8 flagships in 2017 have to offer. Let’s just hope it doesn’t offer more exploding phones.

Japanese blog Mac Otakara has claimed Apple will ship three new iPad Pro models next spring in 7.9-inch, 9.7-inch, and 10.1-inch sizes. The report cited "reliable sources" and provided a few details on specifications, including that all three new models will reportedly feature quad microphones, rather than the current dual setup, and they will keep their 3.5mm headphone jacks. The 12.9-inch model will feature a True Tone display like the current 9.7-inch model. It'll also add the 9.7-inch model's 12-megapixel rear-facing iSight camera and True Tone flash. The smallest of the new iPad Pro models, the 7.9-inch one, will include a Smart Connector, True Tone display, four speakers, and a 12-megapixel rear-facing iSight camera with True Tone flash. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who is known for reporting accurate Apple-based leaks, also said in August that Apple is planning to release three new iPads in 2017, though he claimed the sizes would include a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and an affordable 9.7-inch iPad. Although Mac Otakara doesn't have a perfect record, it was the first to report that Apple was ditching the headphone jack and adding new colours to the iPhone 7 range. It also accurately reported on the pressure-sensitive Home button and Lightning-to-3.5mm audio adapter.

Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has issued a report that says new Apple Watch shipments have decreased by 15-25% which affects the firm’s annual sales prediction. The report notes that KGI cites four reasons for relatively limited interest in Apple Watch: no clear killer app, poor battery life, dependence on iPhone, and the experience multi-touch offers on a wearable. Aside from the fashion aspect, you could argue that health and fitness tracking is the killer app category, but battery life is generally unchanged in version two with the existing need to charge nightly or risk a dead battery before the next night. GPS in Series 2 models has increased iPhone independence for fitness tracking, but cellular is still necessary for most functions. KGI’s multi-touch point is harder to break down, but watchOS 3 cleans up the user experience and reduces the dependency on hidden Force Touch gestures. It stands out that KGI predicts the cheaper Apple Watch Series 1 model, which has the same externals as the first-generation version plus the faster chip of Series 2, will not boost sales. BI reports that KGI forecasts a small bump specifically for the upgraded Apple Watch Series 2: The Apple Watch announced by Apple last month, the “Series 2,” is very similar to the device Apple originally revealed in late 2014, and Kuo is raising his shipment estimates for the new device by less than 10%. Still, KGI forecasts a drop in the short-term based on the current shipping models: “Based on these considerations, we revise down our 2016F shipments projection for the entire Apple Watch line from 10.0-10.5mn units to 8.5-9.0mn units (vs. 10.4mn units in 2015),” writes Kuo. “We now predict 2016F Apple Watch sales will decline from 2015 (with shorter selling time of eight months).” Even with KGI’s predictions, it’s difficult to measure Apple Watch sales performance considering Apple doesn’t break out the product as a separate category like it does for iPhone, iPad and Mac; Apple Watch revenue is lumped in with iPods, Apple TV, Beats hardware, and other accessories. Apple is set to announce its Q4 2016 results later this month on October 27, which should include data for initial Apple Watch Series 2 sales (just not specifically) and iPhone 7 sales.

The major Mac software update was released at the end of September, and starting today Apple will begin automatically downloading the update on Macs that haven’t updated yet (via The Loop). Mac users will still need to manually allow the software update to be installed; the only change here is that the update can download automatically then prompt you to install. You can also opt out of this feature in System Preferences → App Store → Download newly available updates in the background. The Loop says Apple will not download macOS updates even with this option enabled if you’re Mac runs out of local storage, however, and the automatic download will be deleted if your Mac needs additional storage and you don’t manually delete it first. Before today, updating to macOS Sierra required manually downloading the installer from the Mac App Store. Today’s change could be seen as a way to encourage adoption or simply as a way to make it easier to stay on the latest software update as new versions become more frequent.

Her reworded title along with a tweaked job description is live at the Apple Leadership webpage. The change occurred over this past weekend. This is a purely cosmetic change: her responsibilities have not shifted and she is still in charge of all things retail at Apple. Here’s Anhrendts’s bio page on Apple’s website before the change. You can clearly see that her official title used to be “Senior Vice President, Retail and Online Stores”. And this is what her updated bio page now looks like. The “Online Stores” is nowhere to be seen in her title, she’s now simply “Senior Vice President, Retail”. Her job description has been tweaked slightly as well to reflect the official title change. From the description, we can conclude that her responsibilities have not changed the tiniest bit. She continues to be responsible for “strategy, real estate and developed and operations” of Apple’s brick-and-mortar/online stores and contact centers. Interestingly, the previous description made no mention of her being responsible for retail strategy. The following paragraph relevant to her duties has been added to her refreshed bio page: Since joining Apple in 2014, Angela has integrated Apple’s physical and digital retail business to create a seamless customer experience for over a billion visitors per year with the goal of educating, inspiring, entertaining and enriching communities. The development is likely part of an internal company streamlining that began in August when Apple stopped using the “Store” titling” for retail locations. Apple Stores are now referred to as, say, “Apple Regent Street” instead of the previous ”Apple Store, Regent Street” nomenclature. While visible on Apple’s website and marketing materials, the renamed store names are yet to show up in the company’s official Apple Store shopping application for the iPhone and iPad.

Under her leadership, wholesale prices have gone up, squeezing out any margin that the smaller stores make making it almost impossible to make any money off of a sale. Then you have big box stores like Best Buy, Target, Costco, etc. butchering prices (even though they lose money) to below cost to get customers in to buy the stuff they really make money on. Really sad to see Apple turn their backs on these smaller companies, most of which have better trained employees and more personal service. Apple retail stores are all about the flash and wow factor of the superbly designed interiors, but really lack in who they hire and how they help people. They mostly hire based off of personality and looks. You essentially just need to be a hipster and you have a better chance of getting hired at an Apple Store.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines MacBook Pro with Touch Bar now available for in-store pickup Get up to $200 off the new MacBook Pro + no tax outside NY Where the Apple Car is going Apple’s free app of the week: Tayasui Sketches Pro New Lock screen bug bypasses iPhone/iPad passcode, lets you see photos/contacts   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to PasswordRecovery stores passwords and recovers them when you forget them NCTextColor lets you add vibrancy to Notification Center iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

How to try out the new MacBook Pro Touch Bar on any...   skip to main content skip to main menu     macOS Sierra is now available as an automatic download By Christian Zibreg, Oct 3, 2016 Tweet 7 Comments Apple on Monday told The Loop’s Jim Dalrymple that the free macOS Sierra software update will be available as an automatic download later today. This means that the software update will download in the background for Mac owners who have auto update downloads enabled in System Preferences. Apple is being smart about the move and won’t download any files to your computer if it’s low on storage or does not meet the system requirements for macOS Sierra. Apple will begin pushing macOS Sierra today, it’s a staggered release that will be gradually rolling out to all customers over the next week or so. “If your computer is low on space, macOS Sierra will not download,” explained Dalrymple. “In addition, if it has downloaded and your computer starts to get low on space, the download will be automatically deleted”. Once the software update has fully downloaded to your computer, it won’t install automatically as a prompt will go up asking if you wish to apply the update now, later or ignore the update. You will find the installer in your /Applications/ folder, named “Install macOS Sierra”. To prevent software updates from downloading automatically in the background, open System Preferences → App Store and untick the boxes next to the options labeled “Download newly available updates in the background” and “Install OS X updates”. If you use third-party software which requires custom kernel extensions—especially if your Mac Pro has an unsupported, non-flashed graphics card—be sure to uncheck the option to automatically install macOS updates until any custom kernel extensions have been updated to support Sierra.

The feature can be turned off, however. By Jake Smith for iGeneration | October 3, 2016 -- 18:21 GMT (11:21 PDT) | Topic: Hardware Users can turn off the automatic updates in App Store preferences, and they can be manually deleted. Apple will begin pushing macOS Sierra as an automatic download beginning on Monday. See also I don't want an iPad Pro, I want an OS X tablet ​Reports are circulating that Apple is preparing to unveil a larger, enterprise and power-user focused (and undoubtedly more expensive) iPad called the iPad Pro. Read More macOS Sierra will download in the background and prompt users to install the update, when convenient, Apple confirmed to The Loop. Apple will begin its auto-download of macOS Sierra randomly over the next week for its users. The update will download when it makes sense and only for Macs that support Sierra and have enough storage space. Users can turn off the automatic updates in App Store preferences, and they can be manually deleted. See also: The great, and well-hidden, storage tool in macOS Sierra The headline features in macOS Sierra are Siri for the Mac, Apple Pay to the desktop, an updated Photos in line with the iOS 10 experience, iCloud improvements, and the new Universal Clipboard that allows copying and pasting text and images between iOS and Sierra. Microsoft began pushing Windows 10 to supported PCs in a similar automatic update in mid-2015. Apple also released the third developer beta for macOS Sierra on Monday, bringing bug fixes and performance enhancements. Developers can download the preview from the Apple Developer Center.

Now, a new report from Macotakara suggests that there will be three new iPad Pro models coming in early 2017. Macotakara’s reporting corroborates with KGI stating that there will be a slightly larger “standard” sized iPad Pro, though it says the screen will be 10.1-inches, not 10.5-inches. It says the larger screen will be achieved by making the external dimensions 1cm longer and 0.5cm wider. The smaller 7.9-inch iPad form factor, known as iPad mini, seemed to be abandoned by Apple some have speculated. However, this report suggests Apple will continue developing the iPad mini line with the new ‘Pro’ suffix. iPad mini 4 will renew as iPad Pro (7.9-inch), get Smart Connector, and change into the specification of 4 speakers audio. Also, the iSight camera of 12 million pixels, True Tone flash, and True Tone display correspondence to Display P3 [DCI-P3 wider color gamut aka True Tone display] seem to be adopted. The report doesn’t specifically mention the Smart Connector, but one would assume that it’ll be there and in the 10-inch model as well. It also says that all three models will have a new quad microphone system. Macotakara does not mention a lower cost 9.7-inch iPad, something KGI had previously reported. Lastly, the site says that Apple will retain the 3.5mm headphone jack on all three models of the iPad, unlike the iPhone 7 which got rid of it. On the same line, there’s no word on whether or not the new iPads will gain the new touch-sensitive Home button.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Apple To Launch 3 New IPads In Spring 2017 Posted: Oct 3 2016, 1:12pm CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Oct 3 2016, 1:22pm CDT, in Rumors | Apple     Apple is all set to release 3 new iPads in 2017 with improved specs and design. However, don't expect drastic changes. A Japanese blog Mac Otakara is claiming that Apple is to introduce three new iPad Pro models in spring 2017. These iPad Pro model will come in 7.9, 9.7, and 10.1 inch sizes. How To: Find Hatchimals In Stock The report cites it has gained information from reliable sources. It claimed that the 12.9 inch model will be featuring a True Tone display just like its 9.7 inch counterpart. It will contain four channel ambient light sensors which will have a sensitivity to change their color and intensity as per the surrounding environment. It is also said that the 12.9 inch iPad Pro will have the same 12 megapixel iSight camera found in the 9.7 inch model too. In addition, the 7.9 inch model will be a successor to the iPad mini 4 and thus will have a a Smart Connector, again a true tone display, four main speakers and the same camera features found in iPad mini 4. The features are very much comparable because according to Apple it develops them to make a standardized line up. Currently the iPad has dual setup of microphones but in the near future we will see all the iPad Pro models gaining quad microphones and will also maintain 3.5 mm headphone jacks. The report received today actually reaffirms the claim given by the KGI analyst Ming-Chi-Kuo who said back in August that Apple is to release a trio of new iPads in 2017. However in his note he also claimed that the trio would have a 12.9 iPad Pro 2, a 10.5 inch iPad and a low budget 9.7 inch iPad too. However Kuo did not mention any introduction of a refreshed 7.9 inch model. Some are speculating that Apple just might ditch the iPad mini line due to its concentration on the larger tablet line. Also with the addition of the recent 5.5 inch iPhone Plus a decrease in the smallest tablet of Apple has been observed but the reports received today suggest otherwise. Mac Otakara hasn’t always been on track with Apple rumors but then again its sources have at times given accurate predictions. This blog was the very first to leak that Apple was going to remove the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and also the availability of jet black in iphone 7 Another accurate leak by the blog was iPhone 7’s name scheme, the touch sensitive Home button and even the larger ear piece cut out. It also claimed that the models have a lightning-to-a-3.5 mm audio adapter. Unfortunately the 3.5mm ear pods were wrong which invalidated the rumors of the Smart Connector. On the other hand the timing was also wrong in its report which said that the new MacBook Air models with USB-C ports would be out in June. The latest report however is that they will be out in early October.

News Your Store Management Tips Is Cash on the Brink of a Slow Death? Is Cash on the Brink of a Slow Death? Mark E. Battersby | October 1, 2016 | Cash may be an endangered species. Think about it: Around $60 billion in cashless consumer transactions occurred in 2010. In 2016, the Federal Reserve has estimated that figure will rise to $616.9 billion.  Certainly, the move toward a cashless society is already well under way around the world. In Sweden, an estimated 59 percent of consumer transactions are cashless. And in Canada, 77 percent of those responding to a recent survey by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. said they would prefer to eliminate cash altogether. Stateside, 3 out of 4 Americans say they use less cash today than 10 years ago, according to MasterCard. In fact, 43 percent of Americans said debit cards were their preferred payment method, while 35 percent preferred credit cards and just 9 percent preferred cash, according to a 2014 survey of 1,000 consumers by TSYS, a payment processing company.  “We’re definitely moving toward a cashless society,” says Perry Kramer, vice president and practice leader at Boston Retail Partners, which advises retailers on payment solutions and upgrades. “Do we think we’re going to achieve that in the next 10 years? No. But we will have a much more significantly cashless society.” Smartphones will likely play an important role in that development. “Our findings make it clear that mobile wallets will lead the next wave of mobile engagement,” says Brett Caine, president and CEO of digital wallet provider Urban Airship. (The company likens mobile/digital wallets to a physical billfold, letting you store credit cards, coupons, tickets, and business cards on your phone.) The Benefits of a Cashless Strategy A cash-free existence is appealing not only to shoppers. It also has clear benefits for retailers—among them, new avenues to connect with (and learn about) consumers. Mobile payments, in particular, allow brands to collect reams of personal data from their clients, and ultimately insert their brand messaging into the consumer mobile experience, including on social media networks. Today, as cutting-edge retailers work to eliminate their dependence on cash, jewelry businesses that hope to stay current need to take note of the latest cash-free point-of-sale (POS) innovations—chief among them EMV (Europay, MasterCard, and Visa) technology in credit cards, which helps protect users and lenders from security breaches and credit card fraud, and Apple Pay, Apple’s mobile wallet app that’s accepted at hundreds of chain retailers, from Bloomingdale’s to Best Buy.  In an increasingly digital marketplace, the time is right for jewelry brands and retailers to familiarize themselves with cashless payment systems currently gaining ground.  Next-Gen Credit Cards  First and foremost, retailers must be aware of how credit cards are evolving. “Smart” cards—also known as chip cards—are embedded with computer chips that are more secure against hackers than the traditional magnetic stripes.  In order to accept EMV cards, retailers need EMV readers—and the United States is lagging big-time on this compared with Europe, where chip cards are the norm. Experts, however, say we’re slowly getting there. It’s estimated that almost 90 percent of U.S. consumers will have chip-encoded cards by the end of 2017.  The transition to EMV, first announced in the United States in 2011, has been a daunting chore for many jewelry retailers. A smattering of phone calls from JCK to corporate and independent jewelry stores—including London Jewelers in Manhasset, N.Y., and Tiffany & Co.’s New York City flagship, neither of which use an EMV credit card reader—revealed that jewelers are in no hurry to embrace chip cards. “We’re planning to switch at some point, but it took so much to do the last switch-over, we’re just tired out,” said a representative from an independent jewelry store who spoke on condition of anonymity.  By now, though, every jewelry retailer should be aware of the so-called liability shift that comes with failure to adopt EMV technology: In essence, businesses and card processors using old technology after the Oct. 1, 2015, switch date will find themselves, not the credit card companies, liable for fraudulent charges. “I’ve worked with some retailers where it was costing them a million dollars a month in fines and chargebacks not to be EMV-compliant,” Kramer says. “There’s a big financial incentive for many retailers to be on it. Secondly, there’s going to be a tipping point in the next six months or so, where the consumer is going to assume you accept it and, if the retailer doesn’t have it, they’re going to feel less secure.” Considering that 30 percent of U.S. retailers and 40 percent of all retail transactions use the EMV technology, Kramer thinks the nation is “rapidly getting to that point.”  The Pros and Cons of Mobile Payments The rise of mobile payment options has further reduced the need for consumers to carry cash. Leading credit card companies Visa and MasterCard have both introduced technology that lets users pay with a swipe of their phones. MasterCard’s Maestro card (and accompanying phone app) allows shoppers to pay by waving either the card or their device in front of a reader, while Visa’s payWave uses an embedded computer chip to send payment information to a secure reader at the point of sale. Users wave their card or device within 1–2 inches of the reader to make payments. Meanwhile, Apple Pay and other mobile wallets—such as Android Pay, Google’s mobile wallet app, and Samsung Pay, made for Samsung phones—can store, for example, credit, debit, and loyalty cards and connect a credit card to an account that enables users to pay via near field communication (NFC) technology at terminals found at hundreds of stores. Mobile payments are still relatively new. And most independent brands that accept Apple Pay do so through third-party POS systems, including Square and Shopify, which integrate the Apple Pay functionality into their interfaces. There are, however, caveats. The fact that Apple’s iPhone 6 is the only smartphone that even works with Apple Pay has slowed down the advance of mobile wallet payments. In the United States, iPhones account for about 44 percent of the estimated 207 million smartphones in use. Of these iPhones, approximately 29 percent are from the iPhone 6 family. That means only about 13 percent of all U.S. smartphones are even capable of using Apple Pay.  Another issue that’s holding back Apple Pay and other mobile wallets: vendor adoption, at both POS and online.  Forbes reports that a survey of nearly 100 retailers by PCM Research and ACI Worldwide found that, while half said they were interested in mobile POS and mobile wallets, only a fifth had implemented an omnichannel payments program. Among the challenges retailers reported: incompatible systems, data integration, and the inability to track customers.  The jewelers with whom JCK spoke say they don’t feel compelled to accept any mobile wallet solutions, not even Apple Pay. Adam Gorman, co-owner of jewelry store I. Gorman in Washington, D.C., said he’s never considered accepting Apple Pay because no one’s ever asked to use it.  Worries over the security of contactless payments are another roadblock. The security of EMV cards is predicated on the combination of encryption keys and a consumer-generated PIN code. But with contactless payments (usually made on a smartphone), a PIN is not requested, stripping them of a security layer.  “Contactless payments are probably the future,” says Itai Sela, CEO of B2, a consultancy that specializes in computer-chipped credit cards and contactless and NFC payments. “But they are not secure, and if their security is compromised—which is easy to do—consumers will lose trust in [the payment system] and therefore not use it anymore.” All that aside, Kramer says the biggest obstacle to a cashless society is “the 37-some percent of America that’s unbanked—people who don’t use a bank. That’s a very large part of our society. They don’t have a credit card—but they will get a prepaid card that they reload all the time. Until we can get to the point where we can take these payment cards at retail, the cashless [equation] will be hard to reach.”  Future Pay Despite the challenges to achieving a cash-free society, retailers need to consider their cashless options if they hope to stay relevant to millennials. According to CreditCards.com, 13 percent of that demographic reported using digital currencies in 2014, while 26 percent expect to use them by 2020. High-income consumers are also more open to using digital currencies than those in lower income brackets. Nineteen percent of high-income consumers used digital currencies in 2014, and 32 percent expect to by 2020.  “I think we are going toward a cashless society,” says Sela. But, like Kramer, he says the wheels of this train are moving slowly. Which means there’s still time to get up to speed before the new cashless world is upon us. (Additional reporting by Emili Vesilind)   Becoming Cashless Demographics play an important role for every jewelry retailer attempting to enter (or expand within) the cashless world. After deciding what customers—existing and prospective—want in the way of cashless payment options and what they will accept, be sure to consider these factors: • Is your store EMV-compliant and able to accept the new chip cards? Liability for potentially fraudulent sales is at stake. For more info on EMV compliance, consult the EMV Migration Forum (emv-connection.com) and the Smart Card Alliance (smartcardalliance.org/activities-emv-migration-forum). • If your store can accept the new EMV cards, are they compatible with your business’s existing POS system? Integration remains a work in progress, so shopping for a new, fully integrated system is important.  • Does your store’s current credit card provider offer programs such as MasterCard’s PayPass (mastercard.com/sea/consumer/paypass.html) or Visa’s payWave (usa.visa.com/run-your-business/small-business-tools/payment-technology/visa-paywave.html) for contactless sales?  • Although their acceptance is still limited, Apple Pay (www.apple.com/apple-pay) and mobile wallets such as Android Pay (android.com/pay) offer yet more cashless options. Check out this primer on mobile wallets: wellsfargo.com/mobile-payments/mobile-wallet-basics. • Don’t forget PayPal (paypal.com), the still-growing online payments system that now comprises 14 million merchants and 170 million users.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search iPad Pro 2017 release tipped with iPad mini Pro and new 12.9-inch model Eric Abent - Oct 3, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Those who follow Apple news will know that the rumor mill rarely stops churning, and today that mill is at it again, delivering new whispers of Apple’s incoming iPad Pro releases. A new report by Macotakara (as reported by 9to5Mac) details the three new iPad Pro models that are rumored to be arriving in spring of 2017, dishing some details screen sizes, speakers, and cameras. First and foremost, these reports claim that the iPad Mini will be reborn as a 7.9-inch iPad Pro. This new model will come equipped with a Smart Connector, a four speaker configuration, and a 12MP iSight Camera with True Tone flash. Further details are rather slim, though Macotakara’s sources do say that a True Tone display will also be present on the device. Most of those specifications carry over to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro model, while the standard Pro model will be getting a bit of bump up in terms of screen size, jumping from 9.7-inches to 10.1-inches. We’ve heard of similar specifications in the past, only those rumors pegged the standard model with a 10.5-inch screen. Each of these three new models seem to have been updated to use four microphones, dropping the dual microphone set up of models past. Finally, the report notes that all three of these models retain the headphone jack that has gone missing from the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which doesn’t make a whole lot of sense if Apple is trying to push Lightning as the new audio standard for its devices. It’ll be quite some time before we find out if any of these rumors are true, as the new iPad Pros aren’t said to launch until spring 2017. Until then, expect plenty of additional rumors to detail the new tablets.

Boucherie's Brandon Siemers (left) lines up Centennial running back Nic Greene in B.C. high school football action Friday at the Apple Bowl. — image credit: Douglas Farrow/Contributor     Kelowna posted Oct 3, 2016 at 9:00 AM— updated Oct 3, 2016 at 10:57 AM Turnovers were costly for the Mt. Boucherie Bears who came up a touchdown short against Centennial Secondary Friday night in BC high school football action at the Apple Bowl. The Bears tossed four interceptions and fumbled once in the red zone en route to a 28-21 loss to the Centaurs. Centennial also gained some big yards on kick and punt returns. "We didn't play very well on offence, turnovers really killed us," said Bears coach Mike Godwin. "Offense and special teams didn't help our cause. I'm not making excuses, they're a good football team, but we matched our weaknesses with their strengths and we really paid for it." A dangerous kick returner and wide receiver, Nic Greene also made two interceptions as a defender for Centennial, as did safety Keon Fuoco. Chris Smith led the Bears offence with a 52-yard TD pass from Taylor Knoll, while also throwing a 56-yard TD to Rodney Nucamendi-Snider. On defense, Smith intercepted two passes, while Jacob Mezei added one pick. The Bears will have their hands full this coming weekend when they take on the Terry Fox Ravens Friday night in Coquitlam. The perennially-strong Ravens are 2-0 after 57-0 drubbing of WJ Mouat. "Our guys tend to raise the level of their game against the better teams," Godwin said of the Bears. "We'll need to do that against Fox, they're very good again." Mission 29 KSS Owls 18 After being soundly shutout in their season opener a week earlier against Tweedsmuir, the visiting KSS Owls were considerably better on Saturday afternoon in a 29-18 loss to Mission Secondary. Kelowna's Blaise Beauchemin set the tone with a 75-yard kick off return for a touchdown, but penalties and mental mistakes prevented the Owls from getting much momentum. "It was a tough loss, especially with the great start we had on offense, but we as a coaching staff are leaving here very proud of the team," said Owls coach Chris Cartwright. "We had a great week of practice and we came to this game feeling really good. We are going to continue to learn from our experiences and work with it" This Friday night, the Owls will travel to Abbotsford to take in the WJ Mouat Hawks. Meanwhile, the Rutland Voodoos will kick off their 2016 regular season on Saturday at Earl Marriot.               We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

Could Have 3 New iPads Up Its Sleeve A handful of iPad Pros may be on the horizon -- including a new display size. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 3, 2016 at 2:05PM CEO Tim Cook unveils the 9.7-inch iPad Pro in March 2016. Image source: Apple. For the past couple of years, Apple, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad product cycles have been a bit unpredictable. The company shifted away from annual releases a couple years ago, presumably because Apple realized that tablet upgrade cycles are longer and frequent redesigns and refreshes weren't as necessary. For instance, Apple only launched the 12.9-inch iPad Pro at its September 2015 event, alongside a refreshed iPad Mini 4 with internal spec bumps. Well, we could be in store for as many as three new iPads launching within a matter of months. Three's company Japanese blog Mac Otakara is reporting that Apple is preparing to introduce a handful of iPad Pros next spring, including a 7.9-inch version, a 10.1-inch version, and a 12.9-inch version. The 12.9-inch model is said to get a beefier 12-megapixel primary camera, alongside a True Tone display and wider color gamut like the one found in the newer 9.7-inch iPad Pro that launched earlier this year. The same is expected for a 7.9-inch iPad Pro, which would bring the Mini up to Pro specs, as well as add the four-speaker stereo sound system. Perhaps more interesting is the news of a possible 10.1-inch iPad Pro, which would represent a modest increase from the 9.7-inch display that Apple has always offered for the iPad, starting with the original. If true, this device would see a small increase in size in order to accommodate a larger display. All three tablets are expected to keep the 3.5-mm headphone jack for now, unlike the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The news follows a similar report in August from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo that predicted the mid-sized model would increase to a 10.5-inch display. The big push into enterprise tablet sales by targeting professional users seems to be paying off, so it makes plenty of sense why Apple may be doubling down on its Pro efforts for the iPad. Investors have been watching the iPad business decline for several years, as the upgrade priority is lower, which is why the upgrade cycles are longer than Apple initially expected. The good news is that the year-over-year declines are slowly improving, and last quarter's negative 9% growth was the best performance in two years. Data source: SEC filings. Calendar quarters shown. Chart by author. It's harder to know where the saturation limit is for the tablet market, since many people will decide that they don't need or want one. Roughly half of U.S. adults own a tablet, according to the Pew Research Center. In contrast, smartphone penetration in the U.S. is now around 80%, according to comScore. But the enterprise market still has a long way to go, which is precisely why Apple just partnered up with Deloitte to help sell more iOS devices there. Who knows, maybe we'll even see iPad units grow again in the near future. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Hedonistica I Watch Stuff The Superficial Home Videos Video Games Archives Send a Tip! Facebook Twitter French Guy Smashes Everything He Can In Mall Apple Store With Steel Ball October 3, 2016 View This is a video of a disgruntled Apple customer smashing everything he possibly can in an Apple Store in Dijon (I love your mustard!), France with a 2.5-pound steel ball used for the French game of pétanque. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess he's angry at something. He is heard talking about 'his consumer's right' and citing that he's unhappy with how Apple handles his support case. Minutes later, security turns up and tries to escort him -- but not without him trying to escape. In the end, the team managed to stop him and have police take him into custody, said Le Journal. Does anybody want to translate exactly what he was saying? Because in my mind he's blaming Apple for making him sext the wrong lady and not being willing to call his girlfriend and explain that wiener was actually meant for her. Trust me, I've overheard plenty of Genius Bar conversations before. Keep going for the smash-filled video. Thanks to TheCureForHope, which is complete and utter disappointment and despair. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A 30-Foot Transparent Slide Made Entirely From Glass Previous Story 1980's Teddy Ruxpin Toy Is Coming Back To Terrify An All New Generation Next Story antalicus I really thought he was going to pull out an android phone at the end and hit it as well and show how he was just demonstrating how Apple products are built to break. Im not sure I have seen an Apple phone outside the store without a broken screen. Blackstar If you listen closely you can hear several Siri's asking, "Will I dream?" cardstock It's a bold strategy Cotton, let's see if it pays off for him. Jean Michel Hi i'm french i can translate what he his saying in the video (sorry for the mistake of course) [Start at 0.19s] "Shut Up ! You violate my right" " Stop !" "It's ok ? Ladies and Gentleman, Apple is a compagny that violate the consumer's right. Ok ? Thank's man. So, actually they are violating my right, they refuse to refund, as it's provided by the european law of the consumer, I told them, give me my money back, they said no, so what happen ? There is what happen" *Bim* "Shut Up !" etc etc etc and he says the same things ever and ever, a mix between "shut up" and "you violate my right". I think he did that because he bought an iPhone 7 (tss...) and, as he was not really happy of his purchase, 3 day after he choosed to return it. But they refused, and, i don't know the law, but this guys seems to say that they have to accept. But he his also a little crazy ... GeneralDisorder TIL France is run by lizard people too. Side note: I'd be angry too if everyone around me spoke French. But I'm a dumb hillbilly from Pennsylvania so my opinion is irrelevant. Gingerbread I'm a french speaker and I'd genuinely be annoyed to live in France. Jan Bergström He has some balls. TheQiwiMan LOL what an idiot. Munihausen There is an analogy to BLM in here somewhere.... A Rescue Toaster They do tend to use petty tactics to bully their way into people's lives... If only he claimed Apple / the store is racist against him! He's already asking for reparations! Bling Nye Really? Munihausen Bling, how do you use italics in all of your posts? Do you have a Pro account? How much per month is it? A Rescue Toaster Lol, you ARE a BLM supporter! Munihausen Bling LOVES his tags and is exasperated by most everything he encounters in life, including comments from anonymous internet people. DrZanz A man after my own heart. Granted, I'm not stupid enough to buy an Apple product in the first place but the sentiment is there now. I also wouldn't go about expressing my disdain in such a manner, but I admire the passion. elodie desachy He is saying "Ladies and gentlemen, this is a company who is not respecting the customer's rights and refused to refurbish me according to the European's laws for consumers. I informed them they still refused and what's happen?! looks what's happen!" then he answered to the sales guy "shut up I have laws with me" J HWOATAMAZU He's lucky to be in France. If it were here, security would probably pin him on the floor, making him eat his glasses. Bling Nye And if he were black, he'd be shot dead. Jenness Well we kind of don't know what he is - no one will report anything other than French Male. That's kind of racist or anti-theist to assume he's not black. Look at that crazy bitch Rachel Dolenz - she's a NAACP leader and she looks white and is white biologically but she identifies as Black and so according to SJW's we have to go with it. And identity fluid people will tell you that it's racist, bigoted and anti-gender to tell them they can't identify as black or white or male or female or neuter and change it from day to day as they see fit. You really shouldn't even assume he';s a male. That could be a native-american radicalized Islamic woman - how dare you assume that is a white Christian non-radicalized male doing what "they" do which is being privileged and entitled and ruining crappy expensive products that the masses crave to make them feel important and unique. The only thing we know about anyone supposedly now is by the way they act.

Stock Skyrocketed Today The patent litigation specialist is up big after a favorable verdict in one of its cases against Apple. Steve Symington (TMFSymington) Oct 3, 2016 at 1:17PM Image source: Getty Images What happened Shares of VirnetX Holding Corp. (NYSEMKT:VHC) were up 34.7% as of 12:30 p.m. EDT Monday after the patent litigation company announced a big legal win in its case against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). So what VirnetX confirmed that on Friday, Sept. 30, 2016, a jury in the U.S. Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, awarded the company $302.4 million in a verdict against Apple for infringing four VirnetX patents. More specifically, this verdict covers royalties for Apple's violation of VirnetX's '504 and '211 patents. Or, as VirnetX puts it, "unresolved issues in the Apple I case, remanded back from the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit," regarding damages owed to VirnetX for infringement by Apple's VPN-on-Demand and alleged infringement by Apple's original FaceTime application. "We are extremely pleased with the jury verdict announced today," added VirnetX CEO Kendall Larsen. "This is the third time a jury has confirmed that Apple has been using the technology developed by our inventors." For perspective, recall VirnetX shares plunged in early August after the same U.S. District Court vacated its previous order to consolidate VirnetX's two cases, ordering instead they be retried as separate cases, dubbed Apple I and Apple II. So we're still waiting on the outcome of the Apple II case, which covers alleged infringement, damages, and willfulness of Apple's redesigned versions of both its VPN-on-Demand and FaceTime products in iOS 7 and iOS 8, as well as FaceTime in OS X 10.9 and OS X 10.10 and iMessage. To that end, VirnetX anticipates a jury trial in the Apple II case to be scheduled shortly after the conclusion of the Apple I case. Now what We can also be sure, however, that Apple will promptly appeal this decision, drawing out an already lengthy and expensive legal battle that will make it as difficult as possible for a non-practicing entity like VirnetX to actually collect on the judgment. So while this is absolutely an enormous win for VirnetX, I won't be surprised if the company weathers more volatility -- both up and down -- in the days ahead. And I think investors would be wise to take at least some of Monday's quick profits off the table. Steve Symington owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

All people who stop by the store may not necessarily be there to purchase products but many are likely to visit just to see the store itself. Apple’s iconic Fifth Avenue store in New York City is one such location and its store on London’s Regent Street was another. Apple closed the store about a year ago for major renovations and has finally revealed that the flagship London store will be reopened on October 15th. Apple first opened this Regent Street location in 2004 and the store went on to bring in more than four million visitors per year. It was even Apple’s largest retail store at one point in time so it’s definitely an important retail location for the company. Award-winning architecture firm Foster and Partners was hired by Apple to redesign the store’s layout. While no official images have been shared as yet, reports suggest that the redesign has focused on prioritizing natural light and preserving the historic look of the building in which the store is housed. Apple has confirmed today that it’s going to reopen its flagship London location on Regent Street at 10:00 am local time on Saturday, October 15th. The store will be opened one year after it was closed for major renovations. Filed in Apple. Read more about apple store.

As long as Apple’s asking me to do what I’m doing, I’m gonna keep doing it.'” “The redesign answers criticism that the first iteration was overly complicated, introducing a cleaner interface with larger images and text care of Apple design guru Jonny Ive,” Ugwu reports. “‘We were too ambitious in the beginning — we probably put too much into it,’ said Iovine. ‘But we’re getting there now, one foot in front of the other, and the stuff we’re creating I don’t think anyone is gonna see coming.'” Read more in the full article here.

Apple Music seems to think I like things i say I dont I don’t see how to make my own radio station like on slacker either. All the playlists I see are pre made. Ilovemymac Tuesday, September 27, 2016 - 2:04 pm · Reply It amazes me that people talk about Pandora or Spotify a lot of people hardly mentioned slacker and yet slacker has a wider variety of stuff they actually have real DJs not all preprogrammed content and they have the download feature and to me it’s just a much better service all the way around. and with the variety of music that they have I looked on others and have found that they don’t have some of the songs that I want and slacker is the only one that has it Voice of reason Tuesday, September 27, 2016 - 2:45 pm · Reply Are you an ad? I have a feeling you’re one of those sentient ads from South Park, especially since you didn’t respond to the criticism above as started a new thread. 13 million songs is not the same as nearly 40 million… there are not exclusives to slacker that aren’t on Apple Music, there are, however, many in the opposite direction. MaxBay Tuesday, September 27, 2016 - 2:15 pm · Reply No interest in Apple Music. All of Apple’s promotion actually turns me away from it. The exclusive offerings and the extra publicity to certain performers…manufactured importance. That said, iTunes has been amazingly great over the years. All the music I want to buy – even obscure songs and albums from when I was a kid – is on iTunes. I’ll keep buying instead of renting. Predrag Tuesday, September 27, 2016 - 6:02 pm · Reply I’m sure you have your reasons for buying instead of renting. I thought exactly the same until about a year ago, when I decided to sign up for the Apple Music trial. I have done my math and concluded that for me, as well as for vast majority of people whose music collection is large, Apple Music is cheaper, better and more practical solution. I have a collection of 300 CDs. I used to buy 10 – 15 CDs per year, for decades. I had spent thousands of dollars over those years, and what I now have is around 300 CDs (plus around 100 vinyl LPs, which are in a garage in my old country). After discovering Apple Music, I realised I was overpaying for my music. By spending $10 per month (actually, $15 for my family), I have immediate access to some 4 million albums from around the world. Virtually all of my 300 CDs can be found on Apple Music and I can stream any one of them (plus millions of others) at any time, anywhere. I can always download anything I want, if I know I won’t have internet. For a jazz or classical fan, Apple Music is a priceless treasure trove. I can check out 50 different performances of Beethoven’s 7th symphony, or 20 different versions of Duke Ellington’s “Don’t get around much anymore”. Nobody in their sane mind would ever buy 10 different recordings of a symphony by Beethoven (never mind 50). And for teenagers, subscription model makes perfect sense. Teen tastes have a rather limited shelf life, and many people remember their early adulthood by the embarrassing music choices of their teen years they had to hide and eventually get rid of. Rental allows them to listen to whatever they like while they like it, and simply move on to something else when they grow out of it, without feeling foolish for throwing it away (or hiding it in the attic). MaxBay Tuesday, September 27, 2016 - 6:21 pm · Reply Good points. Young people growing up today will have two things in common when they look back decades from now: 1) They have never known peace. They have never known a time we were NOT at war with this place or that place. Comes with having a permanent wartime economy. 2) They don’t know what it’s like to buy music. Why bother? A subscription for a vast library of music is irresistible. But when I add Amazon Prime to Netflix to monthly Internet to cell phone payments…Apple Music seems more expensive than it really is. Tired of subscriptions. Birdseed Tuesday, September 27, 2016 - 2:17 pm · Reply ““The redesign answers criticism…” Nonsense. The redesign is GOD AWFUL.

I dont care about them. I am a subscriber since day 1 to Apple Music and it is by far THE most miserable Apple experience I have had since I joined this cult back in 1986.

No reason at all. whatever Tuesday, September 27, 2016 - 4:26 pm · Reply What exactly would you change to make it better I assume you are talking about the interface…-If you don’t like Just search and find – no different than any other service.

Sparkles Tuesday, September 27, 2016 - 3:00 pm · Reply Remember when iTunes dropped the CD from it’s logo? Lots of complaints about how ugly the replacement logo was, but Steve didn’t agree.

DavGreg Tuesday, September 27, 2016 - 4:42 pm · Reply I would prefer Apple rental music to be consigned to an app seperate from iTunes so that those who choose to rent their Hip-Hop (aka the Samsung crowd) have their own little corner of the universe and those of us who wish to buy our music never have to see it. Predrag Tuesday, September 27, 2016 - 6:13 pm · Reply That’s condescending and presumptuous, as well as largely wrong. Practically everyone I know who uses and loves Apple Music is a classical music fan. For us, this is a godsend. As I wrote above, we can now compare different performances of same works, explore less popular works and we don’t have to spend a fortune in order to accumulate this large library. Not to mention wait 20 years, buying CDs (or downloads) one by one, until the library grows that large. I’m sure there will always be older people for whom subscribing to Apple Music, after completing their music collection of 500 CDs (and/or downloads) doesn’t seem to make financial sense, but if you fall into the category of people who spend regularly on music, then Apple Music gives you access to all of it right now, rather than over the long period of time. It is like buying a house right away, with a mortgage loan, or buying it brick by brick and slowly building it over the next 30 years. Herself Tuesday, September 27, 2016 - 9:27 pm · Reply You should have been an economist, Predrag. Your rational arguments for utility maximisation are straight out of Sowell. I would also conjecture that you lectured your children on budgeting, and always have a mild rejoinder at the ready when a dinner guest ignorant of TCO boasts of saving money with his technology choices. Such a high viewpoint is hard-won, I know, as you have already admitted. All of us start out as victims of our own concealed biases. Unfortunately, most of us end the same way. Predrag Wednesday, September 28, 2016 - 9:57 am · Reply Not really; it is just a fairly simple and straightforward argument for the concept of Apple Music. Most of those (and I was in that group until recently) against renting (vs. buying) their music use the financial argument (you pay and pay and pay, instead of paying once and then you have it forever). There are many scenarios in which that argument is flawed. On the other part of your message (arguing TCO), I will admit that there were occasions when I deployed that argument in support of my platform choice(s) over “the other one”, but I only did that when the other side exhibited similar condescending arrogance as we saw above. Herself Wednesday, September 28, 2016 - 10:28 pm · Reply Arguments, plural. I was thinking of your collective reviews and commentaries, not just this one. More than once you recorded your change of mind and detailed why. That’s far more persuasive than a one-off product review. Predrag Thursday, September 29, 2016 - 9:55 am · Reply It has been at least ten years since I had discovered MDN and probably as long since I started commenting on articles. Among those who comment, there were always quite a few fairly regular contributors, and it can often become difficult to keep track of who is who, in order to create a picture behind sometimes abstract user names. Yours (under current, as well as previous name(s)) had easily stood out. I must say I’m flattered that anyone would find my contributions meaningful enough to remember. When the average quality of discussion stays rather low, one often feels little need to put effort into carefully wording arguments… Herself Thursday, September 29, 2016 - 10:18 pm · Reply You’ve raised a smile from an admirer. By the way, what do you think of Mahler’s “tenth?” I never got an answer to my original query, but maybe it all got lost in the ether… Predrag Friday, September 30, 2016 - 10:24 am · Reply It clearly got lost somehow, I’m sorry about that. Mahler’s tenth… In a way, like Mozart’s Requiem, what we today take as Mahler’s tenth is of slightly less than authentic provenance. Unlike Mozart, where we have the one definitive Süssmeyr version that is generally accepted as the reasonable realisation of Mozart’s sketches and drafts, with Mahler, we have a work for which provenance isn’t always as clear. Several various realisations exist, and while one is more popular than others, there isn’t nearly as much of a consensus as there is with Süssmayr/Mozart. Having said that, the work is powerful and profound. You can hear the imminence of his demise, the anguish over his wife’s transgression. I don’t really know this work as well as his earlier, sunnier symphonies. I really should get to know it a bit better (after all, I have no excuse now, having Apple Music afford me access to at least a dozen various recordings of several different versions of the work). At the moment, I’m listening to Sir Simon Rattle with the Berliner (from 2000). A very authentic and grand rendition. One thing is clear to me: this work would have influenced some amazing things that came right after (Schönberg, Berg, Stravinsky), likely more so than Strauss at the time, had it been properly available for public performances. It wasn’t until the 60s that audiences got to hear it with some regularity. Herself Friday, September 30, 2016 - 10:09 pm · Reply “The Unfinished…” — that’s the sorry lot of composers, no less than oil painters or cabinet makers. Divine inspiration is cruelly cancelled only by death. There will forever be partial manuscripts, sketches, and proofs which margins cannot contain. Survivors simply cannot resist completing these fragments, for better or worse. It’s the signal fact of mortality that drives all of it — art, science, architecture, literature. “This work would have influenced some amazing things” had even the unfinished part been timely communicated — something much more likely in today’s diverse media, but still a big, floating question mark. The question before the house is whether Steve Jobs’s unfinished symphony is being properly completed. Judging from the commentariat, I’m afraid that the jury will be out for a good while. Predrag Monday, October 3, 2016 - 1:33 pm · The concept of retirement, wherein one reaches certain age and then leaves long years of service to a company, taking up fishing, or golf, simply does not apply to creative artists. While I have met a more than fair share of artists who did exactly that (after working as a 2nd oboe in the National Opera orchestra for 35 years, simply retiring, drawing government’s pension and never picking up that oboe again), not a single creative one has been able to swap creating music (whether by writing it or playing it) for fishing, golfing, dominoes or chess. And for the composers, this is even more true. A wonderful example would be the late Eliott Carter, who celebrated his 100th birthday at Carnegie Hall some 8 years by writing a Clarinet concerto.

They should call it something like Pong. Apple Pong. The Spaceship Mix Tuesday, September 27, 2016 - 6:42 pm · Reply I’ve been using Apple Music since it went live and really enjoy making playlists on it because it’s so much easier than trying to pick tracks off of iTunes. Even though it’s great, there is still room for improvement: 1. Users should have the option to create public pages. I would like to discover some talented playlist creators by genre and would like to be notified whenever they post. 2. Even though there are millions of songs on the service there are still some key albums missing: A. The Feelies – “It’s Only Life” – This is one of my top ten albums of all time. BTW – just saw Brian Wilson perform the number two album of all time, Pet Sounds. They sounded amazing. B. The Farmers (not the hard rock farmers) – “Rock Angel” – great tippidity tappidity alt rock songs from the early 1990’s C. A House – “On Our Big Fat Merry-Go-Round” – classic 1980’s “underground” party music There are probably more, but these are just off the top-of-my-head. And finally, in appreciation of Elon’s dream, here is a song called “Mars” by The Farmers.

(Reuters/Adrees Latif) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Messaging October 03, 2016 Across North America, iPhone owners have become increasingly disgruntled by the device’s spotty touchscreen functionality. The first sign of “touch disease” is a flickering gray bar that appears across the top of the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus screen. Over time, the touchscreen loses functionality. Some reports suggest that the issue is caused by dropping the phone on the ground or “bendgate”— the 6 Plus tends to bend if a user sits down with it in their pocket—but there are also many reported cases where there are no signs of physical damage. A nationwide class action lawsuit in the US filed in late August alleges that Apple concealed “a material design defect that causes the touchscreens on the iPhones to become unresponsive.” In a bid to make the 6 and 6 Plus models sleeker, the Cupertino giant failed to “properly [secure the touch IC chips] to the logic board and, as a result of foreseeable and reasonable use by consumers, fail from normal wear and tear,” the lawsuit states. The plaintiffs claim that the touch IC chips, which communicate with the motherboard, are unable to convert touch commands into language the machine understands due to an engineering flaw: loose or broken connections. Unlike earlier models where there was underfill that acted like strong glue, or a shield covering the logic board, the 6 and 6 Plus leave these units exposed and vulnerable to dysfunction. “Touch disease” is currently the single biggest daily iPhone service issue, accounting for almost 11% of Apple Store repairs, according to Apple Insider. Apple has been accused of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of implied warranty by three plaintiffs who are not only irked by failing screens, but also by the manufacturer’s pricey remedy. Each user was quoted a repair cost upwards of $300. Their options were to either incur the charges or change their handsets. Reinstalling software did nothing to alleviate the problem for one of the plaintiffs, whose screen continued to freeze up 50 to 60% of the time. Genius bar employees have admitted to being aware of the problem but are unable to fix it. Since Apple doesn’t take liability for devices after they have been fixed by a third-party, Apple Store employees cannot refer outside help either. Independent technicians who tried explaining the cause behind the defect in a forum were censored and banned from the company’s online support communities. Across the border, Canada and Quebec-based iPhone 6 and 6 Plus users also filed class action lawsuits for Apple’s poor handling of the “touch disease” in September. And if that wasn’t enough bad news, an iPhone 6 Plus recently exploded in a high school student’s back pocket. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

The huge crowds of people swarmed the streets around the museum with the expanded Farmers Market, along with the hundreds of homemade apple pies, pie by the slice and caramel apple dishes served up, along with apple butter, apple cider, apple chutney and more. The event is a fundraiser for the local museum. In the evening, another crowd gathered at American Legion Park for the equally successful Liquid Apple Night, celebrating the many varieties of hard apple cider.

This begs the question: Is Apple a HIPAA covered entity? Why or why not? When Apple advertised for a top-flight lawyer specializing in health privacy regulations, it seemed that the technology leader might have plans to develop into the healthcare market. However, in the world of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Apple is not currently a covered entity because they do not directly engage in the provision of health care or health insurance. There are several possible explanations for Apple's hiring of a health lawyer. First, Apple may plan to become a HIPAA covered entity. This seems unlikely, as HIPAA covered entities fall into one of three categories: healthcare providers who engage in electronic transactions, health insurers and health information clearinghouses that collect and share information from healthcare organizations. None of these seem to fit Apple's current business model. It's more likely that Apple has plans to become a business associate of a HIPAA covered entity, expanding into healthcare by exchanging information with or facilitating information transfers between covered entities. Any HIPAA covered entity seeking to use Apple services for handling protected health information would require that Apple sign a business associate agreement that requires Apple to comply with HIPAA as well. Apple's focus on the CareKit development environment for health-focused software lends credence to this theory. As Apple responds to demands from third-party app developers, it may build HIPAA compliance directly into its products. In particular, the company may have plans to provide a HIPAA-compliant, back-end database for its CareKit development community.

Stock Skyrocketed Today The patent litigation specialist is up big after a favorable verdict in one of its cases against Apple. Steve Symington (TMFSymington) Oct 3, 2016 at 1:17PM Image source: Getty Images What happened Shares of VirnetX Holding Corp. (NYSEMKT:VHC) were up 34.7% as of 12:30 p.m. EDT Monday after the patent litigation company announced a big legal win in its case against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). So what VirnetX confirmed that on Friday, Sept. 30, 2016, a jury in the U.S. Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, awarded the company $302.4 million in a verdict against Apple for infringing four VirnetX patents. More specifically, this verdict covers royalties for Apple's violation of VirnetX's '504 and '211 patents. Or, as VirnetX puts it, "unresolved issues in the Apple I case, remanded back from the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit," regarding damages owed to VirnetX for infringement by Apple's VPN-on-Demand and alleged infringement by Apple's original FaceTime application. "We are extremely pleased with the jury verdict announced today," added VirnetX CEO Kendall Larsen. "This is the third time a jury has confirmed that Apple has been using the technology developed by our inventors." For perspective, recall VirnetX shares plunged in early August after the same U.S. District Court vacated its previous order to consolidate VirnetX's two cases, ordering instead they be retried as separate cases, dubbed Apple I and Apple II. So we're still waiting on the outcome of the Apple II case, which covers alleged infringement, damages, and willfulness of Apple's redesigned versions of both its VPN-on-Demand and FaceTime products in iOS 7 and iOS 8, as well as FaceTime in OS X 10.9 and OS X 10.10 and iMessage. To that end, VirnetX anticipates a jury trial in the Apple II case to be scheduled shortly after the conclusion of the Apple I case. Now what We can also be sure, however, that Apple will promptly appeal this decision, drawing out an already lengthy and expensive legal battle that will make it as difficult as possible for a non-practicing entity like VirnetX to actually collect on the judgment. So while this is absolutely an enormous win for VirnetX, I won't be surprised if the company weathers more volatility -- both up and down -- in the days ahead. And I think investors would be wise to take at least some of Monday's quick profits off the table. Steve Symington owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

By Jake Smith for iGeneration | October 3, 2016 -- 17:10 GMT (10:10 PDT) | Topic: Tablets Sarah Tew/CNET Apple plans to launch three iPad Pro models in spring 2017, including a new 7.9-inch model, and updates to the 9.7-inch and 10.1-inch models, according to Mac Otakara. What's Hot on ZDNet When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office? GE Digital builds up its global presence with acquisitions, partnerships ​Domino's claims world-first pizza drone delivery Microsoft delivers test builds of Visual Studio for Mac, Visual Studio 2017 for Windows The Japan-based blog, citing "reliable sources," says the new 7.9-inch Pro model will feature four speakers and a Smart Connector, similar to the current line of iPad Pros previously updated in March of this year. Presumably, the small iPad Pro will carry Apple Pencil support like the rest of the lineup. It's expected to replace the iPad Mini 4 currently offered. All three models are said to retain the headphone jack, recently removed from the iPhone lineup in favor of wireless Apple EarPods when the iPhone 7 was released in September. The report did not provide a specific launch timeline and pricing for the new Apple tablets. Mac Otakara also reports the 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2 will receive a 12-megapixel camera with True Tone flash. No other specifications were shared. See also: Apple 9.7-inch iPad Pro review In August, often-reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities said to expect three new iPads to be launched in 2017: a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, a new size 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and a low-cost 9.7-inch iPad. Kuo didn't mention a 7.9-inch Pro model. The new 10.5-inch model, according to Kuo, will be for "commercial and education markets." No pricing was mentioned. Kuo expects iPad sales to continue to fall 10 to 20 percent year-over-year, as Apple has seen sales declines across its iPad lineup. Kuo said Apple could bring big changes to the iPad lineup in 2018, with the adoption of a flexible AMOLED panel for increased screen resolution and radical changes to form-factor.

The report claims Apple’s iPad Pro lineup will include a 7.9-inch, 9.7-inch and 10.1-inch models. The 7.9-inch model will include a Smart Connector, True Tone display, four speakers, and a 12-megapizel rear-facing iSight camera with True Tone flash, according to the report. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is said to have a 12-megapixel rear facing iSight camera and True Tone flash. MacRumors claims that all three new iPad Pro models will have quad microphones, and retain 3.5mm headphone jacks. The 12.9-inch model will also use “ambient light sensors to automatically asap the color and intensity of the display to match the light in the surrounding environment,” according to MacRumors.

Apple is also building a 10.1-ich iPad Pro, which will feature a 12MP camera and have improved True Tone flash. While Mac Otakara doesn’t have a great track record with Apple rumors, it has been accurate on Apple’s plans to remove its headphone jack and its new Jet Black colors on its recent iPhone 7 models.

Even before the test video was published, Apple’s marketing head Phil Schiller responded to a question on Twitter about the claims that the new iPhones dropped sapphire with a ‘Not true’ reply. Apple’s tech specs page for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus also mentions the ‘Sapphire crystal lens cover’ that was first introduced with the iPhone 5. While the new video test separately confirms the use of sapphire on the new iPhones, it also suggests that Apple is using a sapphire laminate over glass which explains its weaker durability rating compared to a traditional watch for reference. The video shows Apple’s sapphire lens cover scratching from a #6 pick, which shows it is softer than the Tissot watch face’s sapphire that scratched with a #8 pick. @Lunnzies Not true. Camera lens cover and top of Home Button both Sapphire. #iPhone7 — Philip Schiller (@pschiller) September 17, 2016 To be clear, there’s no news here about durability as the iPhone 7 sapphire lens cover showed the same hardness levels as the iPhone SE, iPhone 5s, and iPhone 6. Apple hasn’t dropped the durability between models as some reports may have suggested. The video does suggest Apple is using the sapphire laminate over the outside facing glass as a cost-effective measure, however, and questions how much sapphire is needed in the composition to even qualify as a sapphire cover. It includes a lot of sophisticated equipment to test the hardness claims, but unfortunately doesn’t include the Apple Watch display for comparison although it raises the same question at the end. Stainless steel Apple Watches feature a sapphire glass cover that boasts scratch resistance (but not shatterproof) compared to the glass used on aluminum models. At any rate, the iPhone 7 sapphire lens cover is just as strong or weak as the cover used since the iPhone 5 so don’t expect it to withstand any more damage than before or scratch under less force.

Adam Levy (adamlevy) Oct 3, 2016 at 12:01PM Image source: Apple. Wireless carriers had a big opportunity to attract new customers with the release of Apple's iPhone 7, and they were very aggressive in courting them. T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) was the first to offer a free iPhone 7 to customers turning in a recent model iPhone. Sprint (NYSE:S), AT&T (NYSE:T), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) soon followed. But T-Mobile and AT&T ended their promotions over the weekend. Verizon's might not last much longer, but Sprint could potentially continue to run the promotion well into the fourth quarter. That's because Sprint's offer is structured just a bit differently from its competitors. How Sprint will make money at the end of the iPhone 7's lifespan Unlike its competitors, Sprint isn't selling iPhone 7s to its customers; it's leasing them. The terms of the lease mean that Sprint gets the iPhone back at the end of 18 months unless the customer opts to exercise their purchase option or simply continue leasing on a month to month basis. Any way you slice it, Sprint stands to make some extra money on the backend. That gives Sprint an advantage over the competition, which doesn't offer leases. T-Mobile offers a leasing option called "JUMP! On Demand," but it's moving away from it in favor of standard financing. AT&T and Verizon don't lease phones at all. Sprint is also able to squeeze some extra value from leasing devices by moving its leased device financing off its balance sheet. Sprint's majority investor Softbank (NASDAQOTH:SFTBY) set up a leasing company to buy Sprint leases. In November, Sprint received $1.1 billion from the company in exchange for approximately $1.3 billion in leased devices. That provides Sprint with a bit more liquidity to invest in various aspects of its business like building out its network or marketing. Competing carriers typically package up their equipment installment receivables into securities and sell them to investors in order to liquidate the assets. Another benefit of Softbank's ownership Not only does Softbank conveniently own a phone leasing company, it also owns Brightstar -- the largest distributor of used handsets. In fact, Sprint's current CEO, Marcelo Claure, founded Brightstar. As such, Sprint is able to maximize the value it receives for those used iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s devices its new customers turn in to receive the new iPhone 7. It will also allow it to maximize the value it receives from the iPhone 7 at the end of the lease. Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche estimates Sprint is able to recover $200 per iPhone 6 device and $400 for an iPhone 6s. She notes that's more than other carriers due to the relationship with Brightstar. Is it the advantage Sprint needs? Sprint is finally starting to turn around its subscriber growth with four consecutive quarters of positive postpaid phone net adds. Postpaid subscribers are generally considered more valuable as they're generally more creditworthy and spend more for service. After the first weekend of iPhone sales, Sprint issued a press release noting iPhone 7 sales were up 375% over last year. T-Mobile, by comparison, said that its sales were up nearly four-times "compared to the next most popular iPhone," which may not have been last year's model, but the iPhone 6. But if Sprint is able to afford extending this iPhone 7 promotion for several more weeks or even into the holiday shopping season, it could see a great deal more sales. While T-Mobile boasts its positive switching ratios with Sprint and the other two major competitors in the wireless industry, Sprint has an opportunity to grab share from the larger competitors. It's aggressively marketing against Verizon, and AT&T continues to bleed postpaid subscribers. If the promotion is extended, Sprint investors could see an improvement over the 366,000 postpaid phone net additions it saw in the December quarter last year.

Ahrendts’ new title simply reads Senior Vice President Retail. While there’s no real change in Ahrendts’ role it does reflect Apple’s recent changes to its retail and online experiences. From what I can gather, the role merges both retail and online retail operations into one, with no changes in her responsibilities. More likely, the role name change could be a part of a larger revamping of Apple’s retail store branding. In August, the company dropped the word “store” from its “Apple Store” retail listings. In certain scenarios Apple still uses the “Apple Store” branding, but overall all retail locations have completely dropped the “store” branding.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Rumors hint Nvidia, Apple may get back together Rumors hint Nvidia, Apple may get back together By Joel Hruska on September 27, 2016 at 4:32 pm Comment For the last few years, Apple has been an AMD-only shop. Graphics may not be a core area that Apple focuses on — OpenGL support in the latest version of macOS remains stuck in 4.1 territory). But it does include discrete graphics cards in several of its MacBook Pro and iMac products, as well as in all of the Mac Pro SKUs. Now, there’s talk that Apple might switch back to Nvidia. Bloomberg first noticed multiple job listings at Nvidia (some of which have since been edited) that talk about “help[ing] produce the next revolutionary Apple products” and claimed the role would require “working in partnership with Apple” and writing code that will “define and shape the future” of the Mac’s graphics software. There are also openings on the Mac driver team, and Nvidia doesn’t bother writing drivers and software for a platform it doesn’t intend to sell. The report also notes that winning Apple’s business back would be a coup for Nvidia, which has lost some small amount of market share to AMD in recent quarters. Overall, Nvidia remains in control of the desktop add-in market, with roughly 75% market share. AMD’s own Polaris launch earlier this year was meant to reverse this trend, but Polaris is still priced well above its initial MSRP. GTX 1060 stock, in contrast, is both more widely available and more likely to be found at its target $200 to $250 price point. Both companies are still running hot, but Nvidia is doing a better job of managing the temperature. Nvidia’s GP100 Pascal GPU. As for the proverbial feather in Nvidia’s cap, Apple occupies a weird spot in the overall PC market. Its shipments are significant (Apple typically claims the fourth or fifth spot in total PC market share), but it’s dwarfed by its competitors. At the same time, however, people talk about the decisions Apple makes, whether that means building an extremely powerful system in a small wastepaper basket or removing useful ports from smartphones. When Apple shipped twin GPUs with the Mac Pro, it was seen as a sign the company would move towards improving its own graphics implementations and support emerging standards more aggressively. This hasn’t really happened; Apple has Metal, but it doesn’t support OpenCL 2.0 or any version of OpenGL past 4.1. In the past, Nvidia’s CUDA has generally been the preferred choice for workstation applications compared with OpenCL. It’s not clear if this is still the case, but Nvidia would undoubtedly love to button up the Mac line. It may not bring in huge amounts of revenue, but Apple products still drive industry discussions, and by extension, offer a halo effect to the company’s suppliers. We’ve focused mostly on the workstation side of the equation, since Macs aren’t typically thought of as gaming machines. But there are undoubtedly Mac owners who would like to see more powerful GPUs in their various systems. Intel’s HD Graphics chips have been improving steadily every year, but they still lag behind what AMD or Nvidia can offer. Valve has stepped up to promote Steam and Apple gaming, where Apple generally offers benign neglect, but more powerful GPUs based on Pascal would still improve the situation.

StubHub for the fourth-gen Apple TV offers a visually rich experience with both categories and show times. Their goal is to help people go from browsing for entertainment in the living room to finding something to experience out in the world. There’s even a handy feature that shows you seat perspectives for available tickets on the big screen. “We know that most people will be interacting with our app from their couch, as they’re looking for something to do, so we kept the StubHub app for Apple TV focused on browsability and discovery, to better motivate people to get up and get out,” said Marcus Shelksohn, director of mobile product. “The StubHub design team wanted to create a more custom interface to reflect the emotional nature of event discovery – and the result is an engaging look and feel that maximizes event imagery and seat maps, and is highly intuitive to navigate.” While StubHub can help you find tickets for the big show using Apple TV, you’ll still need another device handy to complete your purchase. The process looks to be fairly smooth, however, using SMS to send your phone a checkout link that installs or opens the StubHub mobile app with the exact tickets you picked on Apple TV. StubHub for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and now Apple TV is available for free on the App Store. The easiest way to find an Apple TV app is asking Siri with the Siri Remote.

Blog Liar, Liar, Phones on Fire! Dr. Lorenzo Grande, Technology Analyst 10/3/2016 11:30 AM EDT  2 comments   post a comment Login to Rate Tweet The story behind the Galaxy Note 7. The South Korean giant Samsung finds itself on the hot seat as the story behind the reported battery fires related to the Galaxy Note 7 unfolds even further. As of September, 92 incidents have been reported in the US alone. As a recent article on Bloomberg reported, Samsung wanted to beat Apple at the game of innovation by releasing a better, more powerful smartphone before the iPhone 7 reached the shelves. By leveraging the lack of new features in Apple's latest device, executives at Samsung hoped that they could steal Cupertino's podium and finally assert their company as the leader in smartphone innovation. In order to achieve this, they decided to pack a 3500 mAh Li-ion battery into their Galaxy Note 7 (as compared to the 2900 mAh of the iPhone 7 plus) so as to deliver better performance and longer duration. However, this addition came at the cost of quality, since -- in order to speed up the phone's commercialisation -- all of the testing and optimization were performed in a fraction of the time normally required. Samsung engineers were encouraged to sleep overnight in the office in order to save time from their daily commute, and suppliers were pushed to give Samsung priority with respect to other customers. By August 2016, the required technical deadlines had been met and shipping of the new Korean device began. It did not take long before some customers started reporting spectacular failures of their new purchase with flames and smoke coming out of the battery compartment, but perhaps the biggest fiasco came from how the company managed the whole situation. At first, Samsung advised its customers to switch off their Note 7, but shortly thereafter, also announced the release of a software patch that would prevent said fires from happening, thus generating a good deal of confusion among the now-not-so-proud owners of Samsung's newest smartphone. By September, the issue had grown to such an extent that the company authorized a complete recall of all 2.5 million phones shipped thus far. The estimated cost for the firm runs into the billions of dollars, not to mention the loss of consumer confidence. As a result, Samsung is now receiving major negative publicity on many international flights, where cabin crews invite all passengers to switch off their Galaxy Note 7 phones and prohibits them from charging these devuces while on the plane. Samsung SDI, the battery maker behind the incident, recently shrank its total staff from 7,408 in late 2015 to 6,937 as of June as a cost-saving measure. Samsung SDI is largely responsible for the battery fires, which seem to have been caused by the use of a thinner separator that could not cope well with the dense packing and caused short circuits within the device. The company no longer supplies batteries for the Note 7, and its role in future products might also be reduced. ATL China has now taken Samsung SDI's place in the supply chain. Executives at KBIA, the Korean Battery Industry Association, fear that this accident might trigger a similar crisis to the one Sony experienced a few decades back, when Li-ion batteries were first introduced to the market. However, while at that time Li-ion was a relatively new technology and the numbers involved were relatively small, the current situation is very different, since the market has grown exponentially and Samsung is poised to remain one of the biggest players for the years to come. While some competitors like LGChem might benefit from Samsung's mistakes in the short term, the incident can well slow down the decrease in battery prices that has been witnessed in recent years, with negative repercussions for the whole budding industry behind the energy storage miracle. As consumers demand safer devices (would you leave your Samsung charging anywhere in your absence?), stricter regulations might also ensue, stifling what has otherwise been a technological success story second only to that of PV panels in recent years. As the Note 7 incidents illustrate, Li-ion batteries are still prone to catching fire and endangering their owners. The reason behind this is the fact that flammable liquids are used as electrolytes. A number of additives are mixed with these electrolytes to act as flame retardants, but the truth remains that -- under the right conditions -- thermal runaway is still an issue, and even the best BMS (battery management systems) cannot fully prevent accidental fires from happening. As a matter of fact, combustion in Li-ion batteries can be triggered hours, if not weeks, after a battery pack has been irreversibly damaged, but the reaction time of the BMS might be too slow to block thermal runaway once it is detected, since heat propagates at an exponential rate in these cases. The consumers' hunger for fast-charging smartphones also does not help, since in order to achieve this, batteries have to be charged at constant voltage. This might trigger the lithium plating phenomenon on graphite anodes, a preamble to the growth of so-called dendrites, which are lithium metal whiskers that can puncture the separator, create a short circuit, and offer a local source of overheating that is sufficiently strong to set the whole device on fire. The solution lies in the quest for inherently safe batteries that do not contain flammable electrolytes. E-bus company Microvas showcased a non-flammable liquid electrolyte for their Li-ion batteries that can potentially revolutionize the sector, although it is yet to be seen if it can deliver the power capabilities needed by products other than buses (e.g., smartphones, laptops, and electric cars). Ionic liquids have long been heralded as a viable solution due to their extremely high flashpoint; however, an industrial production that can bring their cost down has not yet been put into place. A more detailed analysis of their potential is available in our flagship report on Li-ion batteries. Inorganic and polymer electrolytes also have the potential to make batteries safer. This year, an article on the peer-reviewed journal Nature Energy reported a sulphur-chlorine-based solid conductor that conducts lithium ions faster than state-of-the-art liquid electrolytes; companies like Toyota, Samsung SDI, and LGChem are already looking into its potential. Using non-flammable electrolytes also has the added benefit of increasing a battery's energy density at pack level, because they can make thermal management systems redundant and reduce the amount and weight of ancillary components. Solid Power, a Colorado-based start-up, will be presenting its take on safe, solid-state, sulphur-based batteries for electric vehicles by showcasing its 350 Wh/kg (750 Wh/L) energy storage technology for mobility applications at the IDTechEx Santa Clara conference. More information on related topics will be covered at the forthcoming IDTechEx Show!, which will take place November 16-17, 2016, in Santa Clara, California. At IDTechEx, Dr. Lorenzo Grande's activities revolve around energy storage for electric vehicles and consumer electronics.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Pixel details : release all about perception (and HTC) Chris Burns - Oct 3, 2016 5 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit The Google Pixel phone has arrived, in two sizes, complete with the company’s new public image for their brand. The letter G, simplicity in all things, the absence of over-thinking names for apps and connecting devices to other smart devices and those devices to the web. If we’re to believe Google will do what we’re fairly sure they will do, this isn’t going to be about a spec war. Google has long since discovered that their biggest competitor(s) don’t play on that basketball court, anyway. The game Apple plays is in design and advertising. Apple has created in the public the perception that their smartphone is the most desirable. They might suggest that the iPhone is the best, and that the iPad is the best – and that’s arguable. But what they’re doing is harnessing the power of perception to such a degree that iOS device users don’t feel the need to switch to a different brand, just so long as Apple still exists and still continues to make new devices. Google, on the other hand, has been cultivating an ecosystem of software that works on all manner of devices. They’ve been creating an operating system that supports many different brands, each making their own iteration of what Google’s baseline Nexus smartphone line presents. They’ve been doing everything right for people that love an open environment with freedom of implementation on a wide variety of different sorts of hardware. If Android is a public drinking fountain Google’s been running for the past 8 years, Pixel is Google’s first set of self-branded bottled water. Those looking for a whole new era of devices with specifications that put past generations to shame will be disappointed, at least mildly. Google’s next wave, with Pixel, is not about competing on benchmarks, or taking the best photos, or having the longest battery life (though they’ll probably speak about these things here and there). Google’s next wave is about perception. Google will aim to make the world perceive that they’re ready to usher in a new age of quality control over their devices. They’ll be responsible for how each device looks, feels, and functions. Updates won’t just be made to make Android look good. Updates will be made to make Pixel devices function better. Updates will be made to make Pixel gain new features. The first couple of Pixel phones will be manufactured by HTC. Not entirely unlike how HTC makes the Vive VR headset and Valve sells it – and HTC sells it too – HTC will make the first couple of Pixel phones. Google wont likely be as up front about who’s behind the wheel with Pixel’s hardware bits as Valve is with the Vive, but it won’t be that different a story. The most important part of this Pixel brand, for Google, is that the public perceives that they’re finally selling the Google Phone, with a big fat “G” on the back so we know who guarantees it.

The patents in question cover secure communication and FaceTime, and now the case will head to the Appeals Court where VirnetX may have a harder time convincing a judge to let it keep the money. VirnetX wins $302.4 million in ongoing patent infringement fight with Apple VirnetX launched its patent infringement fight against Apple in 2010 in the patent troll-friendly Easter Texas Federal Court. The company won $368.2 million in that case, then almost immediately filed a similar lawsuit covering newer Apple products. The court ordered a retrial in the first case, so the jury for the second also handled the retrial. That jury ruled Apple owed $334.9 million for the first case, and $290.7 million for the second. VirnetX didn’t get to celebrate for long because the ruling was tossed out when the Appeals Court said combining the two trials was inappropriate and confusing, and then ordered a new trial. The latest trial in the ongoing VirnetX patent infringement soap opera wrapped up on September 30th with the company landing a $302.4 million win. The case that just won’t end That doesn’t, however, mean it’s time for Apple to write VirnetX a check. Apple’s next step is to appeal the ruling which will take the case out of the Eastern Texas Court in Tyler that’s been so friendly to VirnetX, and that’s where keeping its win gets tricky. The VirnetX case involves four patents which the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office now says don’t cover new inventions, according to Bloomberg. That means they’re considered invalid by the Patent Office even though the Texas Federal Court treats them as valid. The appeal will be heard by the Federal Circuit Court in Washington and its legal experts on patents, and that means VirnetX needs to win on two fronts to collect any money from Apple. First, VirnetX needs to convince the Appeals Court that the USPTO is wrong and its patents describe new inventions. Second, it needs to show the lower court’s ruling on patent validity is correct. Failing to prove either of those will spell doom for VirnetX’s case. Assuming VirnetX loses, it can try to take its case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Considering the track record so far where VirnetX wins in Tyler, then the Appeals Court shoots down the ruling, that’s something the company is probably already planning for. Like so many other patent infringement cases, a win isn’t ever the final word. The Federal Court system moves slowly, so it’s a safe bet the VirnetX and Apple patent fight is still at least months away from wrapping up.

There’s no obvious ‘download all’ button and iCloud Music Library moves all syncing to iCloud, not iTunes, so you can’t just shuttle your library from your Mac to your iPhone or iPad. If you like to keep a local music library, this is a problem you will likely face when you upgrade to a new iPhone even if you restore from an encrypted backup using iTunes, which is considered the most efficient method. There are a few ways to work around this issue using iTunes. I’ll share my method below … Why might you want to download your whole Apple Music library locally? For me there are a few benefits. Instant playback without the buffering that streaming can have in low connection environments, offline playback during flights, no worry about mobile data usage – and potentially better battery life from local playback versus streaming over the network. Apple doubled the amount of storage offered on the iPhone 7 with 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB so it’s also likely you can fit a lot, if not most, of your whole music library on your iPhone now. For perspective, the iPod classic – which was considered the jukebox of iPods – capped out at 160GB and that wasn’t even solid state. My full Apple Music library only has about 3500 songs which can easily fit on my 256GB iPhone 7 Plus, but the Music app on iOS 10 only lets you automatically download new content; your existing library must be downloaded by playlist, album, or track by track. The trick here is to make a single playlist that includes your full library without needing to maintain it. You’ll need an iPhone or iPad with the latest version of iOS plus a Mac or PC running the latest version of iTunes. In my situation, I’m an Apple Music subscriber with iCloud Music Library enabled on each device. How to download all Apple Music on iOS 10 Create a Smart Playlist on iTunes using Mac or PC. Use these options: Match music for the following rules: Times is greater than 00:00. Leave the Limit to box unchecked and make sure Live updating stays checked so this playlist will include your entire library and stay updated automatically. Give your new smart playlist a name. I chose All Music since that’s exactly what it includes. As long as you have iCloud Music Library enabled on both iTunes and iOS, your new smart playlist will automatically appear on your iPhone and iPad with a single download all button. You can even give the playlist some nice artwork if you want (I used @doney’s Apple Music Color Flipped icon). Tapping the cloud with arrow icon will initiate a spinner icon which means your playlist content is downloading locally. Depending on the size of your library, this could take a while. For best results, I let the process run overnight while my iPhone was connected to power, Auto-Lock disabled in Settings → Display and Brightness → Auto-Lock (and display dimmed), and the Music app open with the playlist in view. Just remember to turn Auto-Lock back on to avoid battery drain in regular use. (The power connection is definitely smart, but the rest was just for good measure.) For me, it took two nights and part of the next day, but over 3500 songs downloaded locally (save for a few edge cases) with one press of a button on iOS. My current Apple Music library is available locally (I have 50GB to spare even with iCloud Photo Library and apps) and music added will download locally automatically using this setting: Settings → Music → Downloads: Automatic Downloads. Keep in mind that you’ll need to repeat the download process in the future if you replace your iPhone or iPad or restore the software on your current iPhone. Hopefully Apple improves the experience before next year, considering what you can do with high storage iPhones and iPads, but the focus on streaming suggests that may not happen.

 Apple CEO Tim Cook thinks augmented reality will be as important as 'eating three meals a day' Kif Leswing Oct. 3, 2016, 11:19 AM 8,698 facebook linkedin twitter email print AP / Matthew Sumner for Getty Images Apple CEO Tim Cook continues to talk about augmented reality like it's the next major computing platform after the smartphone.  During a talk with Republican Senator Orrin Hatch over the weekend in Utah, Cook gave his most detailed answer yet about how Apple is approaching the technology, which uses computer glasses to superimpose computerized images on the world around the user, kind of like Google Glass does. Cook thinks AR will "take a while" to reach mass adoption because of difficult technical challenges. But it will get there. "It will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, kind of how we wonder how we live without our phone today," Cook said. His discussion of the topic, which visibly excited him, provides the skeleton of what to expect as the augmented reality industry develops. Eventually, Cook thinks that AR could become so essential that it will be as much a part of a user's day as "eating three meals a day."  Here were his complete comments:  "I think there’s two kind of different questions there. It will be enabled in the operating systems first, because it’s a precursor for that to happen for there to be mass adoption of it. I’d look for that to happen in the not-too-distant future. In terms of it becoming a mass adoption [phenomenon], so that, say, everyone in here would have an AR experience, the reality to do that, it has to be something that everyone in here views to be an 'acceptable thing.'" "And nobody in here, few people in here, think it’s acceptable to be tethered to a computer walking in here and sitting down, few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something, because we’re all social people at heart. Even introverts are social people, we like people and we want to interact. It has to be that it’s likely that AR, of the two, is the one the largest number of people will engage with. "I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day, it will become that much a part of you, a lot of us live on our smartphones, the iPhone, I hope, is very important for everyone, so AR will become really big. VR I think is not going to be that big, compared to AR. I’m not saying it’s not important, it is important. "I’m excited about VR from an education point of view, I think it can be really big for education, I think it can be very big for games. But I can’t imagine everyone in here getting in an enclosed VR experience while you’re sitting in here with me. But I could imagine everyone in here in an AR experience right now, if the technology was there, which it’s not today. How long will it take? "AR is going to take a while, because there are some really hard technology challenges there. But it will happen, it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it. Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today." Here's the video of the talk. Cook addresses virtual reality and AR starting at 18:40.

This time, eyes are on the next iPad — or rather, the next set of iPads. In fact, these iPads are supposed to be a new lineup of iPad Pros. Apple may introduce three new versions of its iPad Pro next spring https://t.co/mGAcP360ve pic.twitter.com/xb2n5aoLSm — The Verge (@verge) October 3, 2016 According to a report by Japanese site Mac Otakara, Apple is expected to ship three new iPad Pros in the spring of 2017. These new iPads include the regular 12.9-inch model, as well as two new size options: a 7.9-inch and a 10.1-inch model. That doesn’t seem to be the only upgrade for Apple’s iPad Pros. It seems these new models get some hardware improvements as well. The report states that the 12.9-inch iPad Pro will get an iSight camera that outputs 12 million pixels, the True Tone flash that has been featured on every iteration of iPhone since the introduction of the iPhone 5S back in 2013, and a “True Tone display correspondence to Display P3 will be adopted.” The current, smaller iPad Pro — the 9.7-inch model — will see a slight screen increase, jumping to 10.1-inches. This will change the dimensions slightly by 1-cm in length and 0.5-mm in width. So it gets just a teeny bit longer and just a teeny bit wider. Though the report doesn’t explicitly state, it can be inferred that this iPad Pro will see the same hardware upgrades as the 12.9-inch model. Lastly, the iPad Mini 4 is supposed to renew as an iPad Pro. It will retain the same 7.9-inch display size, but will see some new internal updates. It’s expected to receive the Smart Connector, the four speaker output that the current iPad Pros use — though it’s unknown whether these will be the same stereo speakers used in the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus — and the same iSight camera, True Tone flash, and True Tone display as the expected 12.9-inch iPad Pro. If Apple is going to place this iPad in the Pro lineup, perhaps they’ll call it the iPad Mini Pro instead of the iPad Min 5. Additionally, the entire lineup will change from the dual microphone setup to a quad microphone setup. And interestingly, these iPads are going to retain the 3.5-mm headphone jack, indicating that Apple isn’t ready to kill off the audio jack just yet — the iPhone is, maybe, just an introduction to the world of wireless technology. This report claims their information comes from “well-placed sources,” though Mac Otakara doesn’t explicitly name their sources. According to Mac Rumors, “Mac Otakara does not have a perfect track record with Apple rumors, but its sources have proven accurate on multiple occasions in the past.” They state that Mac Otakara‘s post back in November of 2015 hinted at Apple removing the headphone jack — which evidently came true. And another post seemed to confirm the rumored iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus “Jet Black” color option. The site also “accurately leaked the iPhone 7’s naming scheme, pressure-sensitive Home button, and larger earpiece cutout,” according to Mac Rumors. Perhaps inaccurate in the past, it now seems Mac Otakara may be the site to keep an eye on in terms of Apple leaks and rumors. The first iPad Pro was introduced in November of 2015, and was initially met with a bit of skepticism: an iPad that featured a 12.9-inch display seemed awkward to some. However, after long usage, the iPad Pro become loved ubiquitously by tech critics and fans alike. In March, 2016, just four months after the launch of the iPad Pro, Apple introduced a new, smaller 9.7-inch iPad Pro. This iPad Pro curbed those weary of a larger iPad Pro, delivering the same power and features as its bigger counterpart, but in a significantly smaller chasis. [Image by Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP Images] Given Apple’s track record, the iPad Pro may be due for a refresh. This trio of iPad Pros are expected to launch in the spring of next year, but that could be anywhere between March and June.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Enters Agreement with Denmark University for new Biogas R&D Partnership | Main | Google invents a Touch Gesture System Designed Specifically for Future Smart Garments » October 03, 2016 Fintech Australia Joins Stubborn Local Banks in Fighting Apple Pay's Closed Technology   In August Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Tells Australian Commission that Three Top Banks are in a Cartel to Dictate Terms for Apple Pay." We then followed up with a report in "early September titled "Korea's Financial Tech Firms Unite to File a Complaint with the Fair Trade Commission over Apple Pay." The saga continues today with Fintech Australia who has interposed itself in the war between Apple and the nation's banks, arguing that the dispute highlights the need for open access in all areas of financial infrastructure."   The Australian reports today that "A group of banks, including three of the big four, have been casting around for allies as they seek clearance from the competition regulator to collectively negotiate with Apple over the price of access to its iPhone platform for mobile wallet services.   Coles and other retailers have backed the banks, as has payments innovator Tyro. Tyro says in its submission to the ACCC that it's in the public interest to maintain choice for consumers, merchants and banks in relation to digital wallets and applications."   According The Australian "Fintech Australia is taking a different approach, and it's the right one.   It wants to use the Apple versus everyone battle as a prod to achieve wider, underlying reform, arguing that a negotiation over pricing will not resolve the fundamental issue of access to the iPhone infrastructure known as Near Field Communications.   The irony is not lost on the lobby group either, that the same banks arguing so strongly for NFC access on Apple devices continue to block third-party access by fintech companies to bank financial data."   The report further noted that "The Fintech Australia submission to the ACCC states that "Consumers should have the right to access their money, and instruct institutions to transfer that money, using the device or mechanism of their choice, to the third party of their choice. Equally, consumers should also have the right to access their data, and instruct institutions to share their data, with the third party of their choice."   Last month, the regulator declined to grant interim authorization to the banks. The ACCC expects to release a draft decision on the Apple issue next month.   Apple developed an independent operating system for their mobile devices called iOS. The designed security system tightly ties software and hardware together to better secure consumer information, especially for Apple Pay. Many of the top banks in the world are working with Apple. Australian banks want to fight Apple and this has extended to South Korea.   The Australian business correspondent just takes the view that it's a "no brainer" that Apple Pay should be an open system. It's an age old argument that every competitor of Apple's has complained bitterly about for ever and a day. Any time Apple has a market advantage in anything, these views pop-up instead of negotiating or competing directly with Apple.   What's next? The Australian Music industry demanding that Apple's iTunes or Apple Music be open for all Australians to freely enjoy? In the end, if this group of stubborn banks can't compete in the marketplace with Apple Pay and begins to lose business to the only Australian bank working with Apple, then that's the free market and they'll be forced to work harder or smarter to earn the Australian consumer's business instead of being protected like an elitist group.   It'll be interesting to see what the official decision will be from the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC). I believe their initial decision against the banks was correct and hope that they make that decision final.   To Date, ANZ is the only big Australian bank to have intelligently struck a deal with Apple.      About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

StubHub, which lets ticket owners resell their tickets in its online marketplace, is positioning the Apple TV app as designed to spur consumers to browse and discover events nearby on a big-screen HDTV. The app features a side-scroll interface for browsing within a seating section of a specific event, and includes high-resolution seat maps on the listing cards so users can get a sense of what the view from the section will be. With digital-ticket sales are increasingly shifting to mobile, StubHub’s Apple TV experience was designed to provide a “custom interface to reflect the emotional nature of event discovery,” said Marcus Shelksohn, director of mobile product. StubHub sells tickets via its apps for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and Android devices.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple rumored to debut three new iPad Pro models this spring Jacob Siegal BGR NewsOctober 3, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share A major iPad refresh is incoming, if the latest rumors are to be believed. On Monday morning, Japanese Apple blog Mac Otakara published a report claiming that Apple would launch three new iPad Pro models in spring 2017, including a 9.7-inch model. READ MORE: A painful reminder of just how bad the iPhone 7’s battery life is Citing reliable sources, the report says that the next flagship 12.9-inch iPad Pro will be equipped with a 12-megapixel iSight camera with True Tone flash, as well as a True Tone display, both of which are featured on the current 9.7-inch model. The 7.9-inch iPad Pro, which will theoretically replace the iPad mini 4, is said to include all of the same features of the larger iPad Pro models: 12-megapixel camera, True Tone display, four speakers and a Smart Connector for accessories. In addition to receiving a miniature model, the iPad Pro line will also feature a quad microphone setup as opposed to the dual microphones on the current models. Even more noteworthy: the sources say that Apple's new iPad Pros will still have 3.5mm headphone jacks, despite the fact that Apple "courageously" removed them from the iPhone 7 line. This might be the most welcome surprise of all if true. Back in August, Apple insider and KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo shared his own expectations for the future of the iPad line. His report also claims that Apple will launch three iPad Pros, but rather than a 7.9-inch mini model, Kuo believes Apple will instead unveil a mid-range 10.5-inch model. Although the two reports have some fundamental differences, both suggest that we'll be waiting until next year for any new iPad models.

Apple may launch three new iPad Pro tablets in spring 2017 WITH headphones jacks Rumours point to new 7.9-, 9.7- and 10.1-inch models due next year The new 7.9-inch model could spell the end of the iPad Mini Reports suggest that the new tablet will include the 3.5mm headphone port that Apple controversially dropped from the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus By Libby Plummer For Mailonline Published: 10:52 EST, 3 October 2016 | Updated: 10:55 EST, 3 October 2016 e-mail 20 shares 13 View comments Apple could be launching a trio of new iPad Pro tablets as early as spring 2017, according to new reports.  'Reliable sources' claim that the new 7.9-, 9.7- and 10.1-inch models will launch next year.  The 7.9-inch model is expected to replace Apple's iPad Mini 4. Apple first unveiled the 12.9-inch iPad Pro in September 2015, making it the tech firm's biggest tablet to date. The company also unveiled the Apple Pencil (pictured) WIRELESS CHARGING?  Apple could be adding wireless charging technology to its next-generation iPhone 8, according to a recent patent application. The news follows last month's launch of Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The patent application, filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, shows images of a round charging device with a concave top, similar to the plastic wireless charger used by the Apple Watch.  All three of the new iPad Pro models are expected to be equipped with quad microphones and will retain the 3.5mm headphone jack, reports Japanese tech site Mac Otakara.  Apple controversially dropped the traditional headphone port from its new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus handsets which it unveiled last month.  'Mac Otakara does not have a perfect track record with Apple rumors, but its sources have proven accurate on multiple occasions in the past' said Mac Rumours, which was the first to spot the highlight the latest rumour.  The Japanese site was the first to correctly report on Apple dropping the 3.5mm headphone port from its latest handsets and introducing the new jet back colour, says Mac Rumours.  The site also reports that the existing 12.9-inch iPad Pro will be getting the True Tone display, which is currently limited to the current 9.7-inch model. The larger iPad model is also expected to gain the 12-megapixel rear camera and True Tone flash from the smaller model.   RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next More than half of drivers would prefer to travel in a FLYING...

Aside from the odd exploding iPhone here and there, things have gone swimmingly for Apple. The company's latest and greatest flagship phones offer big improvements over the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in just about every key area, from power and performance to camera quality and even battery life. Where power and performance are concerned though, the flurry of iPhone 7 reviews that have flooded the web over the past couple of weeks may have buried one of the most impressive things about Apple's new iPhones — despite the fact that Apple never focuses on speeds and feeds, its latest iPhones positively crush every single flagship Android phone on the market. Just how much more powerful are the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus than their Android-powered rivals. A new set of performance test results leave little room for interpretation. MUST SEE: The reason this lifelong Android user jumped ship to the iPhone 7 Plus is surprising Shortly after the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were released last month, we saw a mind-blowing real-world performance test that pitted the new iPhone 7 against the fastest widely available Android flagship, Samsung's Galaxy Note 7. The results of that test were flat-out embarrassing. Apple's new iPhone 7 wasn't just faster than the Note 7, it was in a completely different league. That type of real-world usage test is one way to compare smartphones against each other, but another more common method is with benchmark tests. Neither method tells the entire story of course, but together they help paint a more complete picture of how powerful one smartphone is versus other models. So, do benchmark tests tell a different story than that real-world performance test? Let's have a look — here are single-core GeekBench test results, as compiled by mobile blog GSMArena: screen-shot-2016-10-03-at-9-25-40-amMore Here are multi-core GeekBench results: screen-shot-2016-10-03-at-9-26-04-amMore And Aututu 6 test results: screen-shot-2016-10-03-at-9-26-44-amMore Noticing a pattern here? Apple's new iPhone 7 completely crushes every other phone thanks to industry-leading chip designs, cutting-edge components and optimizations that make iOS far smoother in general. The most impressive takeaway here is that we might not see a more powerful smartphone unveiled until next September when Apple launches the iPhone 8 — remember, Apple's iPhone 6s is still more powerful than nearly every other smartphone out there more than a year after its release.

Thermal grease is the gooey stuff that’s applied to the CPU and GPU (if one is present) to ensure the best possible bond with the heatsink. A heatsink is a metal device that uses copper to rapidly radiate heat away from chip(s). It’s connected to one or two fans that blow across it. Therefore, proper bonding of the heatsink to the chip(s) via thermal grease provides the best possible cooling of the chip(s). Many accuse Apple’s heavy handed approach of actually working to insulate rather than efficiently cool the chip(s). This means the fans have to work harder to keep the chip(s) cool, and therefore the battery life gets used up more quickly. Even worse, some say the excess heat can lead to premature death of the chip(s), and therefore the MacBook Pro itself. The evidence Take a look at the state of my 15in mid-2015 MacBook Pro after I’d removed the heatsink to undertake the steps outlined below: In other words, this is the grease applied at Apple’s manufacturing plant. Yuk! The chip at the left is the CPU, while the chip at the right is the GPU (note: not all MacBook Pros feature a GPU). Above the MacBook Pro case you can see the heatsink itself, which in the case of most MacBook Pros is a wide metal bar. Ideally the grease would be just on the chip die surfaces, rather than spread across the entire top of the chip surface. I’ve rebonded/regreased the heatsink of every MacBook Pro I’ve owned (and a white Intel MacBook before that). All had extremely long lives. If you can’t wait to see the results of my latest effort, scroll to the bottom of this web page. I advise you rebond/regrease YOUR MacBook Pro too, although only after reading the following really, really important conditions: 1. Only do it if the MacBook Pro is out of its warranty period; 2. Only do it if you know what you’re doing – it’s a moderately easy task if you’ve ever been inside a PC to replace a component, for example, but likely impossibly tricky if you’re new to all this; you may have to remove the logic board depending on the model of your MacBook Pro; 3. You do all of this at your own risk. You take responsibility for it. You make the choice to do it. I tried hard not to make any mistakes below but I cannot be held liable for any omissions or bloopers. What you’ll need The following items are required: Thermal grease, a.k.a. heatsink compound. That’s the syringe in the photo above. You only need a tiny, tiny amount – literally maybe a gram or two – and will be forced to buy way more than you’re ever going need. People online argue about which brand is best. Just google if you really want to. Isopropyl alcohol, to clean off the old thermal grease. Again you won’t need a huge amount. I got a 250ml bottle and used almost none of it. Paper towels and Q-tips for cleaning off the old grease (also known as kitchen roll and cotton buds for UK readers). Anti-static protection ideally including an antistatic mat, earthing plug and wristband. I really cannot emphasize this enough. Some professionals laugh at precautions like this but the risk of zapping a component with static is serious. It’s a mistake to assume that a zap will outright destroy a component, or that the zap will be seen. The electrical discharge might be invisible and might just damage something so that it becomes faulty 1 in 1000 times it’s used. Why take the risk? Screwdrivers, including the right size and shape for your MacBook Pro, including its bottom case and the screws used to fix the heatsink in place. I used a bag of screwdrivers bought to repair iPhones. They cost almost nothing on eBay. Metal polish to polish the heatsinks, of which more later. I used an old bottle of silver polish I had hanging around. You need one of those marginally abrasive old-fashioned polishes, rather than one of the newer magical liquid cleaners. The steps you need to follow Broadly speaking you need to do the following: 1. Remove the bottom case of your MacBook Pro. 2. Possibly remove the logic board. 3. Detach the heatsink. 4. Clean everything. 5. Polish the heatsink copper pads. 6. Reapply thermal grease. 7. Put everything back together again. All of this typically involves unscrewing a handful of screws, disconnecting some logic board connectors, and perhaps rerouting a cable or two. However, I’m NOT going to go into how to do this because: (a) The steps vary quite a lot depending on the model, and; (b) The steps are detailed far better than I could ever write them over at iFixIt. Often there will be a specific guide to removing the heatsink for your model, or you might just have the follow the general teardown steps and stop when you’ve removed your heatsink. Just search for your model at iFixIt, which will be identified by its year of manufacture and size of screen – both of which you can discover by clicking the Apple menu, then About This Mac. Before even lifting a screwdriver read and reread the steps for your model so you’re absolutely sure what you’re doing, and what to expect. Print them off if it helps. Don’t forget the most important early step, which is to disconnect the battery from the logic board as soon as you open the case. Cleaning and polishing Once you’ve got the heatsink off, use the dry paper towel to remove as much of the old thermal grease as possible from both the chip(s) and the heatsink surface. Don’t scape! Using even a plastic tool to scrape can cause scratches in the soft copper used for the heatsink surface. That means the heatsink won’t be as efficient because less surface area will be able to touch the chip. Next, use the alcohol to remove the remaining heatsink compound by applying it to a piece of paper towel or a Q-tip. Use the alcohol sparingly, and definitely DO NOT saturate either, but try to get the chip(s) and the chip die(s) as clean as possible. Use small amounts of metal polish to shine the heatsink copper pads that make contact with the chip(s). Polish repeatedly but carefully until you can start to see your reflection in them. Take a look at the photo below. It’s not the best shot but the left-hand heatsink shows the reflection of my fingers taking the photograph, while the right-hand heatsink is still dull and fuzzy because it hasn’t yet been polished. While polishing be careful not to apply too much force so that you bend or distort the heatsink component. I didn’t believe polishing the heatsink was worthwhile until I tried it and saw a massive improvement in cooling. In fact, I rebonded the heatsink on two separate occasions, polishing only on the second attempt. Temperatures dropped substantially between each attempt. Once you’ve got the heatsink copper pads polished nicely, use the alcohol to thoroughly clean them. Ensure there’s no fluff or dust on either the chip(s) or heatsink coppers. At this point it’s not a bad idea to clean dust and fluff out of the fans, and the air intake areas. Canned compressed air is good for this. Apply a tiny, tiny pea-size amount of heatsink compound in the centre of each of the CPU, and then the GPU if you have one. Don’t spread it yourself! It will be squashed out and spread evenly when the heatsink is reapplied, which you should do next, and then follow your initial steps in reverse to reassemble your MacBook Pro. Don’t forget to reattach the battery before screwing the case back on! Test your MacBook Pro once it’s booted by running lots of apps and really stressing the machine until the fans are spinning. If you get any kind of crash or freeze then you might not have applied the heatsink properly, and should repeat the steps above. What results to expect Below are before and after figures for temperatures, as provided by the excellent Hardware Monitor app. To get these figures I closed all apps and then let my MacBook Pro idle for around five minutes, only moving the mouse cursor occasionally to stop the MacBook Pro entering sleep mode. The difference is quite incredible. Look at the CPU and GRAPH figures, which represent the CPU and GPU respectively. Note that the fans, identified here as LEFT and RIGHT, were spinning at their minimum rotational velocities, so don’t reflect any temperature difference in this instance. Also note that the “before” figures above are from my SECOND attempt at rebonding/regreasing the heatsink, at which point I polished the heatsink coppers. Here’s what the figures looked like prior to my first attempt, when the MacBook Pro was still using the grease applied in the factory: When this measurement was taken the MacBook Pro was doing nothing in particular, with a handful of basic apps open. In other words, comparing the factory-applied thermal grease to my own attempts, I might’ve managed to drop the CPU and GPU idle temperatures by 8 degrees. That’s just incredible. Now do you see why this is worth doing for a long and healthy life for your MacBook Pro? . , Leave a comment... Need advise on purchasing a Mac Book Pro. Thanks. Lee Schroter — P.D.Schroter · Oct 2, 09:27 AM · # Thanks for the nice writeup! (Tho you really should move that “don’t forget to detach the battery” step onto the first list.) In over 30 years of usually intense personal computing, I’ve never had a CPU or GPU fail; problems were other parts failing on the logic board, on the spinning disks and in the power supplies. So it’d be good to understand this work in the context of how it will really help. If it reduces the risk of failure from 0.5% to 0.4%, it’s probably not worth doing except for the pleasure/geekery of it. Spending maybe $100 of time/supplies with a 99.9% chance of not mattering means an expected cost of 1000 X $100. Add also the risk of screwing up. (I say this as somebody who has re-done the heat sinks on a couple of PCs. Successfully, and with good results because the parts WERE running over spec.) I presume that this work merely moves the heat away from the 2 chips faster, and won’t affect the many heat-sensitive parts in the rest of the MBP. So it’d be nice to know what Intel or anybody else says about the CPU’s life span at different temps. Thanks again, and in advance for a reply. — Walt French · Oct 3, 02:06 PM · # Hi Walt I’m afraid I can’t provide the reassurances you need because what I wrote is based on my own experience, and that of others. It’s a bit like applying underseal to a car. Will it work without it? Yes. Will it work for many years. Yes, Will it last for many years? Well, that’s why we apply underseal – and it’s only when you’ve had rust that you see the light. The info you’re looking for is out there on Google. Macs undoubtedly have issues surrounding GPU death, related often to Apple’s poor quality manufacturing (there’s a product recall on several models) but as I mention in the piece lots of people ascribe their troubles to poor cooling. Indeed, Apple repairers like Louis Rossmann are a little obsessed with the poor state of cooling on MacBook Pro computers. — Keir Thomas · Oct 3, 02:30 PM · # Nice text! A curiosity (non related to the article): What wallpaper is that? — Harlley Sathler · Oct 4, 10:50 AM · # This is great advice, very technical but it would be wise to follow if you want to keep a Mac around for as long as possible. I suspect the current (even if ancient) MacBook Pro lineup will be the last true “Pro” Mac lineup that Apple made, so if you have one, take good care of it!

By Ben Dandridge-Lemco   Jamie McCarthy / Getty Images Update (10/4 10:10 a.m.): After being added to Apple Music on Monday, Jay Z's The Blueprint vol. 1, 2, and 2.1 have been removed from the service once again. A source close to the situation tells The FADER that the three albums were not supposed to be made available on Apple Music. After acquiring TIDAL in 2015, Jay Z took measures to keep his own music catalogue relatively exclusive to the service. In March, it was reported that Jay Z's The Blueprint series had been removed from Spotify and Apple Music. Now, it seems that The Blueprint volumes 1, 2, and 2.1 have returned to Apple Music, as Complex points out. Reports of Apple Music acquiring TIDAL began to circulate in June, but the rumors were debunked by Apple Music head Jimmy Iovine in an interview with Buzzfeed. "We’re really running our own race," Iovine said in September. "We’re not looking to acquire any streaming services." As of this writing, Jay Z's Reasonable Doubt and The Blueprint 3 albums remain unavailable on Apple Music. Reasonable Doubt is currently available on U.K. Spotify.

For the most part, the outlet corroborated a previous report from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo with one major difference: Kuo claimed Apple would be releasing a 10.5-inch model iPad Pro model next year, not the 10.1-inch device mentioned in Mac Otakara’s report. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro should gain a twelve-megapixel iSight camera (the same as on the iPhone 7?), as well as True Tone flash and wide color gamut P3 display, both of which are found on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The next iPad mini is said to be called the 7.9-inch iPad Pro. That device, according to Mac Otakara’s sources, should come outfitted with a Smart Connector and a four-speaker setup as found on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, plus a twelve-megapixel iSight camera, True Tone flash and wide color P3 display. As for a rumored new 10.1-inch iPad Pro model, the report states that the device will be 1 centimeter longer and 0.5cm wider than the 9.7-inch iPads. The report adds that all three iPad models coming in 2017 will have four microphones, presumably to improve Siri reception in both landscape and portrait orientation. Lastly, Mac Otakara is adamant that the upcoming iPads won’t drop the 3.55 mm headphone jack like the iPhone 7 series has. The devices should release in Spring 2017.

Felipe Queiroz Drumond Same here! I was keen to keep my ipad mini 2 just because there was not a up-to-date ipad mini. The mini pro is what I was expecting for! AMB_07 What a coincidence I’m also on the ipad mini 2! I’m not sure about an upgrade yet, even though the Mini 2 is from a different era, but I’ll keep an eye on that and if the price is right who knows. Noohar Still loving my Mini 2 as well. Jose Gonzalez Still on iPad mini 3 waiting for a new iPad mini. I’ve seen some deals on the “4” but it would kill me to upgrade and then see a 5th gen come out shortly after. I’ll just wait. techfreak23 Doesn’t make sense why they would go from 9.7 to 10.1. The current sizes are perfect for everyone’s personal preference. They just need to make them with all of the same hardware and features so that the main difference is size. PhoneTechJay Maybe it is the same external size with a .4in bigger screen inside it. techfreak23 The only reason I can see them doing that is to change the aspect ratio to 16:9 or 16:10 from 4:3, which again doesn’t really make sense to me. PhoneTechJay They can make the screen a bit bigger and still keep the same resolution if they wanted to. techfreak23 That would lower the pixel density. Again, all of it doesn’t make any sense. Jamessmooth Great news. I made the mistake of getting my Pro without LTE and have been regretting it ever since. Force Touch, back-lit typecover, True Tone and that wide color gamut and I’ll be a happy camper. Don’t care about the camera, but I was in Europe a few weeks ago and man there are a LOT of people taking pics with their iPads these days! Edit: I’d like it to be water resistant too… After all, it should be right?? James G Hope they make it in Black! Silvio6 If it had fingerprint touchid i would have bought the mini4. So the new mini will be my 1st ipad mini unless it has a “stupid” button 🙂 in that case, I’m sure there will be great deals on the 4.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines How to mention someone in your Instagram story MacBook Pro with Touch Bar now available for in-store pickup Get up to $200 off the new MacBook Pro + no tax outside NY Where the Apple Car is going Apple’s free app of the week: Tayasui Sketches Pro   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to PasswordRecovery stores passwords and recovers them when you forget them NCTextColor lets you add vibrancy to Notification Center iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

It’s been lovingly called the “Spaceship” for years, and the latest drone flyover of the site shows you why. As per usual, two drone pilots have been conducting flyovers of the facility using DJI Inspire 1 and Phantom 4 quadcopters. They show an outer building that’s mostly done, with details like landscaping and solar panels being finished at speed. DON’T MISS: Yup, now the iPhone 7 is exploding The first video, filmed by Duncan Sinfield with his Inspire 1, does a good job of showing you around campus. It’s filmed either at dawn or dusk, and you get the coolest effect of the entire building — the glowing facade that really demonstrates the spaceship theme rather well. The landscaping is one of the biggest projects left to complete. The famous Apple iHill is marked out well for the final grade, but the remainder of the inside of the spaceship is still just dirt. Matthew Roberts’ drone footage, filmed with a DJI Phantom 3 Pro, takes a closer look at the roof of the building, and in particular the solar panel installs. Apple has made a big deal out of its environmental policies recently, installing wind and solar on the roofs of some buildings, and debuting an iPhone recycling machine to reduce e-waste. The scale of Apple’s new HQ is always difficult to grasp from the drone footage, but the occasional glimpse of tiny workers is enough to remind you how ambitious this project is. Construction will cost around $5 billion — expensive, for sure, but a lot less than Apple’s hundreds of billions of cash sitting offshore. (It’s less than Apple’s back tax bill to the European Union, for that matter.)

This time, some users complain that the Bluetooth does not operate as it should when connecting their phones with their cars. Most problems have affected BMW owners that have the ConnectedDrive system without Apple CarPlay/Android Auto connectivity. Some owners of these vehicles have complained that they cannot stream music from their phones to their cars via Bluetooth. The problem requires a reboot of the smartphone, which fixes the issue until a reconnection is made. The complaints mentioned that music is streamed over Bluetooth at first, but the ConnectedDrive freezes in five to ten seconds after it begins playing. According to MacRumors, the problem is not singular to BMW cars, as it has also affected owners of Kia and Hyundai owners. There is no link between this issues except for the same phone, the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. It appears that the problem is not bound to iOS 10 itself, as many owners say that previous versions of the iPhone operate as intended in the same conditions. This issue also occurred two years ago after the launch of iOS 8 and the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. At the time, Apple fixed the problem with the iOS 8.1 update, while the same problem was solved afterward for iPhone SE users with the iOS 9.3.2. update. Apple had reportedly told customers that the issue would be repaired when the next iOS update is available, which is currently in development. As a preparative measure, BMW owners are recommended to update the multimedia unit’s software to the latest version of the ConnectedDrive system. BMW has also replied to the concerned customers, and they were informed that the brand is working with Apple to enable connectivity with the iPhone 7, as they still had to complete testing the smartphone. BMW has also suggested users to get a ConnectedDrive update from its website, as well as an update from Apple for the phone’s operating system. iPhone 7 bluetooth BMW ConnectedDRive Kia Hyundai connectivity   Could Hyundai Be a Porsche Alternative?

In response to Amazon’s first day score card - 1.5 million units sold in 12 hours - on Saturday, rival Flipkart on Sunday raised the bar, pegging the number of units sold at 2.25 million in exactly 12 hours. This figure includes sales made by Myntra it acquired two years back. The annual online war between the two biggest e-commerce players will continue through most of the week, with one trying to overpower the other with new stats on product sale, assortment, and discount, in the process telling investors who’s the biggest. Watching the initial trends, analysts estimated that the top three e-commerce firms, Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal, could end up with a combined sales of $1.5 billion, or Rs 10,000 crore, in the festive sale week that began over the weekend. What happened on Day 1 Flipkart Flipkart and Myntra together sold 2.25 million units in the first 12 hours of the Big Billion Days Sold more Apple watches in 10 minutes than the total sale of Apple watches online and offline in a month Myntra clocked 3 times more revenue in the  first hour, compared to the 2015 edition Amazon In the first 12 hours, managed to sell over 1.5 million units More than 100,000 units sold in less than the first 30 minutes Microwaves saw a 30-time spike in demand Consumer durables categories saw a 10-time growth Diapers and baby products have witnessed an increase of 12 times Snapdeal At midnight, 180 orders booked per second By 4 pm, more than 1.1 million people had made purchases Orders went to nearly 52,000 sellers People from 2,800 cities and towns placed their orders Fastest delivery: An order for iPhone 5s  placed at 7.20 am on Oct 2 was delivered in Gurgaon at 8.10 am The third player - Snapdeal - is playing the “time” card more than anything else. A promise of delivery within 50 minutes - just a little more than what it takes for a pizza to arrive - was the USP for the Kunal Bahl-led company. “We had the fastest delivery of the season at under an hour. An order for iPhone 5S placed at 7.20 am on October 2 was delivered to the buyer in Gurgaon at 8.10 am,’’ a company executive said. If the speed of drone (so far the domain of Amazon) was what Snapdeal was hard selling, Flipkart made Apple its pitch. The Bengaluru-based e-commerce leader claimed it sold more Apple watches in 10 minutes than the total sale of Apple watches, online and offline, in a month. Just the day one of the festive sales could generate around $300-400 million (about Rs 2,000-3,000 crore) in orders for the three e-commerce players, they said. Amazon had kicked off the sale on Saturday, followed by Flipkart and Snapdeal on Sunday. Pundits are yet to identify a clear winner. Almost all the three players have done on an average $100 million (about Rs 700 crore) in sales, said insiders. Amazon may have done a little more transactions and may be a notch higher than Flipkart, a consultant said. However it is too soon to decide any pecking order, he added. “This season has the potential to have $1-1.2 billion (Rs about 6,800-7,000 crore) worth of transaction happening predominantly due to the electronics and fashion categories,” said Sreedhar Prasad, partner, e-commerce and start-ups, KPMG India. The weekend holidays saw more consumers shop online. Snapdeal’s Unbox Diwali sale saw nearly 1.1 million buyers from over 2,800 cities and towns across the country buy on the platform in the first 16 hours of the sale. The company saw sales volume jumping six times of average volumes by 4 pm on Day 1. The sale, which started at midnight with 180 orders being booked per second, got bigger during the day as buyers used the national holiday to explore a plethora of deals. “We are seeing consistent growth across all categories, with overall six time increase in volumes as compared to usual days,” Saurabh Bansal, vice-president, category management, Snapdeal said. Among other things the Gurgaon-based e-commerce biggie sold 12 apartments and 846 motorcycles in a single day. Amazon claimed that sales on the second day grew fivefold when compared to sales on the same day during last year’s Diwali sale. The US e-tailer said that it had sold 1.5 million units in twelve hours during the second day of its Great Indian Festival, taking its cumulative sales for the two days so far to six times its average daily sales. Last year, the three players combined did a business of $1 billion (Rs 6,800 crore) during the same period.

The report states that Apple will release a new version of its 7.9-inch iPad mini under the Pro tagline, which will feature four speakers and a smart connector just like the current lineup of iPad Pros. Apple is also reportedly building a new 10.1-inch iPad Pro, which will feature a 12MP camera and improved True Tone flash, but those dimensions go against a report from the very reliable Apple analyst Ming Chi-Kuo, who says a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro is on the way. Macotakara also suggests the 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2 will receive a 12MP camera and True Tone flash as well, but offers no more details about the specs of the device. Macotakara did say that the new iPad Pro lineup will keep the headphone jack, which would be nice. But given that this report conflicts with Ming's letter and the timeframe before these devices will supposedly be released, it's best to take this with a grain of salt, for now. iPad Pro 9.7 review Source: Macotakara Next Up In Circuit Breaker Researchers send text message using chemicals This Panasonic megaphone automatically translates commands into multiple languages Amazon is rolling out Alexa-only shopping deals Apple launches repair program for iPhone 6 Plus ‘touch disease’ flaw Google's new Pixel phone case will put the day's news where you can't avoid it Star Wars drones are coming to the US just in time for the holiday toy hunger games Now Trending Microsoft Surface Studio review: a beautiful invader of Apple's base Sand's End Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon suggests having too many Asian tech CEOs undermines ‘civic society’ This Article has a component height of 7.

Berry October 3, 2016 10:27 AM SHARE TWEET EMAIL REDDIT EMAIL REDDIT Stephen Lovekin, Getty Images Update: And just like that, the Jay Z albums that mysteriously reappeared on Apple Music, like Blueprint and Blueprint 2, have now been yanked from the service once again. Apple Music Original Story: If you’re a Jay Z fan, Apple Music hasn’t been your best friend—until now. Recently, the God MC excited iPhone-dependent fans across the globe when he put his albums The Blueprint, The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse and Blueprint 2.1 back onto the popular streaming service. While no one knows for sure what Jay Z putting these albums back on Apple Music means as to whether the company will regain access to other albums like Reasonable Doubt and Blueprint 3, it does appear that it could be at least a step in that direction. Months ago, it felt like such a thing was practically impossible. Back in March, the folks at Pitchfork noticed that Hova’s albums Reasonable Doubt and The Blueprint had been taken off by Apple Music. When the site reached out to Spotify, a rep for the company noted that Hov’s Blueprint albums hadn’t been available for at least a few months up to that point. Tidal is still the only music streaming service that has permission to stream all of Jay Z’s albums. If you know anything about Tidal, you understand why. Back in early 2015, Jay Z and several other artists launched the music streaming service as a platform for artists to have more control over the royalties earned from their work. While Tidal generated a solid buzz thanks to the star power of Kanye West, Beyoncé, Nicki Minaj and Hov himself, the service has struggled to compete with streaming giants like Apple Music and Spotify. With that in mind, it makes sense for the company to incentivize fans to subscribe by making itself the only platform that streams all of Jay Z’s albums, so it might be a while before Apple or any other streaming service gets their cyber-hands on all of Hova’s legendary discography. Apple users who still want access to all of Jay Z’s albums can subscribe to Tidal, or buy every Hov album but The Blueprint 3 on iTunes. Man I waited for this a long time. Finally back on Apple Music Listen to The Blueprint by JAY Z on #AppleMusic. https://t.co/C886n3A9Fr — ➗ (@whereistariq) October 3, 2016 so happy they finally put Jay Z back on apple music — kentist (@Kenster_) October 2, 2016 10 Instances in Which Rappers Were Searched By Police But Not Arrested Image of Subscribe to XXL on Filed Under: Jay-Z Category: News SHARE TWEET EMAIL REDDIT More Leave a comment EMAIL Print this page Pin it!

 Apple is searching for new revenue streams BI Intelligence Oct. 3, 2016, 10:07 AM 2,064 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Snapchat has partnered with Foursquare to improve geofilters Google won't build ad blocking into Chrome Google has shut down a malicious ad attack on its AdSense network This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Digital Media Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Apple opened its Search Ads program for the App Store last week, and the first sponsored app listings to go live on October 5. The ads aim to improve app discoverability within Apple’s relatively crowded store of 2 million apps, and improve Apple’s competencies as an ad-services company.  There are three core strategic elements to Apple opening a new playground for search in its App Store: Bringing a proven business model to new ground. These ads are reminiscent to Google’s search ads, and particularly the search ads that have been in the Google Play store for over a year. Search advertising is the centerpiece of Google’s business. Indeed, Google attributed its stellar Q2 2016 performance to mobile search growth. By introducing search ads to its App Store, Apple is simply adapting a known revenue driver to a new environment. Monetizing low-hanging fruit with minimal effort. Over 65% of iOS app downloads originate from search on the App Store. Search ads provide an obvious way for Apple to monetize this behavior without a lot of effort. Yet the pricing of these ads – a cost-per-install basis (not by impression) and with no minimum bid – suggests Apple isn’t overly intent on turning search ads into a meaningful revenue driver for the time being. Selling the narrative of Apple as a services company. Apple has emphasized its services businesses over the past year in the wake of decelerating iPhone sales. The company made the case that its services – comprising includes iTunes, iCloud, Apple Music, Apple Pay, Apple Care, and its App Stores –  grew 19% year-on-year to $6 billion, and was on course to be a Fortune 100 company next year. Developing search-ad expertise builds this narrative further. Another possible implication – and one that remains pure conjecture for now – is that Apple is laying the groundwork for a mobile ad business to counteract rivals like Google and Facebook. Here is how that scenario could play out: Solidifying Apple's walled garden by making iPhones invisible. iOS 10 expanded on the “Limit Ad Tracking” privacy setting to make opted-in users practically invisible to third-party mobile advertisers by hiding an iPhone's “Identifier for Advertising” (IDFA) number. Around 17% of iPhone users currently have “Limit Ad Tracking” turned on, according to the Future of Privacy Forum. Ingesting developers' ad preferences to create new ad solutions. Search ads would give Apple valuable insights into developer’s keyword and audience preferences for their app ads. Apple could use these insights to build other mobile advertising solutions beyond search ads.  Building the foundations of a robust ad platform stating with search. Apple's search ad platform lets advertisers target ads by device, keyword, audience and schedule. These features could form the backbone of a more robust ad serving platform moving forward. In this regard, Apple might be following the blueprint set by Google, which has built a formidable advertising business around its search ad core.  With that said, search ads and app-install ads are very different spaces to be in. Search ads are intent- and action-based, whereas app-install ads are passive and actionless, appearing regardless of a user’s action. The insights gleaned from a search ad business might not be directly applicable to an app-install business. Moreover, Google and Facebook’s faraway lead in mobile app-install ads means they’re unlikely to be supplanted any time soon. But Apple’s ability to shut out competitors by hiding IDFA numbers, and the foundation it's building for a robust ad platform, could propel the company into a substantial mobile advertising player, assuming this is what Apple wants to achieve.  To receive stories like this one directly to your inbox every morning, sign up for the Digital Media Briefing newsletter. Click here to learn more about how you can gain risk-free access today.

The Irish one hasn’t had the smoothest of rides when it comes to planning permission, so it’ll be hoping for better luck with the Danish project, now confirmed to be situated in Foulum, a small village in Central Jutland. The Danish foreign minister Kristian Jensen told CPH Post that the DKK6.3B ($950M) project would represent the largest foreign capital investment in the country’s history. Tim Cook said back in 2015 that the Irish and Danish projects combined would also be Apple’s biggest investment in Europe to date. Apple had already confirmed that the new center would run on 100% renewable energy, but Jensen says that the company’s commitment to renewables in the area goes further than this … As part of its plans, Apple has formed an ‘ambitious agreement’ with the nearby Aarhus University to fund research into biogas. Under the terms of the agreement, Apple will provide financial support to the university’s research into biogas and how usable energy can be extracted from agriculture, whether it is fertiliser or straw supplied by local farmers. The amount of Apple’s funding was not disclosed. The center will help provide online services across Europe, including the iTunes Store, App Store, iMessage, Apple Maps and Siri. It is due to begin operations next year. Guides Data center View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Investors should buy Apple shares due to multiple pieces of evidence pointing to solid iPhone demand, according to Pacific Crest, which reiterated its overweight rating. "We recommend buying AAPL. We believe iPhone demand remains consistent with our sell-in expectations, which suggests Apple should meet or beat our overall estimates through 2016," analyst Andy Hargreaves wrote in a note to clients Sunday. "This, along with optimism around the 2017 iPhone cycle, creates a favorable risk-reward around the stock, in our view."

(Seeking Alpha) Related VHC Mid-Afternoon Market Update: Dow Falls 75 Points; VirnetX Shares Spike Higher 15 Biggest Mid-Day Gainers For Monday Shares of VirnetX Holding Corporation (NYSE: VHC), an internet security software and technology company, announced it won a patent case against Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) According to Reuters, a federal jury court in Texas ordered Apple to pay VirnetX more than $302 million in damages for using its patented internet security technology in its FaceTime video conference without the necessary permission. VirnetX's litigation against Apple dates back to 2010 when VirnetX claimed infringement of four patents relating to secure networks and secure communications links. In 2012, a jury awarded $368.2 million in damages but the U.S. Court of Appeals partly overturned the verdict because there were issues with how the trial judge instructed jurors on how to calculate damages. Another suit brought on against Apple by VirnteX was combined with the 2012 case and a jury slapped an even larger $625.6 million verdict against Apple. However, these results were also voided on the notion that references to the 2012 case confused jurors and was unfair to Apple. As noted by Reuters, the most recent trial proceeded as ViirtnetX expected with a $302.5 million award. The juror were this time requested to determine damages on two VirtnetX patents that Apple had been previously found guilty of infringing. The stock was up about 47 percent at $4.49 Monday morning.

Despite Apple controlling the hardware and software, there is only so much they can do in terms of optimizing battery usage till the point where having a bigger battery is the only way you can go. Unfortunately presumably for vanity purposes to keep its phones slim, Apple has opted to not increase battery size by much over the years and it shows. According to UK consumer testing report Which?, it seems that the Apple’s iPhone 7 doesn’t even come close when measured up against 2016’s flagship phones. As you can see in the image above, the test found that the iPhone 7 only lasted 712 minutes during a 3G phone call, and 615 minutes on 3G internet. The HTC 10 actually beats out the competition by lasting 1,859 minutes on a 3G call, and 790 minutes when using 3G internet. Coming in second place for calls would be the LG G5 with 1,579 minutes, but it falls to third place for internet where it lasted 640 minutes. As for the Galaxy S7, it came in third for 3G calls at 1,492 minutes and second for internet where it lasted 677 minutes. As you can tell by these numbers, the differences are huge, so if you’re looking to buy a phone and battery life is your number one priority, then maybe the iPhone 7 isn’t the phone for you.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple is reportedly planning to launch three new iPad Pro units some time in the spring of 2017, according to Mac Otakara. The meat of this rumor suggests that Apple will launch a new 10.1-inch iPad Pro, a new 9.7-inch iPad Pro and, for the first time ever, a smaller 7.9-inch mini version of the iPad Pro. If it happens, it will be the first time Apple has added “Pro” features to the iPad Mini, including a smart connector dock, presumably for a mini keyboard, four speakers and support for the Apple Pencil. MacOtakara suggests Apple will also add quad microphones, boosting performance from the current dual-microphone setup. TrueTone displays and 12MP cameras are expected for all models. Funny enough, MacoTakara suggests the new iPads will include headphone jacks. Weird.

Macotakara says the largely-forgotten 7.9-inch iPad mini, last updated in September 2015, will get the Pro suffix along with all the associated benefits. That means the Smart Connector for attaching a keyboard and four-speaker audio. The report also says Apple will include a 12-megapixel camera with a TrueTone flash. Interestingly Apple also plans to bump the regular-sized, 9.7-inch iPad Pro up to 10.1-inches, by making the device 1cm longer and 0.5cm wider, the sources say. That would be significant, given the legacy of the 9.7-inch device, which has been in play since the very first iPad in 2010. Related: iPad Pro review Also on deck for a refresh this year is the original 12.9-inch iPad Pro, according to Macotakara. The report also says all three models will retain the 3.5mm headphone jack, when they launch next spring, and will switch from dual-microphone to quad-microphone set-ups. The last question appears to be whether the mechanical home button, axed from the iPhone 7, will depart from 2017’s iPad models too? No news on that in today's report.

Tech News Downloads Software Store Search for: BetaNews Hot Topics: Windows 10 Microsoft Apple Cloud Tablets Android Security Reviews Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Linked-in RSS The best new features in macOS Sierra By Mihăiță Bamburic Published 2 months ago 41 Comments Tweet Apple has officially released macOS Sierra, the latest version of its Mac operating system. Just like its recent predecessors, it is available for free. But, unlike any of the major releases introduced since 2001, it no longer bears the OS X name, as Apple wants to bring it in line with its other consumer-facing operating systems. So, it is called macOS Sierra, and not OS X 10.12 Sierra. Does that mean it is a completely new operating system underneath? No. What Apple has done is improve upon OS X 10.11 El Capitan by adding a significant number of changes that should keep Mac users happy for one more year. The user experience has not been changed dramatically, though there are some pretty exciting things in macOS Sierra. Hey, Siri Siri has finally landed on Macs. It is the biggest new feature in macOS Sierra, and if you have been relying on the voice assistant on your iPhone you will probably want to take advantage of it here as well. The list of things that Siri can do is pretty similar to what you have been used to on iOS, so you can expect to have pretty much the same user experience. If you ask Siri what it can do, it'll show a list of things that you can ask it to do, which includes opening apps, messaging contacts, changing System Preferences, show weather info, and so on. But it is not as advanced as you may like, as certain queries are still answered with web searches, it doesn't always know how to deal with follow up questions, it gives answers to questions you did not ask, etc. Siri is easy to summon. You can click on the icon in the menu bar, next to Spotlight, or the one in the Dock to bring it up, but you can also press the command and space keys at the same time to launch the voice assistant. When Siri fires up, the sound in apps will be muted so you can hear it and ask it things. Better iCloud integration One of the first things that you will notice when using macOS Sierra is the fact that what is on your desktop is now automatically uploaded to iCloud. This gives you the benefit of automatically backing up screenshots, among other things. Same applies to things stored in the Documents folder. The Copy and Paste You've Been Waiting For This feature is addressed to iOS users, who will now be able to copy and paste items between a Mac and an iPhone or iPad. As an example, if you select some text on your iPhone you will then be able to open a Word document on your Mac to paste it in. It is part of Continuity. Apple Watch Holds the Key... ... to unlocking your Mac. The option to unlock your Mac using your Apple Watch can be found under Security & Privacy. It is a convenience feature, that will allow you to use a strong password for unlocking your Mac without having to go through the hassle of entering it every time you want to use it. I should note that if you do not have an Apple Watch you can still try different apps, like Tether, to get the same effect using an iOS handset. This also relies on Bluetooth to figure out if you are close to your Mac, and if that is the case it will handle the authentication on your behalf. There is a higher chance of losing or misplacing a smartphone than a smartwatch though, so keep that in mind. Notification Changes Apple has tweaked the notification center and how notifications appear on your Mac in macOS Sierra, adding the ability to pin certain things from Siri and giving notifications an iOS 10 look. The widgets are also updated to match iOS 10. What Apple has not done is change the theme of the notifications center and notifications to match the system preference (dark or light), so if you have set macOS Sierra with the dark theme the notifications center and the notifications that you receive will still have the standard colors. Improved Default Apps The macOS Sierra update also affects the built-in apps. Among the apps that have been improved are Apple Music, Contacts, Mail, Messages, Notes, Photos, and Safari (it gets Apple Pay integration, as the big highlight). There is an app that has been removed, and that is Game Center. It is unlikely to be missed though. Supported Devices If you have not yet upgraded to macOS Sierra, you should know that the new operating system has dropped support for some older devices. It is compatible with the following Macs: late-2009 and newer iMac 2010 and newer Mac mini 2010 and newer Mac Pro late-2009 and newer MacBook 2010 and newer MacBook Air 2010 and newer MacBook Pro How to Get It? If you have a supported Mac, you can get macOS Sierra from the App Store and update directly. You can easily create a bootable USB drive if you want to perform a clean install. 41 Comments Tweet Got News?

However following the debacle that was the app’s launch, Google had nothing to fear as Apple’s CEO Tim Cook had at that time recommended Google Maps as an alternative while they sorted their problems out. That was a few years ago and Apple Maps has come a long way since. If you’re still looking for reasons to use the app, you might be interested to learn that Apple has since updated the Maps app with full Amtrak support. What this means is that in addition to support for the northeast routes, Apple Maps will now support pretty much the entire Amtrak system that covers the Midwest, Northwest, South, and West regions of the US. It will also cover Canadian cities of Montréal and Vancouver, so if you are a Canadian resident you can look forward to taking advantage of this update as well. Now we’re not sure if this change will be enough to bring users back into the fold, but if you’ve always favored native apps then we guess the support for Amtrak is Apple getting one step closer to creating the Maps app that iOS users deserve.

Zelda Real Escape Game Announced More Tech iPhone 7 comes last in battery testing By Matthew Humphries 10.03.2016 :: 4:30AM EST @mthwgeek Apple will continue to tell everyone who cares to listen how amazing the iPhone 7 is, but as the weeks tick by from its launch, the smartphone is looking less and less amazing. The latest disappointment? Battery life. The removal of the headphone jack has not been well received and there’s even a case trying to fix it. Now a battery test comparing the iPhone 7 to its three major rivals has seen Apple’s smartphone come in last, and by some margin on talk time. The testing was carried out by the independent UK consumer body Which? Two tests were carried out focusing on 3G call time and 3G Internet use. The iPhone 7 running iOS 10 was pitted against the HTC 10, LG G5, and Samsung Galaxy S7 all running Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Here’s the results: Now, Apple and I’m sure many iPhone users will argue that 10 hours of Internet browsing or 12 hours of talk time are more than enough. But I’d argue that’s not the point. These are results from testing, which while useful are not fully representative of real-world use and that always ends up being worse. You have to view this as best case, and batteries do deteriorate over time. The reason why Apple comes in last is easily explained: it has a tiny battery compared to the competition. Here’s the battery size of each smartphone: Galaxy S7: 3,000mAh HTC 10: 3,000mAh LG G5: 2,800mAh iPhone 7: 1,960mAh The size of the battery demonstrates the priorities within Apple. They want the thinnest and lightest fully-featured phone they can create, and if that means shipping a smaller battery then that’s what they will do. Apple knows what its competitors are doing and could very easily increase the size of the battery to top the charts, but thin and light is more important to them so they make decisions with that being the priority. If there’s any other valid reasons for shipping a significantly smaller, non-removable battery I’d like to hear them. Would anyone care if the iPhone 7 was a few millimeters thicker? Outside of Apple I highly doubt it. Would iPhone users appreciate an extra 3-5 hours of battery life between charges? I can’t see anyone answering no to that question, can you?

The rectangular case has an integrated induction charger for the Apple Watch -- which is Apple MFi Certified -- and a USB-A port on one side for charging any other device connected to the bank. The Power Bank has an included battery rated at 4,000 mAh and a 2A output, which ZENS said "guarantees fast charging of the Apple Watch and iPhone or iPad." Its battery falls in line with another portable Apple Watch/iPhone charging pack made by Kanex, which can recharge an Apple Watch six times over on one life. The two-in-one ZENS Power Bank is developed especially for Apple Watch and iPhone/iPad. As is the case with other ZENS products, the innovative new power bank stands out for its sleek, ultra-slim design. It offers a space-saving way to charge your Apple iPhone and/or Apple Watch at home, in the office or on the go, without the need to bring along a cumbersome charging dock while you’re underway. The Apple MFi Certified module that is incorporated in the ZENS Power Bank eliminates the need to add your own Apple Watch Charger. While you are wirelessly charging your Apple Watch, you can use the reversible micro USB cable, that is impossible to plug in wrong, to charge your iPhone or iPad. ZENS says the Power Bank is ideal for travel as well as home and office use, because "the all-in-one charging and battery solution requires little space on your desk or in your bag" thanks to its ultra-slim design, which is about 5 inches long and just 1.5 inches wide. The company has released an integrated charging puck accessory before for the Apple Watch, with the small Apple Watch Power Bank that focused on portability and had a 1,300 mAh battery. That cheaper option, which runs for $56, didn't offer simultaneous iPhone or iPad charging with an additional USB-A port, however. Those interested can purchase the ZENS iPhone/Apple Watch Power Bank from the company's website for €69.99 or about $78.00, and it will ship to the United States and several other countries from the Netherlands.

According to Goldman Sachs’ Donald Lu, Digitimes reported on September 28 that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) had increased its 16nm orders at Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE: TSM) in Q4 2016. The analyst expects seasonal correction to depend on the iPhone 7 sell through, given that Apple is expected to have built more iPhone 7 models than iPhone 6S during H2 2016. “Our checks at Taobao, stores, and official channels of telco operators indicate that iPhone 7 Plus is supply constrained, but that supply/demand of iPhone 7 is sufficient,” Lu mentioned, while pointing out that China represented 23 percent of Apple’s sales, making it the second largest market after the Americas. Related Link: Citi Boosts Q4 iPhone Estimate From 73 Million To 79 Million Units Strong Demand “Staff at Apple’s flagship store in Sanlitun, Beijing commented that they saw much stronger demand for iPhone 7/7 Plus than iPhone 6s as customers are attracted to the dual cameras in the Plus model as well as the waterproof and dust-resistant features,” Lu stated. The analyst also noted that there seemed to be greater demand for the jet black model, although stock inventory was lower and the models were selling at a premium to the recommended retail price on Taobao.

And, unfortunately for Apple, there could be more damages to come. By Jake Smith for iGeneration | October 3, 2016 -- 12:47 GMT (05:47 PDT) | Topic: Networking Image: File photo A federal jury has ordered Apple to pay more than $302.4 million in damages, in a secure computer and mobile communications patent retrial against VirnetX. Friday's verdict was the third in the ongoing patent dispute that began in 2010, with two earlier verdicts overturned by appeal and an East Texas federal judge. The two patents relate to Apple's FaceTime calling feature. The damages included what Apple must pay to use the patents. Bloomberg reported court documents show VirnetX, a company which makes most of its money from patent licensing, will seek further damages for willful infringement in a later hearing. Apple's legal battles aren't close to over. VirnetX has a second lawsuit in the courts, claiming Apple infringed on its patents with iMessage and security features. It's made up of patents thrown out in the judge's second appeal during the first case. We have reached out to Apple for comment. Apple isn't the only company to feel the pain of VirnetX. Microsoft has settled out of court with the patent troll twice, paying $200 million and $23 million over Skype patents.

David Gewirtz says "no". Here's why. By David Gewirtz for DIY-IT | October 3, 2016 -- 12:15 GMT (05:15 PDT) | Topic: Apple Image: David Gewirtz It's true. The iPhone 7 simply is not compelling enough to justify a three hour round trip drive to Orlando, plus whatever hell the Apple Store would want to put me through this year. Not gonna do it. No way. Last year, my wife and I bought our then-new iPhone 6s Plus phones using the Apple Upgrade Program. The offer was compelling. The Apple Upgrade Program allowed us to decouple our phone purchase from our wireless service. It allowed us to get an interest free loan for the purchase of the phones. But - and here was the kicker - once we owned the phones for a year (which, for us, is today), we'd be allowed to turn in the phones and upgrade to the newest model, without any cost or penalty. iPhone 7 review Incredibly fast and powerful, with improved low-light camera Is Apple pushing the smartphone forward, or only doing enough to get by? Read More Having been stuck with phones that started to feel old about six months into ownership for many two-year cycles, this seemed like a heck of a deal. Of course we were going to want the new iPhone 7 when it came out. It was a tick (meaning, a major upgrade) on Apple's normal tick-tock release update pattern. The iPhone 7 is a bit of a big deal. It's got that extra zoom lens camera on the back of the phone. Apple's new portrait feature is in beta, but it's still an interesting expansion of a smartphone camera system. Also, the A10 fusion processor is a nice jump in speed. Plus, of course, the opportunity to lose the incredibly useful and well-entrenched headphone jack helps new iPhone 7 owners feel like they get to live in the future. I can't make myself care. I'm a bit uncomfortable about losing the headphone jack, even if they have included an adapter, because I use it every week for recording my workshop project videos. While the adapter seems to work, you never know exactly what effect that might have on sound quality. Plus, it just annoys me. The more salient fact, however, is that our iPhone 6s Plus phones are actually very darned good. We bought the 128GB models, which means we still have a good amount of capacity. I shoot 4K videos each week. They can each consume 64GB or so. But if I move them off the phone between shoots, it has plenty of room to grow. The phones are fast enough. We haven't had any performance complaints. We have the Plus models, so it's not like we're hankering for a bigger screen. The iOS 10 upgrade went well. We're not seeing any performance degradation because of the upgrade. While the new camera is interesting, it's not a DSLR. In fact, I just purchased a Canon T6i DSLR as part of an upgrade to my workshop shooting environment. In my opinion, this is preferable to settling for the not-yet-fully-baked DSLR-like camera features on the iPhone 7. I'll have a new DSLR in my hands tomorrow (yay, Prime!) to replace my ancient Digital Rebel. You can buy a brand new, decent DSLR for far less than the price of the iPhone 7. iPhone 7 Plus review Perfecting the 6s Plus with water resistance, dual cameras,lightning performance The iPhone 7 Plus is the best iPhone, as it should be. Read More There are two other factors, which I don't want to minimize, that made me decide to keep the iPhone 6s Plus. The Apple Store transaction was a hell day experience. There's nothing compelling enough in the new phone to justify what could be four or more hours of hassle. I decided to research whether or not I could upgrade online. You'll love this. When I called Apple to ask how, an Apple rep told me it probably was possible to upgrade online. The rep then suggested that I go to the store, so that one of the in-store reps could walk me through the online ordering process. So, go to the store to order online to avoid going to the store. Okay, then. Be that as it may, if we don't exercise our upgrade option now, when we finish the two years of payments on these phones, we get to keep them. By contrast, if we chose to upgrade, we'd have to turn these devices in for the new iPhone 7s. That's okay, but these are sweet pieces of kit. If we stick it out for the year, we'll have them available to be used for whatever we want. That includes having a spare 4K camera or two, using them as mini iPad minis, and more. I've always liked keepingmy out-of-service phones for their smart PDA/pocket computer capabilities. These will make nice additions to the spare gear family when their time on Verizon comes to an end. So there you go. Even though we made a big deal about getting the iPhone Upgrade Program, we're not upgrading. To be fair, the program is still a good deal (except for the in-store hassle). It's flexible enough that if we do change our minds, we can still upgrade. Upgrading will still be no more expensive than purchasing the phones outright, or through a carrier contract. Honestly, if you're buying an iPhone (whether you're planning on upgrading after a year or not), if you don't mind going through the hassle of signing up, and you can get approved, I recommend using the iPhone Upgrade Program. It's a win-win, best of both worlds, leave your options open kind of program. I'm still glad we signed up for it. Have you upgraded your phones?

By Jake Smith for iGeneration | October 3, 2016 -- 12:04 GMT (05:04 PDT) | Topic: Mobility Matthew Miller / ZDNet Apple is in talks with Foxconn-owned Sharp to supply OLED displays for Apple's future iPhone lineup, according to Bloomberg. Apple is said to be looking to partner with several suppliers for supply chain reliability. iPhone 7 Plus review Perfecting the 6s Plus with water resistance, dual cameras,lightning performance The iPhone 7 Plus is the best iPhone, as it should be. Read More The deal is said to depend on Sharp's ability to produce the displays, and it's not clear what other specifics are being hashed out in negotiations. On Friday, Sharp announced an investment of 57.4 billion yen ($566 million) for OLED production facilities to start output by June 2018. Foxconn, a major smartphone manufacturer for Apple and others, took over Sharp in a deal last month. Apple has been previously rumored to launch an OLED display for the 2017 version of the iPhone, producing sharper colors and a more flexible display than Apple's current offerings.

FOXSPORTS New York Giants: Keys to Beating the Minnesota Vikings By Patricia Traina/FanSided via NFL Spin Zone Oct 3, 2016 at 8:00a ET 0 Shares Aug 12, 2016; East Rutherford, NJ, USA; New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham (13) looks on in the first half at MetLife Stadium. Mandatory Credit: William Hauser-USA TODAY Sports The New York Giants begin a challenging two-game road stretch starting with a visit to Minnesota, a place that hasn’t been kind to them as of late History hasn’t exactly been on the side of the New York Giants (2-1), who take on the undefeated Minnesota Vikings on Monday Night Football. For starters, the Giants are 23-26-1 overall on Monday night, a mark that includes a 15-27-1 road record. They’ve been involved in some lopsided games against the Vikings dating back to 2009, includinga 44-7 Vikings win at Minnesota, and the most recent one being a 49-17 loss last year (also at Minnesota). Speaking of Minnesota, the Giants have not won a road game against the Vikings since 2004, when they emerged with a 34-13 victory. (Note: The Giants did win a road game “at Minnesota” 21-3 in 2010. However, that game had been moved to Detroit after the old Metrodome’s roof collapsed under the weight of a snowstorm.) Must Read: NFL Power Rankings Week 5: Where Do the Giants Stand? History aside, this is a new Giants era led by a new head coach and the more pressing question is going to be just how resilient this group really is after suffering such a devastating loss last week to Washington, a game that the Giants literally gave away thanks to sloppy play and turnovers. “You just go back to what got us here in the first place, go back to the basics,” said offensive lineman Justin Pugh when asked how the Giants can avoid falling into a rut. Let’s take a look at some of the key questions the Giants will need to answer in order to have a fighting chance. Next: Bring in Da Noise Bruce Kluckhohn-USA TODAY Sports How will New York Handle the Crowd Noise? Loud stadiums can never be a good thing for a visiting team, and certainly not for a team whose quarterback tends to tweak the play and protection calls right up until the last possible minute. Therein lies one of several challenges for Eli Manning and the offense, to get lined up and to all move on the same snap count despite what’s sure to be eardrum splitting noise.

I don’t know if you can get any louder than that building there.” To prepare for the expected noise levels, the Giants worked inside their field house last week where they cranked up recordings of crowd noise to the highest possible volume. They also put a focus on hand signals and silent counts, the latter being “like it’s another play, another scheme, in the offense” according to McAdoo. If all that preparation doesn’t work for a Giants team that is coming off 11 penalties at home the prior week, it could be a long night for New York. Next: The Dreaded Injury Report Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports Who’s In and Who’s Out? The Giants brought all their injured players with them to Minnesota with the exception of safety Nat Berhe (concussion). The team has already declared defensive tackle Robert Thomas (illness) and safety Darian Thompson (foot) out, so we know they won’t be playing. However, the three biggest question marks—cornerbacks Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie (groin) and Eli Apple (hamstring), and running back Rashad Jennings (thumb)—will all be in the building Monday night. Will any of those three play? Let’s start with the defensive backs since the Giants are rather thin going into this game at both corner and safety. The early feeling is that Apple probably won’t dress for this game, but there is a remote possibility that Rodgers-Cromartie might dress and serve as an emergency type of player. The Giants, remember, did not hold their weekly workouts until literally a couple of hours before their chartered flight to Minnesota. If one or both Rodgers-Cromartie and Apple were that bad, they probably would have found a way to get the open workouts in much earlier in the week, especially considering they had an extra day in which to prepare. McAdoo said last week that neither Rodgers-Cromartie nor Apple have to practice in order to play in the game, a stark contrast to the practice former head coach Tom Coughlin used to have. Given that Rodgers-Cromartie is a bit more versatile in the defense—he can play outside and in the slot—and, given that he seemed to be moving much better Friday during the part of practice open to the media, there is a small chance he could dress for this game unless he suffered a setback during the Saturday practice. Assuming the worst, the best guess is that Leon Hall and Andrew Adams will rotate at free safety depending on the personnel grouping, with Trevin Wade getting the start at cornerback. Next: Battle of the Pit Sep 18, 2016; East Rutherford, NJ, USA; New York Giants defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul (90) celebrates a sack of New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees (9) during the first half at MetLife Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Ed Mulholland-USA TODAY Sports Can They Win the Matchup in the Pit? The Giants offensive line vs. the Vikings defensive line is a scary matchup, especially after that Minnesota unit made the Carolina offensive line look like Swiss cheese the week before. On the other side, the Giants defensive line against the Vikings offensive line is a better match-up and is one they have to win. Right defensive end Olivier Vernon probably has his best matchup of the year against second-year man T.J. Clemmings. Vernon has been disruptive thus far, but the sacks haven’t really come for him just yet. This weekend could change all that—Vernon has a lightning-fast first step which should give Clemmings some headaches. You could say this every week for the Giants and most teams, but winning in the trenches will be pivotal. However, that’s even more of the case on Monday Night Football as the Vikings offer a test on both sides of the ball in that regard. Next: Airing it Out Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports Will They Open Things Up? Despite having a much better receiving corps in Odell Beckham Jr., Victor Cruz, and Sterling Shepard, the Giants have only completed passes to those three players 46  times out of quarterback Eli Manning’s 76 pass completions. Compare that to the fact that Manning has completed 24 passes to the trio of Shane Vereen and tight ends Larry Donnell and Will Tye. To further break down those numbers, the 24 pass completions to Vereen, Donnell and Tye are more than those completed to Beckham (19), Shepard (16), and Cruz (11). If the receivers are the Giants’ strength and the pass blocking is there, those numbers need to change. The question, though, is whether the offensive line will be able to give Manning the time he needs to wait for the receivers to get into their patterns before he has to make the throw. One thing the Giants might want to try doing more of is running short slants. The slant has been pretty much open for the Giants this year, especially with Sterling Shepard. So it might behoove the Giants to take the old Vince Lombardi approach of continuing to do what’s worked until the opponent finds a way to stop it. Next: And the Magic 8 Ball Says the Winner Will Be... Jeff Hanisch-USA TODAY Sports Prediction: Minnesota 27, Giants 21 The Giants injuries on defense are stirring up far too many memories of last year, when they scrambled to fill holes with guys who probably weren’t ideal fits. Talent level aside, it’s all about chemistry, and the concerns in the defensive secondary in particular are likely to be too much to overcome. Coming up against a well-coached Vikings team, New York will be tested in most facets of the game. They have the talent to compete, surely. However, the question is always whether this team will play to their potential or falter far too often. Next: Odell Beckham Jr.: Let the Man Live It won’t be a blowout or a lopsided win for the Vikings as I think the Giants offense will keep them in the game. But the state of the secondary is worrisome. Thus, the home team looks like they’ll be walking out of Monday Night Football the victors.

However it seems that Apple might not be the focus of the ire of consumers in the future because it is possible that many other Android OEMs could soon be following suit. The USB Implementers Forum has recently published its Device Class 3.0 specification, and for those wondering what this means, it means that manufacturers now have a standard in which they are able to send audio signals through USB-C ports ranging from PCs to phones. In some ways it reminds us of how keyboards and mice used to connect via the PS/2 port, but that has changed as USB is now the standard connectivity. With this new audio standard, manufacturers are now given the choice as to whether or not they want to use this as a new means of sending audio signals, which also means that they could eventually start getting rid of the headphone jack as well. That being said, it remains to be seen if manufacturers will indeed embrace this standard. But like we said, Apple isn’t the first. We’ve seen other companies such as Motorola remove the headphone jack too, and there have been some rumblings that Samsung could follow suit with the 2017’s Galaxy S8, but until then we guess only time will tell.

This is a handy feature for those moments when you wish to view the display in a subtle manner without fully turning on the screen. Watch our video overview inside to see it in action. The feature, which is officially labeled Wake Screen on Crown Up in the General → Wake Screen section of the Watch app preferences, is only available to Series 2 owners. The Digital Crown wake feature can be toggled via the Watch app preferences, and can be used in concert or separately from the traditional Wake Screen on Wrist Raise functionality. Turning the Digital Crown up while the Apple Watch screen is off will incrementally display the contents of the screen. Turning the Digital Crown down after partially awakening the screen will dim the screen incrementally until it’s off. If you wake the Apple Watch screen slightly using the Digital Crown, the screen will automatically dim and shut off by itself. If you wake the screen fully by turning the Digital Crown all the way up until maximum brightness is achieved, then the Apple Watch screen will remain on like normal. Video walkthrough Subscribe to 9to5Mac’s YouTube channel for more videos Imagine, for example, yourself in dark movie theatre. Instead of turning on the Apple Watch screen full blast with a wrist raise or tap, attracting unnecessary attention in the process, you can use the Digital Crown to peek at the screen’s contents in a much more subtle manner. Apple Watch Series 2 owners have a new way to wake the screen   Time Travel One of the side effects of the new Wake Screen on Crown Up functionality is that Time Travel, a feature that debuted in watchOS 2, is no longer enabled by default. Time Travel allows users to go back or forward in time on the watch face to see information pertaining to that particular time. Time Travel is now disabled by default If you wish to re-enable Time Travel, open the Watch app, and while on the My Watch tab, tap Clock and enable the Time Travel switch. You can still use the Digital Crown to wake the screen up while Time Travel is enabled, but if you keep turning the Digital Crown in an effort to fully wake the screen, Time Travel will eventually be invoked.

The capability was included in iOS 10 when it went into beta, but now Apple has officially launched Search Ads and opened them up for any developer to purchase. On a new webpage, Apple guides developers through the process of purchasing Search Ads and offers retails as to the benefits of them. For one, Apple says that over 65 percent of app downloads via the App Store come from search results, so putting your app at the top with a Search Ad gives an advantage. Apple also touts the ease of using Search Ads, saying that they can be set up in “just a few easy steps,” while also noting that they offer full developer control. Finally, Apple promotes that Search Ads offer stringent privacy and content controls, meaning they are safe for everyone. Additionally, Apple is offering $100 in Search Ads credit to new users, allowing everyone to briefly try the benefits. Ads in App Store search went live with iOS 10 beats over the summer. Throughout the period of beta testing, Search Ads were free of charge for developers that opted-in and helped Apple test the initiative. You can get started with Search Ads on Apple’s website. The capability  is still rolling out, so if you can’t quite complete the process, keep trying. Search Ads is an efficient and easy way to help people discover your app on the App Store for iPhone and iPad in the U.S. The App Store is the primary place where people come to find apps. In fact, over 65% of downloads come directly from a search on the App Store.+ Put your app at the top of relevant search results and connect customers directly to download in one tap. You don’t need to be a marketing expert. Set up in just a few easy steps, and control as much as you want with budgeting tools, audience refinement, and detailed insights. Designed to give users a safe search experience, Search Ads sets a new standard for delivering relevant ads while respecting user privacy. Learn what is and isn’t acceptable when using Search Ads.

The interview focused mainly on Springsteen’s new memoir “Born to Run,” which was released earlier this week. Apple Stores, especially in flagship locations like SoHo, have long held events but it’s interesting to see Eddy Cue moderate an interview. Cue himself is a big music fan, so that likely influenced the choice. Additionally, Apple Music head honcho Jimmy Iovine was also in attendance. Iovine came up a few times during the interview, with Springsteen joking that Iovine, who helped produce much of Springsteen’s work, “stayed awake most of the time” during the recording process. “Jimmy did well,” Springsteen said. Other topics covered during the interview include a discussion of Springsteen’s family life, the early days of making albums like Born to Run, what music he listens to now (notorious Apple basher Kanye West makes the cut), and cars. No, not the Apple Car, but Springsteen’s love for including cars in his lyrics. Interestingly, the SoHo appearance was live streamed on Facebook, not Apple Music or Beats 1. Although the interview focused primarily on Springsteen’s new book, such a high-profile interview seems like something Apple would have wanted on Beats 1. Nevertheless, the full video of the interview can be seen below. Springsteen’s new book is available now. Bruce Springsteen at the Apple Store in SoHo!

A Monday doesn’t seem particularly likely, and the ‘multiple sources’ cited are apparently just anonymous emails, but sometime around that date seems more likely than not. Logic dictates that a new OS update will be required for these new machines and if they were ready late September/early October, Apple would have added them to the September event. Additionally, Apple is known for its late October launches, having had one in October four of the past five years (skipping last year) and it wants to have its channel full of inventory for the runup to the holidays in November.  So October is a safe guess for upcoming products… IHS Securities – known for its cost-focused teardowns of Apple kit – also predicted recently that we’d be seeing a new 13-inch MacBook Air alongside the new MacBook Pro machines, supporting an earlier Bloomberg report suggesting a new iMac and 5k display (yes please!) at the same time. MacRumors also says that its ‘understanding’ is that ‘the company’s current development work on macOS 10.12.1 focused largely on preparing the operating system to support the updated hardware’s new features.’ Apple will of course need to ensure that macOS Sierra supports the two rumored hardware additions to the upcoming MacBook Pro range … We’re expecting the 2016 MacBook Pro to feature an OLED touchscreen in place of the physical function keys. Leaked images appear to show space for this bar, along with four USB-C ports. There appears to be support for my own theory that the touchscreen bar will be able to offer application-specific shortcuts as well as access to the universal controls currently offered by the function keys. The other significant new hardware feature we’re expecting is a Touch ID power button. This is likely to offer support for Apple Pay on the web, which currently requires handoff to an iPhone, as well as unlocking the Mac itself. We’ve already seen clues in macOS Sierra in terms of support for both features. We’re expecting the new machines to feature Intel Skylake processors, and an option for AMD’s Polaris GPUs. Apple has also been exploring the possibility of removing the headphone socket, but it seems unlikely it will do so this year, In terms of form-factor, the new MacBook Pro is pegged to have a smaller footprint and be thinner than existing models, but not to use the same wedge shape as the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Air machines. We’ve seen a number of concepts showing how the new machines might look. I’m not expecting to get everything I want from the new machine, but will almost certainly bite the bullet and downgrade from my 17-inch beast to get the latest tech. What about you? Based on what you’ve seen and heard so far, are you planning to buy a new MacBook Pro next month? Take our poll and share your thoughts in the comments.

My iCloud Photo Library is up to 14,633 photos and 1,261 videos and growing. Almost every one of those were captured with an iPhone so its camera matters to me. Last year’s iPhone 6s introduced Live Photos which I absolutely love. (This from November is just one of my favorites; you can view it on the web thanks to Tumblr’s new Live Photo feature). This year includes Portrait mode on the iPhone 7 Plus which intelligently applies a blur effect over backgrounds on still shots. Portrait mode photos often look like they were shot on dedicated cameras, not smartphones. The feature requires the dual camera system on the iPhone 7 Plus to work and is only available in beta on iOS 10.1 beta for now. Apple wants to fine tune Portrait mode’s performance before it hits primetime, and there are a few things we can already learn about it through testing. I’m a little late to the game here because my 256GB Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus only just arrived yesterday, but I got the chance to try out Portrait mode over the weekend on my wife’s iPhone and a lot more yesterday and today. Benjamin and I discussed it briefly on this week’s 9to5Mac Happy Hour podcast, and I have a few more points to make after further testing. First, people are really impressed by Portrait mode shots when you share them on social media and suspect they came from the iPhone 7 Plus and not a dedicated camera. Photos in Instagram are reduced to such a low resolution and so much detail is lost that flaws in the blur effect are harder to see (example). I shared a few shots on Facebook last night too, for example, and my colleague Dan from 9to5Toys had to verify they were from iPhone 7 Plus. He described the samples as absolutely gorgeous with no difference between nice point-and-shoot cameras. Depth effect photos are easily sharable and people instantly appreciate their quality. Live Photos, on the other hand, have a slight learning curve and generally only play nice in specific apps. Live Photos were also harder to edit until later software updates. Depth effect photos work with all of the usual editing tools including cropping, rotating, applying filters, and changing color/light/B&W levels. You can’t remove the depth effect after you capture the shot, but by default the Camera app captures a regular photo with the depth effect photo so you can choose which to keep. Using the depth effect feature is pretty simple too. My wife tried it before I got the chance and followed the tips in the Camera app to increase the lighting and find the right distance and focus. It’s a bit odd to see instructions like this in an Apple app, especially in the Camera app, but they’re effective at taking anyone form now really knowing about the feature to taking excellent shots with the blur effect. The way blur effect is artificially applied makes me think of Photoshop and users who edit similar effects in post after a photoshoot. Except with the iPhone 7 Plus, you don’t need Photoshop or professional editing skills. Just follow the guidance in the Camera app and shoot great photos. Move closer to or further from your subject, make sure the lighting is decent, and you see the effect in real time. I’ve noticed already that sometimes I find it hard to choose between the original photo and the blur effect version. My advice is keep both if they’re both good in certain instances. Other times either one or the other is clearly superior. Apple’s Photos app also creates a dedicated album called Depth Effect that only shows photos taken with Portrait mode if you want to only see the new style images. Depth effect has the added benefit of blurring out unwanted background when you shoot. Sometimes the background is exactly what you want. It puts the photo in context. Proves that you were actually at the Grand Canyon! But sometimes the background includes an overflowing trashcan or a pedestrian making a funny face. Blur effect can fight the photo bombers. Portrait mode is a beta feature within a beta operating system, so not everything is perfect yet. Apple can fine tune a lot in software so the feature will likely continue to get better over time, but it’s already quite impressive. I’ve noticed that the Portrait mode has a difficult time properly applying the blur effect when capturing the side of someone’s face. This likely varies on the environment, but in my testing the outline of the face lacked the blur effect. You see it in preview, though, so you don’t waste your time with a bad capture. The more complex the outline of the subject, the harder it is to capture correctly. Because the blur effect relies heavily on a subject being within a certain distance in specific lighting, Portrait mode just isn’t ideal for capturing motion. Portrait mode is optimized to work with people, but it can be difficult to convince a three-year-old to pose still. This was especially clear when snapping my kid swinging at the park. Portrait mode just doesn’t work well with the back and forth fast movement. Burst mode or Live Photos will work better but you’ll miss the blurred background. (Side note on Live Photos with iPhone 7 Plus: switching between 1x and 2x optical zoom is totally captured like other motion so there’s a cool effect to try. Here’s an example.) Finally, Portrait mode does not work with Live Photos. You have to pick one or the other; even the normal photo that Portrait mode can capture isn’t a Live Photo. This is certainly a limitation of the current hardware so I don’t expect this to change. I’ve used my iPhone 6s to shoot photos in some instances when I might have been better off using my Nikon 1 because I love the motion and sound captured with Live Photos. Now that same question of Live Photos or better still photos is back, but this time all on my iPhone. Maybe the iPhone 10 will do it all! Overall, I’m very pleased with what Portrait mode has to offer. I’m also eager to see how much better the already good feature improves throughout the beta and in future software updates. If you rely on your iPhone for most photography and you capture a lot of photos like me, it’s a seriously compelling reason to opt for the iPhone 7 Plus over the smaller model. 1x and 2x optical zoom without using Portrait mode isn’t so bad either: Guides iPhone 7 Apple's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were announced on 7th September 2016 View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple Apple ordered to pay $302 million in FaceTime damages to patent troll... Apple Apple ordered to pay $302 million in FaceTime damages to patent troll VirnetX By Bindu Nair - Apple has been ordered to pay $302.4 million in damages to notorious patent troll VirnetX for infringing on the latter’s patents related to services like FaceTime. This marks the third time the tech behemoth has been dragged to court over the matter. Apple’s troubles began in 2010 when VirnetX sued the company for violating 4 of its patents. The court had initially instructed the brand to cough up $368.2 million. However, this ruling was partially overturned because of discrepancies in how the judge instructed the jury on calculating damages. VirnetX came back swinging earlier this year, managing to get an even bigger $625.6 million payout. This was once again dismissed because the judge in charge felt the 50 repeated references to the earlier case could have confused jurors. Accordingly, he thought the circumstances were unfair to Apple. Also Read: Apple sued for $10bn by man who says he invented the iPhone in 1992 VirnetX didn’t give up the fight though. It’s now won against Apple yet again. The $302.4 million fine could potentially climb even higher if it is found to have willfully infringed the patents in the next round of court hearings. To make matters worse, the handset maker also has to contend with a second lawsuit over iMessage and newer versions of its security features. Apple has gone on record before to express its sentiments against patent trolls like VirnetX, claiming that it’s constantly been targeted more than any other company. The second has a storied history with such lawsuits, going against industry bigwigs like Cisco and Microsoft in the past.

The tiny snag is that most of them aren’t much cop. Why? Well some misunderstand how a wearable is best used, and demand you spend far too long with your wrist in front of your face; others misfire on ergonomics or usability. Others briefly impress, but that’s not good enough for us. We want apps that are clever and well-designed but also that we return to on a regular basis. That, then, is what this list is all about: the best Apple Watch apps we’re actively using. Just Press Record (£2.29) The idea behind Just Press Record is to make capturing voice memos insanely simple. On Apple Watch, the app starts off as a massive microphone button. Prod it to start recording. When you’re done, the recording lurks on your Apple Watch until it next connects to your iPhone, at which point it transfers. Easy. Using the Apple Watch app, you can also peruse and playback recent recordings. The only snag is there’s no background playback, so it’s best for shortish memos. Still, that’s a small niggle when using it makes you feel like you’re living in a trashy sci-fi flick. Download Just Press Record eBay (£free) The eBay iPhone app is so good these days that we rarely venture on to the desktop site, and so it’s great to see the smarts of the world’s largest car-boot sale extending to Apple Watch. The pared-down interface enables you to check your activity, watched and bid-on items, and the status of whatever you’re currently selling. You can thrill at the amount of cash you’ve made over the past month, and also sneakily bid on an imminently ending auction of a limited Lego minifig when you should be paying attention in a meeting. Or so we’ve been told. Download eBay Drafts (£3.99) Weirdly, Notes has yet to make its way across to Apple Watch, but fortunately Drafts ably fills that particular void. The app enables you to capture new notes by dictation, which are then hurled into your Drafts inbox. Alternatively, you can append or prepend whatever you input to an existing note – for example, to update a diary or shopping list. If you don’t fancy talking at your Apple Watch, you can use the new watchOS 3 Scribble feature to write notes instead. Also, your inbox is browsable and your notes are readable on you Apple Watch, saving you from having to keep heading to your iPhone. Download Drafts Related The 10 best smartwatches in the world right now Fantastical (£2.29) It feels a bit odd to recommend an app primarily for one feature, but here we are. For reasons beyond us, Calendar on Apple Watch still lacks the means to create new entries. By contrast, Fantastical’s been able to do so for ages. Much like the iPhone version, Fantastical for Apple Watch has some natural-language smarts, meaning you can say something like “lunch with Mark next Wednesday at 12 for 2 hours” and the event will be correctly created. Beyond that… well, it’s a calendar for your Apple Watch, although a good-looking and snappy one. Download Fantastical 2 PCalc (£7.99) If you’ve fond memories of calculator watches, you’re probably a) quite old and b) not going to be convinced about using a calculator app on Apple Watch. Because frankly, doing so is a mite fiddly. Still, PCalc is the best of them. The buttons are fairly chunky, and although operators lurk on a second screen, accessing them is fast. The app also includes a handy third screen for calculations. It defaults to tips, but you can spin the Digital Crown to get at units for all kinds of things. Note that freebie PCalc Lite offers similar functionality to massive cheapskates. Download PCalc Cicker (£free) We've seen an app recommended for one feature - and now this is an app that only does one thing: keep count. Clicker gives you a big number on the screen that increments every time you tap. Beyond that, you can clear the number or subtract one from it. You can also keep track of your counting by way of a complication. If that feels a bit too limited, Tally 2 is a useful alternative, with multiple counters and the means to define custom steps. But its lack of a complication feels like a missed opportunity on Apple Watch. Download Clicker Twitterrific (£free + £1.49 IAP) The official Twitter app is an oddball, giving you access to your entire feed and current trends. Believe us, you don’t want to plough through a Twitter feed using a tiny screen strapped to your wrist. Twitterrific is smarter, concentrating on notifications. These can be activated individually in the iPhone app, meaning you get a ding on your wrist when something you consider important happens: a direct message, a new follower, or, if you’re a bit self-obsessed, when someone favourites one of your tweets. The app enables you to respond appropriately to notifications, replying to a message or following back a new follower. You'll need to shell out £1.49 to make these features come alive on your Watch, but trust us: it's worth it. Download Twitterrific YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE iCheapskate: the 35 best free apps for iPhone and iPad CARROT Weather (£2.99 + IAP) We get the thinking behind Apple’s Weather app, which uses a clock face to show how the weather will change over the next 10 hours or so, but it doesn’t scan too well. Several third-party apps do better, but CARROT has become our firm favourite. The design is smart and clear, displaying current conditions and any imminent rainfall. Scroll and you get the week’s forecast; tap on an item and you get more details. The CARROT apps are also underpinned by a malevolent AI, which hates humans. It helpfully states that it “sucks to be you” if it’s about to pour down, and whimsically mulls that it’s “a bit moony” on cold, clear nights. The only downside is having to splash out £1.49 for an Apple Watch complication, and a further £2.29 if you want premium features like alerts, notifications, and complication customisation. If that all feels a bit much, Dark Sky's good too, and offers a complication for nowt. Download CARROT Weather 1Password (£free + £7.99 IAP) Our favourite app for keeping passwords and other important information secure, 1Password proves handy on Apple Watch too. Sensibly, it doesn’t attempt to send your vault’s entire contents to your wrist; instead, you activate individual items, such as a credit cart, website login, or a note. These then show up as bright, tappable buttons inside the Apple Watch app. Naturally, you might have security concerns, but 1Password for Apple Watch can be secured by a PIN. You can also force-quit the app after use, to make doubly sure your information isn’t accessible should someone pilfer your Apple Watch, your iPhone and presumably also your finger to crack Touch ID. (To do this, click-hold the side button, and when the power screen appears, click-hold the Digital Crown.) Note that although the iPhone app is initially free to install, you'll need the £7.99 Pro Features in-app purchase to unlock Apple Watch functionality. Download 1Password Cheatsheet (£free) If you don’t need the security of 1Password but still fancy quick access to bite-sized notes (such as Wi-Fi passwords and door combinations), Cheatsheet’s an excellent download. Each tiny information nugget comprises a piece of text and custom icon, and cheats can be synced from the iPhone app. You can also edit and create new cheats directly on Apple Watch (by way of dictation), along with using one of these notes as a complication. Just don’t make it your credit card PIN, eh? Download Cheatsheet BBC News (£free) The problem with most news apps on Apple Watch is they try to be too clever, when all you really want is to rifle through some headlines. Most have sluggish page-swipe interfaces that get old fast. BBC News understands such problems and avoids them entirely, hence why it’s the news app we keep returning to. You get headlines for the top stories, a user-defined ‘My News’ list you build in the iPhone app, and ‘most read’. Tap a headline and you get a synopsis under a tiny photo. Using Handoff, you can continue reading the current item on your iPhone. Download BBC News Citymapper (£free) On the iPhone, Citymapper is fantastic, giving you point-to-point directions for a range of supported cities, and location-based public transport details and alerts. The Apple Watch app is equally good, offering rapid access to favourite places, and information about nearby trains, buses, ferries and more. Journey steps are clearly outlined, providing all the assistance you need, such as times of upcoming trains, stops on your route, and tiny maps that link through to Apple’s Maps app. We just wish it could somehow magically work for every town and city in the world rather than just the handful of (mainly) capitals it's currently set up for. Download Citymapper Find Near Me (£free) On the iPhone, Find Near Me is a strange one — perhaps the most powerful of the simple freebie apps for finding local amenities and stores, but, boy, is it ugly. On Apple Watch, though, the tiny display has clearly forced the developer to simplify and the result is excellent: clear buttons to access a category, and then a results list with names and directions. Tap an item and you get further details, including reviews for restaurants and the means to get directions by foot, bike or car. Handily, there’s Siri search integration, too, for when the predefined categories don’t cover where you want to go. Download Find Near Me Overcast (£free + optional IAP) Given the convenience factor of the Apple Watch being at the end of your arm, it follows that plenty of ‘app remotes’ now lurk on the App Store. Overcast is an interesting case, because the developer made an Apple Watch remote to control his excellent iPhone podcast app, decided it was rubbish, and rethought it from scratch. The result is a massive improvement, based around a static ‘now playing’ screen, and using Force Touch to access the app’s effects (smart speed; voice boost) and your full list of podcasts. Download Overcast Shazam (£free) Shazam is an app that elicited squeaks of joy from onlookers upon its arrival on smartphones. You’d waggle your smartphone about, and it’d figure out what music was playing nearby. Now, that’s old hat, but on a smartwatch… Yeah, it’s still a lot of fun. During testing, the app proved remarkably reliable, didn’t miss a trick regarding selling you things (you can use Handoff to buy the current track in iTunes on your iPhone), and for many songs there are live lyrics. If people didn’t think you periodically peering at your wrist when notifications arrive was annoying enough, just imagine how thrilled they’ll be with you bellowing something awful by Coldplay when you’ve had one too many drinks but can still just about focus on your wrist.
