The jailed Death Row Records founder claims Andre "Dr. Dre" Young wanted him dead to get out from under an alleged lifetime management agreement specifying Knight should get 30% of the millions Young made selling his Beats headphones business to Apple and producing "Straight Outta Compton" for Universal. Knight claims Young first hired a gunman to shoot him inside the 1Oak nightclub in West Hollywood in August 2014 and then funded a follow-up armed assault at Tam's burgers in Compton in January 2015. "Dr. Dre did it. Andre Young is responsible for both crimes," Knight's new lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court states. Suge Knight's harsh jail rules blamed on 'massive scandal' Suge Knight (l.) is suing Dr. Dre (r.) claiming the rapper-turned-mogul hired hitmen to kill him. "Serious attempts on Knight's life began only after Young was paid through Apple on May 28, 2014," the lawsuit claims. "Given that Dre has had zero interaction with Suge since leaving Death Row Records in 1996, we hope that Suge's lawyer has lots of malicious prosecution insurance," an attorney for Dr. Dre states. The new civil filing from Knight's lawyer Thaddeus Culpepper is a cross-complaint in a wrongful death lawsuit brought by the widow of Terry Carter. A February 1996 Vibe cover shows Snoop Dog, Dr. Dre (top center) and Suge Knight (below center) with Snoop Dogg (l.) and Tupac. Knight is now behind bars on charges he murdered Carter and attempted to kill Cle "Bone" Sloan when he hit the gas on his truck and ran over both men during the confrontation outside Tam's. Ice Cube and Dr. Dre reportedly cleared in wrongful death suit Knight has pleaded not guilty, claiming the men were armed and threatened his life. His new lawsuit names Young, Universal and Apple as respondents, alleging they reached a "mutually agreeable scheme" that would result in Young somehow severing ties with Knight. Knight claims Young recruited Sloan and another man named Dwayne "Knob" Johnson to go after him. His lawsuit alleges Young employed the men as technical advisors on "Straight Outta Compton" but paid them out of his own accounts for the alleged hit. Suge Knight's robbery trial postponed till after murder case "Young did not wish to share another penny with Knight," the new lawsuit states. "Young wished (for) an overall solution to this apparent, constant Suge Knight dilemma." Knight has pleaded not guilty to the deadly Jan. 29, 2015 hit and run, claiming the men were armed and threatened his life. (Damian Dovarganes/AP) The new court paperwork alleges checks from at least one of Young's accounts paid Sloan $300,000 and "Knob" $20,000 weeks before the incident at Tam's. "Knight is informed and believes that Apple, Universal and Young agreed that payments for the armed assault were to be made by Young so as not to implicate Universal or Apple," the cross complaint states. "Knight is also informed and believes payments from one or any or all of the accounts were used to pay the armed gunmen that shot Knight seven times at 1Oak nightclub on August 14, 2014," it states. Judge denies rap mogul Suge Knight murder-trial witness info It claims a man identified as "T-Money" told a Sheriff's investigator "that he was paid by Young to kill Knight (at 1Oak)." Knight claims Universal "was at least aware that part of Sloan's tactics in addressing the Knight dilemma would involve armed assault." Knight, 50, previously accused Young of involvement in the 1Oak shooting in a court filing last April that blamed Knight's stringent jail restrictions on a "massive scandal and cover-up."

In court papers obtained by TMZ, Knight alleges that Dre did not want to pay him his 30 per cent stake in Beats by Dre after he sold the company to Apple.  Knight claims that he was owed the money because of a lifetime contract between him and Dre, but that Apple did not want him associated with the brand because he is currently on trial and facing a murder charge in the death of Terry Carter. He is asking for $300million in his lawsuit, claiming that Dre made $1billion in the deal with Apple. Dre's lawyer said in a statesmen after Knight filed his lawsuit: 'Given that Dre has had zero interaction with Suge since leaving Death Row Records in 1996, we hope that Suge's lawyer has lots of malicious prosecution insurance.'  Scroll down for video Suge Knight (above in 2007) claims in a new lawsuit that Dr. Dre twice hired a hit man to have him killed Knight claims that Dre (above) did not want to pay him the 30 per cent share he was owed after the rapper sold Beats by Dre to Apple Knight claims that the first time Dre tried to have him killed was in September 2014, when a gunman opened fire at a MTV Video Music Award hosted by Chris Brown at 1OAK in Los Angeles. He was shot multiple times in the abdomen, chest and arm and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department later said through a spokesperson that the gunman appeared to target Knight. In his lawsuit however Knight claims that a man named T-Money who was later questioned by the police said that he was hired by Dre to target Knight.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Jared Fogle's wife sues Subway claiming the sandwich company...

Share this article Share 170 shares No arrests have been made in the case two years later, and earlier this year Knight sued party host Brown for failing to provide adequate security at the venue. That lawsuit also accuses Brown of having gang ties, as well as a 'well-documented track record of hosting events and/or parties in which violence frequently erupted.' Knight claims that just a few months later, in January, Dre again tried to have him murdered, this time by Cle 'Bone' Sloan.  That incident occurred on the same day that Knight drove over Carter, killing the man. Knight has claimed he only acted in self-defense however, trying to escape from Sloan.  'I f***** him up!' Sloan, a former gang member, told the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department shortly after he too was hit by Knight's car. Sloan reportedly admitted to attacking Knight, the co-founder of Death Row records, as he lay in a hospital bed suffering from multiple head wounds.  In his lawsuit, Knight claims that Dre paid Sloan $300,000 to try and have him killed that day. Knight is also suing Apople and Tam's, the fast food restaurant where the incident with Sloan and Carter occurred in January of last year.

Follow TechnoBuffalo The Apple Watch hasn’t yet achieved iPhone-like success like Apple hoped it would. There’s no real pressing need for a smart watch like there is for a smartphone, and sales of the Apple Watch are making this glaringly obvious. According to market research firm IDC, Apple Watch sales plummetted 71.6-percent in the July to September timeframe compared to last year. Apple sold 1.1 million watches in 2016, down from the 3.9 million it sold in the same period in 2015. There are many factors to this, starting with the lack of refresh of the Apple Watch. Originally announced in September 2014 and released in April 2015, the flagship wearable for Apple wasn’t updated for 16 months, or 24 months when you compare that to when awareness for the watch began to grow. The newly announced Apple Watch Series 2 should help boost sales in a market Apple dominates with a 41.3-percent share. Following hot on the heels of Apple—but still a ways off —is Garmin, Samsung, Lenovo, and Pebble, which each sold fewer than 700,000 units in the timeframe.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Releases iOS 10.1 with 'Portrait Mode' that delivers the All-New Professional Level 'Bokeh' Effect | Main | Apple Granted 55 Patents Today Covering Wearable Displays, Inductive Charging, Face Recognition & More » October 24, 2016 LG's Big Gamble on a Modular Smartphone Dies while Samsung Continues to seek an iPhone Killing Form Factor   The top reason that Apple's iPhone 6 mania swept the globe back in 2014 was because they introduced their first phablet to go toe-to-toe with Samsung who pioneered that category. Samsung laughed at Apple's late entry into this category believing that they owned that segment lock, stock and barrel. They made the very same mistake that Steve Ballmer did when Apple's iPhone first came to market. Ballmer openly and heartedly laughed at Apple's new gadget and yet he laughs no more. While Samsung tried to play it down, the fact is that in 2014 Apple smashed South Korea's record for a foreign company selling smartphones. They took 33% market share that year, easily overtaking LG and dropping Samsung down from 60% to 46%. Samsung's smartphone sales, and more importantly profits, plummeted for two years running after the release of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. To this day Samsung's Heir Apparent was hoping that the "Galaxy Note7 would outflank the iPhone 7 and it wasn't meant to be. The Note7 was rushed to market to beat the iPhone 7 and cutting corners led to the Note7 battery crisis and demise of this year's Note smartphone; a complete derailment.   The LG G5 Modular Smartphone Dies a Painful Death   As we noted earlier, LG was the other smartphone looser in 2014/2015 when Apple's iPhone 6 mania swept the globe. In an effort to regain their place in the sun, LG also took a big gamble this year when they introduced their bold new LG 5, the "World's first smartphone with modular expandability." An idea that they borrowed from Google's failed moonshot known as 'Project Ara.'   According to the Korean press today, LG has unofficially killed their modular smartphone concept and will return to a standard smartphone structure for their 2017 G6 smartphone. Insiders say that they will be abandoning the 'Modules' framework.   The report further noted that "LG Electronics was not able to achieve results that it expected because need for modules was not really needed when people had actually used the G5. There was inconvenience in removing and attaching modules and users had to buy additional devices."   They also noted in their report that "Sales of the G5 were very low as there was a problem regarding production yield due to the more complicated module structure. Even LG Electronics admitted that the G5 was not a success and it led to huge change in executives who were responsible for development of G5."   Samsung Seeking the Holy Grail of Smartphone Designs   With the demise of Samsung's Note7 due to never ending reports of exploding phones, Samsung was trying to maintain a brave face and announced that their new Galaxy S8 would introduce dual cameras like the iPhone 7 Plus, no Home Button and the world's first 10nm processor. The also hinted that they might introduce a foldable smartphone to excite the market with. Then two weeks ago another Samsung foldable phone patent came to light with more advanced models being contemplated.   Last week a new Samsung patent surfaced at USPTO that revealed a more advanced scrollable smartphone/tablet/TV. This is Samsung's third major patent on the subject. The first two could be reviewed here and here. Their third patent which was filed in the U.S. in February 2016 and published last week illustrates a more refined idea for a scrollable device.   Samsung's patent FIGS. 12 to 15 noted below are views illustrating content being displayed on a display area as a flexible display of an electronic device is being withdrawn or retracted   Samsung's patent notes that "This type of flexible display may be used in an electronic device such as a TV, a mobile device (smartphone), tablet PC and the like." Interestingly, they place a lot of emphasis on a scrollable TV. For example, they note that "a flexible display may be mounted on a main body of a TV such that it may be withdrawable or retractable, thereby realizing a wall-mountable TV.   When the TV is turned off, the flexible display may be rolled into the main body of the TV, thereby not exposing a display area to outside or exposing only a small portion of the display area to the outside. When the TV is turned on, the flexible display may be withdrawn or retracted from the main body of the TV, exposing the display area of the flexible display to the outside.   In order to withdraw or retract the flexible display from the main body of the TV, a user's force may be used to pull the flexible display or a driver may be used configured to automatically withdraw or retract the flexible display from the main body of the TV."   Whether it's mobile and/or stationary, the marketing angle may be that either or both will relate to a next-gen television.   Also noted in the Korean tech press today was Qualcomm announcing in Korea that their next generation G5 modem would be available for smartphones either in late 2018 or 2019 in that country. Samsung and LG are expected to be able to take advantage of this first and Qualcomm talked about being downloading a 1.5GB film in just three seconds flat.   So bendable and scrollable smartphones (and other devices) are on Samsung's mind as they seek a new form factor that could provide them with a longer standing edge over Apple that they lost when the iPhone 6 Plus phablet came to be.   Will Samsung be able to find another another home run in the coming years ahead to take on Apple's iPhone or will all of their fancy patents be sold in the form of a coloring book of fantasy inventions for children? Only time will tell.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Pound trims drop as Carney signals odds of BOE cut diminishing Oil falls as Russian comments add to production accord doubts Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp U.S. stocks declined from a two-week high as mixed forecasts from industry giants and a slump in consumer confidence spurred concern over the outlook for the world’s largest economy. Oil retreated. Blue chips Caterpillar Inc. and 3M Co. dropped after cutting their estimates, outweighing optimism with United Technologies Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co.’s earnings. Apple Inc. fell in after-hours trading as it reported sliding prices for its smartphones and forecast lower-than-expected profitability over the holiday period. The pound pared losses as Bank of England Governor Mark Carney signaled that the chances of another interest-rate cut this year are diminishing. Oil sank on bets Russia won’t join OPEC to curb supply. Traders have been assessing the strength of corporate profits and the economy amid bets on a Federal Reserve hike by December. U.S. consumer confidence fell more than forecast in October as households became less upbeat about the labor market, the Conference Board said Tuesday. More than a third of S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report earnings this week, including Alphabet Inc., Coca-Cola Co., Amazon.com Inc. and Boeing Co.  "Given that we’re now in the thick of earnings season, there are going to be acute reactions nearly every day,” said Frank Cappelleri, executive director at Instinet LLC in New York. "Other than that, the price action is not materially different than what we’ve seen over the last two months. There have been multiple false starts where budding momentum has gotten cut short." Global markets have actually seen declines in volatility -- with a cross-asset gauge of price swings in equities, rates, currency and commodities down to the lowest since 2014. While risks exist, the drop in anxiety has coincided with a reduction in uncertainty when it comes to U.S. politics and policy. Hillary Clinton’s odds of victory are close to the highest on record at 86.5 percent, according to forecaster FiveThirtyEight. Likewise, investors appear to be coming to terms with the inevitability of a Federal Reserve hike in December. “Until we get something that really surprises the market, we’re going to continue in this low volatility,” said Hank Smith, who helps manage more than $6 billion as chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co. in Radnor, Pennsylvania “Neither the election nor the Fed’s rate decision have people particularly worried right now.” Stocks The S&P 500 dropped 0.4 percent to 2,143.16 at 4 p.m. in New York. The gauge has been stuck in a 64-point trading range after reaching a record in August and hasn’t climbed for three consecutive sessions in more than a month. Apple shares fell 2.3 percent to $115.55 in extended hours on Tuesday. The stock closed at $118.25 in New York regular trading. It had rallied 22 percent in the last three months. The company, which gets two thirds of revenue from the iPhone, experienced its first annual sales decline since 2001, amid waning smartphone demand. Among stocks moving on corporate news: 3M slumped after cutting the top end of its 2016 profit forecast. Caterpillar slipped after reducing its sales estimate for this year. Sherwin-Williams Co.’s disappointing results weighed on shares of Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Cos. Whirlpool Corp. tumbled after lowering its profit outlook. Under Armour Inc. sank as its forecast renewed slowdown concern. JetBlue Airways Corp. fell after reporting profit that missed estimates. Procter & Gamble and United Technologies climbed after their results beat forecasts. A two-day lull for European equities ended as Novartis AG led drugmakers down after saying its profit fell for a seventh straight quarter while Italian lenders slumped. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.4 percent, erasing an earlier advance. Miners jumped to their highest level since August 2015, tracking a rally in metal prices. Most emerging-market stocks retreated as Brazilian consumer companies fell on prospects for a slower-than-expected reduction in borrowing costs, outweighing gains in commodity producers from South Africa to China. Commodities Oil fell 1.1 percent in New York. Output cuts aren’t “an option for us,” said Russia’s envoy at OPEC, Vladimir Voronkov, according to Interfax. U.S. crude supplies probably rose 2 million barrels last week, a Bloomberg survey showed before Energy Information Administration data Wednesday. “The nonsense around the production agreement comes in and out of the market,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. “It’s coming out of oil today because of the Russian statements, which come after Iraq made it clear that they weren’t going to make a cut.” West Texas Intermediate for December delivery slipped 56 cents to $49.96 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent for December settlement dropped 67 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $50.79 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Arabica coffee, the mild-tasting bean type favored by Starbucks Corp., surged to the highest since February 2015 after Brazil’s largest producer cut its export estimate for 2016 amid rising domestic consumption and the effects of drought. Gold rallied on speculation that demand will accelerate before the Diwali religious festival in India, the world’s second-biggest buyer of the metal. Industrial metals surged as increasing profits at Chinese steelmakers and gains in global manufacturing boosted speculation that demand will improve. Currencies The pound rebounded from its lowest level since the flash crash earlier this month after Carney said there were limits to officials’ willingness to look beyond an overshoot of their inflation target. Sterling fell 0.4 percent at $1.2186, after earlier slumping 1.3 percent. “The comments by Carney do highlight that the latest sterling selloff is starting to worry policy makers as it brings closer the risk of stagflation,” said Valentin Marinov, head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at Credit Agricole SA’s corporate- and investment-banking unit in London. Bloomberg’s Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the currency against 10 major peers, fell 0.1 percent after rising to the highest in seven months. South Africa’s rand led gains in emerging markets amid a rally in metals. Russia’s ruble rose as companies lined up to make payments before a tax deadline. Chile’s peso rallied amid speculation of a change of government next year and as copper prices surged. Bonds A gauge of expected price swings in Treasuries fell to the lowest since December 2014 before the Fed meets next week as traders see a clearer outlook for monetary policy in the U.S. and abroad. "No one’s expecting anything from the Fed’s meeting next week," said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist in New York at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, one of 23 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. "People are looking for a December rate hike. Even with the presidential election, people are comfortable with rates." The benchmark U.S. 10-year note yield was little changed at 1.76 percent, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. A $26 billion two-year Treasury auction drew the weakest demand since July. Austria sold 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) of bonds due in November 2086 via banks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The sale follows this year’s century bond offerings from Belgium and Ireland, as well as 50-year deals from France, Italy and Spain, as countries take advantage of historically low interest rates to issue ultra-long debt.

Known as the CoreGraphic bug, it was discovered by security researcher Marco Grassi. It allowed hackers to create a jpeg file that used a memory bug to run code on the user's phone whenever it displayed a hacked picture.  Scroll down for video Known as the CoreGraphic bug, it was discovered by security researcher Marco Grassi, and allows hackers to create a jpeg file that used a memory bug to run code on the user's phone. HOW TO UPDATE NOW  You can make sure that you aren't at risk by updating your iOS device to iOS 10.1 as soon as possible.  To update, select Settings / General/ Software update To update your watch, select the watch app , then geneal / software update Apple confirmed the fix was available in the iOS 10.1 for iPhone 5 and later, iPad 4th generation and later and the iPod touch 6th generation and later. It also released updates for the Apple watchOS , macOS and tvOS addressing the same issue. 'A memory corruption issue was addressed through improved memory handling,' it said of its support site, warning the hack meant 'Viewing a maliciously crafted JPEG file may lead to arbitrary code execution.' Security researcher Micah Lee first spotted the update, tweeting 'Upgrade to iOS 10.1 right now.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next How man will REALLY get to the red planet : National...

Security expert Graham Cluley explained  'In simpler language, if you view a maliciously-crafted JPEG graphic (for instance, by browsing a website or opening an email) on a vulnerable iOS device, you could be allowing malicious code to execute. 'That's a nasty security bug, and now Apple has released a patch there will be surely be some criminal hackers who are interested in seeing if they can find a way of exploiting it.' Michael Horowitz, from Chicago, checks out his new iPhone 7 Plus at the Apple Store on Michigan Avenue, in Chicago. Apple's iPhone 7 Plus is getting a new camera capability: the blurring of backgrounds to focus attention on people in the foreground. Apple first announced the 'portrait mode' feature in September but it wasn't available until the company released its iOS 10.1 software update Monday.  It replicates an effect typically limited to larger cameras known as SLRs.   While SLRs accomplishes this by controlling how wide the lens opens, the iPhone uses software adjustments. Portrait mode requires an iPhone 7 Plus because it uses the phone's two lenses to sense depth.  Other iPhones have only one camera lens.  The software update will still be available for other iPhones because it also comes with bug fixes and other improvements. The update also adds a new camera capability for the iPhone 7 Plus — the blurring of backgrounds to focus attention on people or other objects in the foreground. To use the feature, slide the mode at the bottom of the camera app to 'portrait.' It's between 'photo' and 'square.' Then take a few steps back, as the feature taps the zoom on the iPhone 7 Plus's second lens, meaning images are enlarged two-fold.  The screen will guide you to move closer or farther from the subject, or in some cases, find a setting with more light.  When shooting multiple people, make sure everyone's the same distance from the camera to keep them all sharp. A customer sets up his new iPhone 7 Plus, right, as he switches from an iPhone 6 at the Apple Store on Michigan Avenue during the release of the Apple iPhone 7 and the latest Apple Watches, in Chicago. Apple is calling this depth-effect feature a beta, which means it's a work in progress. The iPhone will also save the unadjusted shots by default. Huawei's dual-lens P9 phone also has a similar feature. The update comes three days before Apple holds a product event in Cupertino, California, during which the company is expected to unveil new Mac computers. Separately, Apple announced Monday that a Nike edition of Apple Watch will come out Friday, starting at $369.  The runner-focused watch was announced in September, but no specific date had been given.

Apple today released iOS 10.1, which brings a load of changes, including Portrait Camera for the iPhone 7 Plus. According to the update release notes, the new Portrait Camera "creates a depth effect that keeps your subject sharp while creating a beautifully blurred background." This new feature, found in the Camera app in between the Photo and Square modes, shows off the power of the iPhone 7 Plus's dual-camera system. The iPhone 7 Plus has the same camera as the iPhone 7, plus a second rear camera Apple would love you to believe is a telephoto (it's not). Regardless, the new Portrait mode feature leverages both 12-megapixel cameras, plus "advanced machine learning" to create that blurred background effect. The image to the right, for instance, was shot using the iPhone 7 Plus in Portrait mode (click the photo to view it full size). "This effect, also known as 'bokeh' and previously only capable on DSLR cameras, turns the camera you carry around with you every day into an even more powerful photography tool," Apple said in a news release today. The feature is currently available in beta, and customers can "expect enhancements in future iOS updates," Apple said. In addition to Portrait mode, the iPhone 7 Plus's dual-camera system offers up to 2X optical zoom and 10X digital zoom for photos. For more, be sure to check out iPhone 7 Plus vs. iPhone 6s vs. Galaxy S7: Cameras Compared. Meanwhile, iOS 10.1 includes a slew of other changes and bug fixes for Maps, Messages, Apple Watch, and more. Maps now includes transit support for "every major train, subway, ferry, and national bus line, as well as local bus systems for Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya."

The first-generation iPod stood out with its mechanical wheel for browsing the music library and scrolling through tracks in an intuitive way.  The original iPod had 5GB of onboard storage and a FireWire port for connection to a Mac, and sold for US$400 (RM1,667) in the US. The following year, its storage capacity was doubled and the device became compatible with Windows computers.  A key turning point followed in 2003 when Apple opened the iTunes Music Store, which at the time offered 200,000 digital music tracks to American users.  More than one million songs were sold in the first week and the platform rolled out worldwide in 2004, revolutionising the music market and its established customs.  The MP3 revolution was now well and truly underway, bringing digital music formats to the forefront of the industry.  Soon, music videos, TV series and movies joined the store. Several billion tracks are now bought each year via the platform. In the early years of the iPod, many rival portable digital music players saw the light of day, based on the same principle, often cheaper but less smartly designed.  Despite all efforts, many firms were destined to fail in the sector, including Microsoft, whose Zune digital music players struggled to take off. From 2001, Apple built on the success of the classic iPod by developing a selection of different models, from the discreet iPod mini in 2004 (replaced by the nano in 2005) to the screenless shuffle in 2005.  The iPod touch came out in fall 2007, mirroring the design of the brand new iPhone with its colour touchscreen. A far cry from the original MP3 player, the iPod touch brought Wi-Fi connectivity and access to the millions of applications in the App Store.  It can be used as a portable gaming device or even for taking photos. Apple has sold around 400 million iPod devices in total. — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Facebook accidentally declares some users dead, including founder Zuckerberg Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Sony seeks to patent method for measuring journalists' accuracy The best action cams for winter sports Consumer drone business stumbles, but commercial markets beckon Apple now sells refurbished iPhones Robotic dinosaur replicas stomp in Tokyo hotel (VIDEO) Best smartphones for holiday 2016 Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Malaysian gaming content exports soar 75pc to RM80m Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Models with Down Syndrome team up with celebrities Reuters Video: Reflection ‘healthy’ for Democratic party, says Obama 'Beauty and the Beast' first full-length trailer Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Reuters Video: Duchess meets movie-star cat, animals go wild Related Articles Samsung seeks redemption with AI-infused Galaxy S8 phone Huawei wants to beat Apple in smartphones in two years TAG Heuer invades Apple’s home turf with Silicon Valley office Apple’s new laptop gets more touchy, but not on its screen Apple seeks to reclaim lost PC market share with new Macs Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Business Home LBoard Analyst: Pakatan, Dr M will be friends for now Sheith Khidhir Bin Abu Bakar Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Smartwatch sales tumble, dragged down by Apple AFP | October 25, 2016 But IDC analyst Ramon Llamas said the decline is not as ominous as it appears -- because many consumers were waiting for the new version of the Apple Watch and upcoming Android devices. WASHINGTON: Global smartwatch sales slid 51.6 percent in the third quarter, amid a steep decline for the Apple Watch ahead of its updated device, a market tracker said Monday. The IDC survey said total smartwatch volumes were 2.7 million units, less than half the level of a year earlier. Apple, the largest smartwatch vendor, saw its sales down 71.6 percent. But IDC analyst Ramon Llamas said the decline is not as ominous as it appears — because many consumers were waiting for the new version of the Apple Watch and upcoming Android devices. “The sharp decline in smartwatch shipment volumes reflects the way platforms and vendors are realigning,” Llamas said. “Apple revealed a new look and feel to watchOS that did not arrive until the launch of the second generation watch at the end of September.” Llamas added that Google’s decision to hold back the Android Wear 2.0 operating system has also limited sales. “Samsung’s Gear S3, announced at (the trade show) IFA in September, has yet to be released. Collectively, this left vendors relying on older, aging devices to satisfy customers.” Nonetheless, the market is showing limited growth, according to IDC. “It has also become evident that at present smartwatches are not for everyone,” said IDC analyst Jitesh Ubrani. “Having a clear purpose and use case is paramount, hence many vendors are focusing on fitness due to its simplicity.” Despite its sharp sales drop, Apple maintained the top position with an estimated 1.1 million units sold and a 41 percent market share, according to IDC. Apple does not release sales figures for its smartwatch. Garmin was the number two brand with sales of 600,000 and a 20.5 percent market share, followed by Samsung with 400,000 and a 14.4 percent share, according to IDC.

The spam filtering utility makes improvements to SpamSieve’s filtering accuracy, tells Apple Mail’s junk filter when incoming messages are not junk (instead of only when they are junk), adjusts sizes of the Dock icon status indicators to deal with a font change in Sierra, and works around an OS certificate error when checking for a software update. ($30 new with a 20 percent discount for TidBITS members, free update, 13.4 MB, release notes, 10.6+) Read/post comments about SpamSieve 2.9.26. 1Password 6.3.5 -- AgileBits released 1Password 6.3.4 with a single change that might throw you for a loop if you weren’t expecting it in the password management utility. The update “improves verification and authentication of communication with the 1Password browser extension.” After installing the update, you’ll be asked to verify 1Password’s connection to the extension via 1Password mini in the form of a six-digit code (shown in both 1Password mini and a Web browser tab). This verification opens automatically after installation if you have a Web browser open, or immediately after opening your Web browser the next time. “Take Control of 1Password” author Joe Kissell also notes that if you’re using the Bartender menu control utility, “you have to click the 1Password mini icon in Bartender — not just press the keyboard shortcut — to bring it up in order to see the code.” A few days after the 6.3.4 release, AgileBits updated 1Password to version 6.3.5 to fix a crash that could occur when using the 1Password browser extension, resolve an issue where the 1Password browser extension authorization window failed to display due to a missing monospace font, ensure that the app properly advises you to re-enable iCloud sync when upgrading from version 4, and correctly show the browser authentication popup when using Bartender. ($64.99 new from AgileBits and the Mac App Store with a 25 percent discount for TidBITS members when purchased from AgileBits, free update, 43.9 MB, release notes, 10.10+) Read/post comments about 1Password 6.3.5. BusyCal 3.1.1 -- BusyMac has released BusyCal 3.1.1 with improvements and bug fixes for the calendar app. The update improves the Quick Event panel by adding a preview of the event details as you type and providing interactive Attendee and Location pickers. The new version also adds mass transit support to Travel Time, improves 24-hour time entry in the Info panel, fixes a bug related to deleting an instance of a repeating meeting on Microsoft Exchange, fixes a crash that occurred when adding attendees with arrow keys, resolves an issue that prevented un-sharing an iCloud calendar, and corrects several user interface bugs when running in macOS 10.12 Sierra. ($49.99 new, $29.99 upgrade, 11.3 MB, release notes, 10.11+) Read/post comments about BusyCal 3.1.1. Audio Hijack 3.3.2 -- Rogue Amoeba has released Audio Hijack 3.3.2, which corrects a critical bug when running in macOS 10.12 Sierra where deleting blocks could cause an exception in Core Animation and leave the user interface in an inconsistent state. The popular audio recording utility also improves how the app displays the disappearance of an audio device, ensures the left and right arrows work in the Sessions tab, makes adjustments so FaceTime can be captured in Sierra, and adds support for the Avaya Spark app as a VoIP input source. Additionally, Audio Hijack now requires Instant On to capture audio from iTunes due to changes made in iTunes 12.5 — a prompt will appear if necessary. ($49 new with a 20 percent discount for TidBITS members, free update, 16.2 MB, release notes, 10.9+) Read/post comments about Audio Hijack 3.3.2.   TextExpander: Your knowledge at your fingertips.

Email | 24 Oct 2016 | Print  ExtraBITS for 24 October 2016 by TidBITS Staff In ExtraBITS this week, AT&T seeks to purchase Time Warner, T-Mobile pays a heavy price for data throttling, we say goodbye to Macworld founder David Bunnell, Apple reveals plans to build home automation into newly built homes, and we review Apple’s $49 iPhone 7 Plus case in 49 words. AT&T Aims to Buy Time Warner for $84.5 Billion -- Ma Bell is back and bigger than ever! Telecom giant AT&T has made a bid to acquire Time Warner Inc. for $85.4 billion in cash and stock. Note that while this deal would give AT&T ownership of HBO, Turner Broadcasting, and Warner Brothers, it doesn’t include Time Warner Cable, which is now owned by Charter Communications and is being rebranded as Spectrum. AT&T is likely trying to place itself on an even content footing with Comcast, which purchased NBCUniversal in 2011. However, with U.S. politicians from both sides of the aisle speaking out against the merger, it’s unclear if federal regulators will approve the deal. Read/post comments T-Mobile Fined $48 Million for Data Throttling -- In an agreement with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, T-Mobile will pay a total of $48 million in customer benefits, educational donations, and fines because of throttling connection speeds for its largest data users without advance notice. Impacted customers will receive a 20 percent discount on accessories and will be eligible for an additional 4 GB of data per month. T-Mobile CEO John Legere responded in his typically bombastic fashion, tweeting that T-Mobile believes more information is good for customers. Though, apparently, it takes an FCC settlement to make that happen. Read/post comments Remembering David Bunnell -- David Bunnell, the founder of PC Magazine, PC World, and Macworld, as well as Macworld Expo, has passed away. Fast Company’s Harry McCracken profiles Bunnell’s life and career, including his background as a social activist. Read/post comments Apple Reveals Home Automation Plans for New Construction -- Today you purchase and install HomeKit home automation devices in existing homes, but Apple wants to go beyond retrofits by building the technology into new homes. “We want to bring home automation to the mainstream,” Greg Joswiak, Apple’s vice president of product marketing, told Bloomberg. “The best place to start is at the beginning, when a house is just being created.” According to a survey by real-estate firm Trulia, twice as many people prefer a newly built house to a pre-owned property, so perhaps the boost that home automation needs is to become standard in new construction. Read/post comments 49-Word Review of the $49 iPhone 7 Plus Case -- Apple’s tight-fitting iPhone 7 case features a luxurious leather exterior, a soft microfiber lining, and built-in volume and Sleep/Wake buttons. It provides decent protection without adding extraneous bulk, is easily removed, and doesn’t cover the iPhone’s stereo speakers. Best of all, it eliminates the camera bump.

The Google Pixel is an amazing phone hidden in a boring body Polygon 10/24/2016 Ben Kuchera © Provided by Polygon Google’s drab-looking Pixel line of phones are going to be many things to many people, but it’s hard to overestimate just how important Google’s move into high-end hardware will prove to be for smart phones in general and portable virtual reality in particular.  Popular Searches Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF ▼ 1,250.00 -175.00 -12.28% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 105.71 -2.72 -2.51% Dynavax Technologies Corp DVAX ▼ 4.10 -7.50 -64.66% TransDigm Group Inc TDG ▼ 252.94 -19.35 -7.11% We were sent a Google Pixel XL, the larger of the two models, in anticipation of the release of Daydream. Daydream is a virtual reality platform that’s set to take the basic ideas behind Google Cardboard a step further. The idea is to create a virtual reality platform that’s not as disposable as Cardboard, while offering a headset that resembles sweatpants much more than it does a piece of technology. But Daydream isn’t here yet, so let’s talk about the phone. I inserted the AT&T SIM card from my personal phone — an iPhone 6S Plus — and attempted to use the Pixel for a week to get a sense for the hardware before it became the brain and display of our Daydream review unit. There are two things that define the Pixel: It’s fast, and it’s boring. The speed My god it’s fast. Apple prides itself on creating responsive, zippy phones, but the Pixel seemed to chew through both standard tasks and complex assignments with ease. Android is many things, but it often suffers from carrier-ordained cruft and a somewhat sludgy feel in less capable handsets. The Pixel is Google’s attempt to create a high-end competitor to the iPhone, and with Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor and 4 GB of RAM, the Pixel delivers that. One of the Pixel’s closest competitor was the Samsung Note 7, and that thing explodes. Google needed to show up, match the price and speed of the latest iPhone and avoid the pitfalls of the myriad flavors of Android that often feel like the digital version of walking down Times Square. It achieved those goals, and more. This is arguably the best Android device you can buy. So yeah, if you want a responsive, powerful Android device? Google has you covered and, since it’s Google, you won’t have to wait for software updates. Pixel runs Android 7.1 Nougat out of the box. But now let’s talk about how boring it is. The Android iPhone The Pixel looks like an iPhone from the front, even though there’s no front home button. There is a section of the rear of the unit that’s made of Gorilla Glass and features a fingerprint sensor, and that’s basically it. There’s a letter “G” on the back to let you know it’s from Google. The materials feel good in your hand, and it’s clear that this is a premium device, but it’s the opposite of flashy. It’s unlikely you’ll ever be using it and have someone ask what it’s like to use a Pixel. John Gruber wrote an amazing post about the “boring” nature of Apple’s design language with the iPhone line, and Google is basically drafting behind Apple, benefiting from the decreased wind resistance. © Provided by Polygon Google Pixel “Here’s the genius of the black and (especially) jet black iPhones 7,” Gruber wrote. “In a very seductive way, they look like something new and desirable. And at the same time, they are instantly recognizable as iPhones. That is what ... I’m-bored-with-Apple’s-designs pundits don’t get. With a highly successful product and brand, new versions need to strike a balance between familiarity, the foundations of the brand, and hot newness. The bored-with-Apple crowd just wants the hot newness.” Google didn’t really need to come out with a device that looked shockingly different nor did it feel the need to try to introduce you to any new design language. It’s a phone. Steve Jobs more or less decided what phones look like now when he and Apple introduced the first iPhone, and Google is secure enough to simply release a phone. The Pixel even comes with an adapter that allows you to plug your new phone into your existing iPhone to slurp down all your content. The little fold-out “get started” guide all but assumes you’re coming from an iPhone. What Google did was not easy. The company — along with HTC — created a phone that uses well-established design, is screamingly fast, features one of the best cameras on the market without feeling the need to announce itself visually. I see swagger where others complain about an uninspired design. And of course the whole thing is tied so tightly into the Google ecosystem that they’re inseparable. Google is more than happy to store an unlimited amount of photos and videos, and in fact there are options to have any backed up photos or videos over 90 days old deleted. The “free up space now” button option does the same thing. When you’re the manufacturer of the phone and the designer of the services included, “cruft” turns into “features.” While Apple is adding extra lenses to extend what its cameras can do, Google is exploring software options, to great effect. The only feature that makes me look longingly at the iPhone 7s is the water resistance, and the lack of it in the Pixel line is baffling. The counter-argument is the inclusion of a standard headphone jack, and it’s likely those two things are connected. Google created a phone that’s easy to use, fast as hell and is filled with a number of neat little touches that only become evident once you’ve used the phone for a bit. I thought the ability to waggle the phone to switch from the rear- and front-facing cameras was silly until I started to rely on it when taking selfies with my wife. So it looks like a phone. Big deal. That’s what we’re buying, anyway. But what about Daydream? That’s a good question, and it’s the reason we’re talking about the phone at all. Google is releasing a virtual reality platform called Daydream next month, and it’s the company’s next step in turning Cardboard and the content already available for it into something a bit more serious. All that speed we were discussing above is now very important not just to drive phone responsiveness, but to allow the high framerates necessary to maintain comfort in VR. This is also a shot at Samsung and Oculus, and by Oculus we mean Facebook. © Provided by Polygon Google Daydream View VR headset colors The Gear VR worked so well in part because Samsung allowed Oculus deep access to software and hardware of its phones. It was a special relationship, not to mention a selling point and a differentiator in a crowded market. Google has responded not just with Daydream as a platform, but by baking Android VR Mode into the latest version of the Android operating system as a whole. Anyone can release Daydream-ready phones as long as they conform to the specifications. That relationship between Samsung and Facebook is not only no longer so unique, it’s actively detrimental; when people hear Galaxy they think explosions, and that’s a deal breaker in a device you’re supposed to strap to your face. And Daydream is the reason I would suggest the Pixel XL to anyone interested in using this phone as their doorway into virtual reality. While the standard Pixel has a beautiful screen running at 1920 by 1080, that gives you a pixel density of 440 PPI, or pixels per inch, with the phone’s 5-inch screen. The Pixel XL has a similarly beautiful screen that runs at 2560 by 1440 and measures 5.5 inches, giving it a pixel density of 534 PPI. Pixel density matters when you’re using a platform that brings the screen that close to your face, and the XL is a significant improvement over the standard Pixel. For reference, the Oculus Rift “only” delivers a pixel density of 461 PPI. In practice this means that both models of Pixel phones are good enough for VR, but the Pixel XL will likely look better when placed in the Daydream viewer. It also means that VR enthusiasts may be surprised to find that the Daydream platform, while fueled by a Pixel XL, will have a clearer screen than their tethered head-mounted displays like the Rift or Vive. The Pixel is Google’s attempt at showing the world it can create the best Android device on the market, while attempting to bring VR to the masses and to further lock customers into the company’s myriad services and data-collection methods. It may look boring, but the world of both smartphones and VR will likely be changed fundamentally by its existence.

Known as the CoreGraphic bug, it was discovered by security researcher Marco Grassi. It allowed hackers to create a jpeg file that used a memory bug to run code on the user's phone whenever it displayed a hacked picture.  Scroll down for video Known as the CoreGraphic bug, it was discovered by security researcher Marco Grassi, and allows hackers to create a jpeg file that used a memory bug to run code on the user's phone. HOW TO UPDATE NOW  You can make sure that you aren't at risk by updating your iOS device to iOS 10.1 as soon as possible.  To update, select Settings / General/ Software update To update your watch, select the watch app , then geneal / software update Apple confirmed the fix was available in the iOS 10.1 for iPhone 5 and later, iPad 4th generation and later and the iPod touch 6th generation and later. It also released updates for the Apple watchOS , macOS and tvOS addressing the same issue. 'A memory corruption issue was addressed through improved memory handling,' it said of its support site, warning the hack meant 'Viewing a maliciously crafted JPEG file may lead to arbitrary code execution.' Security researcher Micah Lee first spotted the update, tweeting 'Upgrade to iOS 10.1 right now.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next How man will REALLY get to the red planet : National...

Share this article Share 94 shares 'It fixes a remote code execution vulnerability that's exploited by getting you to open a malicious JPEG.' Security expert Graham Cluley explained  'In simpler language, if you view a maliciously-crafted JPEG graphic (for instance, by browsing a website or opening an email) on a vulnerable iOS device, you could be allowing malicious code to execute. 'That's a nasty security bug, and now Apple has released a patch there will be surely be some criminal hackers who are interested in seeing if they can find a way of exploiting it.' Michael Horowitz, from Chicago, checks out his new iPhone 7 Plus at the Apple Store on Michigan Avenue, in Chicago. Apple's iPhone 7 Plus is getting a new camera capability: the blurring of backgrounds to focus attention on people in the foreground. Apple first announced the 'portrait mode' feature in September but it wasn't available until the company released its iOS 10.1 software update Monday.  It replicates an effect typically limited to larger cameras known as SLRs.   While SLRs accomplishes this by controlling how wide the lens opens, the iPhone uses software adjustments. Portrait mode requires an iPhone 7 Plus because it uses the phone's two lenses to sense depth.  Other iPhones have only one camera lens.  The software update will still be available for other iPhones because it also comes with bug fixes and other improvements. The update also adds a new camera capability for the iPhone 7 Plus — the blurring of backgrounds to focus attention on people or other objects in the foreground. To use the feature, slide the mode at the bottom of the camera app to 'portrait.' It's between 'photo' and 'square.' Then take a few steps back, as the feature taps the zoom on the iPhone 7 Plus's second lens, meaning images are enlarged two-fold.  The screen will guide you to move closer or farther from the subject, or in some cases, find a setting with more light.  When shooting multiple people, make sure everyone's the same distance from the camera to keep them all sharp. A customer sets up his new iPhone 7 Plus, right, as he switches from an iPhone 6 at the Apple Store on Michigan Avenue during the release of the Apple iPhone 7 and the latest Apple Watches, in Chicago. Apple is calling this depth-effect feature a beta, which means it's a work in progress. The iPhone will also save the unadjusted shots by default. Huawei's dual-lens P9 phone also has a similar feature. The update comes three days before Apple holds a product event in Cupertino, California, during which the company is expected to unveil new Mac computers. Separately, Apple announced Monday that a Nike edition of Apple Watch will come out Friday, starting at $369.  The runner-focused watch was announced in September, but no specific date had been given.

However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant.

"From my perspective, this is the heart of earnings season. How earnings trends are developing is top of my mind," said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas. "The market wants to see the good earnings data is not just about financials," he said. Apple, the largest S&P 500 stock by market capitalization, is the highlight of Tuesday's earnings reports. Analysts polled by Reuters on average expect the iPhone maker to report earnings of $1.65 a share on revenue of $46.89 billion for the quarter. "Tech is the largest sector in terms of an earnings weight," Lefkowitz said. "Getting a better handle on trends there is going to be important. We've seen some weakness in industrials. [We] want to see how broad-based that is." The Nasdaq 100 closed Monday at a record high of 4,909.97 after hitting an all-time intraday high of 4,911.59, helped by gains in Microsoft, Amazon.com, Apple and Alphabet, Google's parent company. show chapters <p>A-list tech earnings on deck</p> <p>Paul Meeks, tech investor, and John Traynor, People&rsquo;s United Wealth Management CIO, give their views on upcoming tech earnings from Apple, Amazon and Alphabet.</p> A-list tech earnings on deck    Monday, 24 Oct 2016 | 2:51 PM ET | 02:28 Tech led the S&P 500 higher, which closed up 10 points at 2,151. The broad index gains were helped by more than $100 billion in corporate deals, including AT&T's more than $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner, announced heading into Monday's trading session. The major banks set a positive tone to earnings season with better-than-expected third-quarter results, helped by a surge in revenue from bond trading. The majority of S&P 500 names have yet to report, with about one-third of the index posting results this week. "I hope what the market's signaling or finding out [is the] earnings recession doesn't exist or never really existed," said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management. Quarterly earnings per share have declined for four straight quarters as a sharp plunge in oil prices along with a strong dollar weighed heavily on corporate profits. If all remaining companies report earnings that match estimates, earnings per share will return to growth this quarter, up 1.1 percent from the third quarter last year, according to Monday's Thomson Reuters data. Other earnings reports due ahead of Tuesday's open include DuPont, Eli Lilly, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Merck, Novartis, Procter & Gamble, United Technologies, Corning, Freeport-McMoRan, KeyCorp, KKR, Lockheed Martin, Pentair, Sherwin-Williams, Sprint, TD Ameritrade, Under Armour, Valero Energy, Whirlpool, AK Steel, II-VI, Janus, JetBlue, Spirit Airlines and TransUnion. Firms set to post quarterly results after the close include Chipotle Mexican Grill, Capital One, Discover Financial, Edwards Lifesciences, Express Scripts, Juniper Networks, Vertex Pharma, iRobot, Pandora Media, Panera Bread and Owens-Illinois. Among the few pieces of minor economic data scheduled for release Tuesday are August home price indexes from S&P Case-Shiller and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Consumer confidence for October is scheduled for release later in the morning from The Conference Board. Analysts expect the index to tick down to 101.5 from 104.1 in September, according to a consensus estimate from Reuters. The Richmond Fed survey is also due Tuesday morning. Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart is scheduled to speak at 1:20 p.m. ET on lending and investing in community development. Fed speakers will then be in a quiet period ahead of the central bank's meeting next week. The Treasury is set to hold a two-year note auction in the afternoon. Treasury yields rose Monday, with the two-year yield near 0.84 percent in late trade and the 10-year yield around 1.76 percent following an encouraging pickup in the October flash U.S. Markit manufacturing PMI. The U.S. dollar index was little changed in late trade Monday after hitting intraday 97.188, its highest since February 3. The euro was around $1.088. "For now, everything depends on the election," said Athanasios Vamvakidis, head of G-10 FX strategy in Europe at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. If Hillary Clinton wins the U.S. presidential election and federal government gridlock continues with a Republican-dominated Congress, Vamvakidis said the last leg of the dollar rally will come around December, when the Fed likely raises rates and the European Central Bank probably extends its asset purchase program. The euro dollar is near his year-end target of $1.08. Overseas on Tuesday, ECB President Mario Draghi is set to speak in Berlin on "Stability, Equity and Monetary Policy."

Apple's market share and software, and Amazon and Google's cloud businesses will be top of mind for Paul Meeks, CNBC contributor and technology investor, and John Traynor, chief investment officer at People's United Wealth Management. Getty Images Apple's flagship store in New York City Apple Headline numbers: Earnings, revenue and iPhone sales What Traynor is watching: Samsung and the software ecosystem For Traynor, the key issue is whether defectors from Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 recall are using more of Apple's cloud and content. "We'll keep an eye on that number, but we're hoping that Apple can differentiate between their core demand, how much is Samsung [Galaxy Note] 7 related and really, what they're doing to convert those Samsung customers over to Apple customers." Apple grew its services revenue 19 percent last quarter, hitting App Store records on the heels of augmented reality game Pokemon Go. It has also looked more into content, including a deal with "Carpool Karaoke." "In all of our tech holdings, we're focused on connectivity and content," Traynor said. "And we think Apple is right at the confluence of those two trends." Amazon and Google Headline numbers: Earnings, revenue; Google ad sales; Amazon e-commerce sales What Meeks is watching: Cloud "As you've seen with two other stocks that are jumping on the cloud — Microsoft and Amazon — the dialogue about the company is going to go to what kind of traction they have in the cloud space," Meeks said of Alphabet. In addition to being a dominant force in online commerce, Amazon is also a leading provider of cloud services. It has 31 percent market share, according to Synergy Research Group, followed by Microsoft's Azure, at 9 percent. Google has about 4 percent market share, according to Synergy. But Microsoft reported its cloud revenue grew 116 percent last quarter, with commercial cloud annual revenue run rate of more than $13 billion. Meeks is hoping Amazon will hit at least the level of Microsoft's rate of cloud sales growth. But while Meeks sold Amazon's stock, he's not planning to buy it back just yet. "What happens with tech stocks is they are notoriously volatile," "There will be some Amazon-related issue — a competitive issue, even macroeconomic issue — that will cause a dip in the stock, and if it gets deep enough, I will buy it then."

What can we expect from this running-centric smartwatch? Like the Apple Watch Series 2, the Nike+ edition boasts built-in GPS, heart rate monitor, swim-proof water resistance up to 50 meters and an incredibly bright (1,000 nits max) display, all powered by a capable dual-core processor and watchOS 3. Unique to this flagship are the Nike Sport band (a perforated version of the Apple Watch Sport band) and two exclusive Nike-branded customizable watch faces. Additionally, the Nike+ Run Club app comes pre-installed. If you're considering an Apple Watch to be primarily used as a fitness tracker, the Nike+ edition could be the one to get, especially if you like the idea of a synthetic rubber band that's perforated for breathability. However, there's no need to fret if you've already copped the Series 2. You can still download the free Nike+ Run Club app, which tracks and stores your personal running history, for an almost identical experience. Note that Apple Watches do not include an altimeter, so if tracking altitude is an important part of your running, the Nike+ edition won't free you from running with your phone. Like other Apple Watches, the Nike+ edition will be available in two watch face sizes. The 38-millimeter version starts at US$369 and the 42-millimeter version starts at $399. Color combinations are Black/Volt (neon green), Black/Cool Gray, Silver/Volt and Silver/White.

October 25th 2016 21 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ The 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch MacBook Pros will likely get a new design Brooke CrothersFox News Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend APPLE has officially set an event for in which it’s expected to roll out a redesign of the MacBook. The October 27 event teaser tagline is “hello again,” likely a reference to the Mac, which has been introduced with the “hello” tagline in the past. The event’s main attraction should be new MacBooks, according to Rhoda Alexander, Director Tablet and Notebook PCs at IHS Markit Technology. “I think we’ll see a new version of the [MacBook] Air and the two [MacBook] Pro models,” Alexander told Fox News in a phone interview. The 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch MacBook Pros will likely get a new design, Alexander said, while the 13-inch MacBook Air is expected to see more modest improvements. Reports over the weekend, based on comments from an analyst in Asia, said that in addition to the MacBook Pros, there will be a “13-inch MacBook.” Based on those reports, it’s not clear if it would be the MacBook Air or a new thin-and-light MacBook. Among other things, Alexander expects newfangled keyboards containing “OLED function bars … but just on the [MacBook] Pros.” Instead of the standard function keys at the top of all keyboards today, the new Pros are expected to have an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display-based set of virtual function keys that change dynamically according to the task the user is doing. Pros are also expected to have new USB Type-C ports — the same tiny USB port that is featured on the 12-inch MacBook and on phones like the new Google Pixel.Source:News Corp Australia Previous Bloomberg reports have said to expect a MacBook Pro with a thinner, lighter chassis and a flatter keyboard, similar to the “butterfly” keys on the ultra-thin 12-inch MacBook. The Pros are also expected to have new USB Type-C ports — the same tiny USB port that is featured on the 12-inch MacBook and on phones like the new Google Pixel. Japanese-language Apple enthusiast site Macotakara — a reliable source of Apple rumours — said last week that the 11-inch version of the MacBook Air will be discontinued, possibly because that market need is already met by the super-svelte 12-inch MacBook. The Japanese site added that the traditional MagSafe connector may get eliminated on the MacBook Pro. That would follow the 12-inch MacBook, which has replaced MagSafe with a USB-C connector for charging. What does Apple need to do? “What they need to do is have an updated design and incorporate features that continue to justify the premium customers continue to pay for these products,” Alexander said. Apple has been criticised for waiting too long to do a physical overhaul of the MacBook Pros. For example, the 15.4-inch MacBook Pro Retina’s design hasn’t changed significantly since 2012. “They should have done it a long time ago,” Ryan Smith, editor in chief of tech site Anandtech, told Foxnews.com in a recent email. “Most models are full price yet years out of date, and that makes buying old models bad investments for consumers,” he added. Daniel Matte, an analyst with Canalys, a market research firm, hopes to see a bevy of announcements. “I would hope to see them announce a new MacBook Pro, Mac Pro, iMacs, and Thunderbolt Display with updated components,” Matte told Fox News.

It was a third generation model and I loved it. It was commuting salvation packed into what seemed like an impossibly small package. The iPod was a transformative device for Apple that laid the groundwork for future devices like the iPhone. Although it synced with a computer, the iPod marked Apple’s first major foray into consumer electronics. In some ways, the introduction of the iPod seems like an impossibly long time ago, but when you look back at its evolution, it’s amazing just how far technology has come in such a short time. To mark the fifteenth anniversary of that first iPod, The Verge published a visual history of the iPod. I enjoyed scrolling through the product shots and picking out the ones I owned. For a little more history and context on where the iPod fits into Apple’s past, I recommend watching Stephen Hackett’s video on the 512 Pixels YouTube channel. Also, in piece of almost-forgotten history, Nobuyuki Hayashi tells the story of twenty CDs that Steve Jobs and his iPod team chose and put on the iPod prototypes given to journalists for testing (via Daring Fireball). The CDs included an interesting mix of classical, jazz, blues, classic rock, then-current hits, and other selections, each of which is linked in the article. Tags: ipod Join Now Like MacStories?

One of the major highlights of the newest version of the mobile OS is the Portrait Mode, which is specifically available only for the iPhone 7 Plus. But aside from that, the iOS 10.1 update also addresses a number of vulnerabilities, which makes it vital for owners of compatible Apple devices to download the new firmware as soon as possible. For instance, according to a tweet from Micah Lee, a security engineer, the iOS 10.1 update comes with a CoreGraphics security content which repairs a “remote code execution validity that’s exploited by getting (users) to open a malicious JPEG file.” Upgrade to iOS 10.1 right now. It fixes a remote code execution vulnerability that's exploited by getting you to open a malicious JPEG. pic.twitter.com/VpY7fpJlyP — Micah Lee (@micahflee) October 24, 2016 A vulnerability in the Contacts app was also addressed in the iOS 10.1 update, wherein an “application may be able to maintain access to the Address Book after access is revoked in Settings,” Apple’s support page noted. This was fixed through improved file-link validation. Head to Apple’s official support page to see the complete list of security contents and Common Vulnerabilities And Exposures or CVEs addressed in iOS 10.1 update. Going back to the Portrait Mode, this new camera feature only works for the iPhone 7 Plus through its dual-camera setup. To those curious as to how it works, BGR explained that the primary shooter “actually captures two images, one with the 28mm lens and one with the 56mm lens.” Apple’s software then “takes data from both images and then fuses them together to create one unified photograph,” it added. Expected to take more beautiful images, the iPhone 7 Plus rear camera through its Portrait Mode essentially adds a bokeh effect, creating a blurred background, which helps the subject of the photo to stand out even more. Take note, though, that the Portrait Mode is still in beta in iOS 10.1 update, which means there may still be issues as you use it. [Image by Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images] Moreover, website 9to5Mac listed the full patch notes for the iOS 10.1 update. The Messages app gets a new option enabling users to replay bubble and full-screen effects. The update also fixes several Messages issues including contact names showing incorrectly in the app. The Maps app is also getting major changes. The patch notes for the iOS 10.1 update noted the following changes for Maps. Transit support for every major train, subway, ferry, and national bus line, as well as local bus systems for Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya Sign-based transit navigation including layouts of all underground structures and walkways that connect large transit stations Transit fare comparison when viewing alternative transit routes Fixes and improvements were also made to Apple Watch, AirPlay Mirroring, Bluetooth connectivity, Health app, Weather, Mail and more. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJUM8NRq-EQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Aside from iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the iOS 10.1 update is compatible with the iPhone 5, 5c, 5s, as well as the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, and iPhone SE. For the iPads, it should run on iPad mini 2, mini 3, mini 4, iPad 4, iPad Air, iPad Air 2. The two iPad Pro models, the 9.7-inch and the 12.9-inch will also get the iOS 10.1 update. The iPod Touch 6th generation is the only model from Apple’s media player family that can be upgraded with iOS 10.1. Moreover, the report from Ars Tecnica explained the following about the latest iOS update. “The build number, 14B72 on older iDevices and 14B72c on the 7 and 7 Plus, is identical to the beta build that was released last week, so if you’re enrolled in Apple’s public or developer beta programs, you already have the final version of the update.” Those who are excited to get Apple’s iOS 10.1 update can head to the device’s Settings menu. Look for Software Update and tap Install Now to start downloading the OTA file. The Apple device will begin with the update process once the download has successfully ended. Furthermore, expect the iPhone or the compatible Apple mobile device to reboot automatically into iOS 10.1 after the installation process is completed. Aside from the iOS 10.1 for its mobile devices, Apple also released the latest iteration of its MacOS Sierra this Monday, October 24. Version 10.12.1 is now available to compatible Mac devices.

Analysts KGI say the event at Apple's Cupertino HQ on Thursday will see the launch of three new machines -  a new 13 inch MacBook, a new 13 inch MacBook Pro and a new 15 inch MacBook Pro. Scroll down for video The event will take place at Apple's Cupertino HQ on October 27th, and is expected to see a range of new Macbook machines with a new 'smartkey' screen above the normal keyboard. WHAT DO WE KNOW?  KGI says Apple will debut a 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro, alongside a 13inch MacBook. Previous reports say Apple is also eliminating the USB and its Megsafe connector, and replacing them with USB-C support and Thunderbolt 3. The MacBook Pro could also have an OLED touch bar, which replaces the strip of function keys and let users create their own custom keys for each app. Apple's dramatically overhauled MacBook Pro will feature a new 'thinner and lighter' design. KGI published a report on Saturday outlining their predictions for Apple’s Mac roadmap ahead of the media event on October 27th. It also claims that new iMacs and a rumoured new 5K cinema displays won't form part of the announcement, according to 9to5mac. It also doesn't mention the Mac Pro, Apple's tubular design, or its Mac Mini.  Russian trademark filings also seem to reveal that Apple is readying the release of three new Macs running macOS Sierra, it said. The products have apparently passed the Russian registration, labelled as ‘portable personal computer models’ with model identifiers A1706, A1707 and A1708.  A previous report suggests the Cupertino company is set to eliminate the traditional USB and Megsafe ports in its next-gen MacBook Pro – and kill the 11-inch MacBook altogether.  The previous claims come from Macotakara, a Japanese publisher, which was one of the first sources to predict the death of the iPhone’s headphone jack.

Share this article Share 85 shares ‘According to information from a reliable Chinese supplier, Apple is planning to announce the new MacBook Pro within this month and will begin shipping out to retailers in October,’ reads the blog post. ‘There has also been rumors that they are going to cancel MacBook Air of the 11-inch model to focus on the 13-inch ones’. If the report is true, the new machines are expected to use metal injection molded hinges, have USB-C support and Thunderbolt 3. The USB Type-C plug is reversible so users will no longer have to stab blindly at USB ports in order to connect and charge gadgets, because plugs will fit in sockets in either direction.  A new report suggests Apple is set to remove the traditional USB and Megsafe ports in its next-gen MacBook Pro, and replacing them with USB-C support and Thunderbolt 3. Pictured is the MacBook Pro line Apple released in 2015 It is also designed to be used in thinner and sleeker products like tablets and ultrabooks, and is being called ‘the only connector one will need across all devices,’ according to the USB 3.0 Promoter Group. However, this means users would have to charge their device through the USB-C port and connect peripherals through the Thunderbolt 3, reports Steve Dent with Engadget. possible oled touchpad for the function buttons in next macbook, as well as hella USB-C ports pic.twitter.com/MD4oCtIOSU— Sam Sheffer (@samsheffer) June 2, 2016 In the end, users will be forced to purchase their own USB 3.0 adapter.  It is also rumored that the MacBook Pro will have an OLED touch bar that replaces the strip of function keys and let users create their own custom keys for each app. This rumor came from a reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo at KGI Securities earlier this year. Macotakara , a Japanese publisher, also reveals Apple is killing off the 11-in MacBook altogether. However, the firm will reveal a 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro at an event planned for some time this month. Pictured are MacBook Pros Apple released in 2015 Kuo says Apple plans to introduce a dramatically overhauled MacBook Pro with a new 'thinner and lighter' design. It is expected to look similar to the slick and minimalist MacBook. APPLE’S PATENT REPLACES KEYBOARD WITH TOUCH SCREEN  A patent filed by Apple earlier this year shows a laptop similar to a MacBook that features a flat touch surface where a keyboard would normally be. The invention, dubbed a 'configurable, force-sensitive input structure for an electronic device,' looks similar to its 'Force Touch' trackpads. These trackpads use haptic technology which senses movement from a user's fingers on the surface. MacBook Pro might have an OLED touch bar that replaces the strip of function keys. A patent filed by Apple this year (pictured) shows a laptop similar to a MacBook that features a flat touch surface where a keyboard would normally be located 'The trackpad features built-in force sensors that allow you to click anywhere and haptic feedback that provides a responsive and uniform feel,' Apple says. A tiny motor then vibrates to give the user feedback on what they are touching. The patent suggests similar technology laptop keyboard, a number pad, or a track pad. It claims 'micro-perforations' in the casing could light up to give the user an outline to where keys are on the flat keyboard. And the position of the haptic keys could also be customized.  The device will also include Touch ID support and a new OLED display touch bar above the keyboard. Kuo's report explains that the MacBook Pro updates are the 'brightest spot for Apple's 2016 rollouts' and was the first to mention 13-inch and 15-inch models.    Read more: Apple may ditch traditional USB ports on the MacBook Pro 次期MacBook Pro、10月末に出荷開始？ | Rumor | Macお宝鑑定団 blog（羅針盤） Apple plans to launch new Macs at an October 27 event - Recode KGI: Apple to release new 13-inch MacBook plus two MacBook Pros at next week’s event, new iMac & 5K Display coming next year | 9to5Mac Share or comment on this article e-mail 85 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Moment of impact as earthquake rattles home in Wellington Got any oink-tment?: Excited piglets take a warm bath SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Obama and Trump sit down to discuss the transfer of power James Corden sings for the 2016 Sainsbury's Christmas advert Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes?

One of the major highlights of the newest version of the mobile OS is the Portrait Mode, which is specifically available only for the iPhone 7 Plus. But aside from that, the iOS 10.1 update also addresses a number of vulnerabilities, which makes it vital for owners of compatible Apple devices to download the new firmware as soon as possible. For instance, according to a tweet from Micah Lee, a security engineer, the iOS 10.1 update comes with a CoreGraphics security content which repairs a “remote code execution validity that’s exploited by getting (users) to open a malicious JPEG file.” Upgrade to iOS 10.1 right now. It fixes a remote code execution vulnerability that's exploited by getting you to open a malicious JPEG. pic.twitter.com/VpY7fpJlyP — Micah Lee (@micahflee) October 24, 2016 A vulnerability in the Contacts app was also addressed in the iOS 10.1 update, wherein an “application may be able to maintain access to the Address Book after access is revoked in Settings,” Apple’s support page noted. This was fixed through improved file-link validation. Head to Apple’s official support page to see the complete list of security contents and Common Vulnerabilities And Exposures or CVEs addressed in iOS 10.1 update. Going back to the Portrait Mode, this new camera feature only works for the iPhone 7 Plus through its dual-camera setup. To those curious as to how it works, BGR explained that the primary shooter “actually captures two images, one with the 28mm lens and one with the 56mm lens.” Apple’s software then “takes data from both images and then fuses them together to create one unified photograph,” it added. Expected to take more beautiful images, the iPhone 7 Plus rear camera through its Portrait Mode essentially adds a bokeh effect, creating a blurred background, which helps the subject of the photo to stand out even more. Take note, though, that the Portrait Mode is still in beta in iOS 10.1 update, which means there may still be issues as you use it.

The Messages app gets a new option enabling users to replay bubble and full-screen effects. The update also fixes several Messages issues including contact names showing incorrectly in the app. The Maps app is also getting major changes. The patch notes for the iOS 10.1 update noted the following changes for Maps. Transit support for every major train, subway, ferry, and national bus line, as well as local bus systems for Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya Sign-based transit navigation including layouts of all underground structures and walkways that connect large transit stations Transit fare comparison when viewing alternative transit routes Fixes and improvements were also made to Apple Watch, AirPlay Mirroring, Bluetooth connectivity, Health app, Weather, Mail and more. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJUM8NRq-EQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Aside from iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the iOS 10.1 update is compatible with the iPhone 5, 5c, 5s, as well as the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, and iPhone SE. For the iPads, it should run on iPad mini 2, mini 3, mini 4, iPad 4, iPad Air, iPad Air 2. The two iPad Pro models, the 9.7-inch and the 12.9-inch will also get the iOS 10.1 update. The iPod Touch 6th generation is the only model from Apple’s media player family that can be upgraded with iOS 10.1. Moreover, the report from Ars Tecnica explained the following about the latest iOS update. “The build number, 14B72 on older iDevices and 14B72c on the 7 and 7 Plus, is identical to the beta build that was released last week, so if you’re enrolled in Apple’s public or developer beta programs, you already have the final version of the update.” Those who are excited to get Apple’s iOS 10.1 update can head to the device’s Settings menu. Look for Software Update and tap Install Now to start downloading the OTA file. The Apple device will begin with the update process once the download has successfully ended. Furthermore, expect the iPhone or the compatible Apple mobile device to reboot automatically into iOS 10.1 after the installation process is completed. Aside from the iOS 10.1 for its mobile devices, Apple also released the latest iteration of its MacOS Sierra this Monday, October 24. Version 10.12.1 is now available to compatible Mac devices.

Apple has distributed a fresh round of security updates to address remote-code execution holes in iOS, macOS, Safari, and the firmware for Apple Watch and AppleTV. Miscreants who exploit these flaws can take over the vulnerable device – all a victim has to do is open a JPEG or PDF file booby-trapped with malicious code, so get patching before you're caught out. The fixes come just days before the Cupertino developer of TextEdit is set to hold a special event to introduce a (presumed) refresh of its Mac product line and potentially new iPad tablets. For those running iOS, the 10.1 release includes updates to address 12 CVE-listed security vulnerabilities in the firmware for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. Those flaws include a remote code execution flaw in the handling of JPEG images (CVE-2016-4673), a remote code execution bug in WebKit (CVE-2016-4677), local code execution flaws, and a vulnerability in contacts (CVE-2016-4686) that would let an application pull Address Book details even when access has been revoked. For macOS Sierra (10.12.1), the update brings fixes for 16 CVE-listed vulnerabilities. Those include the CVE-2016-4673 image-handling bug as well as remote code execution flaws that could be triggered by font files (CVE-2016-4667) and PDF files (CVE-2016-4671). Also released was a fix for a denial of service error in Nvidia graphics card drivers (CVE-2016-4663) and a bug that exposed the length of user passwords (CVE-2016-4670). Included among the latest fixes for iOS and macOS was CVE-2016-4635, a remote audio eavesdropping vulnerability for FaceTime that Apple had previously attempted to remedy in older versions of iOS and OS X. Apple did not say whether the flaw was exposed in iOS 10.1 and macOS Sierra, or if the fix was an update to an already-installed security measure. For those running the Safari browser on Sierra and older versions of OS X, Apple has produced patches to address a trio of WebKit flaws that can allow web pages or applications to achieve remote code execution (CVE-2016-4666, CVE-2016-4677) and pull location information (CVE-2016-4676). Meanwhile, Apple Watch users are advised to update their arm candy to watchOS 3.1 to get fixes for eight CVE-listed flaws, including two flaws in sandbox profiles (CVE-2016-4664, CVE-2016-4665) that allow third-party applications to view image libraries and sound files without permission. The AppleTV will also get an update for 10 flaws, including the sandbox profiles flaws (CVE-2016-4664, CVE-2016-4665), the WebKit remote code execution bug (CVE-2016-4677), and the CoreGraphics JPEG bug (CVE-2016-4673) patched in other Apple products. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 49 Comments More from The Register Apple is rolling WebRTC video-chat into Safari iOS, OS X browsers WebKit could soon get support for open conferencing standard 6 Comments Atlassian creates new Android, iOS development teams What's 'app-ening at the developers' darling?

Called Portrait, it takes advantage of the two cameras on the back of the camera to give you a DSLR-like effect to your pictures. We've been using the feature on our iPhone 7 Plus to find out the best way to use it. To update your device to iOS 10.1, plug your device into power and connect to the internet with Wi-Fi. Then, tap Settings > General > Software Update. From there, tap Download and Install. That's it. How do I use Portrait Mode? The Portrait mode is found in the camera app. It's accessed by swiping between the different shooting mode, as you've previously done before with modes like Panorama, Photo, or Square. It is only available on the iPhone 7 Plus, so if you own an iPhone 7, sorry it isn't available to you. To use it simply scroll to Portrait in the camera app and start taking photos. You might have to follow some on-screen instructions to take the perfect picture. These pics show what the iPhone 7 Plus dual camera is capable of Go to Apple's Camera app, then slide over to the Portrait mode, and the mode should prompt you to move back. At the end, you get a Depth Effect picture, plus one without the effect so you can see the difference. Pocket-lint What is Portrait Mode and how does it work? The technology behind Portrait is called Depth Effect. Depth Effect is designed to deliver a more DSLR-like photo with a shallower depth of field (read: softer, out-of-focus background) by creating a depth map comparison of what the two differing lenses see in front of them. In addition to the usual wide-angle lens, a telephoto lens is located on the rear of iPhone 7 Plus. Apple has devised a way to use both lenses at the same time to mimic depth of field when taking portrait shots. Apple iPhone 7 Plus camera: Dual camera tech explained What is bokeh? Here's the photography effect explained When you capture in Portrait mode, the camera snaps two photos: one regular and one with blur applied to the background. Apple's built-in image signal processor scans the scene, then applies machine-learning techniques to recognise people in the image, and ultimately creates a depth map using the device's two cameras, which results in an image where the people are in focus while the background has a bokeh-like effect. This allows software to digitally blur the background, which it identifies as being farther away, while keeping the foreground sharp. Or at least that's the idea. Pocket-lint Can I use Portrait to take all my pictures? It's probably not advisable. The Portrait mode comes with a number of caveats: you'll need plenty of light, to be the right distance away from your subject with ample distance from the background, to have lots of contrast between the foreground and the background, for there to be not too many faces in the picture, oh and for your subjects to stay still. This is no snap-and-go offering. Pocket-lint Portrait Tips and Tricks To use this new mode, launch the Camera and select “Portrait." Once in this mode, you are guided real-time with a live preview of the depth effect, including how to best distance the camera from the subject. We find the best portraits of someone are in brighter light. If shooting more than one person, we recommend up to three people. Keep them in the same plane if you want everyone to stay sharp. The further your subject is from your background, the more pronounced the blur effect will be. You’ll also notice better blur if you have good contrast between your subject and the background such as contrasting colours. Portrait likes faces, but it can be used to shoot objects just make sure they are high contrasting to get the best effect. Thin objects or scenes where there are a lot of similar colours don't look as good. In the beta, pictures have looked great on screen, but not so great blown up full size on a monitor. If you want to ensure you have a backup of what would be a non-Portrait version of the image, make sure you've got the Keep Normal Photo option ticked in settings (Settings > Photos & Camera). This will save a photo without the depth of field effect applied in addition to the Portrait Version. Is that all iOS 10.1 brings? The iOS 10.1 update includes some smaller features and bug fixes for other iOS 10 devices. It corrects a syncing bug that kept iTunes tracks from being stored on the Apple Watch, for instance. Apple also said the update also "improves Bluetooth connectivity with third-party accessories", which suggests iOS 10.1 might correct the Android Wear issue that prevented smartwatches from connecting to an iPhone.

According to a recent report by IDC claims that between Q3 2015 and Q3 2015 the global smartwatch market has declined by more than half. The report goes on to say that while 5.6 million units were shipped in Q3 2015, that number declined to 2.7 million year over year. It’s important to note however, that Q3 2015 was the first time the Apple Watch had widespread availability after a limited online launch while the second generation Apple Watch was only available in the last two weeks of Q3 2016. Ramon Llamas, research manager for IDC’s wearables team, stated that these numbers represent the way smartwatch vendors are realigning. “Apple revealed a new look and feel to watchOS that did not arrive until the launch of the second generation watch at the end of September. Google’s decision to hold back Android Wear 2.0 has repercussions for its OEM partners as to whether to launch devices before or after the holidays. Samsung’s Gear S3, announced at IFA in September, has yet to be released. Collectively, this left vendors relying on older, aging devices to satisfy customers,” said Llamas. Despite this, Apple Watch remains the most popular smartwatch brand in the world, followed by Garmin, Samsung, Lenovo (Motorola) and Pebble. Apple’s individual smartwatch market share decreased from approximately 70 percent to 40 percent year over year in Q3 2016. In addition however, Garmin experienced the largest annual increase, growing its market share from 2 percent to about 20 percent between Q3 2015 and Q3 2016. Thanks to the Gear 2 smartwatches, Samsung finished Q3 2016 with a slightly higher market share, up to 14 percent from six percent, while both Motorola and Pebble saw their numbers inch a little lower. Jitesh Ubrani senior research analyst for IDC mobile device trackers, agrees however that smartwatches are not for everyone, which emphasizes vendors’ need to be specific and deliberate in their decisions. “Having a clear purpose and use case is paramount, hence many vendors are focusing on fitness due to its simplicity. However, moving forward, differentiating the experience of a smartwatch from the smartphone will be key and we’re starting to see early signs of this as cellular integration is rising and as the commercial audience begins to pilot these devices,” said Urbani in a statement. In total however, the smartwatch market has contracted by 51.6 percent.

Nioc Tib Can’t beat a real watch … but it complements the phone rather than only providing the time/date display. It’s Me Gotta wonder where IDC pulled their numbers from if Apple hasn’t released any sales numbers and their watch is mainly sold through their own stores. FlamesFan89 “analysts” getting their info from “insiders” It’s Me Maybe. But I don’t think they’ve ever claimed to be getting them from insiders at apple. If they said that, then there wouldn’t be a question as to where they got there numbers. Since they don’t claim to get them from insiders at Apple, where then? Samsung? FlamesFan89 You are overthinking it. I was being facetious. It’s Me Question still stands. Without numbers or info From Apple, how reliable are their guesses? I don’t doubt Apple sales fell. The first gen had been on the market for almost 1.5 years and the replacement was anticipated, so a drop in sales would be more than expected. But did IDC just take that assumption and make guess based on it? FlamesFan89 Maybe they got their information from the same analyst that thinks 50% of Note users are going to move to iPhones. 😉 It’s Me Probably. Leif Shantz Most people don’t want a smart watch because of the price. The average person doesn’t want to drop $300-500 on a glorified watch that drops support after 2 years. So drop the price to $99-$$249 and sales Unorthodox There are real life limitations to lowering the price. At certain point it’s cheaper to destroy goods than trying to sell them. I’ve never been impressed with this whole smartwatch thing, and it looks that I am not alone. monkeymo at $250 I don’t want buy a smart watch, $100 sure, because you have to upgrade these things, they wont last, they aren’t made to last. I have no problem plunking down good money for a good watch because its gonna last forever. John W Smartwatches are awesome IMO, but there are some massive flaws that i think are keeping people away – Price….. the only watches that are reasonably priced are pebble’s, and while they are nice they are very pedestrian looking. – Battery life …… who wants yet another thing to charge every single night? And all of that aside, the economy is not so good right now and something rather frivolous like a watch that tells you what is going on with the phone that is already in your pocket is tough to justify. Mo Dabbas you summed up what I wanted to type. But on the price part, for 400-500 you can get a real watch that is way nicer than almost all smart watches. A main thing that almost all makers forgot about. A watch is an accessory before anything and so the looks are crucial. Nioc Tib A watch must be nice to be an accessory. Fossil, Tag Heuer and Micheal Kors produce magnificent Android watches, at a price tag similar to their regular models. FlamesFan89 But they suffer from the same thing that all smartwatches suffer from: they lack longevity. If you drop $400-$500 on a watch, you can get a really nice watch, that can quite literally, last a lifetime. The same amount of money on a smartwatch will provide you with something that might look great, but inside of 5 years, will likely be completely useless. Nioc Tib Similarly … if you are ready to ditch 1000$ on an Iphone 7 or Pixel that will last no more 2-3 years (too = lack of longevity) , this is a similar none sense to me. Perspective is the key. FlamesFan89 I think the big difference is that, with electronic devices, we are accustomed to them having a relatively short lifespan of only a few years. Phones, game consoles, computers, etc. It’s basically the norm, and expected that they will need to be replaced. The watch industry is in stark contrast to this however. With watches, once you hit a price point above the Walmart Timex watches, the expectation is that these are lifetime purchases. A lot of the time, watches are more like jewellery that happens to tell time, rather than a utilitarian device. The smartwatch industry seems to have missed that point. They incorrectly thought that people would be willing to pay for these devices like they do with phones, but they ignored the driving factors behind the watch industry in the first place. deltatux I have a first-gen Moto 360, most people complained about battery life and performance, but I never did. Battery lasts 2 days if I didn’t feel like charging daily and I mainly use my smartwatch for basic apps like Transit, the clock itself, weather forecasting, Google Authenticator, see who’s calling and messaging. What kind of performance do you really need? I do agree, the biggest setback for smartwatches is the pricing. Smartwatches, unlike regular watches, really only lasts for 2-3 years before being replaced, just like a phone. However, personally, I don’t want to pay the same amount for a single-use item like a regular watch. Yes it’ll last 10+ years and likely same with the battery but there’s a reason why, it pretty much does only 1 thing which doesn’t take much to do in the first place. Also, why do smart watches all need Cortex A7 chips? I’m sure that the lowly Cortex A5 or A32 is more than capable as smartwatch SoCs (much more power efficient too) and yet manufacturers always put Cortex A7 chips. AKDISQUS BATTERY…. BATTERY…BATTERY. I already knew smartwatches were doomed to fail. Once we can get the software and hardware to be so energy efficient that we can keep our smart watches charged through solar, kinetic or even body thermal only then can they be somewhat useful. Until then… worthless. h2oflyer Right on ! All Citizen quartz watches sold in Canada are solar powered. Some models have smarts and update via GPS or very low frequency radio signal from Fort Collins Colorado. Seiko still makes decades old Kinetic watches that use the rotating weight to spin a generator through 100 to 1 gearing and charge a lith-ion battery. Wearing one as I type. “Smart” battery efficient watches have been around for a while. Can’t Fix Stupid Smartwatches are like 3D tv….sorta neat but not really crucial to have. Mo Dabbas “Could the world be losing interest in smartwatches?” — To be honest there was no real interest to begin with. Nundo It’s all about price. $400-$500 is too steep for majority of people. I have four smart watches and only paid for two because the prices were between $150-$200. Pebble time and the LG G watch are my favorite to wear.. demigod79 Smartwatches are dead already – frankly, their decline was so fast that I don’t even think they had a chance to become a fad. I predict that in the next couple of years they will be completely abandoned by manufacturers and nobody will be talking about them. I stopped wearing watches a long time ago (ever since I saw that my flip phone could tell time). Smartphones also seemed like the ultimate all-in-one device (phone, camera, email, web browser, music player, video player, game machine, etc.) so a smartwatch seemed like a step backwards. The fact that these devices offered nothing essential and had terrible battery life sealed their fate. Good riddance. Ipse Agree with all the comments about price, design and battery life. I got a Samsung ONLY because it was 100$ and does all the basic stuff I would have otherwise bought a fitness tracker for. The novelty wears off pretty quickly if there are no other compelling arguments to justify the purchase. Dmitry Avdeev Wow, what a shocker, the sales are down. But isn’t it ALWAYS the case with ANY product right after the initial hype is over? I am also surprised by all the nay-sayers here in the comments. Well, it looks like smartwatches are not your kind of product. Or you are just not that into it (read – not keen to be early adopters). Yes, this particular gadget right now is an early adopters thing, as there are still many major issues to be resolved down the road. You are right about the battery life and the price – those are two biggest issues to start with. But – again – there are ways to avoid paying too much (I am a happy owner of 1st Gen Moto 360, easily available for ~$100 on ebay brand new) or being tied to a charging cradle (use Pebble with its ~1 week battery life). I find Moto 360 to be an extremely helpful gadget. It is Google search engine on your wrist. With a voice recognition feature. Super helpful when driving for notifications. Awesome for setting up quick reminders for something when on the go. Great for tracking steps, weather and your daily agenda. You have to charge it daily (or even twice, depending how you use it), yes. I can live with it. Smartwatches are here to stay. They won’t be on every wrist in the next 5 years, that’s for sure. But they will find their niche on the market eventually, and it won’t be too small. Rich002 So all smart watch sales combined in one quarter totaled 2.7 million units. Consider that the 10th largest smart phone vendor (ZTE) sells approximately 10 million phones a quarter. Yeah! Smartwatches are dead. Some of you are in denial.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Razer Blade Stealth (late 2016) Review : Still the anti-MacBook Boss Chris Burns - Oct 24, 2016 4 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Editors' Rating: 9/10 Pros Keyboard is comfortable and customizable with Chroma Comes in black Relatively light and thin Robust and hearty feel Cons WIthout Razer Core, remains less than AAA gaming powerful USB-C power port makes tripping easy Bezel is big (but not terribly so) Razer logo still over-the-top for a laptop not explicitly gaming-aimed When I reviewed the original Razer Blade Stealth earlier this year, I suggested it was the “true MacBook alternative”. I stand by that claim, and go one further: Razer has out-done Apple in one key area. At a time when Apple is taking upwards 2-3 years to bring a refresh to their MacBooks, Razer just released 2 in 1. Less than a year after release, the Razer has another Razer Blade Stealth with upgraded specs. Is that good or is that bad, you might be thinking to yourself. I feel that it’s a bit of both. Razer is showing that they’re capable of turning around upgraded specs in a new model in a quick and efficient manner. Razer is also showing that they want the best innards possible for their notebooks at all times – no matter what. That would be a problem with a company like Apple, as they generally need time to sell off the massive amount of stock from the previous generation. Razer’s issue is often rooted in supply and demand rather than feelings of abandonment. Razer fans can’t very well feel like Razer has left them in the dust with a new model if they weren’t able to buy the old model in the first place. “The reason why we are able to make our Razer Blade systems thinner and more powerful than everyone else is because we use bespoke custom parts,” said Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan. “But that also means that manufacturing them takes longer and we have limited availability.” Razer’s CEO often comments on his own Facebook page about these sorts of issues and the reasons and fixes therein. “That much said, we’re making as many as we can and to the high standards of quality that we expect from every Razer product,” said MLT. “So please be patient and we’ll catch up with the demand at some point of time.” Razer provides and atmosphere that makes a user feel lucky to have a product in the first place. Razer making another Razer Blade Stealth is only an issue to those trying to figure out which model is newest. They all have the same name, after all. Is being an “anti-MacBook” a good thing or a bad thing, you might also be asking yourself. For Razer and its fans, it’s quite good. The Razer Blade Stealth’s design could be mistaken for a hardcore re-imagining of the Apple notebook, but then it’d be missing the point. A Razer Blade Stealth like this one delivers on the hardware quality of Apple’s MacBook Pro. At the same time, this Razer Blade Stealth runs Windows 10 – or whatever other OS you wish, if you’re handy with the code. The Razer Blade Stealth is a highest-end notebook for everyone that isn’t a big fan of Apple. It’s an amazing laptop in its own right. We’ve covered much of the ins and outs of this notebook in our original Razer Blade Stealth Review from earlier this year. This new model is almost identical, save the processor and the battery. As such, everything we’ve said about that earlier model stands for this refreshed model here in late 2016. This version of the Razer Blade Stealth has a 15% larger battery capacity than the previous model. This model keeps the 0.52-inch thinness of body that the previous model had. It also has the newest 7th-gen Intel Core i7 processor inside and comes in two display densities. Above are charts provided by Razer showing three configurations for the Razer Blade Stealth. It’s actually available in five different configurations in all. The least expensive version of the notebook with 4K display is in the gallery above, as are the two least expensive versions with WXGA+ (1440 x 900 pixel). At the highest end is a 4K version of the notebook available with 16GB of RAM and 1TB PCIe SSD storage. That version of the notebook will run users $1,999.99 USD. Or you could go all the way up to the most powerful gaming-ready desktop-replacement notebook from Razer in the Razer Blade Pro for quite a few dollars more.

I’m not sure if the one site I can find that says yes can be trusted or not. October 25, 2016 at 12:11 EST AM George Canellis October 25, 2016 Thank goodness for this update. I went from iOS 8 to iOS 10 on my iPhone 6 Plus & I regretted it. The Touch ID was excruciatingly slow. If I put the iPhone to sleep & then tried to immediately revive it, it would take a good 15-20 seconds if not more to reveal the lock screen. Since this update I now have my good ol’ iPhone back again. Thank you Apple. Good work! 👍 October 25, 2016 at 9:15 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Going back to El Crapitan there has been exactly one release where Mail worked properly … 10.11.6. 10.11.0-3 had a horrendous memory leak. 10.11.4-5 fixed that but introduced a read and deleted messages come back as unread bug. 10.12.0-1 can’t fetch mail from an Exchange server properly … good thing there’s only a few of those out there.

Updated: November 14, 2016 @ 4:53 pm Full Forecast News Sports Life Entertainment Dining Buy & Sell AP Can Samsung Recover From the Galaxy Note 7 Disaster? newsfeedback@fool.com (Evan Niu, CFA) Oct 24, 2016 0 Samsung's (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) official recall of the Galaxy Note 7 line earlier this month solidified the product as one of the biggest tech flops in recent memory. In this week's Industry Focus: Tech, The Motley Fool's Dylan Lewis and contributor Evan Niu discuss what we know about the Note 7 explosions, how Samsung's stock has been affected so far, how the company might recover from this, and how much this might hurt the business going forward. On the other side, the duo take a look at some companies that could benefit as they take up Samsung's slack. A full transcript follows the video. A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 14, 2016.

Wunder Capital: Do well and do good. Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast the dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Friday, Oct. 14, and we're talking about the fiery mess that is the Samsung Galaxy Note. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined on Skype by Fool.com senior tech specialist, Evan Niu. Evan, how's it going? Evan Niu: It's been a fun time to watch Samsung, considering I've been a longtime Samsung skeptic. Lewis: We're both Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) guys, we're both iPhone guys, so I think it's been comforting for us to know that the phones in our pocket are not going to spontaneously combust any time soon, right? Niu: It's reassuring. (laughs) I'm not worried about my phone blowing up. Lewis: On today's show, we're going to give a little rundown on what's been going on with Samsung and the Galaxy Note line over the last month-plus, how that line fits into the company's smartphone segment, and the company's financials in general. Then, which companies, if any, might benefit from some of the backlash and the recall of the Galaxy Note line. Evan, you want to get us up to speed, give us a little timeline on what's been going on? Niu: Sure. Galaxy Note 7 launched in mid-August. I think that was part of the deal -- Samsung was really wanting to beat Apple to market on timing, because, as everyone knows, iPhones come out in September. So, I think the company was really pushing toward the timeline of getting this thing out to market as quick as possible to try to beat Apple to the punch. Which is kind of silly, because it's only a month difference. How much of a difference could that make? But, apparently, that was important to Samsung. I think that's partially what's led up to these problems, they cut corners or tried to do things too fast. Things obviously just weren't ready. Then, as we know, in early and mid-September, we started to see reports of Samsung Note 7 either exploding or catching on fire, a lot of the time while they were charging. In general, sometimes you hear stories about this happening. When you're using a third-party charger that's not up to spec, that can sometimes be the culprit. But these were the official chargers, the regular Samsung chargers you were supposed to be using.  So, Samsung does this huge recall, 2.5 million units. They think they figured out that it's the batteries that they sourced in-house from the Samsung SDI internal battery division. So, they do this recall. They leave all the other phones out there that have different batteries from third-party suppliers. They start replacing phones. And now, all of the sudden, in the past week or two, the replacement phones are now catching on fire. (laughs) So, everything is a huge mess, and now they've made the call to officially kill the project altogether. That's a tough call to make, but you have to do it when it's this bad.  It's crazy, because in modern smartphone times, people take this stuff for granted. Before this one, you hadn't heard about an exploding phone, or a phone catching on fire, meaningfully, in years. At least, not at this scale, outside of isolated incidences, like the third-party charger thing I was talking about. But, you don't see this wide-scale type of thing happening. It's been years. I think most consumers have probably thought that companies have figured this out, but apparently they haven't. It's kind of crazy. Lewis: Yeah, still running into some issues on the tech side. This is, I think, brutally bad timing, given that the company is basically coming off its best earnings report in a couple years. It seemed like they had a ton of momentum, decent amount of growth in the smartphone space. Earlier this week, when the company decided to go with the full recall, they also issued an update to guidance. So, we don't even really have to speculate as to what the financial hit might look like, we can look at exactly at what the company said here. They are now expecting third-quarter operating profit to come in at 5.2 trillion South Korean won, which is roughly $4.6 billion, down from the original forecast of 7.8 trillion won. So, a decent amount of rollback there. Third-quarter revenue has also been revised down. It's now expected to be about 47 trillion won from the previous guidance of 49 trillion won. Niu: I think what's even more disconcerting about this whole thing is, Samsung still doesn't know what's wrong with the phones. They cannot figure it out. As recently as last week, there was a New York Times report that their engineers are still trying to replicate the problem, and they can't. That doesn't inspire a lot of confidence. It's one thing if they do this recall, they get the phones back, and they figure it out and presumably fix it. But, if they don't even know what's wrong, that's a huge question mark. It really calls to question all these other things about their future phones. I don't think any of their phones have had this type of problem, but going forward, unless they can figure this out and definitively say, "This is what caused it, and we have a solution ... " This is totally unrelated, but hilarious. They also had washing machines that are now blowing up. I don't know if you saw that. A couple weeks ago, there were reports -- because, Samsung makes everything, and they have these top-load washing machines, and those are now exploding. Clearly, it's a totally different thing, because those don't use lithium ion batteries like the phones do. But it's kind of like, what's going on with everything?! (laughs) Washing machines, too? Lewis: To layer on top of that, I think there are another couple reasons why this is a little bit different than your average product recall, or even food-safety-related issues, like what we've seen with Chipotle or Jack in the Box in the '90s. You talked about how they haven't been able to diagnose the problem, which doesn't inspire a lot of confidence in the other products they have out there. I think one of the other issues is, there's a lot of confusion in the Galaxy line. You look out at Samsung's product offering, frankly, it's really hard to keep all their phones straight. They intentionally moved the Note to be on the 7 naming convention, to keep it consistent with the other offerings. Now, I think you're seeing people that aren't 100% sure which products are safe, and which aren't. I saw news that they had to push notifications, I forget which product, but it was one of their newer and higher-priced phones, that -- Niu: It was the regular S7. Lewis: Right. That, those were not part of the recall, and the people who held those in their hands, if they were reading this notification, didn't need to worry about that. That's fine, but when you have a super fragmented offering, and a lot of the headlines are "Galaxy 7," and they're trying to distill it down to something like that ... Niu: Yeah. For average consumers who don't follow this stuff as closely as we do, they just see some headline about Galaxy something, 7 something. There's a Galaxy S7, there's a Galaxy S7 A, there's the Galaxy Note 7. There's so many, and they're all part of the Galaxy brand that Samsung has put so much money into building. They put tens of millions of dollars into building this brand over the past five or 10 years. And now, this one horribly botched product risks killing all that brand value. It's not uncommon for Samsung to spend more money on marketing, advertising, kickbacks, commissions to retailers and all that, than it does on R&D. It puts a ton of money into this, and now, because they're unified, they're all getting dragged down. They're trying to contain this thing, like you said, notifications saying, "Your phone is safe." It sounds exactly like the phone is not safe. But, "The phone is safe, don't worry." Lewis: I think one of the other things that makes this tougher -- and returning back from this a little tougher -- is the product life cycles of smartphones. You look at a place like Chipotle, fast casual, they're able to give away a ton of free product via coupons, Chiptopia, that kind of stuff, and get people back in restaurants relatively quickly, because meals are a routine purchase for people. Smartphones are not. You're buying a phone every two years. Once you get someone in an ecosystem, the likelihood of them staying there is a lot higher. So, I worry there's going to be this class of people coming onto smartphones, or maybe people that recently decided to make the switch over to the Galaxy line, specifically the Galaxy Note line, that they're second-guessing it, might go with another Android device, might decide to go over to something on the iOS side. Niu: Yeah. That's exactly the thing they need to figure out. Samsung is really good at hardware. Samsung has tried so hard over the past 10 years to get better at software, but of course, they have to get Android from Google, and they do their whole modifications and tweaks, this stuff they put on top of it to try to differentiate. But the point remains that Samsung isn't actually good at that stuff. Their software is not very good. They're really good at hardware. If all the sudden, their hardware is having all these problems, there's really not a good reason to buy a Samsung phone. Historically, their hardware has been incredibly well-made. But now, there's no reason. If their one strength is now being called into question ... Lewis: People are going to go elsewhere. Niu: Exactly. And, even if you want to stay with an Android, there's tons of really good Android phones out there.  Lewis: I think, to help adjust for this a little bit, Samsung is offering customers about $75 to trade in their devices for other Samsung models. That's a good retention effort. They might save some lost customers along the way. But it wouldn't be surprising to see some flight from the brand. One of the other reasons I think this is troubling is the timing in the calendar year. This is ahead of the holiday season, and it's the biggest time of the year for consumer electronics. To have to wipe out an entire product line ahead of the quarter where you're probably going to be doing 40% of your business, at least ... Niu: And one of their most expensive, most profitable products, too. Lewis: Yeah. That's rough, that's really hard to deal with that, as a business.  Niu: Yeah. This is the time, holiday shopping season. Everyone makes all their money here. And now, Samsung has to pull one of their flagship...the Note 7 has been a differentiator compared to the iPhone for a long time, because it comes with a stylus, it's bigger. It was like the posterboy for phablets. Samsung has established itself as the phablet leader, and Apple now has the 7 Plus, which isn't as big as the Note 7 and doesn't have a stylus. But other than that, it's pretty comparable, as far as giant phones go. Lewis: Yeah. I started briefly introducing what the company was expecting for revenue writedown and revised guidance. It looks like analysts were expecting the company to ship about 15 to 19 million units from Q3 2016 through Q1 2017. To put that into context, Samsung shipped between 75 million and 78 million smartphones last quarter. So, while this is a big deal, it's a fancy new line they were really trying to get some momentum behind, in the grander scheme of their product mix, it's actually maybe about 10% or so. I don't think it's as big of a deal as people realize. Niu: I think the big difference is, a lot of Samsung's volume comes from these low-end, cheaper smartphones in places like India. They sell phones that are $50 to $100. They're not making a lot of money on that, but they ship a lot of units, which helps them keep their rank in the smartphone market. Like you mentioned, it's a lot more than Apple, 75 million on a non-holiday quarter, that's a ton of phones. But a lot of those are low-margin, low-value units versus these high-end phones -- that's where these companies make their margins. I think it has a leverage effect, in that it seems smaller in terms of units. But it had a pretty big impact on operating profits. Generally speaking, mobile is about half of Samsung's business, in terms of revenue and operating profit, roughly, before this whole thing. Mobile includes a bunch of things, like tablet and these phones. But the mobile segment itself is incredibly important to them. Within the mobile segment if you look at the margin profile within their mobile business, these high-end phones are quite important in terms of profitability. Those low-end phones get a lot of volume, but considering that Samsung is largely a hardware player, if they sell a low-end phone to someone, it's not like they're capturing that customer on to their platform like Google or Apple would be. They're just trying to sell the phone. So, I think it won't have a huge impact on total volumes. But I think, again, coming back to the brand, it's so damaging for the brand. That's something that's really hard to put a number on right now -- brand valuation. I think that's the bigger thing here. Missing out on one product cycle is one thing, if it's contained within this product cycle. But if there's lasting damage to the brand, they could be hurting for a long time. Lewis: I think that's why you've seen market reaction to this actually not be so bad. Short-term, if we're to take the company at the guidance that they're giving, and we look at the product mix, and they're able to hold the volumes on those other brands, the drop that we've seen makes sense. I think if you look back to when this story originally broke, the company was down about 4% or 5%, which really isn't all that crazy given that this is one of their most consumer-facing and high-profile lines. They do have so many other offerings in the smartphone market. If those hold, there shouldn't be too much of an issue there. One of the things people might not realize about Samsung is, they're a little bit more diversified than your Apple, in terms of the different hardware arenas that they've planned. To give you an idea of their revenue mix, consumer electronics is about 22% of revenue, and that does not include smartphones. IT and mobile communications, as you said before, a little over 50% of revenue. Device solutions, which is the semiconductor and display panel business, 36% of revenue. The IT and mobile is the highest-margin business that they are in, and having a high-profile phone, a high-ASP phone (average selling price), being removed, might lead to some margin compression there. But if they're able to hold on the other brands, I think this muted reaction from the market makes sense. Niu: Yeah, I guess we'll just have to see if they can successfully pull off this crisis management. I think it's a good thing to kill those phones, definitely, especially when you don't know what's going on. You have to bite the bullet. Lewis: Absolutely. In the second half of the show, we're going to hit briefly on a couple companies that might be poised to benefit as Samsung goes into crisis mode. But before we do, what if you could help combat global climate change, and make money at the same time?

So, Evan, we talked about how the premium side of the smartphone market could see some shake-up. We might see some consumers that were interested in the Galaxy line, maybe they were Galaxy Note owners, taking this opportunity to either try an iOS device, maybe another Android device. Do you think there are any big beneficiaries with this? Niu: I think there are definitely some winners and losers. If we start with the loser list, I think it's a little bit shorter, because Samsung is mostly self-contained in terms of its suppliers. Samsung is so directly integrated that it makes most of the components that go to its phones. It still has some third-party part suppliers. But as far as supply relationships go that might suffer from reduced unit volumes, it's mostly going to be within Samsung itself. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) probably loses a little bit because the Snapdragon 820 is inside the U.S. variants -- Keep up with money news, sent to your inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. Lewis: Can you explain what the Snapdragon does? Niu: Snapdragon is the main applications processor that has integrated modem and all these things. It's one of the most important pieces of any phone, the processor. Samsung, what they do is they have all these different variants for different geographies. Samsung has been trying to ship to its own in-house Exynos processor. I think the last year, they were exclusively Exynos, with no Snapdragon, but this year, Qualcomm has gotten back into the mix, they've improved their chips a little bit and got more competitive. There's some variance for different geographies, and Qualcomm is in the U.S. variance. So, they'll lose a little bit, since they obviously won't be selling into this phone anymore. But there's kind of a hedge, because Qualcomm does sell a lot into Apple. If people buy iPhones instead of the Note 7, probably incrementally negative to Qualcomm, but they're not totally out of the picture. Lewis: Right, you might be a little pinched, but nothing crazy. Niu: Right, there's a little bit of a hedge, there's a silver lining. And of course, it depends on which iPhone you get, because not Qualcomm has lost a little bit of spot in the iPhone, because Qualcomm used to be the exclusive modem supplier, and for the first time ever, Apple has gone to Intel -- well, first time not including Infineon 10 years ago. Now, this year, Apple is now buying modems from Qualcomm and Intel, depending on which phone you get. As far as pure winners, I would say certainly Apple. Lewis: Yeah, I think they're up 10% since some of the products issues around the Note 7 surfaced. The market certainly seems to think -- Niu: Yeah, there was already iPhone 7 optimism, and now the shares just keep going higher. They're at 2016 highs because of all this stuff that's going on with Samsung. I think it's pretty clear that a lot of people are probably going to try. And we've already been seeing Android switching rates continue to rise every quarter. Apple touts this every quarter, every quarter they're like, "highest Android switcher rates ever." I think that trend is going to continue, particularly with one of the biggest Android OEMs hitting into this wall here. As I mentioned, Intel is now in some of the iPhones. So Intel, to the extent that people are buying the phones with their modem, they benefit. Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), I think, is a big winner here too. They actually just released earnings that were pretty strong. Taiwan Semiconductor is producing Apple's A10 Fusion chip. Another change this year is that, in prior years, Apple had been dual-sourcing its chip manufacturing from both Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor, which started one or two years ago. They only brought on Taiwan Semiconductor one or two years ago. But now, supposedly, with all the indications that we're getting, it's exclusively to TSMC, which is a huge win for them and a huge blow to Samsung, in terms of the foundry business on the chip manufacturing side. That's a lot more chips that Taiwan Semi is going to be making for Apple. They just released earnings; it was pretty strong, came in above expectations. I don't remember the exact numbers. But the important thing is that Taiwan Semiconductor raised fourth-quarter guidance, and that raised guidance did not factor in the possibility of these other phones being discontinued. So they were already super bullish, even before factoring in the Note 7's discontinuation into their forecast. So, I think they're really going to bank this holiday quarter if Apple sells enough phones. That's a ton of orders going to TSMC to make these A10 Fusion chips. I think they're probably a pretty big winner here. Lewis: Yeah, I think a lot of people tend to read into the commentary we get from component manufacturers that go into the iPhone as a general baseline for how that segment might be doing when Apple reports again. If you're seeing guidance up from Taiwan Semiconductor, that probably bodes well for the iPhone business. Niu: Yeah. And even before the Samsung Note -- that's what blew me away -- their guidance was so strong, and they literally said, "This does not include any impact if the Note 7 is discontinued," which it has been. So, it looks really good for them. As far as third-party carriers or retailers are concerned, I think they're pretty ambivalent. They're just trying to do their best to help their customers not be in danger. Their brands aren't going to be affected, and they're not going to be bearing a lot of cost because Samsung is going to be paying for all of this. So most of the retailers and carriers just want to do what's right for the customer and get these things off the market. I don't think there's going to be any damage to them. Lewis: I've seen [Alphabet's] Google thrown around in the list of potential winners as well. The idea is kind of similar with Apple -- they released the Pixel phone somewhat recently. Having a major potential competitor off the table bodes well for people giving that a shot. That's not going to be something that meaningfully contributes to the numbers for Google. I think, when you're talking about Apple and Google here, seeing Samsung falter and knowing that there might be a slightly larger bite of the smartphone market available to them isn't something that's thesis-altering. It's certainly interesting for some of the component manufacturers that are specifically in some of these devices and not others. But big picture, if you like Apple and Google already, stick with them. But don't buy solely on the idea that they might pick up some incremental business here. Niu: Yeah. The Pixel looks like a pretty good phone. Of course, it's Google's first phone, they designed the whole thing. They're outsourcing manufacturing, naturally, to HTC. But as far as them designing the phone itself, this is the first time that they're really doing the whole thing. It looks like a really good phone. I think, definitely, people that are not getting the Note 7 might consider the Pixel, because it's a pure Google phone stock Android without all the third-party software and all this stuff on it. But I think the biggest challenge there in terms of getting people to switch from a Note 7 to a Pixel XL or whatever the large one is called, it's really just about distribution. Google doesn't have distribution channels in the way that most companies in the space do. They're partnering with Verizon, which is the only carrier partner. Other than that, they're selling it online through the online store. But, it might surprise you how many people, when they need a new phone, they go to the carrier store. They just go to the retail store. Lewis: It becomes kind of a default decision, right? Niu: Yeah. And it makes some sense, because that's where they have the most selection, they can deal with all their plan stuff. I personally tend to buy things online, and I think a lot of people do. But, carrier distribution is an incredibly important channel for any phone maker. People that already know which phone they want they'll just go and buy that phone online. But a lot of people don't know, and they still like to shop around, like any other product in their lives, versus people like you and me are probably so loyal that it's not even a decision, it's just, when am I going to get my iPhone? But, for a lot of people, their phone breaks, or it's time for an upgrade, they just go to the carrier store and pick one. For the other carriers other than Verizon, Pixel's not going to be there, because Google is distributing themselves. It's harder for Google to get these carrier relationships going, because the carriers want more control. It's harder for Google to negotiate because they've never been a big player in the physical smartphone space. So I think the biggest thing that's going to hold them back is their lack of distribution. Lewis: It sounds like the rundown for investors here is, Apple, Google, possible beneficiaries. The people that might really see some importance swings in what goes on with their numbers are some of the component manufacturers like you talked about, Taiwan Semiconductor. My feeling is, for Samsung's business, if they're able to keep the bad PR and negative brand association contained to the Note line, then this won't be something that's really awful for them long-term. If it does start to bleed into the other products they offer, the S7 and things like that, it could spell trouble for their mobile segment for a long time. Niu: Yeah, the main thing is to figure out what the hell is going on with these things. Clearly, if they launch a phone next year and it has the same thing, that would thesis altering, two in a row. And, if they can't figure it out, there's reason to think that-there might be another one. Lewis: Yeah, I think a lot of consumers want them to know exactly what's going on and tell the public. Then we might see a nice rally in Samsung sales. Niu: They can't replicate this in their labs! It's just crazy. Lewis: Anything else before I let you go, Evan? Niu: No, I think we hit it all.

Apple didn’t give a specific release date for the Nike+ watch at that time, but now that detail has been revealed. The Apple Watch Nike+ will be available starting this Friday, October 28, from Apple.com, Nike.com, Apple and Nike retail stores, and other retailers. Pricing will be set at $369 for the 38mm watch and $399 for the larger 42mm version. This version of the Apple Watch Series 2 comes with a few special features. Those include special watch bands, unique watch faces, and a Nike+ Run Club app that’ll motivate you to go for a run and show you challenges from your friends. This Apple Watch Nike+ features the same body as the Apple Watch Series 2. That means that it includes GPS and is water resistant up to 50 meters. The look of the Apple Watch Nike+ is definitely unique thanks to the watch band’s holes, which Apple says reduces the weight of the band and improves ventilation. Those features plus the Nike+ Run Club app make this the Apple Watch to get if you’re at all interested in running. And the good news is that if you’re not quite feeling the bright green holes in two of the watch bands, there are two other bands available that are a bit more subdued.

Analyst house IDC reported a 51.6 per cent drop in smartwatch sales, with just 2.7 million wrist-mounted computers shipped in the third quarter of the year, compared to 5.6 million over the same period last year. Apple and Lenovo both suffered a 70+ per cent fall in sales. "It has also become evident that at present smartwatches are not for everyone," said Jitesh Ubrani, senior research analyst for IDC Mobile Device Trackers. "Having a clear purpose and use case is paramount, hence many vendors are focusing on fitness due to its simplicity. However, moving forward, differentiating the experience of a smartwatch from the smartphone will be key, and we're starting to see early signs of this as cellular integration is rising and as the commercial audience begins to pilot these devices." Fitness is still king, and the only vendor to show serious growth was Garmin, which saw sales of its sporty smartwatches rise 324 per cent over the year, taking it to second place in vendor shipments with 20 per cent of the market. That's a ray of sunshine for the firm, which has seen its commercial GPS market severely shrunken with the popularity of smartphones. Apple still dominates the smartwatch market, with over 41 per cent of units shipped. Samsung saw sales rise just 9 per cent to hold onto third place, while Pebble – arguably the firm that kicked off the smartwatch craze – saw sales decline 54.1 per cent to just 100,000 units and barely 3 per cent of the market. "The sharp decline in smartwatch shipment volumes reflects the way platforms and vendors are realigning," noted Ramon Llamas, research manager for IDC's wearables team. "Apple revealed a new look and feel to watchOS that did not arrive until the launch of the second generation Watch at the end of September. Google's decision to hold back Android Wear 2.0 has repercussions for its OEM partners as to whether to launch devices before or after the holidays. Samsung's Gear S3, announced at IFA in September, has yet to be released. Collectively, this left vendors relying on older, aging devices to satisfy customers." Apple's latest Watch incarnation could spur the market, although it's not clear if the new designs will generate that much demand. Google slowing Android Wear updates is potentially more serious, since that operating system powers a large chunk of available models. But taking into account the results for the second quarter of the year, where shipments fell 32 per cent, it does appear that the demand for wrist-candy is on the wane. While there are some people willing to spend hundreds of dollars on a wrist-mounted screen for their smartphone, most people don't seem enthused by the concept. Apple is reportedly already closing down some of the pop-up kiosks set up to flog its Watch gizmo, and it was notable that Google barely mentioned the technology in its huge new-product splurge earlier this month. While shipments in the low millions might continue, mass-market credibility may never come for the technology. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 96 Comments More from The Register iPhone fatigue and fading Samsung.

Apple is forecast to report iPhone sales of about 45 million units today when it releases earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter, according to analysts, marking the third successive quarter of decline for its flagship product. That would take total iPhone sales to 211 million for Apple’s 2016 financial year, about 9 per cent lower than the previous year. Though the drop has been expected by investors based on Apple’s guidance, the result is a stark turnaround after a blockbuster 2015, in which iPhone sales surged 37 per cent to 231 million, thanks to huge demand for the iPhone 6. While the iPhone 6S was unable to sustain that level of growth, many on Wall Street have become more optimistic about the prospects for Apple’s latest model, which some analysts say may be boosted by Samsung’s withdrawal of its Note7 smartphone following a spate of battery fires. “We believe investor expectations have already moved higher,” said Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner. But she expected a limited impact on Apple’s shares, which have risen almost a fifth in the past three months, given that the renewed iPhone momentum was “well telegraphed”. Although iPhone unit sales are among the most closely watched figures, analysts are expecting a rise in the average selling price of a handset due to the popularity of the iPhone 7 Plus, which is sold out for weeks on Apple’s website. But some are concerned that supply constraints, particularly for the shiny “Jet Black” model, may limit growth. While many on Wall Street expect that Apple’s smartphone sales will be little better than flat year-on-year in the December quarter, more bullish investors are already looking at a larger wave of upgrades by customers when next year’s iPhone arrives. “The real catalyst (to Apple’s stock) is the 2018 supercycle,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley in a recent note, which predicted “accelerating growth” driving its shares back towards the peak of the iPhone 6 era.

In court papers obtained by TMZ, Knight alleges that Dre did not want to pay him his 30 per cent stake in Beats by Dre after he sold the company to Apple.  Knight claims that he was owed the money because of a lifetime contract between him and Dre, but that Apple did not want him associated with the brand because he is currently on trial and facing a murder charge in the death of Terry Carter. He is asking for $300million in his lawsuit, claiming that Dre made $1billion in the deal with Apple. Dre's lawyer said in a statesmen after Knight filed his lawsuit: 'Given that Dre has had zero interaction with Suge since leaving Death Row Records in 1996, we hope that Suge's lawyer has lots of malicious prosecution insurance.'  Scroll down for video Suge Knight (above in 2007) claims in a new lawsuit that Dr. Dre twice hired a hit man to have him killed Knight claims that Dre (above) did not want to pay him the 30 per cent share he was owed after the rapper sold Beats by Dre to Apple Knight claims that the first time Dre tried to have him killed was in September 2014, when a gunman opened fire at a MTV Video Music Award hosted by Chris Brown at 1OAK in Los Angeles. He was shot multiple times in the abdomen, chest and arm and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department later said through a spokesperson that the gunman appeared to target Knight. In his lawsuit however Knight claims that a man named T-Money who was later questioned by the police said that he was hired by Dre to target Knight.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Jared Fogle's wife sues Subway claiming the sandwich company...

Share this article Share 170 shares No arrests have been made in the case two years later, and earlier this year Knight sued party host Brown for failing to provide adequate security at the venue. That lawsuit also accuses Brown of having gang ties, as well as a 'well-documented track record of hosting events and/or parties in which violence frequently erupted.' Knight claims that just a few months later, in January, Dre again tried to have him murdered, this time by Cle 'Bone' Sloan.  That incident occurred on the same day that Knight drove over Carter, killing the man. Knight has claimed he only acted in self-defense however, trying to escape from Sloan.  'I f***** him up!' Sloan, a former gang member, told the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department shortly after he too was hit by Knight's car. Sloan reportedly admitted to attacking Knight, the co-founder of Death Row records, as he lay in a hospital bed suffering from multiple head wounds.  In his lawsuit, Knight claims that Dre paid Sloan $300,000 to try and have him killed that day. Knight is also suing Apople and Tam's, the fast food restaurant where the incident with Sloan and Carter occurred in January of last year.

Comments By Gregg Keizer Follow Computerworld | Oct 24, 2016 1:20 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Apple iOS MacOS Apple Mac Apple Comments Apple today released the first significant updates for both iOS and macOS. iOS 10.1 includes a host of enhancements and bug fixes, but the signature addition is Portrait Camera, a feature previously touted by Apple for the iPhone 7 Plus only. Using the dual cameras of the iPhone 7 Plus, Portrait Camera creates a depth-of-field effect that presents the foreground in sharp focus but the background in a slight blur. iOS 10.1 introduces the feature as a beta, a move Apple has used in the past, most notably with its Maps, to excuse the initial results, collect data from users, then slowly improve the underlying software. Apple also patched 13 security vulnerabilities with iOS 10.1. Apple debuted iOS 10 on Sept. 13. The operating system will run on iPhone 5 and later, iPad Pro, iPad Air and later, iPad Mini 2 and later, and the fifth-generation iPod Touch. macOS Sierra 10.12.1, meanwhile, patches 16 vulnerabilities and addresses several non-security flaws. Among the latter are a compatibility improvement with Microsoft Office, and a fix to a Mail updating issue. Sierra, which runs on most Macs sold in 2009-2010 and later, hit the Mac App Store on Sept. 20.

Nike’s version of the Apple Watch did not debut with the Apple Watch Series 2, which became available on September 16th. Instead, Apple Watch Nike+ will go on sale October 28. 2016. The Apple Watch Nike+ features a custom watch face and four distinct bands. As we reported after the September 7th event: The new Nike-branded Apple Watch consists of a custom watch face available only to buyers of the watch, and a custom band. The band is basically a standard Sport band in construction, but includes distinctive holes throughout the surface, the interiors of which are a different color than the surrounding area. The result stands out, and I actually quite like it. The band is available in four different colors, which vary the scheme between light and dark gray and a neon yellow-green (Nike calls the color "Volt"). The watch face mirrors these colors, and is available in several different styles, all which incorporate Nike's distinctive font and logo. The Apple Watch Nike+ also includes a permanent complication along the bottom of the display for the Nike+ Run Club app, which I assume comes preinstalled on the devices since the Complication can't be removed. Earlier this month, Apple updated its website with a teaser that said the Apple Watch Nike+ would debut on October 28, 2016. That was confirmed by Apple today with a press release. According to Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer: Running is one of the world’s most popular activities for staying in shape and being healthy, and with Apple Watch Nike+, runners will be even more motivated to achieve their performance goals…. The response so far has been incredible and we’re thrilled to get Apple Watch Nike+ onto customers’ wrists starting Friday. The Apple Watch Nike+ comes in an aluminum finish and is priced the same as the Apple Watch Series 2. The watch will be available on Friday in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Columbia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Macau, Malaysia, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the UK, and the US, with other countries being added shortly thereafter.

(Getty Images/iStockphoto) Patience is the approach used by the billionaire investor Warren Buffett. (Getty Images/iStockphoto) JOHN REESE Three stocks that Buffett and Lynch would like Add to ... John Reese Special to The Globe and Mail Published Monday, Oct. 24, 2016 4:03PM EDT Last updated Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2016 8:15AM EDT Comments AA John Reese is CEO of Validea.com and Validea Capital, and portfolio manager for the National Bank Consensus funds. Globe Investor has a distribution agreement with Validea.ca, a premium Canadian stock screen service. Try it. If only they had seen it coming. Investors often regret missing out on the Apple or Costco or FedEx that could have turned their $10,000 nest eggs into million-dollar lottery jackpots had they simply recognized the opportunity early and stuck with it. It’s easy to judge stocks by their past performance. Twenty years ago, Apple traded at less than $1 (U.S.); now, it’s north of $117. Costco shares have gone from approximately $12 to $149 over the same time, and Monster Beverage from 8 cents to $147. These all look like solid gold performers. What investors tend to overlook, however, is the volatile journey these stocks – and these companies – have had over time. After all, Apple, Costco and Monster started out as small unknown companies decades ago and had a fair number of skeptics and stumbles along their way to becoming large companies and familiar brands. As former investment columnist Morgan Housal pointed out earlier in the year, Monster, which is one of the top performing stocks since 1995, has seen four distinct drops of 50 per cent or more over the past two decades, lost 66 per cent value twice and the shares fell more than 75 per cent once. Having the gumption to stay invested in the stock would be almost impossible for most investors. But successful long-term investing is less about finding the next big thing and more about finding well-run businesses with reliable returns and not overpaying when buying those stocks. Patience is the approach used by the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway has held some of his handpicked investments for decades. Mr. Buffett looks at a company’s record over many years to find those with strong management, consistent profits and good long-term prospects. These are better barometers of a stock’s performance than the near term trading activity would suggest. In his 1988 letter to Berkshire shareholders, which references his purchase of a large stake of Coca-Cola that year, he borrows a phrase from Peter Lynch, the former Fidelity Magellan Fund star manager. “When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favourite holding period is forever,” Mr. Buffett wrote. “We are just the opposite of those who hurry to sell and book profits when companies perform well but who tenaciously hang on to businesses that disappoint. Peter Lynch aptly likens such behaviour to cutting the flowers and watering the weeds.” Berkshire has stuck with Coke shares, which have gone from about $2.30 to more than $42, to this day. Speaking of Mr. Lynch, he prevailed over Magellan at a time when the S&P 500 was on a long bull run, but even that wasn’t without major shocks such as the 1987 crash, when markets fell more than 30 per cent. Markets would go on to recover and Mr. Lynch’s approach continued to produce strong returns for Magellan. Mr. Lynch used to say it didn’t matter how many winning stocks you had in your portfolio, as long as you had enough of them over the course of time. “If seven out of 10 of my stocks perform as expected, then I’m delighted. If six out of 10 of my stocks perform as expected, then I’m thankful. Six out of 10 is all it takes to produce an enviable record on Wall Street.” That is to say, many stocks aren’t winners. Public companies fail or merge into other companies or their shares lag competitors. And investors with fewer resources than Mr. Buffett and Mr. Lynch might not have the opportunity to park their money in a single stock for decades. Investors who are willing to stick it out get paid based on that risk. Over the long-term they accept that volatility is going to be a big part of their journey. Here are three stocks that fit the styles of Mr. Buffett and Mr. Lynch. United HealthGroup This Minnetonka, Minn., managed health-care provider matches with Mr. Buffett’s style of investing because of its above-average return on equity. The company has averaged ROE of 17 per cent over the past decade, only slipping once below Mr. Buffett’s preferred 15-per-cent hurdle. Ingersoll Rand The maker of equipment used to control the air and environment in offices and homes falls under the Lynch strategy, which favours companies that have several years of fast earnings growth. Ingersoll’s growth in earnings per share has been 23 per cent based on the average of the past few years. The growth combined with the valuation gives the stock a price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio of 0.52, a positive for our Lynch-based model. Wells Fargo One of the biggest American banks has a friend in Mr. Buffett, who is its largest shareholder with a 10-per-cent stake. Wells shares have been battered by regulatory and public scrutiny following a scandal over unauthorized customer accounts, but its solid brand and strong market share give it the industry positioning Mr. Buffett likes in his companies. Shares are down 20 per cent since mid-2015, but the fundamentals and now lower valuation help the stock get high scores based on the Lynch and Cornerstone Value quantitative approaches.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « IDC Lists Apple as the Number One Smartwatch Vendor in the World for Q3 2016 | Main | LG's Big Gamble on a Modular Smartphone Dies while Samsung Continues to seek an iPhone Killing Form Factor » October 24, 2016 Apple Releases iOS 10.1 with 'Portrait Mode' that delivers the All-New Professional Level 'Bokeh' Effect   During Apple's iPhone event on September 7, Phil Schiller, Senior VP worldwide marketing at Apple talked about a "big breakthrough in photography" that was part of iPhone 7. The breakthrough was Apple's new dual camera depth camera. He provided his audience with a "Sneak Peek" of this feature known as Bokeh or the Bokeh Effect as noted in our cover graphic. This photo was the one that Schiller used in his keynote to talk about taking an incredibly sharp photo in the forefront that had a beautiful blur in the background so that focus of those looking at the photo was on the subject. Schiller noted that "This is called Shallow Depth of Field. This is a technique that is really useful for things like portrait pictures. It's something that is illustrative of a great camera that often has a very large photo sensor or a really big fast lens." Schiller told his audience that this was coming by way of a software upgrade for the iPhone 7 Plus this fall and today Apple delivered on that promise.   Apple's iOS 10.1 update brings Portrait mode to iPhone 7 Plus customers starting today, adding a beautiful new photo feature to the world's most popular camera. Apple notes in a press release that "Using both 12-megapixel cameras on iPhone 7 Plus and advanced machine learning, Portrait mode applies a depth-of-field effect to make your foreground subject sharp while creating a beautifully blurred background. This effect, also known as "bokeh" and previously only capable on DSLR cameras, turns the camera you carry around with you everyday into an even more powerful photography tool."   One of Apple's patents covering a 3D depth camera was revealed back in July in a report titled "Apple Wins a Patent that may Relate to the new iPhone 7 Dual Camera System."   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums iOS 10.1 update includes portrait mode beta for iPhone 7 Plus by Wayne Manion  1:48 PM on October 24, 2016 One of the promised benefits of the second 12-megapixel camera Apple saw fit to add to the iPhone 7 Plus was a "portrait mode" that could simulate the "bokeh," or background blur, characteristic of high-end cameras with large sensors. The  iOS 10.1 update takes the portrait mode feature from keynote slides to customer handsets, at least in beta form. Apple says the iPhone 7 Plus uses the pair of 12-megapixel cameras in conjunction with "advanced machine learning" to apply the depth-of-field effect. Apple has a press release with a collection of photos where the portrait mode appears to work—like magic, of course. Those at The Verge who have used the feature claim the actual results of portrait mode are "hit and miss." In situations where the feature doesn't work, the site says the resulting images end up looking "obviously fake." The feature is still in beta, to be fair, so perhaps further development will improve the consistency of the software's results. The iOS 10.1 release notes mention more updated content. The camera app underwent some minor changes alongside the portrait mode update. Transit content for Japan is now available, including information about Japanese train and ferry lines. Several bug fixes involving the Apple Watch are also included in the 10.1 update. Unlike in the Android universe, users with supported devices can expect an efficient and orderly rollout of the release to their handsets, without the third-party manufacturer and carrier meddling that plague Android updates. Users who want to apply the update can check the settings app of their iDevices now.

Tech in Asia Advertisement Apple (IW 500/2) is battling to gain a foothold in Indonesia after nationalistic regulations hit the tech giant's efforts to compete in the booming emerging market against Samsung and other rivals. The iPhone 6S and 7 are yet to be released in Southeast Asia's top economy as Apple struggles to fulfill requirements that phone makers must have 20% "local content" for 4G handsets sold in the country. South Korea's Samsung has been able to meet the demands and gain a share of the market in Indonesia -- a country of 255 million people, with an army of young consumers -- more than 25 times bigger than Apple. Officials say the regulations that came into force this year are aimed at supporting the growth of the local manufacturing industry, which lags behind its Asian peers, and plan to raise the local content requirement to 30 percent at the start of next year. Popular Now Tesla’s Future in Trump’s World Who is Killing American Manufacturing? The Automotive Industry: Economic Impact And Location Issues But to critics, it is just the latest example of misguided nationalistic rules that hamper rather than help business in Indonesia, which is ranked 109th on the World Bank's ease of doing business index. The new rules "force companies to rethink the entire supply chain and that is expensive for them to do," said Sudev Bangah of International Data Corp. (IDC), a consumer technology market research firm. Apple has encountered problems in other emerging markets, notably India where the Silicon Valley giant is facing roadblocks in its quest to open stores instead of selling products through third-party retailers. The Indian government reportedly refused in May to exempt Apple from rules stating foreign single-brand retailers must buy at least 30% of their parts locally to open their own outlets. Local content rules In Indonesia meeting the local content rules has been easier for Samsung, as it already had factories in the country, and has added assembly lines to the plants to carry out the final stages of production. Other competitors, including Asus, Lenovo, Oppo and Blackberry -- which used to dominate in Indonesia but has seen its market share obliterated -- have also taken steps to fulfil the government's demands. However officials admit that so far the rules are not boosting Indonesia's phone manufacturing industry as they had hoped. Firms have met the demands by getting local vendors to supply simple parts, such as boxes, manuals and chargers, and hi-tech components are still being imported. But Apple, which makes most of its handsets in China, has not yet met the requirements. Its iPhone 6S was never released in Indonesia while the 7, currently being rolled out globally, seems unlikely to hit the country's shops any time soon. Even before the new rules came into effect, things were not easy for Apple in Indonesia. The iPhone 6 made it into the local market in early 2015, but it was the last country in the world where the model was released as the firm had a tough time getting import licenses, according to a source close to the matter. An Apple spokeswoman refused to comment when contacted by AFP. Still, government officials pushing the new scheme appear unfazed. "With the local content requirement, we hope the component industry can grow," Dini Hanggandari, an official overseeing communications technology at the industry ministry, said, adding that smartphone imports had in recent years contributed to Indonesia's negative trade balance.

You can install the roughly 200 MB update via Settings > General > Software Update or through iTunes. The major addition in this update is the addition of Portrait mode in the Camera app for iPhone 7 Plus users. Portrait mode focuses on faces while blurring backgrounds to create a depth effect in photos. Glenn Fleishman took a deep dive into this feature in an iOS beta in “Behind the iPhone 7 Plus’s Portrait Mode” (24 September 2016). Although iOS 10.1 is now out for everyone, Apple is still labeling the Portrait mode feature as a beta. iOS 10.1 includes a few fixes for Camera and Photos: People names are now included in iCloud backups, the display of wide color gamut photos has been improved in the grid views of the Photos app, a bug causing blurred or flashing screens when opening the Camera app has been fixed, and a bug that caused Photos to quit when turning on iCloud Photo Library has also been fixed. Another notable change in iOS 10.1 is that you can now replay bubble and screen effects in Messages — tap Replay under a message to see the effect again. Note that Replay appears only on received messages, not messages you sent with an effect. In iOS 10.1, Messages effects play even if you have Reduce Motion enabled, which could cause some people discomfort. The update also fixes issues that could lead to incorrect display of contact names, blank white screens, missing Report Junk options, and video messages with missing audio. Japanese mass transit users may want to update to iOS 10.1 right away, since Maps now provides transit directions for every major train, subway, ferry, and national bus line, as well as for local bus systems in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya. Also, sign-based transit navigation includes more detailed underground maps, and you can now compare transit fares for alternate routes. Apple Watch owners see some changes in iOS 10.1 too. Apple added Distance and Average Pace to the workout summaries in the Activity app for wheelchair-based workouts. The update also fixes bugs that: Prevented Music playlists from syncing to the watch Prevented invitations and data from appearing in Activity Sharing Allowed Activity Sharing to update over cellular even when disabled Caused some third-party apps to crash while entering text iOS 10.1 features a number of miscellaneous updates, including improved Bluetooth connectivity, better AirPlay Mirroring performance, improved sharing from Safari to Messages, fixes for Mail formatting (we hope this fixes a few recent quirks with emailed TidBITS articles), a fix for Today View widgets not loading when launched, a fix for alarms that wouldn’t go off, and a resolution for a bug that prevented restoring from iCloud backups. See the release notes for a full list. Last, but far from least, iOS 10.1 includes 12 security fixes for a variety of vulnerabilities.

Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2016-10-24 22:17 Well according to Apple's info on the security content of iOS 10.1, it doesn't apply to my iPad Mini 3. Guess they decided to leave it insecure. I was hoping they would be announcing the 2017 iPad models this month since the 2016 models were released in Oct 2015. Reply  Search   Cached.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple Pay launches in Japan By Christian Zibreg, Oct 24, 2016 Tweet 1 Comment Apple Pay today launched in Japan, one of Apple’s most important markets and home to population of 127 million souls. Marking its twelfth major market, Apple Pay permits Japanese customers to make private credit and prepaid card purchases in stores, online and in apps, plus commute and pay for everyday items with Suica from JR East. To support the service, Apple today issued the free iOS 10.1 software update which has enabled support for transit directions in Japan to help users find ride details, including fare breakdowns that automatically show Suica pricing on their device. Some of the launch merchants for Apple Pay include convenience stores like 7-Eleven, Circle K, Family Mart, Lawson, Ministop and Sunkus, supermarkets such as AEON, APITA and PIAGO, gas stations including ENEOS and Esso Mobil General, retailers like BicCamera, Matsumoto Kiyoshi and Uniqlo and local brands such as JapanTaxi and Sukiya. Apple Pay is also accepted at all locations that accept the Suica prepaid money card, QuicPay or iD. In addition to making purchases, users can easily buy or reload a Suica card or commuter pass using the Wallet app on their iPhone. The iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and Apple Watch Series 2 models sold in Japan feature hardware support for FeliCa Type-F NFC contactless technology. FeliCa technology is used for more than 160 million transactions across Japan. Users continue to receive all of the rewards and beneﬁts offered by their cards. Major Japanese financial brands are supporting Apple Pay at launch. The official support document explains that Apple’s mobile payments service works with credit and prepaid cards issued by Japanese financial institutions like American Express, Mastercard, JCB, iD, QUICPay, AEON, Credit Saison, JCB, Mitsubishi UFJ Nicos, Orient Corporation, Sumitomo Mitsui Card, Toyota Finance, UC Cards and View Card. These major global and domestic networks represent more than three-quarters of all credit card spending in Japan. The service is also supported by carriers KDDI, NTT Docomo and Softbank. In addition to using an iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus or Apple Watch Series 2 to make purchases in many of the country’s largest stores, at neighborhood shops and restaurants and at transportation facilities, other devices like the iPhone 6, iPhone SE, iPad Pro, iPad mini 4 and other can be used to make payments within apps and from their favorite online merchants such as BASE, Demae-Can, giftee, Jalan.net, JapanTaxi, minne and Toho Cinema. In addition to Japan, Apple Pay is also available in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, China, Canada, France, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore and Switzerland (with support for purchasing bus tickets).

(Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images) By Carl Levin October 24 Carl Levin, a Democrat, represented Michigan in the U.S. Senate from 1979 to 2015. Front and center in the presidential campaign is tax avoidance by very wealthy individuals such as Donald Trump and highly profitable corporations such as Apple. Use of unjustified tax loopholes by individuals and tax havens by multinational corporations has been tolerated for too long. Trump’s tax-avoidance schemes will remain at least partially hidden as long as he gets away with keeping his tax returns secret. But Apple’s tax gimmicks are well known. The profits from Apple’s overseas sales of products designed and developed in the United States should be taxed in the United States. But Apple has until now dodged such U.S. taxes by transferring the rights to its intellectual property to itself in Ireland, through shell “subsidiaries” with few employees and little physical presence or tangible economic activity. Apple even had the chutzpah to claim those Irish subsidiaries had no obligation to pay taxes anywhere, other than the token less than 1 percent it paid to Ireland under a special arrangement. After a bipartisan Senate investigation led by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and me exposed Apple’s tax dodging in 2013, it was not surprising that Europe went after the company. Harder to understand is why the Internal Revenue Service has failed to stake a claim to U.S. taxes on that revenue for more than a decade. It has remained passive, and Europe stepped in to fill the vacuum. Shame on Apple for dodging U.S. taxes. Shame on the IRS and the U.S. treasury for failing to challenge Apple’s tax avoidance. Now, Treasury is attacking the European Commission for shutting down Apple’s tax dodging, even though the commission openly invited the United States and other countries to seek collection of whatever share of the back taxes they think is theirs. Instead of accepting that offer, Treasury is threatening a tax war. The next administration should chart a new course. Curbing tax havens such as Ireland directly serves U.S. interests by helping to limit powerful tax incentives for U.S. corporations to move revenue offshore. U.S. firms already hold an incredible $2.4 trillion in profits overseas, mostly in tax havens, dodging an estimated $700 billion in U.S. taxes. Corporate tax dodging denies the U.S. Treasury and U.S. communities resources they desperately need. The water crisis in Flint, Mich., is a tragic example of public services grown dangerous from lack of investment. All across the United States, pipes deliver low-quality water, roads crumble, bridges sag. AAA says motorists spend $3 billion a year repairing the havoc caused by potholes. Civil engineers estimate we need $3.6 trillion to fix all the infrastructure that’s broken. But rather than doing their part to support the nation that helps make their success possible — and where their products are designed, developed and supported in many ways, including through tax credits and patent protection — some big U.S. corporations duck their responsibilities. Apple alone has stashed $215 billion in profits offshore, avoiding almost $66 billion in U.S. taxes, according to Citizens for Tax Justice. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew charges the European Commission with trying to collect taxes it’s not entitled to from U.S. companies. The irony is that the United States allows U.S. corporations to indefinitely postpone paying U.S. taxes on overseas profits, thanks to a loophole called “deferral.” If we maintain that other countries can’t tax those profits, and we effectively won’t tax them, then what we’re really saying is that globe-spanning U.S. companies shouldn’t be taxed on those profits at all, even though most U.S. companies can’t avoid taxes that way. Sixty-five years ago, $1 out of every $3 collected in federal taxes came from corporations — now it’s $1 in $9 . And when corporations dodge their taxes, the rest of us pick up the tab by paying higher taxes ourselves, suffering defective public services or taking on more public debt. The IRS has been passive for too long. The next administration should reinvigorate tax enforcement aimed at profitable multinational corporations paying little or no tax. It should also revamp the regulations used by multinational companies in unintended ways to dodge U.S. taxes on their offshore profits. Congress should also do its part by enacting legislation to stop some of the worst abuses. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and others are championing the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act. Another bill would charge corporations an “exit tax,” such as what Hillary Clinton has proposed, if they abandon the United States — collecting the deferred taxes on their offshore cash. Other bills would make it harder for tax-dodging multinational companies to access their overseas profits tax-free or deny them federal contracts. There’s also a bill to end the deferral tax loophole altogether. The United States should act to end corporate tax dodging and start going after the $100 billion we lose each year due to profit shifting, instead of criticizing other countries willing to take on highly profitable and powerful multinational corporations.

In fact, the number of smartwatches shipped over the July-to-September quarter is down 52 percent compared to the same period last year. Apple shipped 1.1 million smartwatches during the third quarter, down 72% from the 3.9 million it shipped in Q3 2015. That was enough to grab a 41.3% market share, although that down significantly from 70.2% a year earlier. Garmin came in second with 600,000 units sold and 20.5% market share, up from just 2.3% a year ago, while Samsung took the third spot with 400,000 units and Lenovo Group and Pebble were fourth and fifth with 100,000 units each. IDC argues there are a couple of major factors in the decline in smartwatch shipments. For one thing, many consumers knew that the second generation of the Apple Watch was going to be announced in September thanks to numerous leaks, which caused many of them to hold off on buying until the new device arrived at the end of September. On the other side of the equation, Google’s decision to hold back Android Wear 2.0 left OEM partners to decide as to whether to launch devices before or after the holidays. We might still see better numbers for the Apple Watch Series 2.0 as these figures only include two weeks of sale and more appealing devices from the Android camp once Android Wear 2.0 arrives. However, IDC concludes it’s becoming increasingly clear that smartwatches aren’t for everyone. "Having a clear purpose and use case is paramount, hence many vendors are focusing on fitness due to its simplicity,” says senior research analyst Jitesh Ubrani.

The global smartwatch market experienced growing pains in the third quarter, with shipments dropping 51.6 percent from the same time period last year to 2.7 million, according to IDC. "The sharp decline in smartwatch shipment volumes reflects the way platforms and vendors are realigning," Ramon Llamas, research manager for IDC's wearables team, said in a statement. Despite posting the second-largest year-over-year decline (71.6 percent) among leading vendors, Apple maintained its position as the top smartwatch vendor. It saved the release of Apple Watch Series 2 and Apple Watch Series 1 for the end of September, barely making the cut for the third quarter, so sales of its first-gen smartwatch made up the bulk of its Q3 shipments. Lower price points and improved experiences on its newer devices could result in a fourth quarter rebound, though, IDC says. Meanwhile, Google's decision to defer Android Wear 2.0 "left vendors relying on older, aging devices to satisfy customers," Llamas said. Lenovo (Motorola) suffered a 73.3 percent drop since 2015, thanks to a lack of Moto 360 and Moto 360 Sport stocks. The previous quarter also marked the first time Motorola did not introduce a new smartwatch ahead of the holiday season. IKickstarter darling Pebble released its Pebble 2 (its first to include a heart-rate sensor) late in the third quarter. It did little to help the company, though, which saw a 54.1 percent year-over-year slump. Samsung and Garmin were the only two vendors to finish the third quarter higher than the year before. Samsung is still riding the wave of its aging Gear S2 wearable; it recently introduced its follow-up Bluetooth-only Gear S3, but it's not yet available. It was Garmin that took the third-quarter cake with a whopping 324.2 percent gain, largely due to its growing list of ConnectIQ-enabled smartwatches, as well as the new Fenix Chronos. //Related Articles The Best Smartwatches of 2016 As IDC points out, Garmin's devices focus on health and fitness, boasting apps that reflect those goals. "It has…become evident that at present, smartwatches are not for everyone," said Jitesh Ubrani, senior research analyst for IDC mobile device trackers. "Having a clear purpose and use case is paramount, hence many vendors are focusing on fitness due to its simplicity. "However, moving forward, differentiating the experience of a smartwatch from the smartphone will be key and we're starting to see early signs of this as cellular integration is rising and as the commercial audience begins to pilot these devices," he added.

Kate DwyerOct 24, 2016 3:22PM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest Today, with the release of iOS 10.1, Apple unveiled its latest camera feature: portrait mode. With a depth-of-field effect rivaling professional cameras, the setting is sure to help you tap into your inner photographer. During the fall Apple Keynote, where the tech giant announced the Apple Watch Series 2 and the iPhone 7, Apple's marketing head Phil Schiller touted the iPhone 7 Plus's new multi-camera system, which would enable users to take "portraits." In order to make the iPhone's cameras competitive with a DSLR, Apple decided to add a second camera to the phone. That way, the two cameras could manipulate the depth of field of your photos, blurring out the background and capturing every detail of the foreground. To use portrait mode, you'll first need to download iOS 10.1 on your iPhone 7 Plus. Then, launch the camera app and and select “Portrait." (Oddly, you'll be prompted to "Try the Beta." Just go with it.) Once Portrait mode is open, you'll be able to see a live preview of the depth effect, including instructions near the bottom of the screen on how to position yourself near the subject. Your subject needs to be within eight feet to use the feature, and if it's too close, you'll get a message saying as much. The further your subject is from your background, the more pronounced the blur effect will be. To make the most of the depth effect, shoot your subjects against a non-solid background, and if you're shooting a group, make sure everyone is lined up, and no one too far behind the rest of the group. Here's an example of a Portrait-mode photo featuring Karlie Kloss, taken by photographer Kevin Tachman: Loading View on Instagram And here are some more examples: Loading View on Instagram Loading View on Instagram Loading View on Instagram Loading View on Instagram Related: iPhone 7's Best Features follow us Facebook Twitter Pinterest What do you think?

You are at:Home»Mobile»Your iPhone has a secret one handed keyboard – but there’s a catch Your iPhone has a secret one handed keyboard – but there’s a catch 0 By Staff Writer on 2016-10-24 Mobile A A A Apple has created potentially one of the most useful features on its iPhone – but users are currently unable to access it. According to a report by iOS developer Steve Troughton-Smith, Apple has included a special one handed keyboard in every iPhone release since the launch of iOS 8 back in September 2014. The hidden keyboard is designed to make typing easier when holder larger sized smartphone in one hand. The keyboard works by shifting individual keys to one side of the display in order to make typing easier. Today's fun hack (been there since at least iOS 8); the iOS keyboard has an unused left/right one-handed mode. Activated by edge-swipe pic.twitter.com/zIk7x7CVmu — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) October 19, 2016 Video or it didn't happen: (very hard to engage in the Simulator with a mouse cursor) pic.twitter.com/vw2wpCgiLJ — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) October 19, 2016 The keyboard, which was unknown until now, is designed to work best on 5.5 inch displays. However, there is one major problem which is likely to come as a major blow for anyone who owns an iPhone – users are unable to access the hidden keyboard. According to Steve Troughton-Smith, code for the one handed keyboard has been in iOS for more than 2 years, for reasons unknown, Apple has never made it available to iPhone users. Steve says the only way to access the keyboard is by jailbreaking your iPhone, which would instantly void your warranty and is not recommended. The news comes as Apple is just days away from holding an event at its Cupertino HQ, where it is expected to unveil the next generation of its popular MacBook Pro laptop, alongside a possible new iPad. The MacBook Pro lineup hasn’t been overhaul since 2012 and is in need of a refresh. The new MacBook Pro is rumoured to include the same slim chassis found on the current MacBook and could see Apple debut a new OLED Touchscreen display, which will replace the current row of function keys and which automatically adapt and change depending on what apps are being used at any one time.

The Galaxy Note 7 line has officially been axed. What does it mean for Samsung, and who could benefit from the fallout? Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 24, 2016 at 1:42PM Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) official recall of the Galaxy Note 7 line earlier this month solidified the product as one of the biggest tech flops in recent memory. In this week's Industry Focus: Tech, The Motley Fool's Dylan Lewis and contributor Evan Niu discuss what we know about the Note 7 explosions, how Samsung's stock has been affected so far, how the company might recover from this, and how much this might hurt the business going forward. On the other side, the duo take a look at some companies that could benefit as they take up Samsung's slack. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 14, 2016.

Wunder Capital: Do well and do good. Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast the dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Friday, Oct. 14, and we're talking about the fiery mess that is the Samsung Galaxy Note. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined on Skype by Fool.com senior tech specialist, Evan Niu. Evan, how's it going? Evan Niu: It's been a fun time to watch Samsung, considering I've been a longtime Samsung skeptic. Lewis: We're both Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) guys, we're both iPhone guys, so I think it's been comforting for us to know that the phones in our pocket are not going to spontaneously combust any time soon, right? Niu: It's reassuring. (laughs) I'm not worried about my phone blowing up. Lewis: On today's show, we're going to give a little rundown on what's been going on with Samsung and the Galaxy Note line over the last month-plus, how that line fits into the company's smartphone segment, and the company's financials in general. Then, which companies, if any, might benefit from some of the backlash and the recall of the Galaxy Note line. Evan, you want to get us up to speed, give us a little timeline on what's been going on? Niu: Sure. Galaxy Note 7 launched in mid-August. I think that was part of the deal -- Samsung was really wanting to beat Apple to market on timing, because, as everyone knows, iPhones come out in September. So, I think the company was really pushing toward the timeline of getting this thing out to market as quick as possible to try to beat Apple to the punch. Which is kind of silly, because it's only a month difference. How much of a difference could that make? But, apparently, that was important to Samsung. I think that's partially what's led up to these problems, they cut corners or tried to do things too fast. Things obviously just weren't ready. Then, as we know, in early and mid-September, we started to see reports of Samsung Note 7 either exploding or catching on fire, a lot of the time while they were charging. In general, sometimes you hear stories about this happening. When you're using a third-party charger that's not up to spec, that can sometimes be the culprit. But these were the official chargers, the regular Samsung chargers you were supposed to be using.  So, Samsung does this huge recall, 2.5 million units. They think they figured out that it's the batteries that they sourced in-house from the Samsung SDI internal battery division. So, they do this recall. They leave all the other phones out there that have different batteries from third-party suppliers. They start replacing phones. And now, all of the sudden, in the past week or two, the replacement phones are now catching on fire. (laughs) So, everything is a huge mess, and now they've made the call to officially kill the project altogether. That's a tough call to make, but you have to do it when it's this bad.  It's crazy, because in modern smartphone times, people take this stuff for granted. Before this one, you hadn't heard about an exploding phone, or a phone catching on fire, meaningfully, in years. At least, not at this scale, outside of isolated incidences, like the third-party charger thing I was talking about. But, you don't see this wide-scale type of thing happening. It's been years. I think most consumers have probably thought that companies have figured this out, but apparently they haven't. It's kind of crazy. Lewis: Yeah, still running into some issues on the tech side. This is, I think, brutally bad timing, given that the company is basically coming off its best earnings report in a couple years. It seemed like they had a ton of momentum, decent amount of growth in the smartphone space. Earlier this week, when the company decided to go with the full recall, they also issued an update to guidance. So, we don't even really have to speculate as to what the financial hit might look like, we can look at exactly at what the company said here. They are now expecting third-quarter operating profit to come in at 5.2 trillion South Korean won, which is roughly $4.6 billion, down from the original forecast of 7.8 trillion won. So, a decent amount of rollback there. Third-quarter revenue has also been revised down. It's now expected to be about 47 trillion won from the previous guidance of 49 trillion won. Niu: I think what's even more disconcerting about this whole thing is, Samsung still doesn't know what's wrong with the phones. They cannot figure it out. As recently as last week, there was a New York Times report that their engineers are still trying to replicate the problem, and they can't. That doesn't inspire a lot of confidence. It's one thing if they do this recall, they get the phones back, and they figure it out and presumably fix it. But, if they don't even know what's wrong, that's a huge question mark. It really calls to question all these other things about their future phones. I don't think any of their phones have had this type of problem, but going forward, unless they can figure this out and definitively say, "This is what caused it, and we have a solution ... " This is totally unrelated, but hilarious. They also had washing machines that are now blowing up. I don't know if you saw that. A couple weeks ago, there were reports -- because, Samsung makes everything, and they have these top-load washing machines, and those are now exploding. Clearly, it's a totally different thing, because those don't use lithium ion batteries like the phones do. But it's kind of like, what's going on with everything?! (laughs) Washing machines, too? Lewis: To layer on top of that, I think there are another couple reasons why this is a little bit different than your average product recall, or even food-safety-related issues, like what we've seen with Chipotle or Jack in the Box in the '90s. You talked about how they haven't been able to diagnose the problem, which doesn't inspire a lot of confidence in the other products they have out there. I think one of the other issues is, there's a lot of confusion in the Galaxy line. You look out at Samsung's product offering, frankly, it's really hard to keep all their phones straight. They intentionally moved the Note to be on the 7 naming convention, to keep it consistent with the other offerings. Now, I think you're seeing people that aren't 100% sure which products are safe, and which aren't. I saw news that they had to push notifications, I forget which product, but it was one of their newer and higher-priced phones, that -- Niu: It was the regular S7. Lewis: Right. That, those were not part of the recall, and the people who held those in their hands, if they were reading this notification, didn't need to worry about that. That's fine, but when you have a super fragmented offering, and a lot of the headlines are "Galaxy 7," and they're trying to distill it down to something like that ... Niu: Yeah. For average consumers who don't follow this stuff as closely as we do, they just see some headline about Galaxy something, 7 something. There's a Galaxy S7, there's a Galaxy S7 A, there's the Galaxy Note 7. There's so many, and they're all part of the Galaxy brand that Samsung has put so much money into building. They put tens of millions of dollars into building this brand over the past five or 10 years. And now, this one horribly botched product risks killing all that brand value. It's not uncommon for Samsung to spend more money on marketing, advertising, kickbacks, commissions to retailers and all that, than it does on R&D. It puts a ton of money into this, and now, because they're unified, they're all getting dragged down. They're trying to contain this thing, like you said, notifications saying, "Your phone is safe." It sounds exactly like the phone is not safe. But, "The phone is safe, don't worry." Lewis: I think one of the other things that makes this tougher -- and returning back from this a little tougher -- is the product life cycles of smartphones. You look at a place like Chipotle, fast casual, they're able to give away a ton of free product via coupons, Chiptopia, that kind of stuff, and get people back in restaurants relatively quickly, because meals are a routine purchase for people. Smartphones are not. You're buying a phone every two years. Once you get someone in an ecosystem, the likelihood of them staying there is a lot higher. So, I worry there's going to be this class of people coming onto smartphones, or maybe people that recently decided to make the switch over to the Galaxy line, specifically the Galaxy Note line, that they're second-guessing it, might go with another Android device, might decide to go over to something on the iOS side. Niu: Yeah. That's exactly the thing they need to figure out. Samsung is really good at hardware. Samsung has tried so hard over the past 10 years to get better at software, but of course, they have to get Android from Google, and they do their whole modifications and tweaks, this stuff they put on top of it to try to differentiate. But the point remains that Samsung isn't actually good at that stuff. Their software is not very good. They're really good at hardware. If all the sudden, their hardware is having all these problems, there's really not a good reason to buy a Samsung phone. Historically, their hardware has been incredibly well-made. But now, there's no reason. If their one strength is now being called into question ... Lewis: People are going to go elsewhere. Niu: Exactly. And, even if you want to stay with an Android, there's tons of really good Android phones out there.  Lewis: I think, to help adjust for this a little bit, Samsung is offering customers about $75 to trade in their devices for other Samsung models. That's a good retention effort. They might save some lost customers along the way. But it wouldn't be surprising to see some flight from the brand. One of the other reasons I think this is troubling is the timing in the calendar year. This is ahead of the holiday season, and it's the biggest time of the year for consumer electronics. To have to wipe out an entire product line ahead of the quarter where you're probably going to be doing 40% of your business, at least ... Niu: And one of their most expensive, most profitable products, too. Lewis: Yeah. That's rough, that's really hard to deal with that, as a business.  Niu: Yeah. This is the time, holiday shopping season. Everyone makes all their money here. And now, Samsung has to pull one of their flagship...the Note 7 has been a differentiator compared to the iPhone for a long time, because it comes with a stylus, it's bigger. It was like the posterboy for phablets. Samsung has established itself as the phablet leader, and Apple now has the 7 Plus, which isn't as big as the Note 7 and doesn't have a stylus. But other than that, it's pretty comparable, as far as giant phones go. Lewis: Yeah. I started briefly introducing what the company was expecting for revenue writedown and revised guidance. It looks like analysts were expecting the company to ship about 15 to 19 million units from Q3 2016 through Q1 2017. To put that into context, Samsung shipped between 75 million and 78 million smartphones last quarter. So, while this is a big deal, it's a fancy new line they were really trying to get some momentum behind, in the grander scheme of their product mix, it's actually maybe about 10% or so. I don't think it's as big of a deal as people realize. Niu: I think the big difference is, a lot of Samsung's volume comes from these low-end, cheaper smartphones in places like India. They sell phones that are $50 to $100. They're not making a lot of money on that, but they ship a lot of units, which helps them keep their rank in the smartphone market. Like you mentioned, it's a lot more than Apple, 75 million on a non-holiday quarter, that's a ton of phones. But a lot of those are low-margin, low-value units versus these high-end phones -- that's where these companies make their margins. I think it has a leverage effect, in that it seems smaller in terms of units. But it had a pretty big impact on operating profits. Generally speaking, mobile is about half of Samsung's business, in terms of revenue and operating profit, roughly, before this whole thing. Mobile includes a bunch of things, like tablet and these phones. But the mobile segment itself is incredibly important to them. Within the mobile segment if you look at the margin profile within their mobile business, these high-end phones are quite important in terms of profitability. Those low-end phones get a lot of volume, but considering that Samsung is largely a hardware player, if they sell a low-end phone to someone, it's not like they're capturing that customer on to their platform like Google or Apple would be. They're just trying to sell the phone. So, I think it won't have a huge impact on total volumes. But I think, again, coming back to the brand, it's so damaging for the brand. That's something that's really hard to put a number on right now -- brand valuation. I think that's the bigger thing here. Missing out on one product cycle is one thing, if it's contained within this product cycle. But if there's lasting damage to the brand, they could be hurting for a long time. Lewis: I think that's why you've seen market reaction to this actually not be so bad. Short-term, if we're to take the company at the guidance that they're giving, and we look at the product mix, and they're able to hold the volumes on those other brands, the drop that we've seen makes sense. I think if you look back to when this story originally broke, the company was down about 4% or 5%, which really isn't all that crazy given that this is one of their most consumer-facing and high-profile lines. They do have so many other offerings in the smartphone market. If those hold, there shouldn't be too much of an issue there. One of the things people might not realize about Samsung is, they're a little bit more diversified than your Apple, in terms of the different hardware arenas that they've planned. To give you an idea of their revenue mix, consumer electronics is about 22% of revenue, and that does not include smartphones. IT and mobile communications, as you said before, a little over 50% of revenue. Device solutions, which is the semiconductor and display panel business, 36% of revenue. The IT and mobile is the highest-margin business that they are in, and having a high-profile phone, a high-ASP phone (average selling price), being removed, might lead to some margin compression there. But if they're able to hold on the other brands, I think this muted reaction from the market makes sense. Niu: Yeah, I guess we'll just have to see if they can successfully pull off this crisis management. I think it's a good thing to kill those phones, definitely, especially when you don't know what's going on. You have to bite the bullet. Lewis: Absolutely. In the second half of the show, we're going to hit briefly on a couple companies that might be poised to benefit as Samsung goes into crisis mode. But before we do, what if you could help combat global climate change, and make money at the same time? You might be interested in that, right? Wunder Capital is an award-winning online investment platform that allows individuals to invest in solar energy projects around the U.S. Wunder's online investment platform allows you to earn up to 11% annually while diversifying your portfolio, curbing pollution, and combating global climate change.

So, Evan, we talked about how the premium side of the smartphone market could see some shake-up. We might see some consumers that were interested in the Galaxy line, maybe they were Galaxy Note owners, taking this opportunity to either try an iOS device, maybe another Android device. Do you think there are any big beneficiaries with this? Niu: I think there are definitely some winners and losers. If we start with the loser list, I think it's a little bit shorter, because Samsung is mostly self-contained in terms of its suppliers. Samsung is so directly integrated that it makes most of the components that go to its phones. It still has some third-party part suppliers. But as far as supply relationships go that might suffer from reduced unit volumes, it's mostly going to be within Samsung itself. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) probably loses a little bit because the Snapdragon 820 is inside the U.S. variants -- Lewis: Can you explain what the Snapdragon does? Niu: Snapdragon is the main applications processor that has integrated modem and all these things. It's one of the most important pieces of any phone, the processor. Samsung, what they do is they have all these different variants for different geographies. Samsung has been trying to ship to its own in-house Exynos processor. I think the last year, they were exclusively Exynos, with no Snapdragon, but this year, Qualcomm has gotten back into the mix, they've improved their chips a little bit and got more competitive. There's some variance for different geographies, and Qualcomm is in the U.S. variance. So, they'll lose a little bit, since they obviously won't be selling into this phone anymore. But there's kind of a hedge, because Qualcomm does sell a lot into Apple. If people buy iPhones instead of the Note 7, probably incrementally negative to Qualcomm, but they're not totally out of the picture. Lewis: Right, you might be a little pinched, but nothing crazy. Niu: Right, there's a little bit of a hedge, there's a silver lining. And of course, it depends on which iPhone you get, because not Qualcomm has lost a little bit of spot in the iPhone, because Qualcomm used to be the exclusive modem supplier, and for the first time ever, Apple has gone to Intel -- well, first time not including Infineon 10 years ago. Now, this year, Apple is now buying modems from Qualcomm and Intel, depending on which phone you get. As far as pure winners, I would say certainly Apple. Lewis: Yeah, I think they're up 10% since some of the products issues around the Note 7 surfaced. The market certainly seems to think -- Niu: Yeah, there was already iPhone 7 optimism, and now the shares just keep going higher. They're at 2016 highs because of all this stuff that's going on with Samsung. I think it's pretty clear that a lot of people are probably going to try. And we've already been seeing Android switching rates continue to rise every quarter. Apple touts this every quarter, every quarter they're like, "highest Android switcher rates ever." I think that trend is going to continue, particularly with one of the biggest Android OEMs hitting into this wall here. As I mentioned, Intel is now in some of the iPhones. So Intel, to the extent that people are buying the phones with their modem, they benefit. Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), I think, is a big winner here too. They actually just released earnings that were pretty strong. Taiwan Semiconductor is producing Apple's A10 Fusion chip. Another change this year is that, in prior years, Apple had been dual-sourcing its chip manufacturing from both Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor, which started one or two years ago. They only brought on Taiwan Semiconductor one or two years ago. But now, supposedly, with all the indications that we're getting, it's exclusively to TSMC, which is a huge win for them and a huge blow to Samsung, in terms of the foundry business on the chip manufacturing side. That's a lot more chips that Taiwan Semi is going to be making for Apple. They just released earnings; it was pretty strong, came in above expectations. I don't remember the exact numbers. But the important thing is that Taiwan Semiconductor raised fourth-quarter guidance, and that raised guidance did not factor in the possibility of these other phones being discontinued. So they were already super bullish, even before factoring in the Note 7's discontinuation into their forecast. So, I think they're really going to bank this holiday quarter if Apple sells enough phones. That's a ton of orders going to TSMC to make these A10 Fusion chips. I think they're probably a pretty big winner here. Lewis: Yeah, I think a lot of people tend to read into the commentary we get from component manufacturers that go into the iPhone as a general baseline for how that segment might be doing when Apple reports again. If you're seeing guidance up from Taiwan Semiconductor, that probably bodes well for the iPhone business. Niu: Yeah. And even before the Samsung Note -- that's what blew me away -- their guidance was so strong, and they literally said, "This does not include any impact if the Note 7 is discontinued," which it has been. So, it looks really good for them. As far as third-party carriers or retailers are concerned, I think they're pretty ambivalent. They're just trying to do their best to help their customers not be in danger. Their brands aren't going to be affected, and they're not going to be bearing a lot of cost because Samsung is going to be paying for all of this. So most of the retailers and carriers just want to do what's right for the customer and get these things off the market. I don't think there's going to be any damage to them. Lewis: I've seen [Alphabet's] Google thrown around in the list of potential winners as well. The idea is kind of similar with Apple -- they released the Pixel phone somewhat recently. Having a major potential competitor off the table bodes well for people giving that a shot. That's not going to be something that meaningfully contributes to the numbers for Google. I think, when you're talking about Apple and Google here, seeing Samsung falter and knowing that there might be a slightly larger bite of the smartphone market available to them isn't something that's thesis-altering. It's certainly interesting for some of the component manufacturers that are specifically in some of these devices and not others. But big picture, if you like Apple and Google already, stick with them. But don't buy solely on the idea that they might pick up some incremental business here. Niu: Yeah. The Pixel looks like a pretty good phone. Of course, it's Google's first phone, they designed the whole thing. They're outsourcing manufacturing, naturally, to HTC. But as far as them designing the phone itself, this is the first time that they're really doing the whole thing. It looks like a really good phone. I think, definitely, people that are not getting the Note 7 might consider the Pixel, because it's a pure Google phone stock Android without all the third-party software and all this stuff on it. But I think the biggest challenge there in terms of getting people to switch from a Note 7 to a Pixel XL or whatever the large one is called, it's really just about distribution. Google doesn't have distribution channels in the way that most companies in the space do. They're partnering with Verizon, which is the only carrier partner. Other than that, they're selling it online through the online store. But, it might surprise you how many people, when they need a new phone, they go to the carrier store. They just go to the retail store. Lewis: It becomes kind of a default decision, right? Niu: Yeah. And it makes some sense, because that's where they have the most selection, they can deal with all their plan stuff. I personally tend to buy things online, and I think a lot of people do. But, carrier distribution is an incredibly important channel for any phone maker. People that already know which phone they want they'll just go and buy that phone online. But a lot of people don't know, and they still like to shop around, like any other product in their lives, versus people like you and me are probably so loyal that it's not even a decision, it's just, when am I going to get my iPhone? But, for a lot of people, their phone breaks, or it's time for an upgrade, they just go to the carrier store and pick one. For the other carriers other than Verizon, Pixel's not going to be there, because Google is distributing themselves. It's harder for Google to get these carrier relationships going, because the carriers want more control. It's harder for Google to negotiate because they've never been a big player in the physical smartphone space. So I think the biggest thing that's going to hold them back is their lack of distribution. Lewis: It sounds like the rundown for investors here is, Apple, Google, possible beneficiaries. The people that might really see some importance swings in what goes on with their numbers are some of the component manufacturers like you talked about, Taiwan Semiconductor. My feeling is, for Samsung's business, if they're able to keep the bad PR and negative brand association contained to the Note line, then this won't be something that's really awful for them long-term. If it does start to bleed into the other products they offer, the S7 and things like that, it could spell trouble for their mobile segment for a long time. Niu: Yeah, the main thing is to figure out what the hell is going on with these things. Clearly, if they launch a phone next year and it has the same thing, that would thesis altering, two in a row. And, if they can't figure it out, there's reason to think that-there might be another one. Lewis: Yeah, I think a lot of consumers want them to know exactly what's going on and tell the public. Then we might see a nice rally in Samsung sales. Niu: They can't replicate this in their labs! It's just crazy. Lewis: Anything else before I let you go, Evan? Niu: No, I think we hit it all.

Read these and more hot technology news of the day in this dose of your 360 Daily. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge explodes while charging A Galaxy S7 Edge unit, said to be given to the user by Samsung in exchange for their Galaxy Note 7, reportedly caught fire automatically while charging. Images allegedly show that the S7 Edge, which was left for charging overnight, is completely totalled and beyond repair. This continues Samsung's bad streak with replacing the Galaxy Note 7 with other handsets. Meanwhile the company is also said to be offering to upgrade certain Note 7 users to next year's Galaxy S8 or Note 8.Apple's October 27 event all about laptops Apple will reportedly focus on the laptop range at its October 27 event, where the company is said to unveil updated versions of the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro as well as the long-rumoured 13-inch MacBook. It is now being said that the company may not refresh its iMac lineup of desktops at the event. The new MacBook Pro is said to feature an Oled touch bar, Intel Skylake processors, Touch ID fingerprint sensor, USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3, and storage options up to 2TB. OnePlus Diwali sale; OnePlus 3 at Re. 1 OnePlusbegan its 3-day Diwali Dash Sale on Monday, under which the company is hosting flash sales everyday at 12pm, 4pm, and 8pm IST; registrations for the sale have closed now. As part of the sale, users have the chance to purchase the OnePlus 3 Soft Gold variant, accessories, and more products at Re. 1. Select users will also get a mystery box for each time slot; the box can include accessories, goodies, cases and covers, and even a OnePlus 3 smartphone. One winner will also get a week-long trip to London. Samsung Galaxy S8 launch delayed? Work on Samsung's next flagship smartphone, Galaxy S8, is said to be two weeks behind schedule as all of the company's engineers are focussed on figuring out the reason behind the spontaneous explosions of the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7. This is said to put the launch of Galaxy S8 behind by two weeks, and the South Korean titan may not follow its tradition of launching the next S series model at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next year. Xiaomi Mi Note 2 price tipped ahead of Tuesday's launch While Xiaomi officially announced that it is hosting an event in Beijing on Tuesday to launch the Mi Note 2, a new leak  has suggested that the price tag of the smartphone will be $590 (Rs. 39,500). The smartphone is said to have a 5.7-inch QHD dual edge screen, Snapdragon 821 chipset, Android Marshmallow-based MIUI 8 software, 23-megapixel rear camera, and 12-megapixel front camera. New hack puts millions of Android phones at risk Researchers have discovered a new way that lets hackers take control of millions of Android devices. Hackers, using iPhones as well as other mobile devices, can supposedly exploit data on smartphones through memory chips and other physical parts embedded inside to gain root access using without any special permissions. The researchers claim that they have used the hack to root many LG, Motorola, Samsung, and OnePlus handsets. LG to end modular programme with LG G6 Next year's LG G6 flagship smartphone will reportedly mark the end of the company's modular experiment, which began with the G5. The report comes just a few weeks after company spokesperson Ken Hong said that it will not not ditch the "modular concept in the subsequent generation" of G-Series smartphones, despite the G5's performance in the market. Modular smartphones come with compatible mods that can easily placed or detached from the device for added functionalities; however, they face barriers such as learning curve with switching between accessories and high costs of modules. Instagram testing live video feature called 'Go Insta' Instagram is reportedly testing a live video feature in its Stories section for some users on the beta Android app in Russia. The users using the live video feature, at the time, appear at the top of the page with a red tag that reads LIVE. In order to start a broadcast, users simply have to click on a red button that says Go Insta.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   AT&T-Time Warner: Apple angle, effect on consumers and more By Levi Sumagaysay / October 24, 2016 at 10:38 AM Key points from the $85.4 billion mega-merger between AT&T and Time Warner, which was announced over the weekend. • What do Apple and Silicon Valley have to do with this? Before the deal was announced, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Apple had approached Time Warner a few months ago about a tie-up, although the talks didn’t go past the preliminary stage. Apple has long been said to be working on an internet television service, but an apparent lack of content deals has held it up. Time Warner — which among other things owns CNN, HBO, TNT and Warner Bros. — would give Apple access to plenty of content. However, Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes reportedly said AT&T was the only company to approach his company. Whether Apple was interested or not, here’s another connection. Business professor Scott Galloway of NYU told Bloomberg TV today that Apple and other Silicon Valley companies are “running up against the same issue that AT&T and Verizon are running up against, and that is that they are running out of growth.” That’s why he and other experts are saying that AT&T, Verizon and other companies are looking to media and content companies, such as Time Warner and Yahoo, respectively. The difference between the two proposed deals, according to Galloway: “Jeff Bewkes and the TWX board are the opposite of  Yahoo (who they are being compared to). Selling at the high (cable in structural decline), great management, what shareholders want from their fiduciaries. Time Warner (George Clooney), Yahoo (George Costanza)…” • Would consumers be hurt or helped if AT&T bought Time Warner? AT&T’s sell: This deal will give customers more ways to access TV shows and movies on more devices. Those who are critical of the deal include Michael Copps, a former FCC commissioner and now a special adviser to advocacy group Common Cause. “Allowing a communications behemoth like AT&T to swallow the Time Warner media empire should be unthinkable,” Copps said in an emailed statement. “The sorry history of mega mergers shows they run roughshod over the public interest. Further entrenching monopoly harms innovation and drives up prices for consumers.” Politicians on both sides of the aisle are skeptical about the deal, with both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton’s camps expressing concern. • More about why AT&T and Verizon feel pressure: This circles back to what NYU professor Galloway said above. T-Mobile reported earnings Monday, and unlike Verizon and AT&T, the nation’s Nos. 1 and 2 wireless carriers, it’s adding subscribers. Sprint also added subscribers, it said when it reported earnings last week. So as large as they are, AT&T and Verizon are looking for other places for growth. AT&T shares are down about 1.7 percent and Time Warner shares are down more than 2.5 percent Monday.   Photo: A trader walks by the post that handles Time Warner on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, Oct. 24, 2016. AT&T’s $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner represents a new bet on synergy between companies that distribute information and entertainment to consumers and those that produce it.

However, unless you’re rocking a brand new iPhone 7 Plus, there’s not a lot to get excited about. The final version brings a beta version of new Portrait mode feature, which capitalises on the dual camera lenses exclusive to the larger Apple handset. Portrait mode enables iPhone users to take snaps with artificially blurred backgrounds, producing a bokeh effect more commonly obtained by using DSLR cameras. Related: iPhone 7 Plus camera guide Essentially the first camera captures the headshot as normal, while the second camera is used to determine how far away the subject is, offering an approximation of a depth of field effect. Apple announced the feature during its iPhone launch event in September, but said it would arrive in a future update. That future is now. Elsewhere, the update features bug fixes for various issues as well as the addition of Japanese transit directions. To update to iOS 10.1, head to the Software Updates section of General settings.

The iPhone 7 Plus now has its own Depth-of-Field Effect in Beta mode with this newest update. This mode was first introduced by Apple at the event at which they also revealed the iPhone 7. This mode makes for some rather interesting results, especially if the photographer likes their photographs to look super fancy. This mode was first enabled with the release of iOS 10.1 in Beta mode, now it’s available to the public. Despite being part of a public release in iOS 10.1, this mode itself remains (Beta), so says Apple. New users will find this mode in the standard Camera app between Photo and Square modes. This feature will only be available to users of the iPhone 7 Plus. Similar effects are available in some 3rd-party photography apps, but this effect is most “true” with the iPhone 7 Plus. The “bokeh” effect, aka “Portrait”, utilizes the dual-camera system in the iPhone 7 Plus. With these cameras, the subject is sharp while the background is blurry. According to Apple, “bokeh” was “previously only capable on DSLR cameras.” That’s not true, not if we’re considering the HTC One M8, Xiaomi Redmi Pro, LG G4, and every Android device since April 16, 2014. That’s the date Google added “Lens Blur” to their Google Camera app. It’s not done with two lenses, but it ends up looking rather like Apple’s Portrait mode to the untrained eye. Above you’ll see a collection of photos captured by SlashGear with the iPhone 7 Plus in Portrait mode. These images represent the device running the Beta mode of the iOS 10.1 update with this feature. We can assume (and soon test) that the images will look even better in the near future. Also hang around SlashGear for our imminent “other reasons to update to iOS 10.1” shortly.

It replicates an effect typically limited to larger cameras known as SLRs. (AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus is getting a new camera capability — the blurring of backgrounds to focus attention on people or other objects in the foreground. Apple’s “portrait mode” feature was announced in September but was unavailable until the company released its iOS 10.1 software update Monday. It replicates an effect typically limited to larger cameras known as SLRs. Portrait mode requires an iPhone 7 Plus because it uses the phone’s two lenses to sense depth. Other iPhones have only one camera lens. The software update will still be available for other iPhones because it also comes with bug fixes and other improvements. The update comes three days before Apple holds a product event in Cupertino, California, during which the company is expected to unveil new Mac computers.

CUPERTINO (dpa-AFX) - Apple is reportedly planning to launch a completely revamped iPhone 8 next year, as the tech giant plans to celebrate the 10th anniversary of its blockbuster device. Apple fanboys have started groaning due to three consecutive years of seeing the same design reused in the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone 7. According to credible rumor sources, Apple is expected to make many changes to the appearance of iPhone as well as introduce new technology. 'The next iPhone will be, I am told, a clear piece of glass (er, Gorilla Glass sandwich with other polycarbonates for being pretty shatter resistant if dropped) with a next-generation OLED screen (I have several sources confirming this),' wrote tech blogger Robert Scoble on a Facebook post. 'You pop it into a headset which has eye sensors on it, which enables the next iPhone to have a higher apparent frame rate and polygon count than a PC with a Nvidia 1080 card in it.' The new 'clear iPhone' will put holograms on top of the real world like Microsoft HoloLens does, Scoble says. According to reports, Apple is expected to include a new sensor developed by the Primesense team on the next iPhone. 'The phone itself has a next-generation 3D sensor from Primesense, which Apple bought. Apple has 600 engineers working in Israel on just the sensor. It's the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. It's the first product introduction in Apple's new amazing headquarters. It's a big f**king deal and will change this industry deeply. It'll get rid of the HTC Vive lighthouse system, too,' Scoble says.

The WatchOS 3.1 update brings small changes to the device, mostly focusing on fixing bugs. Of note are updates to Messages and a fix for a potential battery issue. With the update, you'll be able to replay full-screen effects in Messages and play effects when Reduce Motion is enabled. The update should also fix any problems Apple Watch Series 2 models may have had that prevented some from charging fully. The update goes on to provide fixes to the Timer, Activity interface, and Force Touch functions in third-party apps. The update won't drastically change how you interact with your Apple Watch, unlike when watchOS 3 became available in September. That update brought a slew of changes to the Apple Watch's interface, including the new app Dock, the SOS feature for alerting authorities to emergency situations, and the Breathe app that guides the wearer through deep breathing exercises. WatchOS 3.1 is available for the Apple Watch Series 2 as well as Apple Watch Series 1 and first-generation models. You'll have to connect your watch to power, and it must have at least 50 percent battery to install the update. Here's a full list of the changes in watchOS 3.1: New option to replay bubble and full-screen effects in Messages Messages effects can play with Reduce Motion enabled Fixes an issue that could cause the notification for Timer complete to be delivered twice Resolves an issue that could prevent Apple Watch Series 2 from fully charging Resolves an issue where Activity rings may disappear from the watch face Fixes an issue that prevented Force Touch options from appearing in some third-party apps.

The IDC survey said total smartwatch volumes were 2.7 million units, less than half the level of a year earlier. Apple, the largest smartwatch vendor, saw its sales down 71.6 percent. But IDC analyst Ramon Llamas said the decline is not as ominous as it appears -- because many consumers were waiting for the new version of the Apple Watch and upcoming Android devices. "The sharp decline in smartwatch shipment volumes reflects the way platforms and vendors are realigning," Llamas said. "Apple revealed a new look and feel to watches that did not arrive until the launch of the second generation watch at the end of September." Llamas added that Google's decision to hold back the Android Wear 2.0 operating system has also limited sales. "Samsung's Gear S3, announced at (the trade show) IFA in September, has yet to be released. Collectively, this left vendors relying on older, aging devices to satisfy customers." Nonetheless, the market is showing limited growth, according to IDC. "It has also become evident that at present smartwatches are not for everyone," said IDC analyst Jitesh Ubrani. "Having a clear purpose and use case is paramount, hence many vendors are focusing on fitness due to its simplicity." Despite its sharp sales drop, Apple maintained the top position with an estimated 1.1 million units sold and a 41 percent market share, according to IDC. Apple does not release sales figures for its smartwatch. Garmin was the number two brand with sales of 600,000 and a 20.5 percent market share, followed by Samsung with 400,000 and a 14.4 percent share, according to IDC.

It’s the third update that Apple has released so far for iOS 10, the two previous updates were minor releases as they only brought bug fixes and tweaks. iOS 10.1 brings Portrait mode to the iPhone 7 Plus. This mode has been developed for this particular iPhone 7 variant as it leverages the handset’s dual camera to create a shallow depth of field and enable users to take great portrait shots with their iPhone. This is made possible by using the handset’s wide-angle and telephoto lens. Some software trickery is required as well to make this happen. The image signal processor first uses the wide-angle lens to create a depth map while the image is captured with the telephoto lens. It then dissects the photo into different layers to ascertain what to blue in order to achieve that bokeh effect that you normally see in photos taken with professional cameras. The iPhone 7 Plus is capable of doing that now that Apple has released iOS 10.1 with Portrait mode. iOS 10.1 also brings a handful of bug fixes as well as performance and stability improvements for all supported devices. It’s rolling out right now over-the-air. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about iphone 7 plus.

Apple Pay in Japan is unique because rather than exclusively using NFC, it also supports the FeliCa payments standard that’s been widely adopted in the country. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models sold in Japan include a FeliCa chip, as do Apple Watch Series 2 models. iPhone 7 and 7 Plus users in Japan can now use their iPhones to make purchases in cafes, purchase transit tickets, make purchases in apps and on websites, replace a Suica card, and more. To use a Suica card with Apple Pay, customers in Japan will need to add their Suica card or Suica commuter card to the Wallet app. Once added, the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus can be used in place of a standard card. Apple Pay in Japan works with credit and debit cards issued by American Express, JCB, Mastercard, Aeon Financial, Orico, Credit Saison, SoftBank, d Card, View Card, MUFG Card, and more. An iPhone 7, 7 Plus, or Apple Watch Series 2 is required to make purchases in stores and at transportation facilities in Japan. The iPhone 6, 6s, 6 Plus, 6s Plus, and SE, along with iPad Pro models, the iPad Air 2, and the iPad mini 3 and later, can be used to make payments within apps and on the web. Apple Pay is now available in 12 countries, including the U.S., UK, China, Australia, Canada, Switzerland, France, Hong Kong, Russia, Singapore, New Zealand, and Japan. Related Roundups: Apple Pay, iPhone 7, iOS 10 96 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) BMcCoy 3 weeks ago This is really big news - the Suica card system is huge in Japan, from travel to vending machines. This will absolutely drive increased iPhone sales in Japan. Rating: 5 Votes krause734 3 weeks ago Rating: 3 Votes macfacts 3 weeks ago I got the impression from a previous story that it was Japanese models only. I don't enough about the Suica system to know if it is straightforward NFC, and therefore compatible with all iPhones with Apple Pay. Would definitely be a bonus for visitors to Japan.. if there was an easy way to add Suica to your iPhone wallet. You then barely need to obtain any local Yen currency! Adding support for it outside of Japan is not going to happen because that would be millions of phones that need additional licensing fees to someone else. Rating: 2 Votes bkmintie 3 weeks ago I'm curious if US iPhone 7's will support Mobile Suica or if it's limited to the Japanese market A1779/A1785 models. Rating: 1 Votes a0me 3 weeks ago Finally! Japan has been using NFC in daily life for more than a decade. Rating: 1 Votes penpal1278 3 weeks ago My wife and I go to Japan frequently and we happened to be there for the AW2 launch so we picked up the Japanese models (although our iPhone 7es are American models) in the hope that we'll be able to use them as pasmo devices when we visit. My assumption is that we will have to have a Japanese apple id in order to leverage it but I'm not sure yet. Her apple id is already tied to Japan and she has been able to use apple pay here in the US, so we'll see what happens. I can confirm that a Japanese Apple ID is not needed to use Suica. You'll be able to download the dedicated Suica app through the App Store where you'll be able to register for a new card. The app seems to only be offered in Japanese for now. [doublepost=1477364477][/doublepost] I'm curious if US iPhone 7's will support Mobile Suica or if it's limited to the Japanese market A1779/A1785 models. It's limited to iPhone 7/7+ and AW2 sold in Japan unfortunately... [doublepost=1477364678][/doublepost] Isn't there a law in Japan that forces Apple do to that? Because if that's not the reason, then yeah: that's a really weird thing that Apple has done. It's not a law, but the government strongly suggests manufactures and carriers for the shutter sound to be enabled. They follow the government's suggestions to prevent mandatory regulations. [doublepost=1477364868][/doublepost] So i am going to Japan next year. If i use Australian Bank with Apple pay with my australian phone, will it work or not? Only at very limited (almost none) terminals that support NFC Type A/B... most only support FeLiCa in Japan. The only place I've seen a Type A/B terminal is at IKEA, confirmed that it works with my US based Apple Pay card! Rating: 1 Votes CarlosQG 3 weeks ago Nice for the Japanese market. Hope it comes to Mexico soon! Rating: 1 Votes dontwalkhand 3 weeks ago Finally! Japan has been using NFC in daily life for more than a decade. Yes but some sad proprietary system unlike PayPass/payWave like the rest of the world :( Rating: 1 Votes Ihatefall 3 weeks ago Too bad this is limited to iPhone 7s sold in Japan. I'll be visiting there soon and would love to use FeLiCa for public transport. You can still get a suica/ pasmo card. It costs 2000 yen and comes loaded with 1500 yen, Once you're done with it, return it for a 500 yen refund. You can buy a card for like 900 yen that blocks the interference from the iPhone and the suica card so you can slip it in your phone case. It's basically the same thing, and I have been doing it for 2 years now. I am going to go with a US iP7+ and Japanese AW2. I HATE how the Japanese iPhones make a shutter sound that can't be turned off, unlike every other iPhone in the world. Rating: 1 Votes Corrode 3 weeks ago You can still get a suica/ pasmo card.

Apple Releases iOS 10.1, watchOS 3.1, macOS Sierra 10.12.1, and tvOS 10.0.1 GO Final versions are available now for all supported devices Oct 24, 2016 17:55 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Just a few moments ago, Apple released the final versions of the iOS 10.1, macOS Sierra 10.12.1, watchOS 3.1, and tvOS 10.0.1, which are now available for everyone who wants to keep their devices up to date. Last week, when we reported the release of fifth Beta builds of the macOS Sierra 10.12.1 and iOS 10.1 operating systems, we told you that Apple could push the final versions of these maintenance updates to the stable channel, just in time for the Japan launch of their popular Apple Pay service, which is now live for everyone. So there you have it, iOS 10.1 is the first major update to the iOS 10 mobile operating system for supported iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices, including the recently unveiled iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, for which it introduces the new Portrait camera mode (currently still in Beta stages). But it looks like iOS 10.1 brings an improved Maps app that now features transit support for every major national bus line, train, ferry, subway, and local bus system in Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka, along with transit fare comparison when viewing the alternative transit routes. The Messages app also received various much-needed improvements in today's iOS 10.1 updates, such as a new option that lets users replay the full-screen and bubble effects, support for viewing the effects when the "Reduce Motion" option is active, as well as a bunch of fixes for some of the most annoying bugs. Additionally, it looks like there are several improvements for better Apple Watch support, and lots of other bug fixes, which you can view in detail if you check out the screenshot gallery attached at the end of the article. watchOS 3.1 is also out today, and you'll have to first install iOS 10.1 on your iPhone device to update your Apple Watch to watchOS 3.1. Here's what's new in macOS Sierra 10.12.1 On the other hand, Mac users can now update their computers to the first point release of the macOS Sierra 10.12 operating system, versioned 10.12.1, which improves the Photos app with automatic smart album support for those beautiful bokeh photos taken with the iPhone 7 Plus device running the iOS 10.1 build.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Three MacBook Pro models leaked before Apple event Eric Abent - Oct 24, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit On Thursday, Apple will hold another event to presumably reveal a set of new MacBook Pros. Obviously nothing is official until Apple makes it so, but there have been a number of leaks in the lead up to this event that all point to new MacBook models. Thanks to Russian regulators, we now have some more evidence to throw on the ever-growing pile that already exists. Consomac (as reported by 9to5Mac) has uncovered a Eurasian Economic Commission filing made by Apple that suggests the company will reveal three new MacBooks at this event. The listing gives almost nothing in terms of actual details. In fact, it only lists three model numbers – A1706, A1707, and A1708 – and says that these are all “portable personal computers models.” So, while this doesn’t give us any hints about what these new laptops will feature, it does nonetheless reinforce the notion that this event will be about the MacBook brand. The new MacBook Pro is said to come with a support for TouchID along with an LED touchscreen taking the place of normal function keys. This touch strip can contextually offer different buttons depending on the app the computer is running, reports have said. While that new MacBook Pro will supposedly be revealed in 13 and 15-inch varieties, rumor has it that Apple will also launch a new 13 inch version of the Retina MacBook. That covers the third MacBook listed here, even though the main focus of the rumors leading up to the event have been on the MacBook Pro refresh. We don’t have much longer to wait before we find out in the rumors were true, as Apple’s event will be going down on October 27. We’ll be on Apple’s campus that day to see what the company has in store, so keep it here at SlashGear for more. In the meantime, have a look through our Apple Hub to see all of the rumors you may have missed out on.

Apple first announced the "portrait mode" feature in September but it wasn't available until the company released its iOS 10.1 software update Monday. It replicates an effect typically limited to larger cameras known as SLRs. While SLRs accomplishes this by controlling how wide the lens opens, the iPhone uses software adjustments. Portrait mode requires an iPhone 7 Plus because it uses the phone's two lenses to sense depth. Other iPhones have only one camera lens. The software update will still be available for other iPhones because it also comes with bug fixes and other improvements. Michael Horowitz, from Chicago, checks out his new iPhone 7 Plus at the Apple Store on Michigan Avenue, in Chicago. Apple's iPhone 7 Plus is getting a new camera capability: the blurring of backgrounds to focus attention on people in the foreground. To use the feature, slide the mode at the bottom of the camera app to "portrait." It's between "photo" and "square." Then take a few steps back, as the feature taps the zoom on the iPhone 7 Plus's second lens, meaning images are enlarged two-fold. The screen will guide you to move closer or farther from the subject, or in some cases, find a setting with more light. When shooting multiple people, make sure everyone's the same distance from the camera to keep them all sharp. Apple is calling this depth-effect feature a beta, which means it's a work in progress. The iPhone will also save the unadjusted shots by default. Huawei's dual-lens P9 phone also has a similar feature. The update comes three days before Apple holds a product event in Cupertino, California, during which the company is expected to unveil new Mac computers. Separately, Apple announced Monday that a Nike edition of Apple Watch will come out Friday, starting at $369. The runner-focused watch was announced in September, but no specific date had been given. A customer sets up his new iPhone 7 Plus, right, as he switches from an iPhone 6 at the Apple Store on Michigan Avenue during the release of the Apple iPhone 7 and the latest Apple Watches, in Chicago.

Resend activation e-mail Infinite Loop / The Apple Ecosystem iOS 10.1 arrives with iPhone 7 Plus Portrait Mode and lots of fixes An overview of iOS 10's first major update. by Andrew Cunningham - Oct 24, 2016 5:41 pm UTC Login to bookmark 64 Apple has just posted the final version of iOS 10.1, the first major update to iOS 10 since it was released a month and a half ago. The update's biggest addition is exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus—it unlocks the "Portrait Mode" feature, which uses data from the main lens and telephoto lens to simulate the depth-of-field effect you often see used in professional photography. Unlike last week's iOS 10.0.3 release, iOS 10.1 is available for everything that runs iOS 10: the iPhone 5 and newer, the fourth-generation iPad and newer, the iPad Mini 2 and newer, both iPad Pros, and the sixth-generation iPod Touch. The build number, 14B72 on older iDevices and 14B72c on the 7 and 7 Plus, is identical to the beta build that was released last week, so if you're enrolled in Apple's public or developer beta programs, you already have the final version of the update. There are plenty of other fixes and tweaks in iOS 10.1, and for your convenience we've included the full release notes below. We've also spent some time with Portrait Mode on the iPhone 7 Plus, and we've included some sample shots to show you the kinds of pictures that are possible with the new feature. Hands-on with Portrait Mode Andrew Cunningham The first time you launch Portrait mode, you'll be told in no uncertain terms that this is a beta. Andrew Cunningham The first time you launch Portrait mode, you'll be told in no uncertain terms that this is a beta. Andrew Cunningham If you're too close to an object or your lighting is too bad, you won't be able to take the shot. Andrew Cunningham Portrait shots get a "depth effect" badge in the Photos app. Portrait Mode is clearly labeled as a "beta," so Apple's algorithms for combining images from the 7 Plus' two cameras may change subtly as iOS is updated. But here's the kind of thing you can expect as you begin to take shots: first, you won't always be able to take Portrait Mode shots if conditions aren't ideal. iOS will warn you if you're too close to the thing you're trying to photograph, for instance, or if your light is too low. Second, while these shots are quite a bit better than what we've seen in the past in other phones (HTC's One M8 is probably the most notable example), you are going to be able to find problems in many shots if you're zooming in and looking for them. It's not difficult to find small blurred bits in foreground objects or little patches of sharpness in what ought to be a blurred background. In particular, the camera has trouble with transparent or translucent objects, and the less light you have, the worse things are generally going to look. All things considered, though, most of these shots look good enough for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or any of the other social photo-sharing services where so many phone pictures end up. Especially when you’re shooting outdoors in the daylight, the pictures actually look pretty good. Andrew Cunningham Indoors, good light. Keep an eye on small details like the individual threads around the edges of the blue Yoshi. Andrew Cunningham Indoors, good light. Keep an eye on small details like the individual threads around the edges of the blue Yoshi. Andrew Cunningham The same shot in Portrait mode. The camera does a decent job here, though you lose a little detail around the edges if you know what to look at. Andrew Cunningham The effect doesn't work very well if you don't have good foreground lighting. Here's a cat. Andrew Cunningham Details around the edges, including the cat's whiskers, are obliterated with the depth mode on. The more solid the object, the better. Andrew Cunningham Case in point, here's a glass of ice water. Keep an eye on the rim of the glass and some of the details in the art. Andrew Cunningham Portrait mode blurs out too much of the glass and some of the art also gets smeared into the "background" here. Andrew Cunningham Here's where portrait mode is at its best. We've got a solid object in broad daylight with clearly differentiated foreground and background layers. Andrew Cunningham Here, iOS does a great job. The wall and mug in the foreground are near-perfectly preserved, while the background is attractively blurred. All Portrait Mode shots are automatically taken with the “telephoto” lens, since the image from the standard non-telephoto lens is being used to distinguish between the foreground and background layers. When you take a Portrait Mode shot, your phone saves both the blurred and the standard telephoto image. So even if your Portrait Mode shot doesn’t come out looking great, you still have the original to work with. The iOS Photos app makes it clear when you’re looking at a Portrait Mode image by adding a “Depth Effect” stamp to them, similar to the stamp that tells you when a picture is using HDR. You shouldn’t run out and buy an iPhone 7 Plus just for Portrait Mode, but as an added bonus on top of the telephoto lens, it’s not half bad. Just don’t go in expecting miracles or hoping to toss out your DSLR. Notable tweaks and complete release notes Enabling "reduce motion" and switching off iMessage effects are now separate toggles; you'll only see the second toggle if "reduce motion" is enabled, though. Enabling "reduce motion" and switching off iMessage effects are now separate toggles; you'll only see the second toggle if "reduce motion" is enabled, though. In iOS 10.0, the sticker UI couldn't handle it if you had too many packs installed. Note how the dots across the bottom of the screen crash into the rest of the UI. iOS 10.1 makes a couple of changes. First, the dots are gone, replaced with a more flexible scrollbar. Second, the name of the current sticker pack is always displayed at the bottom of the screen. In iOS 10.0, it would display briefly before disappearing. For convenience's sake, we've pasted the full release notes for iOS 10.1 below. Major fixes include improvements to Bluetooth connectivity for third-party accessories, Japanese public transit directions in Maps, and iCloud backup support for the names of people that you enter into the Photos app. Users with the "reduce motion" setting enabled can also see iMessage effects now (though they can still be disabled), and the UI for choosing stickers has been tweaked to look less busted for people with lots of sticker apps installed. The full release notes are below: Camera and Photos Introduces Portrait Camera for iPhone 7 Plus that creates a depth effect that keeps your subject sharp while creating a beautifully blurred background (beta) People names in the Photos app are saved in iCloud backups Improved the display of wide color gamut photos in the grid views of the Photos app Fixes an issue where opening the Camera app would show a blurred or flashing screen for some users Fixes an issue that caused Photos to quit for some users when turning on iCloud Photo Library Maps Transit support for every major train, subway, ferry, and national bus line, as well as local bus systems for Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya Sign-based transit navigation including layouts of all underground structures and walkways that connect large transit stations Transit fare comparison when viewing alternative transit routes Messages New option to replay bubble and full screen effects Messages effects can play with Reduce Motion enabled Fixes an issue that could lead to contact names appearing incorrectly in Messages Addresses an issue where Messages could open to a white screen Addresses an issue that could prevent the report junk option from displaying with unknown senders Fixes an issue where videos captured and sent in the Messages app could be missing audio Apple Watch Adds distance and average pace to workout summaries in the Activity app for outdoor wheelchair run pace and outdoor wheelchair walk pace Fixes issues that may have prevented Music playlists from syncing to Apple Watch Addresses an issue that was preventing invitations and data to appear in Activity Sharing Fixes an issue that was allowing Activity Sharing to update over cellular when manually disabled Resolves an issue that was causing some third-party apps to crash when inputting text Other improvements and fixes Improves Bluetooth connectivity with 3rd party accessories Improves AirPlay Mirroring performance when waking a device from sleep Fixes an issue where playback would not work for iTunes purchased content when the “Show iTunes Purchases” setting is turned off Fixes an issue where certain selfie apps and face filters used with the FaceTime HD Camera on iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus did not display a live preview Fixes an issue in Health where individual strokes are converted to separate characters when using the Chinese handwriting keyboard Improves performance of sharing websites from Safari to Messages Fixes an issue in Safari that caused web previews in tab view to not display correctly Fixes an issue that caused certain Mail messages to be reformatted with very small text Fixes an issue that caused some HTML email to be formatted incorrectly Fixes an issue that in some cases caused the search field to disappear in Mail Fixes an issue that could prevent Today View Widgets from updating when launched Fixes an issue where Weather widget sometimes failed to load data Fixes an issue on iPhone 7 where Home Button click settings would not appear in search results Fixes an issue that prevented spam alert extensions from blocking calls Resolves an issue that could prevent alarm sounds from going off Fixes an issue where audio playback via Bluetooth would cause the Taptic engine to stop providing feedback for some users Resolves an issue preventing some users from restoring from iCloud Backup Listing image by Andrew Cunningham Expand full story Reader comments 64 You must login or create an account to comment.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Cindy Boren October 24 Follow @cindyboren Look, no one expected Annie Apple and Eli Apple to agree on everything. (Alyssa Schukar/AP Images for P&G) Annie Apple’s job brought her into direct conflict with her son’s employer over the weekend. On Sunday, Sports Illustrated published an Annie Apple essay in which she described being a victim of domestic violence and took aim at New York Giants owner John Mara, who owns the team for which her son, Eli, plays. She especially took exception to Mara’s comment that the team didn’t know “the extent” of the abuse kicker Josh Brown admitted he inflicted on his now ex-wife. “How are you a so-called champion of domestic violence but lack basic compassion for a victim?” wrote Annie Apple, who is also an ESPN contributor. “Yes, this man signs my son’s checks as I’ve been reminded on Twitter. Mr. Mara owns the New York Giants. He doesn’t own Annie Apple. Wrong is wrong. And Mr. Mara’s comments were unapologetically wrong and hit at a raw place.” [Tom Brady isn’t about to bail out the NFL on the Josh Brown matter] Her son, a rookie cornerback, learned of his mother’s essay after the team’s victory in London. It was a tough spot to be in, but the 21-year-old handled it with aplomb. “I was like, ‘godd—,’” Apple said (via the New York Daily News’ Pat Leonard). “But she’s her own person. She’s gonna do whatever she wants to do. She’s gonna talk about this. I’ve just got to understand that. It’s cool. “My mom’s very vocal and that topic is very important to her, so I can understand where she was coming from. But at the same time in my position I just have to do my part and play football and do what I can do.” [The NFL’s problem with women isn’t getting any better] Brown was suspended for one game until last week, when intense criticism forced the decision to place him on the commissioner’s exempt list. Eli Apple admitted that he and the Giants had preemptively discussed the matter. “I talked to them, let them know my mom, her reactions like that sometimes are like that, she’s her own person, she’s gonna do that, so I’ve just got to do my job,” he said. “I just made sure I talked to everybody, man, just let them know, whoever is concerned. . . . “She has a voice, she has a voice and she’s gonna use it no matter. I love her for that. She’s a unique woman and she’s always gonna speak up no matter what and I can’t really control that. I’ve just got to play football, . . . I tried to [talk to her]. She’s a little upset at everybody right now, so I’m probably gonna give her space a little bit.” sports early-lead Get the top Olympics news by email Major news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox as it happens. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

The new update marks the end of an abnormally long beta period for a relatively minor update, but there was a good reason Apple went through five different developer beta versions of its latest mobile software build. The star feature, Portrait Mode for the iPhone 7 Plus, had to be thoroughly tested to ensure that it was ready for primetime. And as we saw on Monday in samples captured by a professional portrait photographer, it is definitely ready for primetime. DON'T MISS: Report claims iPhone 8 will feature a revolutionary new design that no one saw coming Portrait Mode is a new feature enabled by the dual cameras on the back of the iPhone 7 Plus. By combining the main 12-megapixel wide-angle lens with a secondary telephoto lens, the device is able to add a bokeh effect behind the subject of a photo that mimics the background blurring you would see in a portrait captured by a DSLR camera. The results are stunning. iOS 10.1 also includes a number of other new features as well as bug fixes and refinements that impact all devices, not just the iPhone 7 Plus. The update is available immediately as an over the air (OTA) update or as a download that can be installed by connecting your iOS devices to a computer using iTunes.

Called Portrait, it takes advantage of the two cameras on the back of the camera to give you a DSLR-like effect to your pictures. We've been using the feature on our iPhone 7 Plus to find out the best way to use it. To update your device to iOS 10.1, plug your device into power and connect to the internet with Wi-Fi. Then, tap Settings > General > Software Update. From there, tap Download and Install. That's it. How do I use Portrait Mode? The Portrait mode is found in the camera app. It's accessed by swiping between the different shooting mode, as you've previously done before with modes like Panorama, Photo, or Square. It is only available on the iPhone 7 Plus, so if you own an iPhone 7, sorry it isn't available to you. To use it simply scroll to Portrait in the camera app and start taking photos. You might have to follow some on-screen instructions to take the perfect picture. These pics show what the iPhone 7 Plus dual camera is capable of Go to Apple's Camera app, then slide over to the Portrait mode, and the mode should prompt you to move back. At the end, you get a Depth Effect picture, plus one without the effect so you can see the difference. Pocket-lint What is Portrait Mode and how does it work? The technology behind Portrait is called Depth Effect. Depth Effect is designed to deliver a more DSLR-like photo with a shallower depth of field (read: softer, out-of-focus background) by creating a depth map comparison of what the two differing lenses see in front of them. In addition to the usual wide-angle lens, a telephoto lens is located on the rear of iPhone 7 Plus. Apple has devised a way to use both lenses at the same time to mimic depth of field when taking portrait shots. Apple iPhone 7 Plus camera: Dual camera tech explained What is bokeh? Here's the photography effect explained When you capture in Portrait mode, the camera snaps two photos: one regular and one with blur applied to the background. Apple's built-in image signal processor scans the scene, then applies machine-learning techniques to recognise people in the image, and ultimately creates a depth map using the device's two cameras, which results in an image where the people are in focus while the background has a bokeh-like effect. This allows software to digitally blur the background, which it identifies as being farther away, while keeping the foreground sharp. Or at least that's the idea. Pocket-lint Can I use Portrait to take all my pictures? It's probably not advisable. The Portrait mode comes with a number of caveats: you'll need plenty of light, to be the right distance away from your subject with ample distance from the background, to have lots of contrast between the foreground and the background, for there to be not too many faces in the picture, oh and for your subjects to stay still. This is no snap-and-go offering. Pocket-lint Portrait Tips and Tricks To use this new mode, launch the Camera and select “Portrait." Once in this mode, you are guided real-time with a live preview of the depth effect, including how to best distance the camera from the subject. We find the best portraits of someone are in brighter light. If shooting more than one person, we recommend up to three people. Keep them in the same plane if you want everyone to stay sharp. The further your subject is from your background, the more pronounced the blur effect will be. You’ll also notice better blur if you have good contrast between your subject and the background such as contrasting colours. Portrait likes faces, but it can be used to shoot objects just make sure they are high contrasting to get the best effect. Thin objects or scenes where there are a lot of similar colours don't look as good. In the beta, pictures have looked great on screen, but not so great blown up full size on a monitor. If you want to ensure you have a backup of what would be a non-Portrait version of the image, make sure you've got the Keep Normal Photo option ticked in settings (Settings > Photos & Camera). This will save a photo without the depth of field effect applied in addition to the Portrait Version. Is that all iOS 10.1 brings? The iOS 10.1 update includes some smaller features and bug fixes for other iOS 10 devices. It corrects a syncing bug that kept iTunes tracks from being stored on the Apple Watch, for instance. Apple also said the update also "improves Bluetooth connectivity with third-party accessories", which suggests iOS 10.1 might correct the Android Wear issue that prevented smartwatches from connecting to an iPhone.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | October 24, 2016 -- 17:00 GMT (10:00 PDT) | Topic: Mobility Smartwatch shipments fell 52 percent in the third quarter to 2.7 million units with Apple posting the second-largest decline behind Lenovo, according to IDC data. The research firm did note that Apple still leads the category with 1.1 million shipments. IDC also points out that Apple Watch sales in the third quarter of 2015 were offset by its initial widespread availability after a limited online launch, which likely boosted its sales. What's more, Apple's second generation Apple Watch was only made available during the last two weeks of September. Garmin took the biggest bite out of Apple's market share and posted the largest year-over-year increase in shipments. Garmin's success is due to its ConnectIQ-enabled smartwatches, and the addition of the fenix Chronos, IDC said. Another major factor in the decline in smartwatch shipments is Google's decision to hold back Android Wear 2.0, said IDC wearables research manager Ramon Llamas. "Collectively, this left vendors relying on older, aging devices to satisfy customers," he said. Lenovo's woes are linked to out-of-stock issues and no new product introductions in time for the holiday season. Samsung has remained relatively steady despite that fact that its newest watch, the Gear S3, is still not generally available. It's worth noting that IDC's data only includes smartwatches capable of running third-party applications on the device. Devices such as the Fitbit Blaze and Withings Activite are classified as basic wearables.

 The new Portrait mode for the iPhone 7 Plus camera is available now Steve Kovach Oct. 24, 2016, 12:59 PM 2,589 facebook linkedin twitter email print Portrait mode on the iPhone. Steve Kovach/Business Insider The new camera mode Apple promised for the iPhone 7 Plus is here. On Monday, Apple released iOS 10.1, which includes the new Portrait mode for the iPhone 7 Plus. Portrait mode mimics the "bokeh" effect in DSLR cameras by keeping the subject in focus and blurring the background. It's only possible with the iPhone 7 Plus because of its dual cameras. However, Apple says even though Portrait mode is available to the public, it's still considered a beta product, meaning it will likely improve over time. Early testers of the feature have noted glitches with photos in some cases. You can get iOS 10.1 on your iPhone by going to Settings > General > Software Update.

The new tvOS 10.0.1 update can be downloaded over the air through the Settings app on the Apple TV by going to System --> Software Update. Those who have automatic software updates turned on will be upgraded to the new operating system automatically. As a minor 10.x.x update, tvOS 10.0.1 focuses on performance improvements and bug fixes to address issues discovered since the release of tvOS 10. During the beta testing process, no major outward-facing changes or obvious bug fixes were discovered. The tvOS 10.0.1 update does not include support for single sign-on, a feature that will allow Apple TV users to sign in once with their cable credentials to access all live cable content included in a cable subscription. Apple has said single sign-on will be introduced in a future update. tvOS 10 brings improved search, expanded Siri capabilities, a new dark mode, a Continuity option for using the iPhone for text input, automatic download of universal apps, easy access to live TV, and more.

The full release notes are included below. Anecdotally, watchOS 3.1 includes some noticeable improvements to battery life as well as the usual slew of bug fixes.

Apple has also released iOS 10.1 for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch today. To update Apple Watch, visit Software Update in the Watch app on your paired iPhone. The Watch requires 50% battery and must be connected to power to complete the update. A small update for tvOS and macOS 10.12.1 is also available now, ahead of Apple’s media event on Thursday where it is expected to unveil a new range of Mac laptops. Here’s the full list of changes for watchOS 3.1: New option to replay bubble and full screen effects in Messages. Messages effect can play with Reduce Motion enabled. Fixes an issue that could pause the notification for Timer complete to be delivered twice. Resolves an issue that could prevent Apple Watch Series 2 from fully charging.

Follow TechnoBuffalo After several weeks of beta updates, Apple on Monday released the final version of iOS 10.1. What might not seem significant on the surface is actually a pretty big update, because the release includes Portrait Mode for the iPhone 7 Plus. Portrait Mode is a new feature that’s designed to mimic what photographers get with more expensive gear. We’ve seen companies introduce artificial bokeh effects before, and Apple is essentially doing the same thing here. Apple explains: When you take a shot with the iPhone 7 Plus, the dual-camera system uses both cameras and advanced machine learning to make your subject sharp while creating the same out-of-focus blur in the background—known as the bokeh effect—previously reserved for DLSR cameras. So no matter what’s behind your subject, it’s easy to create a great portrait. For people who take a lot of pictures of friends and family, Portrait Mode could prove to be a big new feature. It might even become a good emergency solution for pros out in the field. Other updates in version 10.1 include: People names in the Photos app are saved in iCloud backups. Improved the display of wide color gamut photos in the grid views of the Photos app Fixed an issue where opening the Camera app would show blurred or flashing screen for some users Apple is also introducing some new features for Maps and Messages, including the ability to replay bubble and full screen effects. And for those who like to keep Reduce Motion enabled, you can now use the new Messages effects. Full release notes are below.

Fifteen years and one day ago, a turtlenecked Steve Jobs stood on a nondescript stage, in front of an un-glitzy presentation screen using comically uncool fonts, and introduced the device that would set in motion the digital music age: the iPod. And while this newfangled device took a couple years to catch on, perhaps because of its cost ($399) and compatibility (Mac-only), the iPod eventually became the de facto MP3 player for music lovers eager to have their entire music collections in one tiny device. Others eventually tried (RIP Zune), but few found the "recipe" for digital music that Jobs described back on Oct. 23, 2001. "In this whole new digital music revolution, there is no market leader," he told the audience. "There are small companies, like Creative and SONICblue, and then there’s some large companies like Sony that haven’t had a hit yet. They haven’t found the recipe. No one has really found the recipe yet for digital music. And we think not only can we find the recipe, but the Apple brand is going to be fantastic, because people trust the Apple brand to get their great digital electronics from." Watch Jobs' presentation: People may have trusted Apple, but they weren’t clamoring to throw down $400 for a 5GB music player, especially if you had to have a Mac. The possibilities opened up a year later when Apple added Windows compatibility, and then in 2003 launched the all-important iTunes Music Store, which meant instead of users having to create their own MP3s (remember ripping all your CDs?), a consumer could just buy a single song or album and synch it to their iPod in a couple easy steps. That CD-->Computer-->iPod process was on full display in the very first iPod commercial, released in 2001 and featuring an enthusiastic guy rocking out to a song by the Propellerheads. Two years after the gadget’s debut, Apple’s ad agency TBWA/Chiat/Day went to Jobs with print ad mockups that featured colorful backgrounds and silhouettes of people dancing with their stark white iPods and chords dangling. According to Walter Isaacson’s book Steve Jobs, the CEO was initially cool on the idea, but he eventually gave the go-ahead. Over the next several years, the sillhouette billboards -- and those TV ads, see below -- would become some of the decade’s most iconic, and affective, pieces of marketing. The year 2004 also saw the introduction of the iPod mini, a much smaller and more colorful cousin to the regular iPod.  A year after that came the iPod Shuffle (which did exactly that) and the iPod Nano, which was touted as being the same width of a pencil. Ads for the Nano were as cool as the device itself, with the most memorable one featuring Feist's "1234." Then came the iPod Touch, which had the look and user experience of the just-released iPhone (2007) but without the phone part. Over the years, the Touch has evolved in tandem with its phone cousin and today is the only iteration of the iPod remaining in the Apple Store. (The original iPod Classic design was killed off in 2014.) The Touch is currently in its fifth-generation and includes the same A8 chip as the iPhone 6. The iPod’s fall from grace coincided with the drop in digital download sales and the rise of streaming as a dominant format. (Who needs 160GB of storage when there’s a cloud up there with practically every song?) It also became redundant when iPhones and other smartphones began doing exact same thing. (Remember carrying around an iPod AND a flip phone? Crazy!) But just like how there are people who will never give up their vinyl LPs, there will be well-heeled collectors who want their thousands of MP3s organized in one mobile device. For them, the iPod will live on.

The numbers show that the smartwatch market is still have to deal with low demand even though some great new smartwatches have been launched recently. Despite that, the Apple Watch remains on top of the list. Market research firm IDC reports that in the third quarter of this year, smartwatch makers shipped 2.7 million units combined with Apple accounting for 41.3 percent as it alone shipped 1.1 million units. The fruit company is followed by Garmin in second place as it shipping 0.6 million units during this period while Samsung came third with 0.4 million units shipped. It merits mentioning here that Samsung’s latest smartwatch – the Gear S3 – was only announced in the third quarter and it hasn’t been released yet. IDC explains that low growth persisted in the third quarter because Google’s decision to delay Android Wear 2.0 may have forced OEMs to push their new Android Wear smartwatches to 2017 while Apple’s new watchOS update didn’t arrive before the end of September. Collectively, these issues left customers to pick older smartwatches that they may not necessarily wanted to spend money on. The numbers might be a bit better in the fourth quarter of this year as the Gear S3 will play its part to grow the smartwatch market, while supply will gradually ease up for the Apple Watch as well in due time.

The products have apparently passed the Russian registration, with the label ‘portable personal computer models’ with model identifiers A1706, A1707, and A1708. This falls in line with numerous other reports, including the one from KGI over the weekend. These three MacBooks are likely two MacBook Pros (13 and 15-inch), along with a 13-inch MacBook to go along with its 12-inch successor. The same source identified the iPhone 7, Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2 a week before Apple’s September event last month. It’s mandatory in Russia for all companies to go through regulations for electronics that use encryption or cryptography technologies, which is basically the entire Apple product line. But beyond model numbers, the regulations don’t show much more. Though it does suggest that the new Macs will be available either on the same day or a few days after they’re announced on October 27. Don’t forget to tune in to Today’s iPhone as we’ll be covering Apple’s October 27 ‘hello again’ event live. The event kicks off at 10AM PT, as always.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Front Page Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Front Page Tue, Oct 25, 2016 - Page 1　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Industrial output grows for second consecutive month APPLE EFFECT:The electronics component sector posted a 20.69 percent annual jump in production due to strong demand for the iPhone 7 By Lauly Li  /  Staff reporter The nation’s industrial production posted annual growth of 5.02 percent last month, marking its second consecutive month of expansion, boosted by demand for Apple Inc’s iPhone 7 series, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said yesterday. The recovery might help industrial output swing back into positive territory this year, after last year’s decline. Manufacturing — which accounts for nearly 93 percent of total industrial output — last month climbed 6.47 percent year-on-year, marking its fifth consecutive month of gains, the ministry said. The electronic component ssector, which is the pillar of the manufacturing industry, saw a 20.69 percent annual jump in production due to strong demand for the iPhone 7, Department of Statistics Deputy Director-General Wang Shu-chuan (王淑娟) said. The result narrowed the year-on-year contraction in industrial production for the first nine months of the year to 0.12 percent, compared with the 0.75 percent fall recorded in the first eight months, she said. “The ministry now expects industrial output to register an annual growth this year, as the outlook remains positive,” Wang told a news conference, declining to estimate a range. Strong sales of smartphones by international brands are fueling inventory demand for electronic components this month, benefiting Taiwanese firms that supply medium and small panels, chipmakers and chip packagers, Wang said. Global demand for TVs, smartwatches and virtual-reality devices is expected to boost sales of computers and optical products this month, she said. Wang said that recovering demand and rising selling prices for steel would also lend support to industrial output and so would local petrochemical plants completing annual maintenance. The ministry estimates that production this month will increase 4 percent year-on-year, she said. In a separate statement, the ministry said that wholesale revenue last month fell 0.9 percent annually and 0.8 percent monthly to NT$826.3 billion (US$26.08 billion), dragged by declining demand for machinery tools. Wang said that softening demand for machinery tools from Japan last month offset the growth momentum in chips, panels, DRAM and graphics cards. Wang said the retail sector posted 2.2 percent annual growth in sales to NT$328 billion last month, supported by department stores’ annual sales. Thanks to an increase in the number of wedding banquets and restaurant spending, restaurant sector revenue rose 5.3 percent to NT$35 billion last month, she said. The ministry forecast that the revenues of the retail and restaurant sectors would climb by 1 percent and 2 percent respectively this month from last month, on the back of the peak season for annual sales and the Double Ten National Day holiday, Wang said.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) Share Written by Mike Murphy October 24, 2016 This Thursday (Oct. 27), Apple will be showing off some new hardware at its Cupertino, California headquarters. About a month after showing off the new iPhone and Apple Watch, this event’s focus is likely to be on Apple’s long-overlooked computers. It’s not clear whether Apple will live-stream the event, which starts at 10am US Pacific time (1pm US eastern time). If so, it will likely be found here on Apple’s site, but be warned: You’ll have to use Apple’s Safari web browser or an Apple TV device to watch it. In any case, Quartz will liveblog the event, so check back for real-time updates and analysis. We’ve considered everything Apple could present and given it an emoji rating, based on how likely we think a new version will be unveiled: A ✅ means we think it’s a near certainty, a ❌ means we probably won’t see any updates, and 🌁 means we’re, erm, foggy. It is in the Bay Area, after all. Here’s what we might see: New MacBook Pros ✅ Apple’s top-line laptops haven’t had a design refresh in four years. This may change. It’s rumored that the new Pros will have a thin interactive touchscreen sitting above the keyboard, replacing the function keys. The screen will be able to dynamically display information based on what programs you have open, such as controls for the song you’re currently listening to on Apple Music. The new Pros may also have the option for massive 2 TB solid-state hard drives, which would be a marked change for a company that’s been miserly with storage options in the past. It’s also expected that the new MacBook Pros will have far fewer ports than the current Pros—they’re not likely to be as minimalistic as the single-port MacBook that was first released in 2015, but it’s looking like the new Pros will only have USB-C and Lightning ports, meaning many of your current peripherals won’t work without some sort of dongle. But unlike the new iPhone 7, it is expected that the new Pros will have a headphone jack. Updated MacBook Airs ✅ Apple’s thinnest laptops have been given only minor processor and storage updates over the last six years. There were rumors that Apple might kill off the Air line, leaving the MacBooks as the lowest-cost laptops that the company sells. According to Bloomberg, Apple will update the hardware on the Air, stuffing in modern processors and ports, but won’t update the screen resolution. So if you want a high-resolution Retina Mac laptop, you’ll have to shell out extra for a MacBook or MacBook Pro. Updated iMacs ✅ Apple’s flagship desktop computer hasn’t has a design refresh in four years, or a spec update in a year. Apple is likely to update its iMacs with modern processors and more storage space, but it’s unclear it there’s a plan to update the design of the computer. Apple probably will release a version with USB-C ports, and potentially new chips made by AMD, according to Bloomberg. New external displays 🌁 Apple hasn’t updated its high-definition computer screens in five years, but apparently a new version will soon be seeing the light of day. The new displays are expected to output 5K-quality video, with the help of a built-in GPU and a new Thunderbolt 3 connection. They won’t work with the current MacBooks—without some sort of dongle, at least. Apple may not have these ready for Thursday’s event, according to MacRumors. New Mac Pros ❌ Gizmodo is reporting that Apple’s high-end trashcan-shaped desktop computer will likely not be updated at this week’s event. It’s been roughly three years since Apple last updated the Pro. If you’re a videographer, animator, or other creator that relies on Macs, you will be left waiting on updates to the company’s most powerful machines. New Mac Minis ❌ Similarly, Gizmodo says Apple’s smallest desktop is likely not to be updated this week, even though we haven’t seen a new Mac Mini model in two years. AirPods availability ✅ Apple’s new $160 wireless earphones were unveiled at the company’s iPhone event in September, and they were supposed to be available in “late October.” They’re still not available on Apple’s website, so it seems likely they’ll go on sale the day of this week’s event if they’re actually going to go on sale in October. One more thing 🌁 We haven’t had any surprising revelations at any recent Apple events–pretty much every new piece of hardware and software has been at least partially uncovered before Apple officially announces it. Perhaps this week’s event will be different. There have been rumblings about a new smart-home device to rival Amazon’s Echo and Google’s forthcoming Home. We haven’t seen updates on Apple’s newest Apple TV in the last year, so there’s a chance that we could hear about a refresh this week. It was also at this event last year that we first were introduced to the massive iPad Pro, so it’s possible that there could be some updates to Apple’s largest tablet.

Buying Guides Which iPhone Is the Best for You? Tim Brookes October 24, 2016 24-10-2016 6 minutes Which iPhone Is the Best for You? Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon Whatsapp Email Ads by Google A few years ago, Apple produced a single iPhone. At present, they are selling five separate models, including larger “Plus” variants and a cheaper, more compact SE model iPhone SE Review & Giveaway iPhone SE Review & Giveaway Apple's newest iPhone is the smallest produced by the company since the release of the iPhone 5s in 2013. Despite being crammed with the latest hardware, you'd struggle to tell the two apart. Read More . If you’ve decided you want to buy an Apple smartphone, you might be wondering which one you should go for. Once budget has been accounted for, the answer to that question very much depends on the person asking it. So we’ve devised a few different scenarios to help you weigh the pros and cons of each option. Don’t forget to tell us why you chose your model in the comments below! Your Options As mentioned, there are five separate iPhone models to choose from at present: The latest iPhone 7 (from $649) and larger iPhone 7 Plus (from $769). Last generation’s iPhone 6s (from $549) and larger iPhone 6s Plus (from $649). The smaller and cheaper iPhone SE (from $399). There are notable differences between each model, including Plus and non-Plus models within the same generation. There are also notable differences in the price, base and maximum storage capacity, color availability, battery life, and more. Let’s take a look at a few scenarios and see which iPhone is best for you. Buyers on a Budget Buy: iPhone SE. Also consider the iPhone 6s if you can afford the extra $150. Ads by Google Even low budgets come with high expectations, and a lot of folks would probably be surprised that even they can afford one of Apple’s notoriously expensive smartphones. The iPhone SE is the cheapest of the bunch, but it’s still a fast and highly capable device. The worst thing about the SE is that it feels a bit old-hat now, as it uses the exact same chassis seen on the iPhone 5. But the insides are all-new for 2016: the same A9 chip as the iPhone 6s, 2 GB of RAM, a top-quality 12 MP camera, Live Photos, and 4K video at 30 frames per second. The screen is a bit of a let-down, and it’s only 4 inches compared to 4.7 inches on the iPhone 6s. You’ll miss out on 3D Touch and a larger screen, and the video quality isn’t quite as good as the iPhone 6s, but if those things don’t really matter to you and you want the Apple smartphone experience in a cheaper, smaller package 5 Things You Need to Know About the iPhone SE 5 Things You Need to Know About the iPhone SE The iPhone SE is more than a boring, cut-price iPhone 5c refresh, and it's not cheap either. Read More , then the iPhone SE is well worth a look. Keep in mind that you can only choose between 16 GB and 64 GB storage capacity — any larger and you’ll have to look at a different iPhone model. Best for Battery Life Buy: iPhone 6s Plus or 7 Plus. A larger phone means a larger battery; it’s as simple as that. Both the latest Plus-sized models include significantly improved battery life over their smaller counterparts. This comes at the cost of ergonomics, as these models feel very big in the hand, and one-handed operation can be difficult even if you have oversized palms. You’ll get up to around 10 hours increased talk time and 20 hours increased wireless audio playback according to Apple’s own figures (which are usually pretty accurate). In the real world, this means your phone is far more likely to last all day long, even if you’re making phone calls, browsing, taking pictures, and using Siri a lot. Don’t forget that you can also employ a few tricks to help iOS 10 better manage your energy How to Fix Poor iOS 10 Battery Life How to Fix Poor iOS 10 Battery Life Battery life not quite what it was before you updated? Here's what's going on and how to improve it. Read More . The Plus models really are considerably larger, so it’s probably worth heading to a shop to see if you can stomach the size before a purchase. Also keep in mind that the larger battery will take longer to charge. The iPhone 6s Plus will cost you $120 less and omits the fancy new dual-lens camera, faster A10 chip, and only comes in 32 GB and 128 GB models. If you can afford it, the iPhone 7 Plus is the better choice, and the lack of headphone port shouldn’t bother you either No Stereo Jack, No Problem: Why the iPhone 7 Sounds Great No Stereo Jack, No Problem: Why the iPhone 7 Sounds Great It's official -- Apple has removed the standard 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7. But don't worry, this is a good thing. Read More . For Smartphone Photographers Buy: iPhone 7 Plus. The only iPhone with a dual-lens system also happens to be the largest Everything You Need to Know About the iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus Everything You Need to Know About the iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus No headphone port, water and dust resistance, and Apple's best camera yet -- this is the iPhone 7. Read More . This provides an impressive 2x optical zoom, allowing you to get closer to your subject without having to move or rely on terrible digital zoom. The regular wide lens is faster, with an aperture of f/1.8 for a shallower depth of field, while the telephoto still provides impressive performance at f/2.8. There’s a new quad-LED TrueTone flash too, and you can order the highest-ever capacity iPhone by opting for a 256 GB model. As of iOS 10, the iPhone 6s and later can shoot RAW, so you might need that extra space if you’re hoping to make use of this feature. While the dual-lens system is nice, the iPhone 7 is also a worthy contender. It too includes the same six-element f/1.8 wide lens, improved flash, and 256 GB option, but if you intend on shooting a lot of pictures, you might miss the considerably larger battery and humongous 5.5-inch screen for composing your shots. The “Toughest” iPhone Buy: iPhone 7. Also consider AppleCare+ with any iPhone purchase. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are the only water-resistant models on the market, built to the IP67 standard and capable of being submerged up to a meter for 30 minutes. That’s long enough to survive a clumsy dunk in the kitchen sink (or worse) without having to pay an AppleCare+ premium for a fix. Of course you should still buy a case to protect against bumps and scratches, and probably avoid the Plus sized model if you’re prone to drops. The larger device is much harder to use one-handed, which means you’ll be shifting your grip a lot if you don’t have both hands free. I’ve spent a week or two with the iPhone 7 Plus, and even with large hands, I’ve nearly dropped it on numerous occasions for this very reason (and it’s not even mine). The Best All-Rounder Buy: iPhone 7. The iPhone 6s is also great if you can’t quite afford the extra $100. Is it any surprise that Apple’s best all-rounder is their flagship phone? The non-Plus models are the bread and butter of the iPhone world. Apple sells the most of them, they’re not overly large, and they include all but a few features that Apple reserves for its largest models. This time round, it’s the dual-lens camera that’s missing; prior to this, it was cinematic image stabilization (missing from the iPhone 6s). Battery life is okay, but nothing remarkable. You’ll get the major new features, like 3D Touch, which allows for pressure-sensitive input so you can quickly access app features or peek inside links Why 3D Touch Might Make You Switch to an iPhone Why 3D Touch Might Make You Switch to an iPhone Android fans: we can no longer claim we have the best smartphone. Read More by squeezing the screen. There’s also a huge number of cases and accessories available as the design is well-established at this stage. The iPhone 7 uses Apple’s most powerful A10 processor, a superior f/1.8 lens, louder speakers, and a smart new home button that doesn’t use moving parts. It also omits the headphone jack, though there’s an adapter in the box. Don’t write the iPhone 6s off either, it’s still a great option but will certainly end up showing its age sooner than the iPhone 7 in terms of overall performance. Last Requests We’ve nearly covered everything, but just to be sure: Want the shiny black one? Order an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus and choose Jet Black when ordering. You can also opt for the matte Black version too. Want the smallest iPhone? Get the iPhone SE. It’s the same size as the iPhone 5, with a 4-inch screen and same performance as the iPhone 6s. Want the latest and greatest? Either the regular or Plus-sized iPhone 7 is what you’re after — unless you’re prepared to wait for the iPhone 8 Why You Might Want to Skip the iPhone 7 & Wait for the iPhone 8 Why You Might Want to Skip the iPhone 7 & Wait for the iPhone 8 2017 marks ten years of iPhones, and rumor has it that Apple has something very special planned. Read More , that is. Got an Apple Watch? It doesn’t matter, all of the iPhone models currently on sale work great with Apple’s wearable. Addicted to selfies? The iPhone 6s, 7, and Plus models all have improved 5 MP front-facing cameras, and a flash that uses the device’s screen to light up your face. You could even go for something older, like an iPhone 6 or 5s by trawling eBay for a bargain! So which iPhone did you go for, and why?

The re-imagining of Apple Regent Street in London marks the continuing evolution of Apple, going beyond retail to create richer, more dynamic experiences for visitors. Its innovative design creates a relaxed environment, while incorporating Apple’s new features and services. The design is the result of a close collaboration between Apple’s teams led by Jonathan Ive, chief design officer and Angela Ahrendts, senior vice president of Retail and Foster + Partners. Save this picture! © Nigel Young Regent Street is one of the most famous shopping streets in the world, and the site where Apple opened its first retail store in Europe in 2004. The new store occupies the same building, with the Grade II listed historic façade now restored and preserved. Built in 1898, the building was the studio of Victorian mosaicist Antonio Salviati of Venice, who was responsible for the exquisite mosaics at the Albert Memorial Chapel in Windsor and St Paul's Cathedral in London. Save this picture! Ground Floor Stefan Behling, Architect at Foster + Partners said, “The new Apple Regent Street is about a respectful dialogue between old and new – carrying forward a heritage of craftsmanship in a contemporary way. Contained within its historic fabric, is a new grand ‘town square’ with trees that bring nature into the interior spaces. Everything from the vast luminous ceiling to the sculptural stone handrails create an experience that is warm and inviting, providing a calm backdrop for everyone to experience Apple’s incredible products, in addition to a diverse and vibrant programme of events. It is a place for people to meet and collaborate, and most of all, it will be an exciting experience that goes beyond retail.” Save this picture! © Nigel Young Characteristic of the new Apple Flagships, the interior space is a 7.2-metre double-height grand hall – forming a 'town square' like space that is flexible and welcoming. The design enhances transparency from the street and floods the store with natural light, dramatically improving the visual connection between the two levels. The interior front facade, with its full height arches clad in Portland stone, can be appreciated in its full extent. The store also features the longest Luminous Ceiling Panels in the world that cover the entire ceiling. The custom-made lighting panels emit a pure, even, white light, and have the capability to absorb ambient noise. Save this picture! Section Using a warm palette of materials including stone, wood and terrazzo that is sympathetic to the historic nature of the building, the store has a calm setting, with the increased height allowing for the addition of twelve Ficus Ali trees on the ground level, bringing nature to the interior spaces. The grove of trees have planters – designed by Apple’s ID Studio and Foster + Partners – that double as a comfortable place to sit and rest. The signature Apple display tables are set against the backdrop of the new Avenue – the completely redesigned wall display that allows people to touch, feel and try out the Apple products and accessories in an engaging and hands-on way. Located in the middle of the space, The Forum is a new learning environment, where experts from various fields can come to entertain, inspire and teach. It occupies a prime position in the store with a vast video wall that acts as an animated backdrop for the entire store. Save this picture! © Nigel Young Along the side walls, a staircase on either side of the screen draws one up to the new mezzanine level set amongst the treetops. The walls and staircases are made from sandblasted stone, while the balustrade – seemingly carved in to the wall – has a smooth, curved, and honed finish that is pleasant to touch. The stone walls and balustrade were created by a combination of handcraftsmanship and CNC robotics, and were dry assembled at the manufacturing site to make sure each piece fit perfectly before installation. Save this picture! © Nigel Young Overlooking the grand hall, the mezzanine hosts the Apple’s Geniuses, where visitors can get assistance to setup their device or answers any product related queries, and the Boardroom – a place for meetings, conversations and partnerships that can be used by app developers, digital entrepreneurs and other small start-ups to become part of the Apple family. © Nigel Young © Nigel Young © Nigel Young © Nigel Young © Nigel Young © Nigel Young © Nigel Young © Nigel Young © Nigel Young Ground Floor Floor Plan Section Elevation The best of ArchDaily, directly to your inbox SUBSCRIBE You're subscribed!

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Competitions GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: iOS 10 Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / News / Mobile Phone News / The iPhone 8 could come with an even more radical design than we thought The iPhone 8 could come with an even more radical design than we thought by Joe Roberts 24 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments As powerful as the iPhone 7 is, there's no doubt the lack of any significant design changes came as a bit of a let-down for many fans of Apple handsets. The company has basicaly used the same design for the last three years, with minimal upgrades appearing on the latest model, the removal of the headphone jack notwithstanding. And for some time, rumours of a big redesign for the iPhone 8 have been doing the rounds, with Apple expected to introduce a new, full-face OLED screen on its upcoming phone. Related: iPhone 8 – Everything we know But it seems that the company could have some even more radical plans for the upcoming iPhone's design, according to tech blogger and Entrepreneur in Residence at UploadVR Robert Scoble. Scoble took to Facebook to reveal what he says are the actual plans for the next iPhone, which will apparently take the form of a clear piece of Gorilla Glass with "other polycarbonates for being pretty shatter resistant if dropped". Patents have already pointed to Apple introducing a new screen that incorporates fingerprint scanners and light sensors below the display panel itself, but this rumour from Scoble goes a step further, claiming the entire phone will be made of glass, with an OLED screen that can disappear, making the phone transparent. According to the blogger, 'several sources' have confirmed the claims, with other rumoured changes involving an eye sensor-equipped headset, into which you put the phone. Why? Well, this will apparently enable the next iPhone to act in a similar way to Microsoft's upcoming HoloLens by projecting virtual elements onto the real world for an augmented reality experience. Related: iPhone 7 vs Google Pixel It goes without saying that absolutely none of this has been confirmed in any capacity, so take the claims with a pinch of salt. And while the claims seem somewhat outlandish, it could be that Apple is working on a phone that doubles as an AR headset which might not necessarily be the iPhone 8. Scoble continues the revelations by adding that the AR-ready handset will function thanks to a "next-generation 3D sensor from Primesense", a company which Apple now owns. The iPhone 7 design remained largely unchanged from the iPhone 6S's design The result will be "a higher apparent frame rate and polygon count than a PC with a Nvidia 1080 card in it". And what about the battery, and all the other hardware that a phone needs to actually work? It's going to be packed into the edges of the smartphone, according to Scoble, which seems beyond the current capabilities of smartphone manufacturers. As such, we're inclined to say the iPhone 8 probably won't be the AR powerhouse this latest report suggests. But transparent screens are definitely now a thing, with Panasonic recently unveiling a new prototype TV that allows the screen to become completely see-through when turned off, effectively turning it into a window. And then there's this see-through prototype phone from 2013. Whatever the case may be, Apple will almost certainly shake things up with the iPhone 8, with all signs pointing to at least an edge-to-edge screen. We can't help but hope the augmented reality version of the iPhone arrives pretty soon though. It sounds incredibly cool, and will be a welcome change at a time when innovation in smartphones is virtually non-existent.

Photo: Getty Images More On: apple These tech innovations are shaking up the beauty world Real-time crime app pulled by Apple amid safety concerns Apple gets patent for foldable iPhone The dystopian future full of self-driving cars is still years away Happy 15th birthday, iPod! The portable music player unveiled by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs on Oct. 23, 2001, changed everything — the way people listened to and bought music and even how they thought of the Cupertino, Calif., company. It’s hard to imagine today, but the first-generation iPod featured just a 5GB hard drive — enough to hold 1,000 songs — and a physical scroll wheel. It cost $399. It was also an instant hit. In less than two years, Apple sold its millionth iPod. Roughly one year later, sales hit 10 million units. In January 2007, Apple reported sales in its first fiscal quarter of $7.1 billion — and 48 percent of revenue came from the iPod. It would never be as important a gadget for Apple again. In April 2007, total Apple iPod sales hit 100 million. Finally, in September 2009, while the gadget had been in decline for years, the company said total sales passed 220 million units. With the iPhone having long taken the place of the iPod as Apple’s profit engine, the company announced in January that it would stop reporting iPod sales. While you can still buy an iPod, the gadget lost its prominent screen-top click-through bug years ago. The iPod Touch, the top-of-the-line model now in its sixth generation, is available in sizes up to 128GB — more than 25 times the storage of the original. Its price: $379, twenty bucks cheaper than the original. Apple also sells an iPod Nano and iPod shuffle. Apple’s iTunes music software, introduced with the iPod, however, is still going strong — although music lovers more often stream their songs instead of downloading them.

Analysts KGI say the event at Apple's Cupertino HQ on Thursday will see the launch of three new machines -  a new 13 inch MacBook, a new 13 inch MacBook Pro and a new 15 inch MacBook Pro. Scroll down for video The event will take place at Apple's Cupertino HQ on October 27th, and is expected to see a range of new Macbook machines with a new 'smartkey' screen above the normal keyboard. WHAT DO WE KNOW?  KGI says Apple will debut a 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro, alongside a 13inch MacBook. Previous reports say Apple is also eliminating the USB and its Megsafe connector, and replacing them with USB-C support and Thunderbolt 3. The MacBook Pro could also have an OLED touch bar, which replaces the strip of function keys and let users create their own custom keys for each app. Apple's dramatically overhauled MacBook Pro will feature a new 'thinner and lighter' design. KGI published a report on Saturday outlining their predictions for Apple’s Mac roadmap ahead of the media event on October 27th. It also claims that new iMacs and a rumoured new 5K cinema displays won't form part of the announcement, according to 9to5mac. It also doesn't mention the Mac Pro, Apple's tubular design, or its Mac Mini.  Russian trademark filings also seem to reveal that Apple is readying the release of three new Macs running macOS Sierra, it said. The products have apparently passed the Russian registration, labelled as ‘portable personal computer models’ with model identifiers A1706, A1707 and A1708.  A previous report suggests the Cupertino company is set to eliminate the traditional USB and Megsafe ports in its next-gen MacBook Pro – and kill the 11-inch MacBook altogether.  The previous claims come from Macotakara, a Japanese publisher, which was one of the first sources to predict the death of the iPhone’s headphone jack.

Share this article Share 85 shares ‘According to information from a reliable Chinese supplier, Apple is planning to announce the new MacBook Pro within this month and will begin shipping out to retailers in October,’ reads the blog post. ‘There has also been rumors that they are going to cancel MacBook Air of the 11-inch model to focus on the 13-inch ones’. If the report is true, the new machines are expected to use metal injection molded hinges, have USB-C support and Thunderbolt 3. The USB Type-C plug is reversible so users will no longer have to stab blindly at USB ports in order to connect and charge gadgets, because plugs will fit in sockets in either direction.  A new report suggests Apple is set to remove the traditional USB and Megsafe ports in its next-gen MacBook Pro, and replacing them with USB-C support and Thunderbolt 3. Pictured is the MacBook Pro line Apple released in 2015 It is also designed to be used in thinner and sleeker products like tablets and ultrabooks, and is being called ‘the only connector one will need across all devices,’ according to the USB 3.0 Promoter Group. However, this means users would have to charge their device through the USB-C port and connect peripherals through the Thunderbolt 3, reports Steve Dent with Engadget. possible oled touchpad for the function buttons in next macbook, as well as hella USB-C ports pic.twitter.com/MD4oCtIOSU— Sam Sheffer (@samsheffer) June 2, 2016 In the end, users will be forced to purchase their own USB 3.0 adapter.  It is also rumored that the MacBook Pro will have an OLED touch bar that replaces the strip of function keys and let users create their own custom keys for each app. This rumor came from a reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo at KGI Securities earlier this year. Macotakara , a Japanese publisher, also reveals Apple is killing off the 11-in MacBook altogether. However, the firm will reveal a 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro at an event planned for some time this month. Pictured are MacBook Pros Apple released in 2015 Kuo says Apple plans to introduce a dramatically overhauled MacBook Pro with a new 'thinner and lighter' design. It is expected to look similar to the slick and minimalist MacBook. APPLE’S PATENT REPLACES KEYBOARD WITH TOUCH SCREEN  A patent filed by Apple earlier this year shows a laptop similar to a MacBook that features a flat touch surface where a keyboard would normally be. The invention, dubbed a 'configurable, force-sensitive input structure for an electronic device,' looks similar to its 'Force Touch' trackpads. These trackpads use haptic technology which senses movement from a user's fingers on the surface. MacBook Pro might have an OLED touch bar that replaces the strip of function keys. A patent filed by Apple this year (pictured) shows a laptop similar to a MacBook that features a flat touch surface where a keyboard would normally be located 'The trackpad features built-in force sensors that allow you to click anywhere and haptic feedback that provides a responsive and uniform feel,' Apple says. A tiny motor then vibrates to give the user feedback on what they are touching. The patent suggests similar technology laptop keyboard, a number pad, or a track pad. It claims 'micro-perforations' in the casing could light up to give the user an outline to where keys are on the flat keyboard. And the position of the haptic keys could also be customized.  The device will also include Touch ID support and a new OLED display touch bar above the keyboard. Kuo's report explains that the MacBook Pro updates are the 'brightest spot for Apple's 2016 rollouts' and was the first to mention 13-inch and 15-inch models.    Read more: Apple may ditch traditional USB ports on the MacBook Pro 次期MacBook Pro、10月末に出荷開始？ | Rumor | Macお宝鑑定団 blog（羅針盤） Apple plans to launch new Macs at an October 27 event - Recode KGI: Apple to release new 13-inch MacBook plus two MacBook Pros at next week’s event, new iMac & 5K Display coming next year | 9to5Mac Share or comment on this article e-mail 85 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Moment of impact as earthquake rattles home in Wellington Got any oink-tment?: Excited piglets take a warm bath SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Obama and Trump sit down to discuss the transfer of power James Corden sings for the 2016 Sainsbury's Christmas advert Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes?

AP FILE PHOTO Giants rookie Eli Apple (AP File Photo) In an article posted on SI.com on Sunday, Annie Apple provided disturbing and emotionally raw details of an abusive relationship with Eli Apple’s biological father that ended before Eli was born. “The comments made by John Mara, owner of the New York Giants, were insensitive, dismissive and callous,” Apple wrote. “How are you a so-called champion of domestic violence but lack basic compassion for a victim? Yes, this man signs my son’s checks as I’ve been reminded on Twitter. Mr. Mara owns the New York Giants. He doesn’t own Annie Apple. Wrong is wrong. And Mr. Mara’s comments were unapologetically wrong and hit at a raw place.” Annie Apple, who has a large social media following, is a regular contributor to Sports Illustrated and ESPN. In her latest piece, she was referring to Mara’s statement in his Thursday radio interview on WFAN during which the Giants’ co-owner and team president acknowledged the team had been aware Brown was abusive and still decided to re-sign the kicker to a two-year, $4 million contract. “He admitted to us he’d abused his wife in the past,” Mara said of Brown, whom the team did not bring to London for its eventual 17-10 victory over the Rams on Sunday. “What’s a little unclear is the extent of that.” Brown has since been placed by the NFL on the commissioner’s exempt list, which is essentially paid leave as he does not count against the Giants’ 53-man roster. The Giants have signed Robbie Gould to take over the kicking duties and it is likely Brown will not kick for them again. Of course, Annie Apple’s opinions about Mara and the franchise’s handling of the situation could put Eli Apple in a precarious position. The first-round draft pick from Ohio State returned to the lineup Sunday against the Rams after missing the previous game with a groin injury. “I know she’s very vocal about that type of situation and that topic is very important to her, so I can understand where she’s coming from,” Eli Apple told reporters after the game in London, according to Newsday. “In the same time I know that in my position I just have to do my part, just play football and do what I can do.”   NorthJersey.com : Sports NorthJersey.com : Sports October 24, 2016, 12:06 PM Last updated: Monday, October 24, 2016, 12:26 PM Giants rookie Eli Apple's mother criticizes John Mara for Josh Brown situation Buy this photo AP FILE PHOTO Giants rookie Eli Apple (AP File Photo) By ART STAPLETON STAFF WRITER |  The Record Annie Apple, the mother of Giants rookie cornerback Eli Apple, criticized the team and co-owner John Mara over their role regarding the status of kicker Josh Brown, who admitted to physically and verbally abusing his former wife, Molly.

Android Pay expands its reach via new partnerships with Visa and MasterCard Posted Oct 24, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Ecobee kicks off a new voluntary energy study to help fight climate change Google announced this morning two strategic partnerships with Visa and MasterCard aimed at expanding the reach of its mobile payments service, Android Pay. The company says that Android Pay users who are shopping online from their smartphones will soon be able to make payments on hundreds of thousands of new sites where either Visa Checkout or Masterpass are accepted at checkout. Visa Checkout and Masterpass are Visa and MasterCard’s own attempts at carving out their own space in online payments, as a competitor to services like PayPal and Apple Pay, for example, the latter of which arrived in Apple’s Safari browser, on both desktop and mobile, this September. Google, on the other hand, is touting how its payments service, Android Pay, is designed to work with existing solutions to improve online checkout across the mobile web. It notes that those merchants who have already enabled either Visa Checkout or Masterpass won’t have to make any changes on their end when the Android Pay support goes live, as their buttons will update automatically. To use Android Pay on sites that offers Masterpass or Visa Checkout, consumers will first have to link their accounts to the respective services in the Android Pay application. Once set up, you can use Android Pay at checkout along with your preferred authentication method, like fingerprint recognition. The end goal, similar to Apple Pay, is to make it easier to complete the checkout process when shopping online from a mobile device. You won’t have to enter a username and password, which can be a hassle. The result, in many cases, is fewer abandoned shopping carts and higher conversions on merchants’ sites. This is Apple Pay’s promise, as well; and PayPal itself has been working to make online checkout more seamless through its OneTouch solution, which saves your credentials across sites and apps so you don’t have to keep logging in. Google isn’t the only one making nice with Visa and MasterCard, as of late. Earlier this year, both companies also expanded their relationships with PayPal, in an effort by PayPal to make its service a more visible option when shopping in-store at brick-and-mortar retail locations. The move was meant to help PayPal gain traction among increasing competition from rival mobile payment solutions, including Apple Pay, not to mention the growing number of stores offering their own digital wallets, including Starbucks, Wal-Mart, CVS, Kohl’s and others. The Android Pay app will be updated with Visa Checkout and Masterpass integrations in early 2017, Google says. The rollout will begin in the U.S., with plans to expand everywhere Android Pay is available (the UK, Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong). 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Android Pay Description Android Play is a mobile payments service for online shoppers.

Revolutionary device turns 15-years-old - but the firm forgets to celebrate The first generation iPod was released in October 2001 Apple no longer advertises the iPod although it is still available to buy The decision not to celebrate may have been a conscious effort not to promote a device no longer listed  By Shivali Best For Mailonline Published: 12:03 EST, 24 October 2016 | Updated: 13:08 EST, 24 October 2016 e-mail 63 shares 23 View comments In October 2001, Steve Jobs unveiled a revolutionary Apple product that would change the way people listened to and downloaded music – the iPod. While the classic iPod design was put to rest in 2015, it is still a vital part of history, for both Apple and the wider technology industry. But despite its importance in Apple's history, it appears that the firm forgot to celebrate the iPod's birthday entirely. Scroll down for video  Despite its importance in Apple's history, it appears that the firm forgot to celebrate the iPods birthday entirely. Pictured left is the first generation iPod, which was released in 2001, and pictured right is the final sixth generation device which came out in 2015 A TIMELINE OF THE IPOD 2001 - first generation iPod is released, featuring a physically rotating scroll wheel  2003 - third generation iPod moves the media controls to touch-sensitive buttons on top of the scroll wheel 2004 - iPod mini is released in a variety of fun colours 2005 - iPod shuffle is the first iPod to use flash memory, and also looked like a flash drive, complete with removable USB cap The first iPod Nano is also released, measuring 0.3 inches (0.76 cm) thick 2007 - the first iPod touch is released 2012 - iPod Nano Touch is released 2015 - iPod Touch sixth generation is the last iPod device released by the firm  The first generation iPod came out on October 23 2001, at a price of $399 (£330). Its memory capacity was just 5GB – which is tiny compared to the 160GB version now on the market. Following on from then, the iPod evolved with the introduction of the colourful iPod Minis, sleek iPod Nanos, and tiny iPod shuffles.  But when the first iPhone was released in 2007, the iPod began to take more of a backseat.  While the International Business Times declared October 23 'National iPod Day', Apple did not appear to celebrate at all. There was no tweet, press release, or even post on Apple's website. Apple does still make the iPod touch, nano and shuffle, but these products are no longer listed on the firm's website.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Does the iPhone have a ONE-HANDED keyboard?

User Ronny Welter tweeted: 'No Apple didn't forget about the iPod's 15th birthday.  'They simply chose they didn't want to promote a device they're silently phasing out.' Through the years, the iPod quickly evolved, but  when the first iPhone was released in 2007, the iPod began to take more of a backseat.

Sometimes single-purpose retro tech is all you need. I recently bought a space gray iPod nano. It wasn't even on display here at the local Apple Store in Los Angeles; I had to ask an employee to retrieve one from the back; he responded with a raised eyebrow. I was going to explain that I'd finally given up my car, am now taking mass transit, and just want a device to listen to music on. I could have told him I'd owned a couple of iPod models between 2001 and 2012 and found them to be pretty decent music players. Instead, I just reiterated my request. "I'd like an iPod nano, please." He asked if I would instead be interested in the vast array of shiny, newer, and much more expensive Apple gadgets on display. But I didn't want an iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or even an iPod touch. I shook my head, and he still looked baffled. I finally said streaming music on my current smartphone (a Galaxy Note 5) drains the battery and I have 2,000-plus tracks locked to an old iTunes account. He nodded, realized this would be a swift sale, and disappeared to dig one out. I sat down to wait and eavesdrop on the various Genius Bar tutorials. When the iPod nano arrived, I was shocked at how, well, nano it is. It's two-thirds the dimensions of a driver's license and doesn't weigh much more than a box of matches. I had a nice pang of nostalgia at the classic user interface while unboxing, though there's really not much to unbox. Oh dear. Not so fast. One thing I'd forgotten about Apple is it likes to keep you locked into the ecosystem. The iPod nano requires connecting to a compatible device to sync with the iTunes platform; it won't do so remotely over Wi-Fi. Apple doesn't even provide a wall socket charger in the small hard plastic case, just a USB connector, headphones, and a paper-based set-up guide. Luckily, I have a graveyard tech drawer at home. I rummaged around and found an old iPod charger, but I wasn't sure my abandoned Mac laptop could cope with a sync. Last year, I quit my MacBook Air for a Samsung Chromebook—a bold decision I'm still happy with. But the iPod couldn't talk to the Chromebook, so I pulled out the old Mac laptop. A bit of fiddling and a (labored) upgrade to macOS Sierra and iTunes 12 later, and I was in business. Before connecting the iPod nano, I removed the sort of embarrassing tracks that were all the rage a decade ago, stripped out previous movies and TV episode purchases (the screen is too small and my nano only has 16GB of space, after all), and subscribed to my favorite podcast: BBC Radio 5's Kermode and Mayo's Film Review. I did the sync and it worked beautifully. On LA's Metro Expo Line, halfway between downtown Los Angeles and Santa Monica, I went down memory lane with my old playlists. I remembered that 2009 layover in Lisbon airport, with my feet up on the wheelie Samsonite, sourcing tracks to keep me company on the journey back to the US. There was one I didn't remember, at first, called "BERLIN." It turned out to be the playlist I'd had on repeat during the six-hour train ride from The Netherlands to Germany. Border control guards stormed the train looking for undocumented immigrants as I was listening to Fade to Grey by Visage. It all came flooding back. I found long-forgotten mixtapes from friends, both to celebrate (birthdays, career successes, moving across the world) or commiserate (firings, heartbreak, and post-surgery). When I first flew to Beijing, I'd asked my colleagues to send me links so I could buy what was in the People's Republic of China "Top 20." They made me a playlist for the trip and sent it via file transfer. Co-workers abroad made me playlists before I went to meet them on business travel trips to Latin America and Seoul. //Related Articles The Evolution of the Apple iPod Nano These playlists are why I wanted an iPod nano; nothing more complex or advanced. I just wanted the music: chosen by me, or music given to me, by people who get me. I've tried various streaming services and I'm not a big fan of the algorithm as DJ in its current state of play. Is there anything I don't like about the iPod nano? Yes. There's no search function or back button. The start screen isn't customizable, so I can't remove the icons I don't want, like fitness, live radio, and photos. Plus, I really hate Apple's Earpods, though that's easy enough to fix. Still, considering the nano cost less than $150, I feel churlish complaining. I just wanted something to play music on, and that's exactly—no more, no less—what it does. I swipe my Metro "Tap" card, put my phone on silent, select a playlist, and slip into aural bliss. Sometimes single-purpose retro tech is all you need.

Internet is becoming unreadable because of a trend towards lighter, thinner fonts The Telegraph 10/24/2016 By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor © Press Association File photo of an elderly gentleman surfing the internet. The internet is becoming unreadable because of a trend towards lighter and thinner fonts, making it difficult for the elderly or visually-impaired to see words clearly, a web expert has found. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 105.71 -2.72 -2.51% Where text used to be bold and dark, which contrasted well with predominantly white backgrounds, now many websites are switching to light greys or blues for their type. Award winning blogger Kevin Marks, founder of Microformats and former vice president of web services at BT, decided to look into the trend after becoming concerned that his eyesight was failing because he was increasingly struggling to read on screen text. He found a ‘widespread movement’ to reduce the contrast between the words and the background, with tech giants Apple, Google and Twitter all altering their typography. True black on white text has a contrast ratio of 21:1 - the maximum which can be achieved. Most technology companies agree that it is good practice for type to be a minimum of 7:1 so that the visually-impaired can still see text. But Mr Marks, found that even Apple’s own typography guidelines, which recommended 7:1 are written in a contrast ratio of 5.5:1. Google’s guidelines also suggest a 7:1 contrast ratio, but 54 per cent opacity of display, which brings the ratio down to 4.6:1. Mr Marks, who has been named one of the Telegraph’s 50 must influential Britons in technology,  said the changes risk undermining the universal reach of the internet. “The typography choices of companies like Apple and Google set the default design of the web, and these two drivers of design are already dancing on the boundaries of legibility,” he warned on the technology site Backchannel . “If the web is relayed through text that’s difficult to read, it curtails the open access by excluding large swaths of people such as the elderly, the visually impaired, or those retrieving websites through low quality screens. “As we rely on computers not only to retrieve information but also to access and build services that are crucial to our lives, making sure that everyone can see what’s happening becomes increasingly important.” The changes in typography have come about because, as web design evolved, the numbers of fonts, colours and background began to diverge from the original set of ‘web safe’ fonts which were deemed legible online. The rise in LCD technology and high definition screens has also allowed designers to use increasingly thinner fonts, which, while working on desktops, can be virtually impossible to read on smartphones or tablets. In recent years, reference guides such as the Typography Handbook have also steered designers away from too much contrast, claiming that traditional black on white typography strains the eyes, and made it difficult for people with dyslexia.   And many computers are now set to grow dimmer during the evening to avoid too much blue light after dark, which can keep people awake. But the US based Web Accessibility Initiative, which came up with the original ratio formula in 2008 to help web designers said too little contrast made web pages ‘confusing and frustrating’. “Choosing colours with poor contrast makes navigating, reading and interacting a real pain,” said a spokesman. “Good design means sufficient contrast between foreground and background colours. If it’s important enough to be clear. This is essential for people with low contrast sensitivity which becomes more common as we age.” But Mr Marks said that reducing the contrast risked alienating some users. “To arbitrarily throw away contrast based on a fashion that looks good on my perfect screen in my perfectly lit office is abdicating designer’s responsibilities to the very people for whom they are designing,” he said. “My plea to designers and software engineers: Ignore the fads and go back to the typographic principles of print. “You’ll be making things better for people who read on smaller, dimmer screens, even if their eyes aren’t aging like mine. It may not be trendy, but it’s time to consider who is being left out by the web’s aesthetic.” Dr Simon Harper, an experimental Computer Scientist in Human Computer Interaction and Information Systems at the University of Manchester, said: "Black text on a white background may convey a certain harshness, grey text, on the other hand, may convey a softer more friendly feeling. "But for some, these design choices come at the cost of legibility, fatigue and comprehension. We call this a situational impairment, whereby the user is disabled by the device, design, environment, or context of use. "Straining to see text will give many a disabling experience. In the new world of cutting edge digital design all of us will at some point become impaired. "Making sure that controls are present to conform the design to the user, so that the user doesn't always have to conform themselves to the design - sometimes and impossible requirement, is the only viable option."

Apple sends out invites to 27 October event likely for new MacBook Pro 9to5Mac also cites usually reliable leaksters KGI as saying Apple would unveil three new MacBooks on stage in Cupertino. The filings don't give away details of specifications or features of the laptops, but merely confirms their existence. It's likely that all three models will be made available for pre-order the same day they're announced. Both the Russian filings and KGI's report say there won't be any new iMacs or a 5K external display unveiled at Apple's event, but they may be announced sometime in 2017. The MacBook Pro will finally get an update and usher in a number of major updates, including improved internal components, a Touch ID fingerprint scanner and an OLED shortcut bar in place of the quick action function keys on MacBooks at the moment. They should arrive in 13-inch and 15-inch variants and have USB Type-C ports and Thunderbolt 3 but there's a possibility Apple will kill the headphone jack, like it did with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apple to continue headphone jack killing spree with MacBook Pro?

 Apple Watch sales are in freefall Kif Leswing Oct. 24, 2016, 9:58 AM 16,146 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple Apple shipped 1.1 million Apple Watches in the third quarter of 2016, which is down 71.6% from the year-ago period, according to an estimate from IDC. Last year, during the third quarter, Apple shipped 3.9 million Apple Watches. That's a bigger drop than in the second quarter of this year, in which shipments were down 56.7% on an annual basis.  This trend towards lower sales is obviously a bad sign for Apple's smartwatch, but it is worth noting that Apple did not ship a new version of the device with GPS until September, towards the end of the quarter.  The well-telegraphed launch of Apple Watch Series 2 in September could have muted sales as customers waited for the new model.  Apple also redesigned the device's software and gave the original model a price cut to $269, which should help holiday sales. "With lower price points and improved experiences, Apple could be heading for a sequential rebound in 4Q16," write the IDC researchers. Apple likes to compare the Apple Watch to the iPod, and suggests that the device should see strong seasonal sales as it makes for a good holiday gift. But Apple has never reported its own internal sales numbers, leaving shipment estimates like the IDC tracker as the best guide.  It's important to note that Apple still has the best-selling smartwatch worldwide, beating the likes of Garmin, Samsung, and Lenovo. And Google's own smartwatch project seems to be stuck in neutral.  But 71% drops in year-over-year sales is not good for any product no matter which way you slice it, especially for a new product without a clearly established market.

T3 The Gadget Website Search News Reviews Mobile Entertainment Wearables More Living Auto Magazine More Tech in depth Best deals iPhone 6S Pixel C OS X tips iPad Pro New Chromecast Get fit News The sporty Apple Watch Nike+ is going to be available VERY soon The sporty Apple Watch Nike+ is going to be available VERY soon By Dan Grabham   Special edition Apple Watch Series 2 on shelves this weekend Shares Apple Watch Series 2 is here (read our Apple Watch Series 2 review) but we've been waiting for the Nike+ Edition. But wait no more dear reader, for it will be available from this Friday 28 October. Apple Watch Nike+ is a special version of the Apple Watch Series 2 specifically intended for runners. There's a silicon band and, like the Hermes Edition, special watch faces with easy access to the new Nike+ Run Club app Apple Watch Nike+ will be available in two different aluminium case sizes, 38 mm and 42 mm and pairs with four exclusive Nike Sport Band colour combinations including Black/Volt, Black/Cool Grey, Flat Silver/White and Flat Silver/Volt. Apple Watch Nike+ will be available in 38 mm at £369 and in 42 mm at £399 from all the usual retailers. Apple Watch Nike+ also includes exclusive Siri commands and deep integration with the new Nike+ Run Club app which is designed to give you the motivation to go for a run. There are also coaching plans that adapt to your schedule and progress, and guidance from coaches and athletes. Naturally all versions of Apple Watch Series 2 have watchOS 3 - check out our guide to all the new watchOS 3 features. Apple Watch Series 2's biggest boon is that it has GPS for fitness tracking plus a new new brighter display and 50m of splashy water resistance. This is a game-changer (for us) as we hate taking ours off in the shower. Apple has included the GPS chip so you can run without your iPhone should you wish to. Apple Watch Series 2 records distance, pace and speed for workouts such as walking, running or cycling. You're able to record runs and then send a map to your iPhone. The demo had slow and fast colors to indicate your speed. For swimmers, Apple developed all-new algorithms after hundreds of hours of research for two new workout options, pool and open water. A new CPU has also been added, which delivers up to two-times-greater graphics performance. The second-generation display boasts 1000nits of brightness so it can be more easily read in in direct sunlight.

During the event, developer Niantic Labs says players will see “increased global encounters” for some of the games “spookiest” characters, including: Drowzee, Gastly, Gengar, Golbat, Haunter, Hypno, and, yes, Zubat. In addition, users will get increased in-game candy for each Pokémon caught: During this period, every Pokémon caught will earn Trainers six Candies—twice the normal amount. The professor will also give Trainers two Candies instead of one for every Pokémon transferred to him. In addition, Buddy Pokémon will award four candies instead of the usual one. Pokémon Candies enable Trainers to evolve or strengthen their Pokémon, so players will want to walk and catch all the Pokémon they can to get their fill of Candy during this special event. The Pokemon Go craze first kicked off on iOS with an initial release in the US and select markets back in July. The game later rolled out to the UK, Canada and much of the rest of the world, and the company is expected to release a much anticipated Apple Watch app by the end of the year. Developer Niantic Labs was invited on stage by Apple at its iPhone 7 event in September to demo the upcoming Apple Watch app, and it also revealed the iPhone app had been downloaded over 500 million times. You can download Pokemon Go for free on the App Store, which also gets an update to Version 1.13.3 today: What’s New in Version 1.13.3 – Professor Willow discovered that Eggs have different patterns depending on the distance required to hatch them. – Pokémon type icons have been added to the information screen for each Pokémon. – Low battery indicator added for the Pokémon GO Plus. – Minor text fixes POKÉMON GO CELEBRATES HALLOWEEN WITH GLOBAL IN-GAME EVENT Increased Encounters of Spooky Pokémon and Candy Bonuses Await Trainers in the First-Ever In-Game Event for the Popular Mobile Title Bellevue, WA, and San Francisco, CA—October 24, 2016—This Halloween, players of the popular Pokémon GO mobile game will experience exciting treats from Niantic Labs, Inc. and The Pokémon Company International. Beginning Wednesday, October 26, through Tuesday, November 1, Pokémon GO Trainers will have the chance to catch some of the spookiest Pokémon available in the game with increased global encounters of Drowzee,Gastly, Gengar, Golbat, Haunter, Hypno, and, yes, Zubat. And, since it wouldn’t be Halloween without candy, Trainers will have the opportunity to earn more Pokémon Candy during this event as they explore the world around them in search of Pokémon. “It’s been incredible watching people explore their neighborhoods and catch wild Pokémon all summer,” said Tatsuo Nomura, senior product manager at Niantic, Inc. “We would like to trick-or-treat in our own special way by giving Trainers the chance to catch more Pokémon and earn extra Candy this Halloween.” During this period, every Pokémon caught will earn Trainers six Candies—twice the normal amount. The professor will also give Trainers two Candies instead of one for every Pokémon transferred to him. In addition, Buddy Pokémon will award four candies instead of the usual one. Pokémon Candies enable Trainers to evolve or strengthen their Pokémon, so players will want to walk and catch all the Pokémon they can to get their fill of Candy during this special event. “The excitement of Pokémon’s 20-year celebration continues this Halloween with the first-ever in-game Pokémon GO event,” said J.C. Smith, senior director of consumer marketing at The Pokémon Company International. “We anticipate seeing many Pokémon-themed costumes during this anniversary year, and now Trainers can add Pokémon GO to their trick-or-treat route to receive Candy and add some of the spookier Pokémon to their Pokédex.” To learn even more details about the Pokémon GO in-game Halloween event, visit the official Niantic blog at PokemonGOlive.com.  blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

The problem may be that your Contacts aren’t properly syncing, and Mac Geek Gab listener Bill wrote in (MGG 626) with the skinny on resetting it. The Issue The problem is that your Apple Watch is displaying phone numbers for some or all your incoming calls, even when the people calling you are in your Contacts. Alternately, you may find that Siri on your Apple Watch is unable to do something like, “Call Dave Hamilton,” even though Dave is in your contacts. The Solution To fix this, try resetting your Sync Data in the Watch app on your iPhone. It’s easy enough, but the last step isn’t entirely intuitive. Start by going to iPhone > Apple Watch > General > Reset > Reset Sync Settings. the following screenshots were taken in iOS 10. Main Screen of Watch App on iPhone On the screen above, tap General, and then scroll to the bottom and look for “Reset.'” General Settings Screen for Watch App on iPhone That will take you a screen with three options. The bottom one is “Reset Sync Data,” as shown below. Reset Screen in Watch App for iPhone When you tap “Reset Sync Data,” the button will flash. And that’s it. You get no additional feedback letting you know the data is being reset, but that’s what’s happening. You’re done, and your Contacts should be properly synced in just a few minutes. I’d call this an interface fail, for what it’s worth. It seems to me you should get a pop-up sheet that asks if you’re sure you want to reset data syncing, with an explanation that accepting means it’s happening. That’s it! Thanks to Bill for writing in to Dave Hamilton and John F. Braun with the tip. About MGG Answers: Each week Dave Hamilton and John F.

Picture: Spencer Platt New York - It's not exactly a store, but the Google “showroom” that opened on Thursday in New York is the internet giant's first real-world shop and a step onto terrain where rival Apple has excelled. The success of the temporary storefront Google opened in the trendy Soho neighbourhood could help the California-based company decide whether to follow Apple's lead and operate its own brick-and-mortar retail operation. The New York pop-up shop will be open through the end of this year, and let people get their hands on new Google devices such as Pixel smartphones which began shipping on Thursday in a direct challenge to Apple's latest iPhones. “This is not even a testing ground, just an extension of the launch,” Google spokeswoman Chrissy Persico said at the showroom opening event. “We want people to come in and experience the products.” Google early this month took on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into hardware, launching the in-house designed Pixel smartphone and a slew of other devices showcasing artificial intelligence prowess. By producing both the phone hardware and its Android software, Google is making a more direct assault on Apple and its tightly controlled ecosystem. The pop-up shop also displayed Google's freshly unveiled Daydream View virtual reality headset, a modular wi-fi system, and a Home virtual assistant that will challenge the Amazon Echo device. Nothing is sold at the Google shop, but the staff directs potential customers to the company's online store or telephone operators who can take orders for products. ‘Big battle’ A wall in the shop is decorated with an artful arrangement of blue, red, yellow and green blocks, arranged to display the internet company's trademark colours. Only 30 or so visitors ventured into the pop-up store for its opening morning, a lean showing in comparison to mobs typically drawn to new Apple stores. Apple has a shop in Soho, too, and many more across the country and around the world. As differences on the hardware side of premium smartphones have faded, competitors have increasingly stressed “experiences” such as smoothly accessing content or services. “I am interested in technology, so I just hang out in stores,” Columbia University student Ravi Lakshmanan told AFP in the Google shop. “There is going to be a big battle of platforms and it's going to be interesting to watch.” Another visitor, Ike McLaughlin, said he has flip-flopped between the rivals but is on Google's side for now because he felt Apple was “playing it safe, when Google is taking risks and making a push in artificial intelligence”. McLaughlin's verdict echoes the concerns of analysts that Apple has not delivered a market-shaking new product since the death of visionary co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. But even if its market capitalisation has fallen below peaks hit in 2015, Apple remains the world's most valuable company based on its share price. For the financial year ending September 2015, Apple posted a net profit of $53 billion, double the figure posted in the last year of the reign of Steve Jobs.

From Apple’s description of the app: The Nike+ Run Club app is seamlessly integrated into Apple Watch Nike+ and offers daily motivation through smart run reminders, challenges from friends and even alerts informing when the weather is right to get outside. Training data, including pace, distance and heart rate are available at a glance, and through shared run summaries, the app promotes friendly competition, even allowing users to send fist bumps to each other, right from the wrist. “Apple and Nike share a passion to make life easier and more fun and we’re excited to bring a great running experience to consumers around the world,” said Trevor Edwards, president of the Nike Brand. “Apple Watch Nike+ with Nike+ Run Club app combine to deliver a powerful device with a simple running solution for all athletes and is another example of Nike’s commitment to bringing innovative products to the market.” As mentioned, the device has the same hardware features as the Apple Watch Series 2, including built-in GPS that tracks your pace, distance and route even if you don’t have iPhone on you, a brighter screen, swim tracking and water resistance up to 50 meters.

LivinArealWorld Well as of right now, Nike run app requires my iPhone to be with me in order to track my gps. Even though I have the AW2, It’s basically useless without the phone.

Photo Credit: Getty Images/ Kena Krutsinger advertisement | advertise on newsday HIGHLIGHTS Annie Apple wrote piece for SI.com Annie Apple details experience with Eli Apple’s biological father LONDON — Annie Apple, the mother of Giants rookie cornerback Eli Apple, took the team and its co-owner to task yesterday over their handling of accused domestic abuser Josh Brown. In an article for SI.com titled “Why I cannot stay silent after John Mara’s callous comments about domestic violence,” Apple detailed an abusive relationship with Eli Apple’s biological father that ended before Eli was born. “The comments made by John Mara, owner of the New York Giants, were insensitive, dismissive and callous,” she wrote. “How are you a so-called champion of domestic violence but lack basic compassion for a victim? Yes, this man signs my son’s checks as I’ve been reminded on Twitter. Mr. Mara owns the New York Giants. He doesn’t own Annie Apple. Wrong is wrong. And Mr. Mara’s comments were unapologetically wrong and hit at a raw place.” Latest Giants stories Glauber: Accorsi earned Ring of Honor with Eli trade Giants gameday: Big Blue seeks 4th in row CFL star Jones gets first NFL start for Giants Victor Cruz’s status a big question for Giants Emotional time for Giants’ Ring of Honor inductees She was referring in particular to Mara’s statement in a radio interview Thursday after newly released documents showed that Brown admitted to abusing his wife, Molly, over a period of years. In the interview, Mara said the Giants were aware that Brown was abusive before re-signing the kicker in the offseason. “He admitted to us he’d abused his wife in the past,” Mara said. “What’s a little unclear is the extent of that.” The article, coupled with a Twitter rant against Mara and the Giants earlier in the week, could make things awkward for the Giants’ first-round pick. GiantsAnnie Apple tweets about Mara’s comments Annie Apple has a large social media following and is a contributor to Sports Illustrated and ESPN, so there was always a danger of her commenting on something regarding the Giants or her son. Eli Apple seemed prepared for that. advertisement | advertise on newsday “I know she’s very vocal about that type of situation and that topic is very important to her, so I can understand where she’s coming from,” Eli Apple said yesterday. “In the same time, I know that in my position I just have to do my part, just play football and do what I can do.” Eli Apple said he had a sense this might happen when he saw his mother’s social media posts Thursday. Those posts included observations such as: “(R)eading these Mara comments makes me sad, angry and completely baffled” and “He just doesn’t get it. This is sad.” Said Eli Apple, “When I saw a couple of tweets, I was like, ‘OK.’ I saw a couple more and I was like, ‘OK, she might go on a rant.’ She’s her own person and she’ll do whatever she’s going to do.” Brown did not travel to London with the team. On Friday, he was placed on the commissioner’s exempt list while the NFL reopens its investigation. On Friday, coach Ben McAdoo said the Giants are “not going to turn our back on Josh.” GiantsGiants vs. Rams in London Annie Apple’s article detailed how she was abused with two young children and Eli on the way. Giants videos “After I found out I was pregnant, he decided he didn’t want another child anymore,” Apple wrote of Eli’s biological father. “He’d changed his mind. He insisted I have another abortion. I refused. I couldn’t go through that again. The physical violence escalated for random things and reasons. He told me he’d keep doing this until I got rid of the baby.” Annie Apple left him and six months later, she wrote, Eli was born. Those memories, she said, came flooding back as she read reports and listened to reaction this week. “Domestic violence isn’t an amusement park attraction or haunted ride you take at an amusement park,” she wrote. “Domestic violence is a real, living nightmare. Victims are judged for not leaving, but the abuser isn’t criminalized.” Brown was arrested in May 2015 for assault, but charges were swiftly dropped. “Usually by the time you hear of a domestic-violence victim, she’s either dead or barely alive; the rest of us survivors have lived in terror and millions of victims continue to live in terror,” Apple wrote. “Domestic violence is not about love; it’s about control. If you’re in a violent relationship, please get out and get help. It never gets better when you stay.” advertisement | advertise on newsday As for Eli Apple, he said he’s spoken to the Giants’ higher-ups about the situation. “I think we’re good on that front,” he said. “I talked to them and let them know that my mom, her reactions sometimes are like that. I just made sure I talked to everybody, just let them know.” He did not say if he had spoken directly to Mara. One person Eli Apple did say he has yet to speak to is his mother. “She’s a little upset at everybody right now,” he said. “I’m probably just going to give her her space a little bit.” Subscribe to Newsday’s sports newsletter Receive stories, photos and videos about your favorite New York teams plus national sports news and events. sign up    Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 24, 2016 9:41am   Comments Share: Related AAPL Negative Chinese Trade Rhetoric Comments Create Buying Opportunity In Apple Exclusive: Energous CEO Talks Dialog Semi Deal, Other Prospects Bloomberg: Apple contemplating smart glass move (Seeking Alpha) Drexel Hamilton’s Brian White expects Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) to report its sales and EPS ahead of the estimates, when the company reports its Q4 2016 results on Tuesday. White maintained a Buy rating on the company, with a price target of $185. The analyst continues to view Apple as a Top Pick for the rest of 2016, given that the company’s “sales, profit and iPhone cycle have bottomed, while valuation remains depressed and we expect the iPhone 7 cycle will return the iPhone franchise to growth.” Q4 Expectations For Q4, White expects the company to report iPhone units of 44.05 million, representing an 8 percent year-on-year decline but 9 percent quarter-on-quarter growth, benefiting from the rapid iPhone roll-out over 29 geographies in the first round and the earlier availability of the iPhone 7, as compared to the iPhone 6s. “Although we believe Apple will benefit from the iPhone 7 launch in China, we expect Greater China revenue to fall by 30-35 percent YoY in 4Q:FY16 and decline 18 percent in FY:16 given difficult comparisons after growing sales by 84 percent in FY:15,” the analyst stated. 2017 Expectations White also believes that the iPhone cycle bottomed out in Q2 2016 and that the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus could bring back unit growth in Q2 2017. “We anticipate iPhone unit growth to return in FY:17 and the we believe the iPhone 8 can drive another year of growth in FY:18,” the analyst added.

As for what we'll see, Apple will probably reveal long-awaited updates to its MacBook Pro. Recent rumors indicatethe upcoming laptop will ditch standard USB ports in favor of USB-C, among other things. The MacBook Pro and MacBook Air have gone a relatively long time without major updates, prompting some Mac fans to question whether Apple is planning to abandon its notebook line. In September, a concerned user reached out to CEO Tim Cook via email to ask if the Cupertino tech giant is "pulling away from the Mac line." Surprisingly, Cook responded, assuaging those concerns. "I love the Mac and we are very committed to it. Stay tuned," he wrote in the message, which was obtained by MacRumors. PCMag will be there, so stay tuned for all the details.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple's iPhone 7 was the top Smartphone in Taiwan for September in Market Share and Sales Value | Main | IDC Lists Apple as the Number One Smartwatch Vendor in the World for Q3 2016 » October 24, 2016 Samsung's Nightmare Continues as Apple's iPhone 7 was a Huge Hit in South Korea in its Opening Weekend   On Friday Patently Apple reported that Apple fans in South Korea enthusiastically Lined up to get their hands on the new 'Non Exploding' iPhone 7. So how did that translate into sales? According to a new South Korean report today, Friday alone rang in sales of more than 100,000 units of the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus combined with more than 300,000 units of iPhone 7 that were also pre-ordered. Selling well over 400,000 iPhone 7s in its first week is nothing shy of stunning.   Lee Byung-tae, a professor at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology's College of Business noted for the report that it is difficult to estimate how many Note7 owners have opted for the iPhone 7. But those that have switched are probably lost to Samsung once someone has switched away from Android.   Apple's CEO Tim Cook noted during Apple's financial conference call that "Overall, we added millions of first time smartphone buyers in the June quarter and switchers accounted for the highest percentage of quarterly iPhone sales we've ever measured. In absolute terms, our year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest than we've ever seen in any nine month period and our active installed base of iPhones is up strong double digits year over year." So there's no doubt that this trend will continue, especially because of the Samsung Note7 crisis.   Patently Apple reported on Saturday that Samsung had decided to offer their Note7 customers returning their recalled smartphones with a new Galaxy S8 when they debut in early 2017. The new S8 will offer many of the same features like an iris scanner and may continue to offer liquid cooling to ensure there are no fire outbreaks.   The timing of that announcement was at the exact time that the iPhone 7 was selling extremely well in its opening weekend in South Korea. It just goes to show you the level of fear that Samsung's executives are having over the rate of switchers to Apple's iPhone.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Skip to main content Home Topics Automotive Cloud Computing Design & Development E-Commerce ERP Economics Energy Global IoT Labor Operations Purchasing Quality Control Regulatory Software Supply Chain Technology Watch Manufacturing Minute Search Social Facebook Twitter Companies Learn Login Register Subscribe Channels MNET CHEM FM ID IMPO PP Advertisement Advertisement China's LeEco Sets Out To Shake Up U.S. Consumer Tech Market 3 weeks 4 days ago Comments by Michael Liedtke, AP Technology Writer SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Most U.S. consumers haven't heard of LeEco, but the Chinese technology company is setting out to become a household name with smartphones and flat-screen TVs that undercut the prices of Apple, Google, Samsung and other industry stalwarts. LeEco heralded its entrance into the U.S. market during a Wednesday showcase in San Francisco, where the company unveiled a sleek smartphone called the LePro 3 that will sell for $400 and an internet-connected TV with a 7-foot screen priced at $5,000. LeEco positions the LePro 3 as an alternative to Apple's latest iPhone and Google's Pixel phone, whose prices both start at $650. LeEco is promising its giant TV, called the UMax 85, will be as good or better than other high-end home entertainment systems that cost $8,000. Both the phone and TV will go on sale Nov. 2 in LeEco's online store, LeWeb.com. The company also is selling a smaller smartphone and smaller TVs with screens ranging from 43 inches to 65 inches. Besides the phones and TVs, LeEco also is coming to the U.S. with a virtual-reality headset, a high-tech bicycle and an electric car in a challenge to Tesla Motors. The company wants to bundle the devices with other services, including an online video package of shows and movies that ties into its origins as the "Netflix of China." LeEco, which stands for "Happy Ecosystem," is branching out to challenge technology leaders who have been able to demand a premium for their products partly because they have been pleasing U.S. consumers for years. "America is the most important global market for us," LeEco CEO Jia Yueting said through a translator during a presentation. "Once we get the hearts and minds of U.S. users, we can move on to the hearts and minds of global users." Innovation in the U.S. has hit a "bottleneck," making it an optimal time for LeEco to enter the market, Jia said in an interview with The Associated Press that was also translated. He envisions creating a platform that enables consumers to hopscotch from LeEco TVs to phones to cars to watch its video service and use other applications that that company plans to introduce. The company is using the devices as "Trojan horses," to deliver its digital services, said Gartner analyst Werner Goertz. "This is a general trend in the industry, and LeEco is a prime example of how companies are subsidizing hardware with ulterior motives." Google is similarly selling its new Pixel phone in an effort to drive more traffic to its search engine and other service, Goertz noted, though that device is being sold at a premium price. Amazon.com's Echo, an internet-connected speaker that understands and responds to spoken language, also is designed to get boost sales at the company's e-commerce site. The expectations for LeEco are modest. The research firm Strategy Analytics projects that LeEco will sell about 25 million smartphones worldwide this year. By comparison, Apple had sold 214 million iPhones in the past year ending in June. Other Chinese companies that tried to make a splash in the U.S. consumer electronics market have barely made a ripple. But LeEco is making a major commitment. During the summer, the company paid $2 billion for budget-TV maker Vizio, a well-known brand in the U.S. that sells in Costco and other prominent chains. It employs several hundred workers at its U.S. headquarters in San Jose, California, with ambitions to expand in Silicon Valley. Earlier this year, it spent another $250 million to snap up a 50-acre site in Santa Clara, California, where it has approval to build an office complex that could span up to 3 million square feet and accommodate about 12,000 workers. Jia plans to call the complex "EcoWorld." "They are not taking a half-baked approach," Goertz said. "But I think they are going to be hemorrhaging money for the foreseeable future. The question is how long they can sustain this strategy?" Jia, who has accumulated an estimated fortune of nearly $5 billion, will shoulder a huge chunk of any losses because he owns half of LeEco. He declined to say how much LeEco has spent in the U.S. so far. "We are financially prepared to bring a new model and a new value for the U.S. consumers," Jia said.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple announces “Hello again” media event for October 27th, expected to unveil next-gen MacBooks, other hardware Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Wednesday, October 19th, 2016, 15:02 Category: Hardware, iMac, Mac Pro, MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, News, Touch ID, USB-C Tweet Some new Apple hardware is coming your way. Apple just sent out the journalist invitations to a product unveiling at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino. The event will take place next Thursday, October 27, at 10 a.m. Pacific time. As usual, the invitation doesn’t specify what new hardware will be announced. Instead, it merely offers a “Hello again” tagline. The going rumor is on updated Macs, since nothing but the 12-inch MacBook has been updated this year. The big rumor points to a next-gen MacBook Pro notebook, which is expected to include a set of touch-sensitive OLED keys to replace the function row along the top of the keyboard, allowing those keys to change based on the application you’re using. The new notebook is expected to feature new ports, especially a conversion from USB-A ports to USB-C ports. This has been somewhat in the works for a while, as the current MacBook features a single USB-C port for charging and connectivity. As with any redesign, we expect Apple to go thinner and lighter. The trackpad will probably get bigger, and might include the lower-travel butterfly-mechanism keyboard found on the MacBook line. Apple has never included Touch ID in a Mac before, but now that Sierra supports Apple Pay on the Web, adding a Touch ID button could let you authorize payments without needing an iPhone or Apple Watch handy—as well as let you log in more securely, of course. Other rumors center around a MacBook Air refresh, although Apple did bump the base-model MacBook Air to 8GB of RAM this past April. The Mac mini got its most recent upgrade, to a Haswell processor, way back in October 2014. The long-neglected Mac Pro (last updated December 2013) might be headed for the history books, but Apple’s other desktop option, the iMac, has gone a full year without an update too. Apple has been rumored to be working on a 5K display with its own GPU to replace the discontinued Thunderbolt Display, as well as new iMacs.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Trademark filing points to MacBook OLED panel being named the “Magic Toolbar” Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Friday, October 21st, 2016, 05:11 Category: Hardware, Mac mini, Mac Pro, MacBook Pro, Patents, Rumor, Touch ID Tweet Sometimes it’s the patent filings that inform you about the next cool thing around the corner. With just a week before Apple’s October 27th media event, a newly discovered trademark filing has been unearthed online, suggesting a potential name for the OLED panel on the new MacBook Pro. According to information rounded up, a trademark filed by a company called “Presto Apps America LLC” for a device dubbed the “Magic Toolbar” could be Apple’s name for the touch bar panel on its new MacBook Pro line. The digging unearthed a company known as “Presto Apps”, which was incorporated on January 22nd of this year and a filing for the trademark on February 5th. The cost of the trademark application was furthermore estimated to be around €16,000. The trademark name falls in line with Apple’s other “Magic” products, including the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad. To top it all off, when investigating Presto Apps’ trademark applications in Canada, Indonesia, and Malaysia, it was discovered that the “Magic Toolbar” application was filed by the same lawyers who applied for the “AirPods” trademark. It was concluded that “either Presto Apps America is Apple and the Magic Toolbar is going to be part of the MacBook announced on 27 October or else it’s the strangest set of coincidences and unlikely events I’ve ever seen.” Rumors that began earlier in the year suggested that the OLED panel on the MacBook Pro will dynamically change for specific apps that are open on the computer, as well as integrate Touch ID into Apple’s MacBook line. Internally, Apple reportedly named the OLED panel the “Dynamic Function Row.” Refreshed versions of the MacBook Air, iMac, Mac Pro, and Mac mini are also believed to be part of the October 27th event. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

For the latest news, start at our WEEI.com home page or click here for the top stories from our news wire. MONDAY’S BROADCAST HIGHLIGHTS:Pro football NFL: Houston at Denver, 8:30 p.m. (ESPN) NHL: Calgary at Chicago, 8:30 p.m. (NHL) SUNDAY’S RESULTS: NFL: Patriots 27, Steelers 16 NFL: Cardinals 6, Seahawks 6 NFL: Buccaneers 34, 49ers 17 NFL: Giants 17, Rams 10 NFL: Eagles 21, Vikings 10 NFL: Dolphins 28, Bills 25 NFL: Bengals 31, Browns 17 NFL: Jets 24, Ravens 16 NFL: Chiefs 27, Saints 21 NFL: Colts 34, Titans 26 NFL: Lions 20, Redskins 17 NFL: Raiders 33, Jaguars 16 NFL: Chargers 33, Falcons 30 NHL: Oilers 3, Jets 0  NHL: Rangers 3, Coyotes 2  NHL: Islanders 6, Wild 3  NHL: Ducks 4, Canucks 2 AROUND THE WEB: Eli Apple — After the mother of Giants rookie corner Eli Apple criticized Giants co-owner John Mara on Twitter last week, Apple reacted to her posts on Sunday. “My mom’s very vocal and that topic is very important to her, so I can understand where she was coming from,” Apple said. “But at the same time in my position I just have to do my part and play football and do what I can do.” Annie Apple, a domestic violence survivor, criticized her son’s boss for his handling, or mishandling, of Giants kicker Josh Brown’s domestic violence against his wife. In an article for SI.com on Sunday, Annie Apple further expressed her disgust. “The comments made by John Mara, owner of the New York Giants, were insensitive, dismissive and callous,” she wrote. “How are you a so-called champion of domestic violence but lack basic compassion for a victim? Yes, this man signs my son’s checks as I’ve been reminded on Twitter. Mr. Mara owns the New York Giants. He doesn’t own Annie Apple. Wrong is wrong. And Mr. Mara’s comments were unapologetically wrong and hit at a raw place.” Apple stressed on Sunday he spoke with his employers and assured them he is committed to the team despite his mother’s anger. “I talked to them, let them know my mom, her reactions like that sometimes are like that, she’s her own person, she’s going to do that, so I’ve just got to do my job,” he said. “I just made sure I talked to everybody, man, just let them know, whoever is concerned.” Apple returned from a groin injury Sunday to play in his team’s 17-10 win over the Rams in London. — Derrick Rose returned to Knicks practice Saturday after being found not liable in his weeks-long rape trial. Rose said it felt “like heaven” to be back on the basketball court and said he “just wants to hoop.” “I got through my little situation, but I’m happy to be focusing on nothing but basketball,” Rose said. And he has returned ready to get back into his craft. “I’m very confident, man,’’ he said. “I really believe that’s why I’m here — to hoop. I still have a lot of confidence in my ability.” Though he missed basketball, the only thing he regrets missing during his trial was his son’s birthday. “Out of all this, the only thing that hurt me was missing my son’s birthday party and birthday,” he said. “Those were the two things I was worried about the most — not being there with my family.” Rose likely will start in the Knicks’ season opener in Cleveland on Tuesday. — For the first time since 2014, an NFL game ended in a tie. When the Cardinals and the Seahawks went to overtime Sunday night tied, 6-6, Arizona’s kicker Chandler Catanzaro only needed a 24-yard field goal to secure the win. He missed when his kick hit off the left upright. Then Seattle kicker Stephen Hauschka needed to make a 27-yard field goal for the win. He missed with a kick that went wide to the left. The last time an NFL game ended in a tie was two years ago when the Panthers and the Bengals tied, 37-37. The two missed field goals came on the same day Colts kicker (and former Patriot) Adam Vinatieri broke the NFL record for consecutive field goals with his 43rd. QUOTE OF THE DAY: “Right now, I stink.” — Stephen Gostkowski, after missing an extra point for the second week in a row THIS DAY IN SPORTS HISTORY: The Red Sox beat the Rockies, 13-1, to take Game 1 of the 2007 World Series. Dustin Pedroia becomes the first rookie to lead off a World Series game with a home run. Josh Beckett struck out nine batters and got his fourth win of the postseason.   Tweet   Read More: Derrick Rose, Eli Apple, John Mara, You May Also Like...

Apple CEO Tim Cook is said to have discussed plans for the MacBook with the heads of Foxconn and Sonder on October 11th in China.

The entire incident took just 1 minute and 36 seconds from entry to exit of the exterior doors. On Wednesday evening a group of seven individuals made up of males and females entered the Mall and went directly to the Apple Store. These individuals, while clad in hoodies and/or hats to shield their identity, surrounded the area of the store where iPhones are on display. In orchestrated fashion these individuals cut the security cords and exited the store with 19 phones. Apple placed a value on the loss in excess of $13,000. The group fled easterly on foot and despite an extensive search was not located. Check out the security camera footage of the robbery below. Anyone that can assist with the identification is asked to contact the Natick Police Department Detective Division at: 508-647-9520. You can give an anonymous tip here.

This corroborates a recent report from Macotakara. The Mac event is expected to take place at or near Apple’s Cupertino campus rather than in San Francisco, where the company held many recent events, including the iPhone 7 announcement. The announcement has been expected for some time as many of Apple's Macs have not been updated in a long time. It's widely rumored that Apple will replace the function keys on the MacBook Pro with an OLED Touch Bar. Check out these renders. Additionally, the Mac mini, iMac, and Mac Pro are in need of an update. Make sure to follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

Reply · Like · Mark as Spam . - October 20, 2016 at 12:49am If CDs/DVDs were still a thing today and not streaming/could based services, this means that if the drive was still included in the MacBook Pro today, there would also be a data doubler, but there's no chance Apple is going backwards to that now. Those are only in 2011 or below models! Reply · Like · Mark as Spam ShadowOne - October 19, 2016 at 11:41am It was a disaster when Lenovo did that a couple of years ago and replaced the function keys with soft keys on the X1 carbon. I hated it so much that I ended up selling the laptop within a couple months of use. Apparently I was not alone and Lenovo ditched the soft keys the following year. Maybe Apple has a better implementation on the Macs but as of now, I'm very skeptical about this.

Chiclet keyboards and two finger scrolling were the two things that drew me to Mac a long, long time ago. So much easier to type with the "low action" chiclet-style keyboard (for me anyhow). Also...yes, I am aware that this is only an artist's concept, not to be taken as the real deal. I'm just saying those types of keyboards would be AWFUL compared to the current version. As the old adage goes, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it.". Reply · Like · Mark as Spam . - October 19, 2016 at 3:26am But what if the current mb pros were updated to keep the old keys to be sold with the new chiclet keyboard styled ones? To me though, I kind of look forward to those kinds of keyboards because sometimes, I press the edge of a key and never registers and/or would be stiff when trying to press when the mechanism couldn't work (unless it's the kind of keyboard that could be force touch you're mentioning) and the worst time for these problems to happen is when gaming.

As rumored the new MacBook Pro will arrive in 13-inch and 15-inch sizes with an OLED touch bar (perhaps called the Magic Toolbar), Touch ID, USB-C, Thunderbolt 3, and a butterfly keyboard design. Our new predictions also include: (1) Intel’s (US) Skylake processor; (2) the same panel resolution but better display quality and energy efficiency thanks to an oxide panel; (3) a new option of 2TB SSD storage capacity; (4) adoption of a similar processor as Apple Watch to control the OLED touch bar more energy-efficiently in the new MacBook Pro models; and (5) a Type-C & MagSafe-like adapter rolled out by Apple or a third-party supplier, given positive reviews for the MagSafe charging design. Kuo also says Apple will introduce a 13-inch Macbook. Its unclear if this is a larger version of the Macbook or if its a new MacBook Air. Recent reports have suggested that Apple plans to drop the 11-inch MacBook Air and just update the 13-inch version. Despite hopes that Apple would update the iMac and release a new 5K monitor, Kuo says they are not ready yet. We also expect Apple to launch new iMacs (21.5-inch and 27-inch) and Cinema Display (27-inch) in mid- 1H17. We cannot say for certain whether Apple will announce the new iMacs and Cinema Display on October 27 as the shipping schedule is not imminent. Apple's 'hello again' Mac event is being held on Thursday at 10:00AM PT. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

Stephen Shankland/CNET Google to Apple: It's your move now on VR, smart speaker 0 Share: Phones by Stephen Shankland October 6, 2016 7:17 AM PDT @stshank Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech Enlarge Image Google Home, the $129 networked speakers that deliver Google Assistant services Photo by James Martin/CNET Google just ratcheted up the pressure on Apple. For starters on Tuesday, it debuted products Apple lacks -- the Daydream virtual-reality headset, the Google Home digital assistant-powered speaker, the Chromecast Ultra streamer that can pipe 4K video to your TV. On top of that is a broader competitive threat. Google designed its new devices on its own, reflecting an evolution into a company that makes hardware, not just one that writes software and offers online services. Sound familiar? That's the winning strategy Apple employed during the last decade's explosively fast development of the phone and tablet market to vault ahead of rivals like Dell, Microsoft and Samsung. Google could one-up Apple when it comes to integration of hardware, software and services. It's no coincidence that Google's new Pixel is the only phone to get the new Google Assistant and to tap into unlimited cloud storage for any photos and videos that don't fit on the phone. The Google Home smart speaker adds another way to use Google Assistant -- and to control Chromecast devices playing YouTube video on your TV and Google Play Music on your stereo. Google's Pixel phones won't push aside Apple iPhones and Samsung Galaxys any time soon. But with new types of gadgets hitting the market, Google's ambition makes it much more likely you'll see devices sporting the company's "G" logo infiltrate your home. "Google...demonstrated that it's finally serious about hardware," said Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson. 12 Google Daydream is VR for everyone (pictures) All about execution To really put the competitive pressure on Apple, Google has to deliver the goods, not just announce them. It's shown some ability here, having sold 30 million Chromecasts so far by Strategy Analytics' estimate. But other products haven't fared so well, like the short-lived Nexus Q audio streaming device. Its acquisition of the Motorola phone business didn't last much longer. And Google's earlier Nexus phones remained niche products despite six years of sustained effort. Google's products aren't first to market either -- Amazon's Echo speaker and Alexa voice-powered digital assistant are already a hit with consumers. But unless Apple's smart speaker project and virtual reality efforts bear fruit soon, Google will beat Apple to market. Google Home and Daydream View are both due to arrive in November. The Google Pixel XL, a 5.5-inch Android phone, has a top-shelf camera and built-in Google Assistant abilities. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET Google doesn't pose any near-term threat to Apple, according to Creative Strategies analyst Ben Bajarin. As with Microsoft's Surface tablet PC line, it will take Google years of sustained effort to develop a reputation for good products and customer trust, he said, and developing the necessary deep relationships with retailers and carriers to push Pixel phones is "super hard." But while people are settled in their phone-buying habits, it's different with Google Home, which taps into a nascent market that's just starting to get attention thanks to the Echo. "Google has an opportunity to break new ground, and Apple is not there," Bajarin said. Apple declined to comment for this story. First isn't always best The immensely profitable iPhone maker has been judicious about entering new markets, and being first in a new category isn't necessarily as important as having a good product. Enlarge Image Google CEO Sundar Pichai stands before queries you can ask Google Assistant. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET Apple wasn't the first to sell digital music players, but the iPod eventually dominated. The iPhone wasn't the first smartphone, but it was the one that rewrote the rules of mobile computing. Google attracted plenty of attention with its Google Glass eyewear, but Apple sat on the sidelines as that product faltered. As online services pervade our lives, Apple can't afford to be complacent. The company has significant services such as FaceTime messaging, iCloud storage, Siri search and Maps. But with more than a billion people each using Gmail and YouTube, and with Google still dominating search, there's no question here who has more clout. That's a big advantage as digital assistants spread to phones, speakers, PCs, TVs, cars and other devices. "It's clear to me we are evolving from a mobile-first world to an AI-first world," Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said at the event. Siri can answer some questions and get iPhones to call mom, but Google Assistant is wired up to the most powerful computer brains on the planet when it comes to fetching the information you want. "This event may have been pitched as a hardware launch but it in reality it is a statement of intent from Google in artificial intelligence," said CCS Insight analyst Martin Garner. "Hardware is simply the means to deepen Google's reach into the fabric of daily life." First published October 6 at 5:00 a.m. PT. Update at 7:17 a.m. PT: Added Apple's response.
