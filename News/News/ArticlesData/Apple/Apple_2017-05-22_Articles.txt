Sign Up Watch Apple's self-driving car cruise down the California highway I would have never expected people to get this excited about some hardware, but that's 2017 for you. MacRumors Car Industry by Andrew Krok May 22, 2017 1:17 PM PDT @andrewkrok When Apple received its permit to test autonomous cars in California, people started geeking out hard. Now, prepare to cry some more tears of fanboy joy, because Apple's car has been spotted in the wild yet again. MacRumors posted a reader-submitted video, showing Apple's Lexus RX outfitted with all manner of self-driving hardware, including a Velodyne lidar emitter, multiple radar emitters and a whole bunch of cameras. It was just cruising down CA 101 in Palo Alto, minding its own business. Apple isn't working on its own car, but rather it's developing a hardware suite capable of providing autonomous driving. It's unclear whether Apple will become a supplier, selling the tech to automakers who will then implement it, or if the tech titan is just burning piles of cash for fun. This kind of stuff ain't cheap. Bloomberg News was one of the first outlets to catch Apple's self-driving hardware on the road. Expect to run into more and more sightings as Apple's development work continues over the next few years.

By: Priyanka Dua Published: Tuesday, May 23, 2017, 11:15 [IST] As we all know, the Cupertino based tech giant Apple has started assembling iPhone SE in India, but now the Government has rejected the former's demand to assemble and sell refurbished phones in the country, ICTflash reported. "India does not want to become a "dumping ground" for used iPhones, which may major cause environmental problems, it has rejected Apple's proposal to manufacture refurbished iPhones in India", ICTflash quoted sources. According to the report, the company is also planning to sell refurbished models of iPhone 6 and 6S. Meanwhile, Apple has started selling iPhone SE models those were assembled in India in select stores. SEE ALSO: Xiaomi Mi Home Store sets a new offline sales record: 5 Crores revenue within 12 hours To recall, the tech giant is asking for incentives from the Department of Electronics and Information Technology (Diety). Apple had asked for tax concessions including lower import and manufacturing duties, and certain policy exemptions from the Government for setting up a manufacturing unit here in the country. The company also wants duty exemptions on the products to be bought from special economic zones (SEZs). Apple had informed the government this year in January that it is ready with a blueprint to begin manufacturing iPhones in India but wants fiscal concessions. According to IDC, Apple's move to start manufacturing in India comes at a time when its sales in China are hit by a slowdown. India's smartphone market is rapidly expanding and is likely to overtake the US market to become the second-largest in the world. Currently, most Apple's products are assembled in China primarily by Foxconn Technology Group.

AFP Relaxnews / 01:50 PM May 23, 2017 The iPad 2017 range currently consists of three types: the iPad mini, the iPad classic and the iPad Pro. Image: Apple via AFP Relaxnews Has the fashion for phablets killed off small tablets? Apple is preparing to drop the iPad mini from its range of tablets, according to a report from BGR citing a source close to Apple. The announcement could be made at Apple’s WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference) which will be held on June 5 to 9 in the city of San José, California. Launched in 2012, but with no updates since 2015, the iPad mini 7.9-inch tablet was used by Apple to compete with Google’s Nexus 7 and Amazon’s Kindle Fire in the small tablet market, which was booming at that time. Five years later, the market has changed. ADVERTISEMENT The main reason for dropping the iPad mini is thought to be the significant drop in sales. Many users now prefer a smartphone with a big screen (an iPhone 6s Plus or an iPhone 7 Plus) rather than a small tablet. Also, buyers could be dissuaded by the fact that prices for the latest version of the device start at $399 for the Wi-Fi version with 128GB of storage. That’s only slightly cheaper than the new 9.7-inch iPad, for which prices start at $429 for the same configuration (and only $329 for the 32GB version). Even though tablet sales have been declining worldwide since 2015, Apple CEO Tim Cook is still very optimistic about the iPad, which he plans to keep positioned at the top end of the market as a PC alternative. It’s rumored that a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro (putting it between the 9.7 and 12.9-inch models) could be unveiled at the WWDC. Apple’s WWDC brings together developers and creatives from all over the world. Over a thousand Apple engineers will be at this year’s event to meet and engage with developers.

It’s the same sourcing norms that have been a hurdle for multinationals such as Apple Inc in setting up retail operations in India. While the Union government has indicated in the past that cutting-edge technology should be treated on a case-to-case basis, the definition of cutting-edge has been hard to find so far.        Tesla had opened bookings for its most affordable Model 3 sedan in India in April 2016, with tech sector leaders such as Vishal Gondal, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, Mahesh Murthy and Vani Kola showing interest in it.  The $35,000 Model 3 sedan is expected to hit the road between late 2017 and early 2018. It is not clear, however, how and when Tesla plans to service customers in India who pre-booked the sedan. Moreover, even if the company makes a formal entry into the country later this year or next year, India lacks adequate charging infrastructure, especially for high-voltage electric vehicles. While India has set an ambitious target of moving to 100 per cent electric mobility by 2030, it continues to push for local sourcing in order to boost the country’s manufacturing sector. Companies like Tesla, which are more akin to technology firms than traditional auto manufacturers, say it is hard for them to meet the 30 per cent local sourcing norm from day one. Experts, however, believe that India’s ask for manufacturers to source components locally is not unviable, even if the technology is fairly new. “Even if you want to bring in some new technologies, it’s not fair for a country like India to accept 100 per cent import,” says Abdul Majeed, partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). “India is a big market and instead of setting shop somewhere else, do it here.”       Original equipment manufacturers often bring along component vendors while setting up manufacturing units in a new region. A workaround to India’s local sourcing requirement for Tesla could be to manufacture the lithium-ion batteries in India, a move which Musk had said would make more sense for Tesla in the long run. “Given high local demand, a Gigafactory in India would probably make sense in the long term,” Musk had said in 2015. However, it is unlikely that the company would rush to manufacture batteries in India anytime soon. Tesla began producing lithium-ion cells at its own Gigafactory facility in the Nevada desert this January, only a third of which has been completed so far. Experts say Tesla’s Gigafactory is just one of the many that will come up globally in next few years, and India could emerge as a prime contender for one soon. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had met Musk and toured the Tesla headquarters during his visit to Silicon Valley in 2015. The two are said to have discussed the implications of development of battery technology, energy storage and renewable energy for India. Musk had apparently made a pitch for bringing the company’s Powerwall energy storage unit to the country. Image: Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk introduces the Model S. Photograph: Stepan Lam/Reuters.

That would be the price tag of the upcoming Apple iPhone 8, which UBS analyst Steven Milunovich predicts will start from a not-so-pricey $870 (roughly Rs 56,000). First reported by Business Insider, the new price predictions were revealed from a note sent to investors. In the past, there have been similar predictions which claimed that Apple’s tenth anniversary iPhone would start from a $1000 (roughly Rs 64,000 for the 128 GB model). Milunovich has changed his predictions from an earlier $1,000 to $870 that should calm down Apple enthusiasts. The analyst predicts that Apple would price its top-of-the-line iPhone 8 model (with 256 GB internal storage) at $1,070 (roughly Rs 69,000). Adding to the above claims, the UBS analyst also said in a detailed note that the iPhone 8 model would account for 45 percent of iPhone sales in the coming year, which means that most iPhone users would flock to the iPhone 8, instead of the usual iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models. Image: iDrop News It is wise to note that these pricing predictions by analysts are based on modules and components that are to be included in the said smartphone. So the actual cost will indeed be higher than the predicted prices. Add to this local taxes and duties in countries like India, and the final price may be a lot higher than what analysts predicted. Samsung recently launched its flagship Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones in India. The Samsung Galaxy S8 is priced at Rs 57,900 while the larger Galaxy S8+ is priced at Rs 64,900. With last year’s iPhone 7 Plus topping out at Rs 92,000 for the 256 GB model. So keeping this in mind along with the full face OLED display and dual cameras as standard on the iPhone 8, we should expect the price tags for the same to start from a hefty Rs 80,000 at least.

(Pic: File, AFP) RELATED ARTICLES Apple ordered to pay over R200bn in EU tax crackdown Apple Pay comes to Safari browser Apple ordered to pay $626m in patent dispute New  York - Apple and Visa are facing claims by Universal Secure Registry, a small Boston-area company, that their mobile-payment partnership infringes four of its patents. In a federal lawsuit filed in Wilmington, Delaware, USR said it sent Apple a series of letters in 2010 describing its patented technology and seeking a partnership long before Apple Pay’s debut. One letter detailed USR’s patent for using biometrics to authenticate identity on a smartphone, according to the complaint filed on May 21. Kenneth P. Weiss, chief executive of USR, also pursued a partnership with Visa around the same time, engaging “in a series of confidential discussions with senior representatives”, according to the filing. Both Apple and Visa shunned USR’s offers in favour of a partnership with each other to incorporate the technology into Apple Pay. According to the complaint, when Apple publicly announced its Apple Pay service in September 2014, the company “touted the same benefits that USR had introduced to Apple and Visa in 2010”. “Just as USR disclosed to Apple and Visa that its patented technology eliminated the need to store or transmit payment-card account numbers, Apple bragged to its users that with Apple Pay ‘the credit card isn’t stored on the device’,” lawyers for USR said in the complaint. Apple spokesperson Josh Rosenstock, and Amanda Pires, a spokesperson for Visa, both declined to comment on the complaint. USR, based in Newton, Massachusetts, wants cash compensation and an order that would block further unauthorised use of its inventions.

Picture: AP Photo/Richard Vogel APPLE is taking the smartphone war right to Google by launching a major campaign to get users to ditch their Android phones, and offering them cash to switch to an iPhone. The tech giant launched the provocatively titled “Switch from Android” website and a series of five YouTube videos as part of its campaign, in a sizeable push that hasn’t been seen since Apple’s “Get a Mac” advertisements launched more than a decade ago. APPLE’S iPhone 8’s new design leaked Apple has launched a "Switch from Android" website as part of a campaign to recruit new iPhone users from Google.Source:Supplied Promising “life is easier on iPhone,” the website touts the Apple phones’ cameras, speed, and customer support but it also has a not-so-subtle dig at Google’s smartphone security record. “Unlike many other phones, important data on your iPhone is encrypted from the start and protected by your passcode,” the Apple website reads. “Apple apps like Maps and Safari help to keep private all the places you go and the sites you visit, and Apple will not sell your information to anyone for any reason.” The website also reiterates Apple’s offer of up to $250 as a trade-in for your old phone, although a Samsung Galaxy S6 only earns $150 in credit. Google recently launched its own voice assistant in Apple’s App Store. Picture: AP Photo/Eric RisbergSource:AP Apple’s move comes as its grip on the smartphone market climbed slightly in the last three months of 2016, according to research firm Gartner, but not nearly as much as Google Android’s share of the market. More than 81 per cent of the world’s smartphones use Google’s software, compared to almost 18 per cent that run Apple’s system. Samsung was also the world’s top smartphone maker in 2016, claiming more than 20 per cent of all sales, compared to Apple’s 14 per cent. But the Apple iPhone 7 claimed the title of most popular smartphone in Australia in March, according to Kantar Worldpanel, even though it’s swamped by Android rivals. Apple previously published a guide on how to switch from Android to an iPhone to lure users in 2014, before releasing an official Move to iOS app in 2015. Both followed the successful “Get a Mac” advertising campaign that ran from 2006 to 2009, featuring Justin Long personifying Apple’s computers.

Apple iPhone 8 could start at a price of $870 if one goes by the latest report, from UBS analyst Steven Milunovich, who wrote this in a note given to clients. This isn’t the first report hinting the Apple iPhone 8 will have an higher pricing. Earlier a report on Fortune had pegged the price of the limited edition iPhone 8 at $1000, which sounds very high to say the least. According to the latest analyst quote, which has been picked up by Business Insider, the 256GB version of the 10th anniversary iPhone 8 will be priced $1,070 while the base variant will start at $870. With Apple it’s hard to predict the final pricing given this is the company’s best kept secret. However, given that the iPhone 8 will see a massive design change and new features like wireless charging, and an edge-to-edge OLED display, a hike in price won’t be surprising. The year 2017 marks ten years of the Apple iPhone, and it won’t be surprising to see Cupertino launch something special to mark the occasion. After all, the iPhone is their most successful product, and it has changed the way smartphone industry works all across. According to reports, Apple will launch three iPhones: The iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus and the special edition iPhone 8 or what some have even called the iPhone X. iPhone 8 will likely feature an glass design, similar to the iPhone 4s, a new 3D Touch module inside the display, no home button, wireless charging support, along with an OLED display which is edge-to-edge. Apple has reportedly placed a large order, over 70 million panels for the OLED panels with Samsung Display, according to reports in Korean media. Other reports have questioned this $1000 pricing mark as well. However, there are reports the iPhone 8 could be delayed due to the OLED panel sourcing. Also it looks like Apple is still trying to figure out how to embed the fingerprint scanner under the display, when there’s home button.

Thanks to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Monday, patent infringement cases must be filed in the jurisdiction where the offending company is incorporated, which will greatly limit the court choices open to patent trolls. Supreme Court ruling limits where patent infringement lawsuits can be filed Patent trolls have spent the last 27 years shopping around for sympathetic courts, which led to a booming business in Eastern Texas. Non-practicing patent holders, or patent trolls, have been filing cases in Federal court there for years because odds are much higher they’ll win their cases. Thanks to the court’s rules and sympathetic juries, patent infringement cases are big business in Marshall, Texas. 40 percent of the patent infringement cases are filed in the town, but that’s about to change, and the trolls can blame Heartland and Kraft. Kraft filed a patent infringement lawsuit in Delaware against Heartland over water flavorings. Heartland’s request to move the case to Indiana where it’s based was denied despite the fact that it doesn’t have a presence in Delaware, according to Reuters. That eventually took the case to the Supreme Court and today’s ruling. According to the Supreme Court ruling, patent infringement cases must be filed where the defendant is incorporated. While Apple makes computers and smartphones instead of juice, the ruling could still have a big impact. The long list of patent trolls the company has tangled with over the years tend to file their cases in Eastern Texas where Apple doesn’t have a presence, and now those cases will have to be filed in Delaware. Apple’s headquarters are in Cupertino, but the company is incorporated in Delaware for tax purposes. Apple isn’t the only big company to incorporate in Delaware. Google, Coca-Cola, Ford, Facebook, Amazon, Kraft, and thousands of other companies have done the same to take advantage of the state’s tax laws. That’s were patent trolls will have to head now, and the Federal Court in that district isn’t as kind to them. That also means Marshall’s thriving patent litigation industry is about to dry up, and most of the jobs it created will go away. For Delaware’s Federal District Court, the dockets may start filling up with the cases that otherwise would’ve gone to Texas—assuming the patent trolls think they have a fighting chance. Regardless, it looks like Marshall, Texas, is about to get a lot quieter and big tech companies like Apple and Google may see fewer frivolous patent lawsuits.

The campaign trades the white of the company’s original I’m a PC campaign for dark pastels and simple, compelling imagery. The message is that it’s simple to switch to iPhone, which is faster, that your music will sound better, and that moving your photos is easy. To kick off the campaign, Apple posted four videos to YouTube, embedded below. Switch to iPhone The main Switch to iPhone website has lots of information to bolster the switching message. It talks about Apple’s commitment to privacy, why Messages is “so great,” the fact that it’s easy, fast, and the qualities of the camera. Jump to iPhone The first spot is called Jump to iPhone, featuring a literal embodiment of that idea that it’s easy to jump from your old phone to an iPhone. Fast The second piece argues that iPhones are faster. Music Apple’s Music spot has a slightly more abstract message that your music sounds better on an iPhone. Photos The fourth spot addresses one of the biggest sources of angst for anyone switching from one smartphone platform to another (and to a lesser extent, to a new smartphone): moving all those pics you’ve taken. The message of this commercial is that doing so is easy, and that Photos does all the work for you. More Switch to iPhone Commercials Likely Coming There are four spots in the series, but there are likely more coming. This has the hallmark of an extended campaign.

Then, John Gruber of Daring Fireball linked to the article and added his own comments, such as how AMP pages scroll differently than the rest of Safari. The creator of Google AMP then explained the scrolling difference, and how Apple will change scrolling in Safari to be like AMP. But let’s go back to the beginning and explain what it all means. What is AMP? In 2015, Google launched the Accelerated Mobile Pages project, or AMP. It’s a special web format web developers and publishers can use to display their web pages and have them load quickly on smartphones. While it sounds great at first, not many developers like the idea of giving Google control over their content. AMP strips out web analytics and special elements like interactive maps and photo galleries. Because of the way AMP is implemented, it even breaks certain features of Safari. How AMP Screws With Safari Google AMP breaks Safari Reader, the “tap status bar to scroll up” function, and Safari’s Find on Page extension. It also messes with Safari’s scrolling on iOS, which was John Gruber’s complaint. But Malte Ubl, the creator of Google AMP, explains: With respect to scrolling: We (AMP team) filed a bug with Apple about that (we didn’t implement scrolling ourselves, just use a div with overflow). We asked to make the scroll inertia for that case the same as the normal scrolling. Apple’s response was (surprisingly) to make the default scrolling like the overflow scrolling. So, with the next Safari release all pages will scroll like AMP pages. Inception: A website in AMP format explaining Google AMP. Breaking it Down User Om2 points out in response to Malte Ubl: In current iOS Safari, webpage scrolling is inconsistent from all other scrolling on the system. This was an intentional decision made long ago. In addition, overflow areas are consistent with the rest of the system, and thus inconsistent with top-level webpage scrolling. This is semi-accidental. In reviewing scroll rates, we concluded that the original reason was no longer a good tradeoff. Thus this change, which removed all the inconsistencies: https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/211197/webkit. Having all scrolling be consistent feels good once you get used to it. Throughout iOS and macOS, Apple implements inertial scrolling, also called momentum scrolling. It’s when you swipe to scroll up or down, and when you lift up your finger, the page continues to scroll on its own for a short distance. Most—if not all—apps use this, and it’s the reason why using an iPhone feels like such a fast and smooth experience. If you’re a web developer, you’re probably familiar with the CSS property webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch. This lets you add inertial scrolling to overflow elements. If you add it to a fixed size element, then the content will also have inertial scrolling. Apple patent: “Continuous scrolling with acceleration” The problem is that very few web developers apply inertial scrolling. This is why, when you browse in iOS Safari, the web page will stop when your finger lifts off the screen. You have to put more effort into getting to the top or bottom of the page. But the good news is that Apple plans to update iOS and bring inertial scrolling to Safari. This will make it consistent with the rest of the system, and should give your thumb less of a workout. We’re not sure when this will happen. MacRumors noted that inertial scrolling isn’t found in the iOS 10.3.3 beta, so it’s possible Apple will wait to bring it to iOS 11.

The new iMacs, possibly with Xeon CPUs, are expected until the fall. The new Mac Pro isn’t expected until some time in 2018. This would seem to make it imperative that Apple introduce (if not ship) new notebooks at WWDC next month. Jonny Evans at Computerworld has the scoop. “WWDC: Apple’s Kaby Lake MacBook upgrades coming soon.” Why does Apple’s new (2016) MacBook Pro have only USB-C ports? Doc Searls describes that as “passive-aggressive” behavior. Conversely, why doesn’t the new Microsoft Surface Laptop have any at all? The Verge has the answer: “Microsoft doesn’t think USB-C is ready for the mainstream.” Even if you never purchase Apple’s next Mac Pro, Jason Snell explains why it “holds an important place in the lineup.” See: “Championing the Mac Pro.” The truth is, every professional user is the most vertical of niches: a target market of one, with specific needs and desires that need to be fulfilled. Very few of us are lucky enough to have the perfect product emerge from Apple’s factories, so we have to pick and choose and find the closest approximation that we can afford. That’s the advantage of making professional products not just powerful, but flexible in terms of specs and features. The more flexible the product line, the more fuzzy space there is for professional users to fit inside. And so. Might we expect a slightly different, more flexible port configuration for the Kaby Lake MacBook Pros?  That would be an amazing, welcome concession to customers. Perhaps the Mac community, having had so long to formulate its thoughts about Apple,  Macs, the competition and their own needs will have an impact on future designs. In any case, my instincts suggest that it won’t be too long before Apple’s Mac lineup starts to look much better. WWDC will be the litmus test. One More Debris Email on the Mac is beleaguered. There have been several misfires in the history of trying to one-up Apple’s Mail app, but none have gone the distance. Whenever I see an article that discusses alternatives to the Mail app, one that’s always mentioned is the trusty Thunderbird. And now this: “Mozilla to Thunderbird: You can stay here and we may give you cash, but as a couple, it’s over.” No, the app isn’t done for, but it’s being relegated to 2nd tier status. Once upon a time, a unified code base for Mozilla’s Firefox and Thunderbird sounded great… What’s happened now is a divorce-of-convenience… the Firefox and Thunderbird source code will diverge. It’s over between the two – not with a bang, but a whimper. Email is one of those things that’s terribly important for some people, but not for many others. It’s not very sexy anymore. And so, we remain stuck with the Mail app, Thunderbird, Outlook and a few others. Things will probably never get any better for email. And so we limp along with less than stellar solutions. It’s sad. ______________________ Particle Debris is a generally a mix of John Martellaro’s observations and opinions about a standout event or article of the week (preamble on page one) followed on page two by a discussion of articles that didn’t make the tmo headlines, the technical news debris.

Here’s how to fix the most common Apple TV problems. On the surface, the Apple TV looks like any other streaming box, but it connects into other Apple devices and it connects to many other parts of your home. The Apple TV controls your Hue lights, lets you play games and download apps as well as acts as an easy way to stream your iPhone or MacBook to your TV using AirPlay. Read: 34 Apple TV Tips & Tricks Even with a proper setup, you may quickly run into Apple TV problems that could be related to your home WiFi, your home theater setup or simply streaming movies not streaming. Here are the most common Apple TV problems and how to fix them so you can play apps, stream movies or mirror your iPhone or MacBook to your TV without calling Apple. How to Fix Apple TV WiFi Problems Apple TV WiFi problems are one of the most common issues that you will experience. This could easily be related to your home WiFi network or it could be that your Apple TV is too far away. Common Apple TV WiFi problems include; Can’t find WiFi network Unable to join WiFi network Can’t access the Internet on Apple TV Frequent disconnects and buffering. To fix these problems, first, navigate to Settings > Network and see if an IP address is showing up. If there is no IP address you need to turn your router off for a minute and to restart your Apple TV. To restart your Apple TV, navigate to Settings > System > Restart. To power cycle your router, unplug it from power. In cases where your Apple TV connects to WiFi, but it is not staying connected or constantly waiting to download more of a show you may have a poor signal. You may need to move the Apple TV out of a cabinet or move your router closer. You may also need to look for a whole home WiFi system. How to Fix Apple TV AirPlay Problems AirPlay lets you stream your iPhone, iPad or MacBook screen to your TV. It’s an awesome way to use the TV as a display when it works. This is a useful tool, but one that can cause many problems. The first thing to do if you cannot use AirPlay is to make sure your iPhone and Apple TV are on the same network. If you connect to a different one by accident or your iPhone is on cellular it will not work. Go to Settings and see if your home WiFi network shows up on both of your devices. Another issue is that you may not see the AirPlay logo in the video app you want to stream. If that is the case, the app may not support AirPlay. This is common in some sports apps and in some TV apps where the company doesn’t allow you to watch on a larger screen. If that’s not the case check your Apple TV settings. You can also check to see if AirPlay is enabled on your Apple TV by heading to Settings > AirPlay and make sure that the feature is turned on. In cases where AirPlay stutters or lags, it could be that your iPhone is too far from the Apple TV or that the lag is related to streaming instead of to AirPlay. How to Fix Apple TV Video Problems If you cannot stream content from apps or there are other video problems you aren’t alone. Occasionally there will be video without audio or audio without video. Before you take any drastic options, restart the stream. This may fix the issue in just a few seconds. If that doesn’t work, make sure the HDMI cable is connected on both ends and if possible try a different HDMI cable. You can also check the Apple TV resolution. To change the resolution that your Apple TV displays, navigate to Settings > Audio and Video > Resolution. Most users will see it set to Auto. This works in most cases, but you can also change it to the resolution your TV supports. How to Fix Apple TV Audio Problems When it comes to Apple TV audio problems there is an easy solution to start with. Just as with video issues, restart the stream before you do anything else. Double check your connections to the Apple TV and your TV. This could be HDMI or it could be an optical cable. Make sure these are all connected, including connections to an audio receiver or soundbar. You may want to switch inputs to see if your Apple TV audio comes back. Of course, you should also check that your volume is turned up and the TV is not muted. How to Fix Apple TV Remote Problems The Apple TV remote is certainly a key part of using the Apple TV. When you have remote problems, you may not be able to use the Apple TV. Before you have any issues, it’s a good idea to set up the iPhone Remote App to control your Apple TV. One Apple TV remote problem is that it is no longer paired. Make sure the remote is charged for 30 minutes. Then put your remote within 3-inches of the Apple TV and hold the volume up and menu button for five seconds to pair. Once this is done, unplug the Apple TV from power for seconds. Plug it back in and then try your remote again. Here are other minor Apple TV remote problems that you can check out. 9 Awesome Apple TV Accessories Griffin Survivor Play   1 / 9 The Griffin Survivor Play is a protective sleeve for the Apple TV remote that can save it from potential damage. The Survivor Play is geared toward Apple TV gamers that will likely use the remote as a game controller, providing maximum grip so that the remote doesn't fall out of your hands, especially when you're playing a game that requires you to fling around the remote to activate the motion sensors inside. The protective sleeve is made out of silicone and has extra-thick grips on the back to make it easier to hold. It's priced at $19.99 and is available now.   1 / 9 69 Responses 11/20/2014 Areyoukiddinme Reply You forgot the most common problem: the little light on the apple tv is off.

It is not user friendly. the remote is nerve racking to use. 06/05/2015 Maria Reply This is an individual user opinion. I happen to love the remote. Fewer buttons so you can use it without looking at it. Solid click anytime you push something. It’s great. 06/11/2015 Larry Reply I totally agree. Very easy. 03/10/2017 Adrian Reply Agree, I hate the new remote. Lean over in the dark to find it only to bump the touch pad and the movie skips or stops playing. Cat jumps on the table in the middle of the night and switches the TV on. Very poorly thought out 05/11/2015 chloe77 Reply We moved the Apple TV to a different TV since Yourube was no longer supported by the first generation Apple TV. When we plugged it in, it would not light up or come on. It simply doesn’t work period. It was working perfectly. Mind you I have three Apple TV s in my home. Any ideas on what’s wrong with the one that simply stopped working? 07/11/2015 D1ddyd Reply It’s common for the PSU on the apple TV 2 & 3’s to fail. You can go to youtube to find a tutorial of how to replace a faulty PSU. They are about US$30 to buy. 07/11/2015 D1ddyd Reply The way to diagnose this is to see it isn’t powering up with the power cable connected, however, if you connect via a micro USB to you computer it will still light up and be able to be restored with iTunes. 05/29/2015 Stickman Reply I have a number of photos on my Mac. When I show them on my TV many of them are out of order plus I get a number of duplicates. I have checked that I am using the correct file. Help. 06/20/2015 Rama Reply great.. thanks boss. This worked for me.. Menu+Up button changed the resolution and that solved my problem 07/21/2015 Lanny Julian Reply My Apple TV no longer receives iTunes via WiFi. I’ve done all that’s noted including reboot, proper sign-in/passwords, tested for speed/signal (OK), but every time I try turning the music on, I get a message “Problem with loading; try again later.” My iCloud photos steam perfectly but no music! 07/24/2015 Tracy Reply Apple TV bite me! I’ve tried everything! To get to the back of my TV you need two people to take it from the bookcase to get to the cables. We unplugged all cables. Put the cables back in place and put the TV back on the bookcase and no Apple TV. I changed the batteries and we switch out remotes. I do not recommend this product. Once it goes it done. There was no extended warranty so basically it did not last 5 months and now I’m back to cable. 02/24/2016 Dickens Reply If your TV is that awkward to access …..secure the cables with some slack. 07/25/2015 Not Happy Reply Apple TV – what a piece of crap…. used it for 3 months … now no power, no light, no nothing. Cant get any link or signal w HDMI or USB – waste of money. 08/29/2015 Mike McCullough Reply Only one problem with my Apple TV’s remote control: the left directional arrow does not respond. Therefore I can’t move to the left. Moving Up, down or to the right is fine. Do I need a new remote control? 08/31/2015 Kerry Reply You could just download the remote app on your iphone and control your Apple TV with that instead. 02/06/2016 Olivia Reply My Apple Remote would not move right. Read thins tip whether your having issues with anyone of directions on remote. I found this tip and it worked for this 64 year old Senior Lady so u can do it too. Get some hand sanitizer and soak the round directional area. I had to let my sit for at least a minute before I got amazing results! After the Sanitizer soaks in clean it off throughly. A miracle! Junk can get caught down in the circle preventing proper function. Tell whomever to clean their hands before using the remote. If it doesn’t work the first time, repeat a second. You’ll be You did! 09/07/2015 Stevemac Reply Sure, rebooting the ATV will allow it to reconnect and AirPlay to reactivate. The bigger question is WHY must a reboot continually be needed? From day to day, the ability to use AP is lost, and will NOT work until a reboot of ATV. My PC doesn’t lose connection to the network, and it is on 24×7. Yet I need to continually reboot the ATV. Very frustrating. Yes, it does work, but should not be needed everyday. This started to occur with the newer iOS versions, so I suspect a bug in the iOS. Again, very frustrating from the company that is supposed to be the one who ” gets it” with regard to consumer electronics. 10/04/2015 John Wilkins Reply Hello I have been experiencing lots of connection issues between my apple computer and Apple TV. It seems to have a mind of its own. All my update are on. But I still loose the connection between the Apple TV and my devices like computer, iPhone 5s, IPad top of the line. If somebody could explain to me why this is not resolved yet after all these years of development.. 10/09/2015 Matt frustrated apple user. Reply Easiest way to solve all your problems is to buy a Roku. Have an Apple TV in the same room as router, DOES NOT STREAM THRU WIFI. Roku on a different level, no problems. Good bye Apple….. 10/10/2015 Rick Bourget Reply Cant access past the main menu screen with remote. Changed and checked new battery , checked cable , rebooted TV , rebooted wifi…….apple TV box light is on but won’t flicker when remote is applied all dead…NFG 10/18/2015 Mark Reply I can’t see any wifi networks on my ATV at all. All I see is computer and settings buttons upon boot up. There are at least 10 wifi networks accessible on my iphone and MBP but my ATV sees none of them at all. ATV used to work fine but for the last couple of months wifi just isn’t working. Any advice on how to resolve this matter would be greatly appreciated. 10/29/2015 Claes Reply Mark, have you got any good answer/hints? I have the same problem 10/31/2015 Andy Reply My ATV looses connection with the ipad every 45 seconds and I have to use the pull up display on the ipad to reactivate the airplay ipad setting. It’s a drag when watching a film and its disappointing that what could be a great gadget turns into a painful experience that will eventually be thrown in the rubbish. The only luck i’ve had reducing this problem is to reduce the resolution to 360p. Not great! 11/07/2015 Carmen Reply I can get the Apple TV to power up but the remote will not control it. Tried all the resets on the remote and changed the battery. The remote is good , it will control my other Apple TV After the main screen is on for 5 minutes it powers off and I can’t get it to power on without unplugging and reconnecting. Then same problem. 11/11/2015 Shaun Reply So, I want to use an AppleTV in an auditorium setup. It has a roof mounted projector at the front and an audio box at the rear where audio/visual plug in. It has a HDMI cable plumbed from the projector to the audio box, about 10 meters away. Plug AppleTV in and no display/audio, although at times it seems to recognize a signal but shows nothing. Tried this in 2 seperate locations with the exact same setup only about 30km’s apart and same issue. Plug the AppleTV into the rear of the projector with standard length HDMI cable, works sweat, but can’t do this real time due to location of the audience. Plug a laptop into the same HDMI cable in the audio box and display’s with no problem. Why won’t the AppleTV work on this cable too? 11/14/2015 John Reply Air play keeps disconnection about every 10 minutes, thats annoying when streaming a movie from my i pad air 2, i have discovered that when the i pad screen turns off and locks that shortly there after if disconnects from airplay, so the only soulition i can make work is to put auto lock to never and leave the screen on, any other suggestions 11/18/2015 Rebecca Reply My remote has a mind of its own. Lately Ill push the select middle button and nothing will happen, I push again and then the icon that I’m on starts to shake. I push the button again and it stops. But I cannot get it to actually select the Icon app I am on. If I push the up/down/left/right button, it takes it all the way to the end of that column or row even if I only pushed it once. Ive restarted the Apple TV and the battery is fairly new. Im trying to connect it to my Iphone but I cant seem to even get to the settings. What do I do? this is beyond frustrating. 11/23/2015 nadia Reply Did you fix the problem? I have the same exactly problem 12/16/2015 David Reply Seeking help!! My Apple TV keeps ‘seizing” for about 1 minute every 3 or 4 minutes as though it’s playing too fast for the buffering when I stream Netflix or a movie. I checked my internet speed at 48Mbps at my PC and have a signal strength of 5 out of max 5 at the TV via a router signal extender. I have checked my HDMI cables and they fit snugly. I tested the internet connection on the TV for over 10 Mbps and it checks out fine. everything seems to work fine except for the playing of the show. any ideas where I should look next? 12/16/2015 David Reply Oh, and I have restarted the Apple TV and the Modem as well with no success. 12/17/2015 Ted Reply Same here. Mine won’t play Netflix for more than a few minutes and Hulu has no audio also. Air play is only way I can watch these apps. C’mon apple! 12/17/2015 Ted Reply Might b done w/apple products don’t think they really care anymore 12/18/2015 Jon Reply Thank you!!! The remote pairing did the trick! :) 12/23/2015 Tim Coutts Reply I have two of these devices in my house. Yes, I made the same mistake twice! For a few months, maybe a year, both worked beautifully but not now. They both respond to their remotes and stream Netflix fine. However, when I’m streaming TV, the video is jerky and the sound isn’t synchronized. I’ve tried rebooting both of them but without success. I’ve also tested the network strength, which is fine of course. My guess that successive upgrades of iOS has introduced problems and Apple just hasn’t solved them. Perhaps they haven’t bothered to try to solve them! Any new ideas? 12/25/2015 Jennifer Reply Apple TV remote has a mind of its own…each time it is touched the volume keeps climbing no matter what button you touch! Any insight how to fix? 02/04/2016 Lindsey Reply I have the same problem, only it turns the volume all the way down without me even touching the remote. Then no matter what, I can’t turn it up again. Did you figure out how to fix your rogue remote? 12/27/2015 Tammie Johnson Reply I need to know why everyday at midnight all the apps on my apple tv sign themselves out then i have to go through the process of signing in 1 by 1.

Just started doing it last night. 04/04/2016 Mako27 Reply Recently I’ve had problems with freezing or jerky video when using you tube on the latest Apple TV. This has occurred with both Wi Fi and when directly connected to the router. The problem I’ve found can be temporarily fixed by restarting the unit but it usually occurs again a short time later. Other streaming channels such as Netflix do not seem to have this problem and operate normally. Is any one else having this problem and if so is there a fix? 04/09/2016 geodorse Reply this article is so bad. 05/02/2016 alan Reply anyone have a suggestion to fix my problem which is that after trying everything all i get on start up is the apple logo on screen centre?

Problems- .freezes image but still plays sound after a couple of minutes into a Netflix movie then I have to ff the movie a few seconds to correct it. . A quick streek or line appears for a second on the screen like a static surge, happens like every 10 minutes .sometimes a pop sound comes from speakers when using Apple 4 tv like electric surge spike. I have reset my Apple TV couple of times and software update but this has not fixed the problem. Anyone know how to fix this, maybe I should return it? 09/16/2016 Phillip Dahlenburg Reply My Apple TV is plugged in not wireless WHY does it take 3 to 4 hours to down load a movie???

ATV is great when it works well BUT there seems to be a serious lack of consistent QUALITY CONTROL. If it was properly made to quality standards, the many faults reported above wouldn’t happen. 11/24/2016 Nonie Sadletr Reply My Apple tv accepts commands for example to play back an Iview program but within a few minutes or even seconds it reverts to the beginning. Now this happened again and again and again. The out of the blue I was able to watch a full program without interruption. 01/02/2017 Laura Reply I bought my Apple TV yesterday and it is not connecting. I am forever on a screen showing me breathtaking photos of the Bay Bridge and views of San Francisco. Has anyone had this problem? 01/12/2017 Nasir Reply Thanks a lot for describing the issue and solution in such detail. 01/14/2017 Terry Leahy Reply We have a weak internet connection. So it is possible to get iTunes videos downloaded and play them on my mac lap top – it just takes time. However if I try to play these using apple Air and apple TV it insists on taking me through the internet, and streaming the videos from iTunes. It treats the mac lap top version as a pirate edition and automatically refers me to the iTunes source – which I cannot get. I am sure this is to do with piracy issues as there is no problem with playing downloaded videos on my mac lap top from other sources with VLC and from my lap top through an ethernet cable to the apple TV and onto the TV screen like that. Basically this whole set up has been concocted to deal with internet piracy issues and makes the assumption that your internet connection is up to streaming live from the iTunes source. It isn’t here. We live in Newcastle, a major Australian city. I can see why young people download pirate editions of everything. It actually gives you a much more user friendly product than the one you get from iTunes. 03/10/2017 Adrian Reply Since the latest software update I’m constanly losing connection with my media server after 60min or so. Have to restart the Apple TV and then its all good for another 60min or so. Don’t seem to have this issue on the APTV3 tho but that unit has been jail broken. 05/14/2017 Murray Reply My problem is different to those discussed above. When I turn on the TV the General Screen appears showing the various options but I am unable to navigate beyond this opening screen. The remote does not appear to be working however when I press the volume control it displays on the screen and appears to still be managing volume control.. 05/22/2017 Stephen Berde Reply I have both a Roku and an Apple TV – I bought the Roku in Hawaii so I could stream Netflix etc – After using both, the ROku seems to work seamlessly where at home I can’t connect to Netflix with the Apple TV while the Roku connects all the time. Very disappointing as I’ve been an Apple fan. I/m impressed with the Roku for streaming and the Apple TV for music etc Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Problem Solving | 22 May 2017 | Print  | Comment (1) Never Be Late or Forget a Task Again with “Take Control of Calendar and Reminders” by Scholle McFarland [Tonya Engst here. Little is more embarrassing than showing up late for a meeting or missing an important deadline due to forgetfulness. The go-to solution for Apple users is to offload your fallible human memory to Apple’s Calendar and Reminders apps, which are built into macOS and iOS. But even worse than forgetting a meeting or task is messing up due to a misconfiguration or misunderstanding in Calendar and Reminders. Been there, done that. These apps are the focus of the first Take Control book to be published since we sold the series: Scholle McFarland’s $10 “Take Control of Calendar and Reminders.” It’s a classic Take Control title that explains all you need to know about real-world usage of these heavily used but under-documented apps. I helped Scholle develop and edit the book, learning a lot about Calendar and Reminders that I didn’t know along the way. To give you a taste of her advice, here’s a slightly modified excerpt from the troubleshooting chapter, which addresses a few common problems that can prevent you from using Calendar and Reminders successfully. Whether you’re suffering from one of these problems now, suspect that a family member is, or want to avoid future mishaps, read on for Scholle’s solutions to some common conundrums!] How Can I Change the Default Calendar for New Events on My Mac? -- If new events are showing up in the wrong calendar, choose Calendar > Preferences > General and then pick a calendar from the Default Calendar pop-up menu at the bottom of the preference pane. Now, whenever you create a new event, it will appear in this calendar automatically. Note that the default, Selected Calendar, adds new events to whatever calendar you last selected, which can produce some unexpected results. Why Do Events I Add with My iPhone End Up on the Wrong Calendar on My Mac? -- When you add events with an iPhone, you can use Siri or do it in the Calendar app. Either way, events are placed in your iPhone’s default calendar, so make sure you’ve designated the one you want to use. On your iPhone, tap Settings > Calendar > Default Calendar and choose the calendar you want from the list. How Do I Prevent Calendar Spam? -- It started in November 2016. Suddenly, Mac users were inundated with calendar spam — bogus event invitations from counterfeit companies hawking cut-rate Ray Bans, Ugg boots, and other supposed bargains, often in Chinese (see “How to Stop iCloud Calendar Spam,” 29 November 2016). Calendar spammers take advantage of the macOS and iOS feature that scans Mail messages for calendar invitations and then sends you a notification. What’s worse, if you click Accept, Decline, or Maybe, you notify the spammer that your account is real and ready for more. To prevent calendar spam, log in to iCloud.com, click Calendar, click the Settings icon (it’s a red gear), and choose Preferences > Advanced. Then, change the Receive Event Invitations radio button to Email To email address. Now, instead of appearing as notifications, calendar invitations will run through your email account, which undoubtedly checks for spam. You can also safely delete messages there without alerting the spammer. How Do I Remove Duplicate Events? -- If you open the Calendar app and your calendar is littered with duplicate events, try this: On the Mac, choose View > Refresh Calendars (or press Command-R). Or, on your iOS device, tap Calendars to see your list of calendars. Swipe down to refresh. If that doesn’t work, check whether you have an On My Mac calendar that is identical to one of your iCloud calendars. Hide it by deselecting it in the Calendars list and see if duplicates disappear. If they do, you can either keep this calendar hidden or delete the calendar altogether by Control-clicking its name in the Calendars list and choosing Delete. How Do I Delete Duplicate Birthdays? -- If Calendar’s special Birthdays calendar shows a birthday more than once, you can remove the extras. First, on the Mac, choose Calendar > Preferences > General. Deselect the Show Birthdays Calendar checkbox and select it again. If that doesn’t work, duplicate contacts are probably to blame. Open the Contacts app and choose Card > Look for Duplicates. If the app finds them, choose Merge. You may need to repeat this step. If some duplicate birthdays still appear in Calendar, go into Contacts and manually delete the stubborn duplicates that the app is unable to detect. Your duplicate birthdays should disappear. How Do I Get Rid of Duplicate iCloud Calendars? -- If identical iCloud calendars appear to be multiplying like bunnies, first try launching Calendar and choosing View > Refresh Calendars. If you are having trouble verifying whether two calendars have completely duplicated events, try making them different colors (Control-click a calendar in the Calendars list to pick a color). Deselect all other calendars in your Calendars list besides these two. Now you can scan more easily to check for non-duplicated events. If you find a non-duplicated event, move it to the calendar you want to keep. If you are sure you need to de-duplicate, log in to iCloud.com, click Calendar, and see if the duplicate calendars appear in the list there: If duplicates appear on the iCloud Web site: To be safe, go back to your Calendar app and make a backup of each of the affected calendars by selecting them in turn and choosing File > Export > Export to create calendar (.ics) files labeled with their names. Once that’s done, go to iCloud.com and delete the duplicate calendar(s) from the Web site, by clicking Edit at the bottom of the calendar list and then clicking the Remove button next to a calendar. A warning asks you if you’re sure. If you are, click Delete. Now, return to the app and refresh your calendars by pressing Command-R. Duplicates should disappear. If duplicates don’t appear on the iCloud Web site: That means the problem is on your end. Choose Calendar > Accounts, click iCloud, and deselect Calendars. Your iCloud calendars disappear from the Calendars list. Then, choose Calendar > Accounts, click iCloud, and select Calendars. As iCloud re-populates your calendar data, this time it should get it right. How Do I Move a Calendar to Another Computer? -- Here’s the beauty of cloud accounts such as iCloud or Google: your calendars show up on any other device that’s connected to that account, no effort required. If you use local On My Mac calendars, though, and want to move one to another computer, you must export a copy and then import it elsewhere. To export a calendar so you can move it to another computer, share it with someone else, or make a local backup: Select the calendar’s name in the Calendars list. Choose File > Export > Export. Choose a location and then click Export. The events are exported to a calendar (.ics) file. Here’s how to import a calendar (.ics) file: Create a new calendar that will hold this file’s events, or choose an existing calendar you want to add its events to. Make sure your choice is selected in the Calendars list. Choose File > Import. (You can import a calendar archive (.icbu) file with the File > Import command, but when you do, it replaces all of your current calendar and reminders information, so make sure you get a .ics file here.) Select the calendar file and then click Import. Alternatively, drag a calendar file from the Finder to the Calendar window to add its events to whichever calendar is selected in the Calendars list. How Can I Merge Calendars? -- If you were over-enthusiastic about making calendars, so long as they are stored in the same account (or are all in On My Mac), you can merge them after the fact. Select one of the calendars in the Calendars list and choose Edit > Merge Calendar. Calendars that you can add events to appear in the submenu. If you can’t merge the two calendars you want, instead consolidate them by exporting the contents of one and then importing it into another, as described earlier in this excerpt. Why Won’t My Calendar Show Maps or Travel Time? -- To see travel time related to a calendar event, you must turn on Location Services on the device where you are working with the event: Mac: Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy. Click Location Services, and then click the lock icon and enter your administrator name and password at the prompt. Click Location Services. Then, in the list to the right, select the checkbox next to Calendars. iOS: Open the Settings app, tap Privacy > Location Services, and turn on the Location Services switch. Still on the Location Services screen, tap Calendar and ensure that Never is not selected. With these settings on, Calendar can determine your approximate location using information from Wi-Fi networks, and if your device has cellular data turned on, from the cellular network. Apple asserts that this is collected in a way that won’t personally identify you. Why Can’t I See Any of My Reminders on My iPhone? -- If you’re faced with a blank screen when you try to check reminders on your iPhone or another of your iOS devices, you may be saving them to iCloud elsewhere, but not be using iCloud on this one. Tap Settings > Your Name > iCloud. Now tap iCloud and make sure the Reminders switch is On. How Can I Get an “On My Mac” Option? -- If you want to store a calendar or reminders list locally on your Mac, you need to choose On My Mac from the submenu when you create the calendar or list. If you don’t see that choice, and you don’t have an On My Mac heading in the app’s left-hand Calendars list or sidebar, you can solve the problem by turning off all accounts associated with calendars or reminders and then turning them back on. To see an On My Mac option in Calendars: Go to Calendar > Preferences > Accounts. Select each account listed there in turn and uncheck the Enable This Account box. Your account-based calendars disappear from the Calendars list — do not be alarmed! In fact, if they don’t disappear, try quitting and relaunching Calendar. Choose File > New Calendar and a new calendar appears in your Calendars list under the header On My Mac. If you want to view your account-based calendars in addition to your On My Mac calendar, return to Calendar > Preferences > Accounts and select those accounts’ Enable This Account box. To see an On My Mac option in Reminders: Choose Reminders > Accounts to open the Internet Accounts pane of System Preferences. For each account listed at the left, select it and then see whether the Reminders checkbox is selected. If it is, deselect it. Your account-based lists disappear from the Reminders sidebar — this is okay! An On My Mac option appears. Return to the Internet Accounts pane and for each account where you do want to view its reminders on your Mac, select its Reminders checkbox. Solving any one or the above described problems may put your calendaring and remembering system back on track.

By Zack Whittaker for Zero Day | May 23, 2017 -- 02:35 GMT (19:35 PDT) | Topic: Security Apple's new headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. (Image: file photo) Apple revealed late Monday that it has received at least one secret national security letter from the US government, demanding personal information on a customer. News of the order came from Apple's latest biannual transparency report, which disclosed it successfully had the secret subpoena "declassified". As with all national security letters, the order to turn over customer data includes a gag order, preventing the company or anyone else from disclosing the contents -- even to the customer in question. But the company didn't say when it received the letter, nor did it publish the order. When reached, a spokesperson did not provide comment. Provisions in the Freedom Act, passed in 2015 as an intelligence community reform effort after the Snowden revelations, compel the FBI to periodically review the gag orders that are attached to national security letters. That in part resulted in details of the letters becoming public for the first time, including challenges from Cloudflare, Facebook, Microsoft, and Yahoo. (Image: Apple transparency report) The company also disclosed as part of the report that it revealed a spike in demands for device data, and national security orders. The report said that US authorities sought to access the data on twice as many Apple devices in the last six months of last year than the first, despite submitting fewer overall requests. It adds that enforcement made 4,254 requests for data on 20,013 devices between July and December last year, up almost twofold from 4,822 requests for data on 10,260 devices during the January to June period. The company reported that it was to turn over data in over three-quarters of all cases, the same amount during the first half of the year. Apple also received between 5,750 and 5,999 national security orders affecting 4,750 to 4,999 accounts -- over double the figure reported during the first half of the year. As with all previous reports, the company confirmed it "has not received any orders for bulk data," typically associated with phone-based data collection. Apple and other companies are still subject to heavy reporting restrictions on national security requests.

Pushing its partnership with Apple, it is pushing out new bands for the Apple Watch Nike+ series. These bands, however, have a special trait, aside from their rugged good looks. They are designed to match the color and style of its new line of Air VaporMax running shoes which, in turn, are designed to match the colors of the sky from “Day to Night”. Casual runners and joggers don’t usually give a second thought to their running shoes. At least not until the issues of comfort and durability hits them hard. More seasoned and invested runners, however, go beyond just comfort and longevity. They also go for style. Nike’s new Air VaporMax running shoes “Day to Night” collection aims to offer just that. It has Nike’s world-famous Air cushioning technology underneath and the company’s new VaporMax Flyknit above. The name of the line comes from the fact that the four colors available from the collection represent the colors of the sky from dusk to dawn, from twilight, sunset, and everything in between. And soon you can have an Apple Watch band that does that too. Thew new Nike Sport Bands for the Apple Watch Nike+ models come in the same four shades of the new running shoes. That means you can choose from Arctic Pink, Violet Dust, Glacier Blue, Blue Orbit, and College Navy. Like other Nike-made bands, these straps are made with fluoroelastomer material and has holes for ventilation and sweat. The four new Nike Sports Bands become available starting June, from Nike and Apple stores, for $49. The bands will also be able to fit other Apple Watch models. The Day to Night shoes themselves go on sale around the same time for $190. Now bundles have been announced yet.

In 2014 it put out a guide on how such refugees can easily make the transition. In 2015, it put out its first ever Android app, even before Apple Music came out, and it was a much maligned “Move to iOS” app. Now it is presenting a more creative way to do that, with five ads that subtly hint at why you’d want to make the move and a revamped Switch site that puts those into words. The Switch site has actually been up for quite a while now but, before today, it focused simply on the Move to iOS app, on how to make the move from Android to iOS. This time, however, it is putting a heavier emphasis on why you’d want to make the switch anyway. Of course, there could be various reasons why, but Apple gives five concrete ones in five 16-second video clips. In typical Apple fashion, the facts are hidden behind humor. For example, there’s the matter of privacy. Apple’s position in light of the encryption and FBI debates has raised its profile in that area. It also promises not to sell your information to anyone, which cannot be said of other platform makers whose primary business is actually advertisement. iPhones are also claimed to be not just fast but faster. The numbers and tests do show that Apple’s A processors have some teeth, at least in certain scenarios. Of course, music is where Apple has always been good at traditionally. Despite its murder of the 3.5 mm headphone jack, it still pride itself in audio chops, both in terms of hardware as well as its vast collection of digital music. The iPhone was once regarded to have the best camera in town, but, lately that crown has been snatched from it and passed on to OEM after OEM. It’s been trying to recover that prestige, though, but it definitely has an uphill battle. Last but not least, Apple wants you to switch to the iPhone because it’s so easy to jump from Android to iPhone. In addition to the Move to iOS app, iOS would boast of a ton of apps that aren’t available on the other side. Then again, the reverse is also true in some cases.

At this stage, Amazon’s Alexa is so far ahead in the AI assistant game, it’s basically Beyonce to Google Assistant’s Kelly and Apple Siri’s Michelle. But if there’s one thing Apple has, it’s lots of money to throw at something to make it a success. And all the signs point to that something being a Siri-powered smart speaker to take on the Amazon Echo and Google's fledgling Home. Numerous patent filings have pointed to Apple working on a prototype for some time, and the latest rumours suggest an announcement could happen at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, better known as WWDC, which takes place in San Jose from June 5–9, 2017. How does Apple go about toppling Amazon from the top of the home automation tree? Here are six things it needs to do.  1) OUT-DESIGN THE COMPETITION The Amazon Echo and Google Home are perfectly acceptable little home hubs, but they respectively look like a Bluetooth Speaker and an air freshener. Apple's specialist subject on Mastermind is still product design, and we'd love to see its minimalist flair applied to a stunning piece of home furniture. In other words, something a lot better than its 'milk crate' iPod Hi-Fi from 2006.  Could it be donut-shaped, like the company’s new Silicon Valley headquarters? Perhaps there'll be a built-in screen to match the Amazon Echo Show? Or will it mirror the alluringly curvaceous form of the Mac Pro? Our money would be on the latter, but there's no doubt Apple's design has been hit-and-miss in recent years - so it'll need to rediscover its best form to trump the more established Echo and Home.  2) MAKE SOME SIRI-OUS IMPROVEMENTS It's easy to forget how far Apple's Siri was ahead of the voice assistant game when it launched with the iPhone 4S in 2011. Back then, being able to ask your phone for the weather was a neat trick, even if it did still embarrassingly start playing Chris Rea's 'Auberge' when you asked it for moussaka ingredients. These days, Google and Amazon have both leapfrogged Apple, and Siri lags behind the competition both in terms of voice recognition and the things it can do. Apple needs to give Siri a major update, and there's every reason to expect it will - the iPhone 8 will benefit from a revamped voice assistant in iOS 11, and Apple recently made some interesting bespoke Siri content for the Apple Watch. Voice assistants are shaping up to be the new capacitive touchscreens, so a Siri Speaker will need to do more than just play catch up to its rivals. 3) WORK SEAMLESSLY WITH HOMEKIT Some of our favourite Alexa tricks are asking her to turn up the heating, switch off lights, and voice control our home entertainment system. It's harder to do the same on the iPhone because HomeKit is still lacking wide support - for example, none of our smart home gear from Sonos, Hive or Logitech Harmony works with HomeKit. Apple needs to get this interconnectivity sorted if it's launching a smart speaker of its own. The Amazon approach, where manufacturers build an Alexa app or "skill", works well. The HomeKit method, meanwhile, sees Apple force certain standards on manufacturers to meet before they ship their product. Apple needs to start working with a wider selection of companies to make sure they work with the Siri Speaker at launch. 4) ARRIVE WITH AN AFFORDABLE SIBLING Apple would do well to offer a couple of Siri speaker options — one premium offering for those who want to use it to play music, and another for those who just want to use it as a way to interact with their smart home. Of course, the Apple advantage is that nearly every device it currently sells is both web-connected and has a microphone and speaker, so any improvements made to Siri for a dedicated speaker could also roll out to iPhones, iPads, Apple TVs and Macs. With Apple traditionally reluctant to take the entry-level route, this could be its solution to the ubiquity conudrum. 5) DELVE DEEPER INTO YOUR LIFE One thing Google does better than Apple is figuring out what you’re doing and providing you with context-sensitive information. For example, letting you know something you ordered is going to be delivered soon, or that your flight is running late, or that traffic is going to affect your journey. Apple’s Siri does some of this stuff, but not nearly as intelligently or comprehensively. Siri needs deeper links into your email and calendar (with users’ permission, of course) in order to start accessing that data, and then a better AI to make sense of the information. 6) WIDEN ITS MUSICAL TASTES OK, based on Apple’s previous form of locking you into its own services, this might be a stretch, but we hope the Siri Speaker plays nicely with more than just Apple Music. The Amazon Echo and Google Home both let you choose Spotify as the default player to respond to your "Play me some Iron Maiden" request, rather than just tying you to Amazon Music or Google Music.   Apple is likely to pair exclusively with Apple Music for its Siri Speaker, but we’d love to see more services offered, or at least connections to other speakers like Sonos — a feature we’ve been waiting for from the Amazon Echo for months.

Might as well make sure the colors match. The Apple Watch Nike+ already comes with exclusive Nike watch faces to get you in the mood to workout, and now you can match the color of your watch's band with your Nike running shoes. The four new Nike bands for the Apple Watch Nike+ correspond to colors in the Nike Air VaporMax running shoe line, including shades of black, pink, white, and blue. (The colors, according to Nike, are inspired by the different times of day at which people like to run). Each one costs $49, which is the same amount you can expect to spend on a regular sport band bought directly from Apple. Related The Best Fitness Trackers of 2017 The Best Fitness Trackers of 2017 The main difference between those bands and Nike-specific ones is perforation: both are made out of strong elastomer silicone, but the small holes in the Nike bands offer more ventilation during sweaty workouts. Existing Nike band color choices for the Apple Watch Nike+ include Black/Cool Gray, Black/Volt (neon yellow), Flat Silver/Volt, Flat Silver/White, and Space Gray/Volt. As for the watch itself, the differences between the regular one and the Nike edition are mostly limited to the Nike+ Run Club app, some custom virtual watch faces, and a small Nike+ symbol above the heart rate sensor on the back. The new bands go on sale starting on June 1 at Nike.com and some Nike retail stores, and they'll be available from Apple shortly thereafter. They're firmly in the impulse buy category, especially since—if you're a regular runner and Nike's claims of strength and flexibility ring true—they'll last a lot longer than it takes for you to wear out your pair of matching running shoes.

(KGO) -- Workers are putting the finishing touches on Apple's new state-of-the-art headquarters, years in the making. ABC7 News has a new look at the nearly completed futuristic campus. VIDEO: Sky7 over Apple Park in Cupertino EMBED More News Videos <iframe width="476" height="267" src="http://abc7news.com/video/embed/?pid=2024830" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> Sky7 flew over the new "Apple Park" campus that is nearly completed in Cupertino. It was the dream of the late Apple founder Steve Jobs - an office park that looks more like a nature refuge. On Monday, the complex is just about finished and a small number of employees have quietly moved in. Sky7 flew over the 175-acre site Monday afternoon. You can see the perfect circle design of the main building. The campus will be powered 100 percent by renewable energy. Sky7 spotted workers installing solar panels on the roof. Some of the park-like features are taking shape. A fraction of the campus' 9,000 trees have been planted and a giant fountain is under construction. The glass pavilion where you enter the Steve Jobs Theater looks to be mostly completed, although the actual auditorium is underground. That's where future Apple unveilings will be held. There are also tunnels, ones that take construction crews inside the ring, and ones that will allow employees to zip from one part of the campus to another. The move in process is just getting underway. It'll take months for all 13,000 employees will work there to get in. There will be a visitor center with an apple store and café open to the public.

Email | 22 May 2017 | Print  ExtraBITS for 22 May 2017 by TidBITS Staff In ExtraBITS this week, Apple has spent $200 million to buy a company whose engineering skills could improve Siri, Panic’s source code was stolen as a result of the HandBrake-carried malware, HomeKit support may be coming to Belkin’s Wemo line of home automation products, and the WannaCry ransomware pandemic has justified Apple’s fight with the FBI over user privacy. Apple Spends $200 Million on Lattice Data to Improve Siri -- Apple’s Siri was the first voice-driven assistant of its kind on the market, but in some ways, it is being overshadowed by Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant, and Microsoft’s Cortana. To boost Siri’s capabilities, Apple has acquired artificial intelligence company Lattice Data for $200 million, largely for the expertise of its 20 engineers. Lattice Data converts so-called “dark data” like free-form text and images into structured data that computers can understand and use in Siri’s responses. Read/post comments HandBrake Exploit Leads to Stolen Panic Source Code -- Panic co-founder Steven Frank has posted an embarrassing confession: after he inadvertently downloaded and installed a compromised version of HandBrake, hackers were able to steal source code to Panic’s apps. There’s no evidence that customer information, sync data, or Panic’s Web site were compromised. However, you should avoid downloading any Panic app that doesn’t come directly from Panic’s Web site or the Mac App Store, and Steven is asking users to report any unofficial versions that people see in the wild. Kudos to Panic for being so open about this and handling it quickly, and take this as a real-world lesson in why it’s important to stay alert when it comes to online security.

Now Belkin has reversed course, telling 9to5Mac, “Wemo is committed to bringing HomeKit support to our line of smart home solutions and will be providing more details soon.” Belkin didn’t say what caused the change of heart, but it’s possible that Apple will announce loosened HomeKit restrictions at WWDC. Read/post comments WannaCry Ransomware Vindicates Apple’s Battle with the FBI -- Last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook came under fire from the FBI for not providing a custom, vulnerable version of iOS so the agency could hack into the iPhone 5c used by one of the San Bernardino mass shooters. Cook refused, on the grounds that it would be impossible to keep any such back door out of the hands of criminals and other intelligence agencies. His stance has now been vindicated, as stolen NSA exploits released by the Shadow Brokers hacking group were used to spread the WannaCry ransomware throughout the world. WannaCry dominated headlines briefly by infecting more than 230,000 Windows-based computers in 150 countries in 24 hours, affecting major companies and even Britain’s National Health Service.

This is according to the newly leaked photos of what appears to be cases for the Apple tablets.  This Monday, two leakers shared pictures of cases for the 2017 iPad Pro models. The cases are very similar in design and all other aspects. The only difference between the two is their size. Once case is for the highly anticipated 10.5-inch iPad Pro, while the other is for the larger 12.9-inch iPad Pro.  In the images that were leaked by tech journalist Shai Mizrachi via Twitter, a 9.7-inch iPad Pro is placed inside the case for the 10.5-inch case. This gives the idea that the new iPad entry will have the same width as the 9.7-inch tablet. Apple may have simply designed the new tablet to be longer than the already existing line. According to Mizrachi, a Chinese case factory has already begun manufacturing the 10.5-inch iPad case. This could mean that Apple is preparing for the imminent release of the new iPad.  READ: iPhone 8 leaked presentation shows Touch ID sensor placement  Another leaker, named Benjamin Geskin, shared a couple of snaps showing cases for both the 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch iPad models. In the pictures he shared, it is very noticeable that there are small circular cutouts at the top of tablet cases’ back. The cutouts are almost flush with the holes for the camera on the upper left-hand corner of the cases. The new positioning of the microphones is said to be similar to that of the $329 budget-friendly iPad. The existing Pro models have their mics on the sides, as pointed out by AppleInsider.  The leaked cases also confirm the rumored four-speaker system of the upcoming iPads. Apparently, when viewing the top and bottom of the cases, one can spot four long cutouts for the speakers. The cutouts at the top are shorter than the two long cutouts surrounding the Lightning port at the bottom. If true, the new tablets will come with the same stereo audio system as the iPhone 7 and the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Geskin also claimed on Twitter that Apple will not be releasing a new iPad mini this year. This fuels the rumor that the Cupertino giant could be phasing out the mini series of tablets entirely due to poor sales. Apple has yet to release an refresh to the mini series. The line was last updated in 2015. READ: Apple, Visa sued over patents violated by Apple Pay Meanwhile, Geskin has shared some details on the specifications of the 10.5-inch iPad Pro. According to him, this tablet will not be bezel-less. However, it will have minimal bezels on the sides. Geskin claimed the side bezels will measure only 7 mm, while the top and down bezels will measure 19 mm. He also stated that the device will sport a physical home button. For renders of the new iPads, he shared a link to Troy Thompson’s iDropNews article that contains pictures of the tablets.  MacRumors reports that production of the 10.5-inch iPad is already ramping up, so the device could debut at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference this June. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is also expected to be introduced at the same event.    New information about the next-generation iPads have been uncovered through leaked photos of tablet cases.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple Reports Second Quarter Results CUPERTINO, California — May 2, 2017 — Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2017 second quarter ended April 1, 2017. The Company posted quarterly revenue of $52.9 billion and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $2.10. These results compare to revenue of $50.6 billion and earnings per diluted share of $1.90 in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 65 percent of the quarter’s revenue. “We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’ve seen great customer response to both models of the new iPhone 7 (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition and we’re thrilled with the strong momentum of our Services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter. Looking ahead, we are excited to welcome attendees from around the world to our annual Worldwide Developers Conference next month in San Jose.” Apple also announced that its Board of Directors has authorized an increase of $50 billion to the Company’s program to return capital to shareholders and is extending the program timeframe by four quarters.  Under the expanded program, Apple plans to spend a cumulative total of $300 billion by the end of March 2019. “We generated strong operating cash flow of $12.5 billion and returned over $10 billion to our investors in the March quarter,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “Given the strength of our business and our confidence in our future, we are happy to announce another $50 billion increase to our capital return program today.” As part of the latest update to the program, the Board has increased its share repurchase authorization to $210 billion from the $175 billion level announced a year ago. The Company also expects to continue to net-share-settle vesting restricted stock units. The Board has approved a 10.5% increase to the Company’s quarterly dividend, and has declared a dividend of $0.63 per share of the Company’s common stock, payable on May 18, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 15, 2017. From the inception of its capital return program in August 2012 through March 2017, Apple has returned over $211 billion to shareholders, including $151 billion in share repurchases. The Company plans to continue to access the domestic and international debt markets to assist in funding the program. The management team and the Board will continue to review each element of the capital return program regularly and plan to provide an update on the program on an annual basis. Apple is providing the following guidance for its fiscal 2017 third quarter:   revenue between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38.5 percent operating expenses between $6.6 billion and $6.7 billion other income/(expense) of $450 million tax rate of 25.5 percent Apple will provide live streaming of its Q2 2017 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PDT on May 2, 2017 at www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/. This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately two weeks thereafter.

In terms of design we’re not sure what to expect – could it be that Apple will stick to the current iPad Pro design? Or will the new iPad Pros start to adopt some of the rumored iPhone 8’s design features? According to a tweet by Benjamin Geskin, maybe not. Geskin’s tweet claims that the new iPad Pro will not be adopting a bezel-less design and that the home button will still be present. This means that for all intents and purposes, the new iPad Pros should look similar to their predecessors and that the changes will most likely be under the hood. iPad Pro 10.5′ WON’T be bezel-less. Still bezels. Still home button. 7mm side bezels. 19mm up & down. (approx) Render coming soon — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) May 22, 2017 We suppose that’s not the worst thing to hear, plus we can only assume that Apple would want to keep the iPhone 8’s design features a secret (or as much as possible) before the reveal. Another tweet by Geskin also revealed alleged cases for the iPad Pro, both the 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch models. What’s interesting about these cases is the camera cutout which seems to be similar to what we’ve seen with the iPhone 8, but some have speculated that this is to make room for one camera lens and one flash unit, as opposed to the iPad Pros sporting a dual camera system. Either way take it with a grain of salt and check back with us in a couple of weeks where hopefully we’ll have the details to share. 2017 iPad Pro 10.5′ & iPad Pro 12.9′ cases.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Is Apple losing the ‘influencer’ battle? Anthony Caruana 23 May, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News One of the perks of my job is the opportunity to travel and meet and work with interesting people. Last week, I was a guest at a conference run by a company called Veeam (in New Orleans). Its focus was on backup, recovery and system availability for companies running virtualisation and cloud software. For most of the last decade, one the one things that has stood out is the number of journalists using Macs. Given that Apple boasts less than 10 percent of global PC sales according to market research company IDC, the Mac is well and truly over-represented in the press-rooms I frequent across the world. But that seems to be changing. The press-room I am sitting in now has 12 tables, each with five or so people sitting and working. There are perhaps five Macs in the room and a couple of iPads. Everyone else is running a Windows PC with the vast majority using Windows 10, and at least half the room has a computer with a touchscreen. Technology journalists aren’t always representative of the broader community. We get access to the latest technology and can call on vendor experts when we hit difficulty. But what I’ve observed over the last few months is a turning of the tide. More journalists are turning away from their Macs and prefer using Windows. I think there are a few reasons for this. Apple’s hardware advantage has been diminished. It set the bar for exceptional build quality and the Windows market has responded with some very nice hardware. One the software side, Microsoft has managed to create a very consistent experience for those flicking between desktops, notebooks and tablets. On the other hand, Apple’s approach of splitting iOS and macOS results in users needing to change how they work when they move between devices. For those who only use one computer it’s not a big deal, but as someone who travels extensively and has a desktop Mac for the office, I find it jarring when something I do with an app on one device doesn’t work the same way on another device. Then there’s the question of choice. Apple’s product strategy has always been based around a limited number of options. Remember Steve Jobs’ famous product strategy? Two types of computer (pro and consumer) and two form factors (desktop and laptop) giving rise to four distinct categories. That has expanded over recent years but it’s still nowhere near what you can find on the Windows side of town. With Windows, I can spend between $350 to $4000 on a computer with screen sizes between 11 inches all the way up to over 30 inches in size. I can choose a case in almost any colour, made from a variety of materials and, in many instances, I can elect to have a touchscreen. Apple’s biggest advantage has always been the fusion between hardware and software. Because it controls the ‘whole widget’ it can ensure things are optimised to work together. Microsoft has done a lot of work to educate computer manufacturers so that they make their computers more reliable and less dependent on the drivers that control how various hardware components work. I think many of these factors are coalescing and people who rely on their computers for their livelihood are starting to take notice. As a result, more of them are shifting towards Windows systems. Journalists are considered ‘influencers’ by the public relations industry. And many PR agencies engaged by computer manufacturers are working hard to change the perception that journalists bought Macs because they ‘just work’. I wonder if what I’m seeing in the press-room this week is indicative of what’s coming next for the Mac.

It's just the way of the world - some people simply aren't as loyal to a mobile platform as fanboys think they should be. So there are humans out there who switch from iOS to Android, and vice versa. As you'd expect, Apple is happy to cater to the latter category. In fact, it's got a whole page on its website dedicated to luring Android users to its mobile operating system and iPhones. It's called Switch and it's received a big revamp today. The new site tells Android users that "Life is easier on iPhone", and provides them with details about how to switch and what to expect. Apple says downloading its Move to iOS app from the Google Play Store and letting it do its thing will ensure that your switch is as painless as possible. You can use this app to take stuff like photos, videos, contacts, calendars, mail accounts, message history, and free apps (including Google's) with you on the other side. Apple is also quick to stress that more pictures are captured by an iPhone today than any other camera in the world. As for performance, the slide above explains things. The Switch site also focuses on detailing how your privacy is a priority for Apple, and it plugs the Messages app too. It doesn't forget to mention its "award-winning support team" either, or the fact that you can easily switch to an iPhone in an Apple Store. To really drive the point home, Apple reveals that iPhones have "industry-leading" satisfaction rates. And once you've scrolled all the way down, you can immediately buy one of the currently sold iPhone models online. You may even get up to $260 in credit towards that purchase if you trade in an eligible device. A new, related ad campaign has debuted today as well, with five different videos already available from Apple's official YouTube account. They're grouped under the "Why Switch" moniker, and you can watch them all in this playlist (linked because embedding playlists isn't working at the moment).

Ugreen’s latest Apple Watch accessory is a portable stand that can be adjusted to rest at a 45-degree angle to easily accommodate an Apple Watch with a closed-loop band installed. Featuring an integrated magnetic inductive charging disk and built-in 4-foot USB cable, Ugreen’s $55 charger is ready to go out of the box, as long as you have access to a USB port that delivers the necessary power. The best wireless keyboard for the Mac? We previously went hands-on with another Ugreen product, the Power Bank, but that unit was designed to work as a portable battery-powered option. The Power Bank wasn’t very ideal for closed-loop bands, although one could make it work simply by removing the lugs from the Apple Watch to allow the charger to make contact with the inductive surface on the watch’s rear. This charging stand, on the other hand, loses the convenience of a built in battery, but gains the convenience of a charger that can be adjusted to various angles. In all, the unit can pivot up to 45-degrees, which is enough to accommodate almost any Apple Watch band, and ensures that the charger plays nice with watchOS’ Nightstand mode. Video walkthrough Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube now The Portable Magnetic Charger comes with a lengthy 4-foot integrated USB cable with a built-in cable management strap. It also features a tacky bottom surface to help prevent slippage on a desk or night stand. Some may deem the $55 asking price to be too high, but you have to consider that the unit comes with an inductive charger pre-installed. That alone is worth nearly $30. All in all, the Ugreen Portable Magnetic Charger is a solid, if not a tad pedestrian, Apple Watch accessory. I wish it came with a built-in battery, but I understand that Ugreen is marketing a separate product to handle that need. How do you currently go about charging your Apple Watch? Would you consider using a similar third-party charger?

The Chorale’s 2016-2017 musical road trip continues with A Musical Bite of the Big Apple: From Broadway to Bernstein, celebrating American classics and the New York composers who created them. “The concert will begin with the traditional side of New York,” explains Artistic Director/Conductor John Sutton. One of the classic pieces, The Promise of Living by Aaron Copeland is one Sutton describes as “hopeful,” and “really captures America.” Also in the first half are Harlem Songs by composer Gwyneth Walker, who has taken three poems by Langston Hughes and set them to song. Her works combined with the words of Hughes will transport audiences to a hot summer night in the city. Harlem Songs is “a true celebration of the culture of Harlem” adds Sutton. “You can’t go to New York without Leonard Bernstein, who captured the sound of the American spirit” says Sutton. The chorale will be performing the notable Chichester Psalms as well as a medley of songs from his Broadway musical, West Side Story. Also on the program are works by Dvorak, Irving Berlin, Duke Ellington, Billy Joel and Stephen Sondheim. Audiences will be in for a special treat, as Philip Crowley, the on-air voice of Shark Tank on ABC will be the concert storyteller. He will act as a narrator and tour guide, adding a unique opportunity for the audience to fully immerse themselves in the musical journey. Mark your calendars for June 10th, and join Angeles Chorale for A Musical Bite of the Big Apple. Says Executive Director, Jeffrey Shapiro, about the concert “a tremendous way to close the season, the eclectic repertoire of Bernstein to Broadway is sure to please.” A Musical Bite of the Big Apple: From Broadway to Bernstein will be performed on Saturday, June 10th, at 7:30 p.m. at First United Methodist Church (500 East Colorado Blvd., Pasadena). Tickets are $30 if purchased in advance online, or $35 at the door. Group discounts available at www.angeleschorale.org or (818) 591-1735.

The company, which has a long history of working with Apple and even recently partnered with the company to create a specific version of the Apple Watch for runners, has unveiled a new collection of Apple Watch bands. These bands are unique in that they match or correspond with pairs of new Nike trainers. The collection, called Day to Night, features four different colours of sport bands. Each band has perforated holes, presumably to help with airflow while you sweat. There's nothing else remarkable about them. They don't glow at night or do anything to help you transition from day to night. Nike only said that the colours were "inspired by a shade of the sky, from dawn to dusk" - and they allow runners to "make a statement by matching their Apple Watch Nike+ bands to their footwear". Is Apple testing an Apple Watch device that tracks blood sugar? Apple and Nike made a new Apple Watch called NikeLab and it's limited Asus might never make another ZenWatch Android Wear watch The new bands will be available from 1 June for $49 (about £38) each via Nike.com or in Nike stores. Apple.com will also carry them from “early June.” Obviously, you have to buy the trainers separately. They’ll go on sale at the same time for $190 (about £146 a pair). There's no word yet on UK pricing, but we'll let you know when we know for sure. There also doesn't seem to be any bundle discounts. See our Apple Watch Nike+ guide for more details about the watch.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Woman airlifted after crash on Deep Creek Road Monday Monday May 22, 2017 at 4:04 PM May 22, 2017 at 4:04 PM Paola Baker Staff Writer @DP_PaolaBaker APPLE VALLEY — A woman trapped in her vehicle after a crash on Deep Creek Road suffered major injuries Monday afternoon, authorities said. The crash, which occurred near the intersection of Deep Creek and Rock Springs roads, was reported at 2:36 p.m. Monday. While specific details are still forthcoming, Apple Valley Fire Protection District investigator Brian Pachman said two vehicles were involved and one driver was airlifted to a trauma center after being extricated from the vehicle. California Highway Patrol Officer Robert Grieve said the crash involved a black Ford SUV and a gray Nissan Altima, both only occupied by their drivers. Specifics on how the crash occurred weren’t yet available, but the driver of the Altima became trapped in the driver’s seat from the impact, Grieve said. AVFPD firefighters successfully freed the driver, but she suffered major injuries and was airlifted to Loma Linda University Center for treatment, AVFPD Battalion Chief James Peratt said. The driver of the Ford suffered minor injuries. He was taken to a local hospital as a “precautionary measure,” Peratt said. No other injuries were reported. The crash knocked down a light signal pole close to the intersection, Pachman said, and the northbound lane of Deep Creek Road was shut down as authorities investigated the scene. CHP logs indicated a county roads unit was requested to repair the pole. Traffic was reported to be backed up following the incident, but Peratt said traffic was flowing in both directions as of 3:45 p.m. Monday. The crash remains under investigation by the Victorville CHP office. Paola Baker may be reached at 760-955-5332 or PBaker@VVDailyPress.com. Follow her on Twitter at @DP_PaolaBaker.

But supporters of the measure still considered it a victory — however small. Preliminary counts of Twitter investors’ ballots indicate that the proposal, which asked investors to back a study on how Twitter might allow its users to buy the company, indicate the measure failed to gain a majority of votes. This was expected. What supporters were less sure about was whether the proposal could hit 3 percent, the threshold at which the measure would be allowed to be resubmitted next year. The aptly hashtagged #BuyTwitter initiative got 4 percent of shareholder votes, according to Jim McRitchie, the shareholder advocate who got the measure on the ballot. Latest business videos McRitchie said after the meeting that he had spoken with CEO Jack Dorsey and members of Twitter’s investor relations team about how to move forward with the initiative. Despite ardent opposition from Twitter’s board of directors, Dorsey on Monday seemed “interested” in learning more, McRitchie said. Patents Apple, Visa face lawsuit A small Boston company, founded by the inventor of a popular corporate encryption technology called RSA SecurID, sued Apple and Visa on Sunday, arguing that the Apple Pay digital payment technology violates its patents. The lawsuit, filed by Universal Secure Registry in U.S. District Court in Delaware, says that CEO Kenneth Weiss received 13 patents for authentication systems that use a smartphone, biometric identification such as a fingerprint and the generation of secure one-time tokens to conduct financial transactions. In the suit and in an interview, Weiss said he had extensive meetings in 2010 with Visa officials, including its chief executive at the time, to discuss working together on the technology. In the interview, he said that Visa had signed a 10-year nondisclosure agreement to gain access to the technology and assigned engineers to fully understand the details, but then dropped further communication without securing a license. Weiss said he also wrote to Apple at the same time seeking to license his technology, but the iPhone maker never responded. Three years later, Visa began work on the Apple Pay technology with Apple, MasterCard and American Express. Apple released Apple Pay to iPhone users in 2014. Although Apple has heavily promoted Apple Pay as an alternative to paying with a credit card, it has not gained popularity with consumers or merchants. Users enroll a credit card on their phone, then touch a finger to the iPhone’s Touch ID sensor to pay a merchant who has installed a wireless terminal that can receive a signal from the phone. Universal Secure Registry did not seek a license agreement or royalties from Apple or Visa after the release of Apple Pay. Weiss said the law firm representing his company, patent specialists Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, advised him to file the suit first. Apple declined to comment on the suit. Visa did not respond to a request for comment. Banking Citigroup unit in settlement For years, Citigroup employees feared that millions of dollars the bank was moving to Mexico might be suspicious. Yet in many cases, the bank did not alert regulators or step up its monitoring for money laundering, federal prosecutors said Monday. Even as Citigroup unit Banamex USA was growing to dominate remittances from the United States to Mexico, the bank did not properly safeguard its systems from being infiltrated by drug money and other illicit funds, prosecutors said. On Monday, Citigroup agreed to pay $97.4 million to settle a long federal investigation into Banamex. In exchange, the Justice Department will not file criminal charges against the bank in connection with inadequate oversight of Banamex USA, which is from Southern California. As part of the agreement, Banamex USA “admitted to criminal violations by willfully failing to maintain an effective anti-money-laundering” compliance program, the Justice Department said. The deal represents the first such agreement between a major bank and the Justice Department under Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

There were a range of new features announced that look to improve the user experience, so what does Apple need to offer with iOS 11 to compete? We’ve outlined some of the key new additions to Android O, along with features that Apple should implement into iOS 11 to compete. Read next: iOS vs Android What’s new in Android O? So, what does Android O bring to the table? While none are ground-breaking features, Android O brings a handful of useful changes to Google’s operating system. Picture-in-Picture One of the announcements made at Google I/O 2017 was the addition of picture-in-picture, a feature already used not only in Google’s YouTube app, but also in iOS. Picture-in-Picture was introduced for iPad users along with iOS 9, allowing users to minimise the video and perform other tasks while still being able to watch. Google O’s implementation of picture-in-picture works much the same as it does on iOS; with a video playing, Android users need only tap the Home button and the video will pop into a small window that remains on-screen while you use other apps. You can slide the video around for the best placement or swipe it off-screen to end the video. Notification Dots While users of custom Android launchers have had access to notification badges for years, Google has never officially offered it – until now. Much like with app badges on iOS, you’ll see a small ‘dot’ that appears on top of your app icon when you receive a notification on Android O. What is different to iOS is what you can do with it; as well as being able to tap on the app to open it and interact with the notification, you can also long-press the icon to get a short list of actions to perform. This includes the ability to view the notification without opening the app via a small on-screen pop-up that looks like the 3D Touch shortcut menu on iOS, but more notification-based. Smart Text Selection Basic text selection tools have been around for quite some time and have largely remained unchanged. More recent iterations of Android and iOS have introduced formatting to applicable text, but not much else. That was until Google announced Smart Text Selection, which uses Google’s AI to intelligently analyse what is being selected, and provides you with contextual shortcuts. Say, for example, you highlight a phone number – it’ll offer you a shortcut to dial the number. Similarly, highlighting an address will provide a shortcut to begin navigation using Google Maps. It’s not just smart suggestions either, as the highlighting process will also be more intelligent, selecting full phrases and addresses instead of single words. Auto-Fill Android O isn’t about one headline feature, instead it’s about addressing a number of smaller issues within the operating system. One such addition is Auto-Fill. It’s not going to bring iOS users over to the dark side, but it should make Android users lives a little bit easier. For the most used apps on your Android device, Android O will help you quickly log in. Although support needs to be manually added by developers, once supported, Android O will remember usernames and passwords to quickly log into apps on your device. Vitals Vitals isn’t one feature, but is instead a suite of tools that helps to improve the performance and security of your Android device. It includes Google Play Protect, which acts similarly to a virus scanner for Android apps and scans your apps for malicious content. It also includes Wise Limits, which prevents apps from running in the background for too long and helps to make your battery last longer. Google claims that the improvements have halved the boot time of the company’s Pixel smartphone, and that apps run faster too. Read more: iPhone 7 Plus vs Google Pixel XL | iPhone 7 vs Google Pixel Tidier UI As well as the above features (and a long list of tiny tweaks), Android O presents a cleaner version of Android – especially in the Notification Shade and Settings app. Although there aren’t dramatic differences in what’s on offer, it’s often the smaller changes that are most appreciated (like when Apple changed the font in iOS 9). What does Apple need to offer in iOS 11 to compete with Android O? While Apple isn’t showcasing iOS 11 until WWDC in June 2017, here’s what we think iOS 11 needs to offer in order to compete with Google’s Android O. Improvements to the Notification Center The Notification Center was originally introduced alongside iOS 5, although what was initially introduced is worlds away with what is on offer in iOS 10, including the Today view with third-party Widgets. While it has seen improvements year-on-year, we feel like it could use a bit of an upgrade, namely with the way that it handles notifications. Notifications in iOS 10 are a mess. While you used to have the ability to group (and clear) notifications based on app, iOS 10 removed the option. Instead, you can only sort notifications by newest first, meaning those that receive many notifications (from games, social networks, etc) may miss important text messages or emails. Compare this to the Notification Shade in Android O: it’s clean, and the notifications are automatically grouped by app. You can split the group notification into single notifications to interact with a specific one, or you can clear them all with a single swipe. It’s so simple and intuitive, and it’s something that Apple fans are calling for in iOS 11. UI improvements – or at least the fabled Dark Mode iOS hasn’t seen a major redesign since iOS 7, which introduced Apple’s mobile system to a world of bold shapes and colours. While Apple’s operating system doesn’t necessarily look ugly, it has looked essentially the same since 2013, and some argue that it’s due for another facelift. Couple that with the fact that the iPhone is 10 years old this year, and we think Apple could be planning something big. If it’s not an overhaul of the look and feel of iOS, we imagine Apple will finally announce the fabled Dark Mode, a feature rumoured to be coming to iOS soon. Ability to change default apps The main argument in the iOS vs Android war is “Android allows for more customisation than iOS” and for the most part, that’s true. Android users can change the launcher of their smartphones, allowing for a completely different look to what Google envisioned. It’s not just in terms of visuals either: Android users can select different default apps, they aren’t locked into the default Google apps like iOS users are with Apple’s first-party apps like Maps and Mail. When an iOS user clicks on an email address in Safari, it’ll open in Mail and there’s nothing they can do about it. It’s a similar story with addresses – it’ll open Apple Maps, even if you use Google Maps or Waze more often. While we don’t want Android-esque launchers to be available in iOS 11, we’d love the ability to change the default apps that open. Because, let’s be honest Apple, nobody really uses the default Mail app. Augmented reality capabilities Okay, we admit this one is more of a ‘blue sky’ idea, but it’s worth mentioning. There are plenty of rumours floating around the internet at the moment that suggest Apple is interested in augmented reality, and is looking to implement the technology into iPhones sooner rather than later. With this being said, we envision an AR camera app being launched alongside iOS 11. Separate from the Camera app that is used to take photos and videos, the AR-focused Camera app would allow users to interact with their environment using AR, whether it be in the form of filters, navigation or getting more information on a product or place. The AR apps would work in a similar way to iMessage apps introduced in iOS 10: it would be its own platform with a range of apps to use specifically within the AR Camera app. At the very least, it should open the world of augmented reality to traditional smartphone app developers, and could serve as the building blocks for Apple’s AR glasses (if/when they ever appear).   Read next: How private is your iPhone data, and how to protect your privacy OUR VERDICT Android O offers decent improvements to the Android experience, but we'll have to wait and see what Apple announces at WWDC 2017 before we deliver any kind of verdict.

As sales skyrocketed, even Apple executives were taken aback the iPad’s popularity, with the device quickly becoming the fastest-selling product in consumer electronics history. A few years later, iPad sales not only began tapering off, but declining substantially. In a relatively short amount of time, the narrative surrounding the iPad shifted from “the iPad is the future of computing” to “how can Apple save the iPad?” As a quick example, Apple last quarter sold 8.92 million iPads, the first time quarterly sales checked in below 9 million units since 2011. Don't Miss: Exclusive: The world’s first look at Apple’s final iPhone 8 design in real life Undeterred, Tim Cook remains confident that there’s a lot of room for the iPad to return to growth. Looking ahead, there are strong rumors that Apple at WWDC this year will unveil a brand new iPad Pro with a 10.5-inch edge-to-edge display packed into a form factor no larger than the current 9.7-inch iPad model. Earlier today, new images purporting to be cases for the aforementioned 10.5-inch iPad Pro and a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro surfaced online via Benjamin Geskin. The leaked images show a four-speaker design, a lightning port, and interestingly enough, a vertical camera orientation similar to what we’ve seen on various iPhone 8 leaks. As for other details surrounding the 10.5-inch iPad Pro model, Geskin relays that it won’t be completely bezel-less. iPad Pro 10.5' WON'T be bezel-less. Still bezels. Still home button. 7mm side bezels. 19mm up & down. (approx) Render coming soon — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) May 22, 2017 7mm bezels all around the device will certainly be sleek, but not as sleek as the iPhone 8 with its reported 4mm bezels. Also of note is that Apple’s new iPad models will incorporate the same static home button originally introduced on last year’s iPhone 7. Additionally, Geskin relays that there will be no new iPad Mini this year, corroborating our exclusive report from last week claiming that Apple will be discontinuing the iPad Mini amid disappointing sales. Some have suggested that Apple releasing larger-screened iPhone models in 2014 with the iPhone 6 and 6s made the iPad Mini form factor less compelling.

They're eerily familiar to anyone who remembers the Get a Mac campaign. If you happened to be browsing Apple's YouTube channel on Monday afternoon, you'd be forgiven for checking your calendar to make sure it wasn't May 2006, the month that Apple released the first TV spots in its Get a Mac ad campaign starring John Hodgman and Justin Long. The videos Apple uploaded on Monday have little to do with Macs and PCs, nor do they feature edgy comedians, but their theme is eerily familiar: Android devices are slow, insecure, and bad at doing common tasks like taking photos or playing music, so you should Get an iPhone. In one of the 15-second clips, a man on the left-hand side of the frame is seen struggling to play a grand piano under a "your phone" banner. After someone comes up behind him to push the piano to the right-hand side of the frame, beneath an iPhone banner, he suddenly becomes a virtuoso. Related The Best Phones of 2017 The Best Phones of 2017 In another clip, a man reading some important-looking documents walks over to the iPhone banner to escape the prying eyes of the person reading over his shoulder beneath the "your phone" banner, suggesting that other phones leave your personal information at risk. In yet another, a man is stuck running in slow motion until he reaches the iPhone banner, where he's able to sprint. You get the idea. For smartphone early adopters or Apple fans, watching the videos brings back memories not only of the Get a Mac campaign, but also of Apple's epic court battle with Samsung over whether or not Android-powered phones stole intellectual property from Apple. That battle is still ongoing, but just like in the PC world, where macOS plays second fiddle to Windows, Apple's iOS is far behind Google's open-source Android smartphone operating system in terms of users. That's not to say that the iPhone 7 isn't still an extremely coveted handset, but Apple's new Get an iPhone clips show that the company is trying to convince Android users of the errors of their ways. Good luck with that: just 11 percent of Android users who bought a new device last year switched to an iPhone.

Google launched the plan last month. Although there is now an iOS YouTube TV app, there is still no tvOS version for the Apple TV. Read: Streaming vs. Live TV: Teens Spend Significantly More Time On YouTube, Netflix Than Traditional Media The iOS app was made available Monday and supports Apple’s AirPlay feature, which means YouTube TV content can be seen on the Apple TV when both an iOS device and the Apple TV are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Airplay offers an alternative for YouTube TV subscribers. The YouTube TV plan is priced at $39.99, offering another option for cable cord-cutters. The streaming service includes channels: ABC, CBS, The CW, FOX, NBC, Big Ten Network, CBS Sports Network, Comcast RSN (regional), ESPN, ESPN, ESPNews, ESPNU, Fox RSN (regional), FS1, FS2, Golf Channel, NBCSN, SEC Network, AMC, Bravo, Chiller, E!, Freeform, FX, FXM, FXX, Nat Geo, Nat Geo Wild, Oxygen, SyFy, Universal HD, USA, YouTube Red Originals, CNBC, Fox Business, Fox News, MSNBC, Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD and Sprout.

The service allows for three streams simultaneously under one plan. YouTube TV is limited to Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia and the San Francisco Bay Area. The iOS app for YouTube TV comes as rumors suggest the Amazon Prime Video app will come to the Apple TV. The app could be introduced next month at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference. Amazon is also expected to start reselling the Apple TV. The company had stopped selling the Apple TV and Google’s Chromecast devices in 2015. YouTube TV service is competing with other streaming plans, including Netflix, HBO Now, Amazon Video and skinny bundles, such as Sling TV and DirecTV Now. The streaming plan is especially going head-to-head with Hulu’s live TV service. The streaming company made deals with 21st Century Fox, ABC, NBC, CBS, Turner Networks, A+E Networks and Scripps Networks for its $39.99 service.

Now, in an effort to coerce an even greater number of “switchers,” Apple today rolled out a brand new marketing campaign designed to convince seasoned Android users that it might be time to jump ship. Don't Miss: If this leaked iPhone 8 case is real, we have some good news and bad news Apple now has a new and dedicated switcher-oriented page on its website where it explains why life is easier on the iPhone. The page covers the usual bases, with Apple assuring potential Android switchers that it’s extremely easy to migrate all of their important data over to the iOS universe. Apple also boasts that the camera on the iPhone is best in class while also touting the iPhone’s impressive performance, ease of use, built-in security mechanisms and more. “iPhone has industry-leading satisfaction rates,” the site adds, “in fact, 97 percent of people who have an iPhone say they love it.” Alongside the new switcher page, Apple also introduced a number of iPhone ads that have something of a nostalgic feel for the iconic and award-winning “I’m a Mac” adds featuring Justin Long and John Hodgman. Each ad, much like the “I’m a Mac” ads of yore, has a singular focus. So, for example, one ad focuses on Apple’s commitment towards privacy. Each ad is only about 15 seconds long, but they nonetheless convey that life in the Apple universe is more enjoyable and user-friendly.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Computers HP finally made the MacBook Air we’ve all been waiting for Chris Mills @chrisfmills May 22nd, 2017 at 6:30 PM Share Tweet Last fall, Apple confirmed that it’s sending the MacBook Air to the server farm upstate. Although it still sells the Air, the form factor hasn’t been updated since 2013, and the screen is equally antique. Apple suggests the non-Touch Bar MacBook Pro as the entry-level laptop for people who want a fully-featured laptop, but $1,500 is one hell of an entry-level price. So, it falls to other companies to fill the void that Apple’s left. Some of the premium Chromebooks are fantastic options for half the price of a MacBook Air, but Chrome OS is still lacking in features for some users. Luckily, HP has a new laptop you might want to take a look at. Don't Miss: Leaked tests show OnePlus 5 is much more powerful than Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel At an event today, HP announced a bunch of new premium Windows laptops. There’s three different sizes, but the one I’m most interested in is the smallest, the Envy 13. It’s a 13.3-inch laptop with 1080p or 4K display, all-metal body, Core i3, i5 and i7 processors, and four USB ports of various kinds. There’s also an option to equip discrete Nvidia graphics of some kind. The best thing is the price: $1,049 for the base option. If that comes with Intel’s latest Core i3 processor and 8GB of RAM, it’s a decently low price for a great-looking laptop. HP’s build and battery life has been stellar on the laptop range for the last few years; now that details like USB-C ports and thin bezels are being added, it means HP’s starting to challenge Microsoft and Apple in the premium laptop world. The Envy 13 should also fill the niche that the MacBook Air left behind quite neatly. It has enough power to handle any reasonable everyday computing task, (theoretically) a long enough battery to last a day, and a premium thin-and-light design that is easy enough to carry around. We’ll have to wait and see if the details like a good keyboard are also good, but things are looking promising. The entire new lineup of laptops goes on sale in June.

The company says that it held special events at all 495 Apple Stores around the world, and showed off photos from many of them (below). ‘Today at Apple’ kicked off this weekend with new in-store programming around the world, including Photo Walks and Kids Hour at all 495 Apple stores. From Getting Started with Coding to How To: Sketch, Draw and Paint with iPad, stores collectively hosted 4,000 sessions a day, including some with very special guests … NordVPN The company first spoke about the initiative just over a year ago, while previewing the San Francisco Union Square store, but it was only last month when we learned that it was to be a major focus. Retail head Angela Ahrendts discussed the plans with CBS, and tweeted about the launch yesterday. An amazing launch of #TodayatApple around the world! Huge thank you to everyone at Apple that made today happen. pic.twitter.com/JIO76jZvEF — Angela Ahrendts (@AngelaAhrendts) May 21, 2017 The microsite launched last week, when customers were able to book slots in upcoming events. In addition to the standard workshops, Apple invited a number of special guests to give performances and teach unique classes. Examples highlighted by the company, and featured in photos below, include: Customers use iPad Pro and Apple Pencil as they learn from master illustrator Todd Selby Movement artist and star of Apple’s AirPods commercial, Lil Buck, shows off his moves in the Forum at Apple Union Square Multiplatinum artist, songwriter and producer Charlie Puth gives an intimate performance at Apple Union Square Leon Bridges gives a soulful “Today at Apple” performance to end the day of sessions at Apple Union Square Dua Lipa performs an acoustic set of tracks from her upcoming album in London’s Regent Street store During a Live Art session with French illustrator mcbess at Apple Regent Street attendees share their own work following his signature style—graphic illustrations without color iPhone photographers cover two miles in 90 minutes as they seek out fashion-forward portraits with photographer Shingi Rice iPhone photographers hit the streets of Brooklyn for a portrait-themed Photo Walk with Timothy Mulcare Music Lab: 18-year-old Steve Lacy earned a Grammy nomination for his work with The Internet — producing it all on his iPhone Aspiring coders of all ages can learn how to code in Swift, Apple’s programming language for iOS and Mac apps Up-and-coming pop sensation, Sigrid, performs tracks off her debut “Don’t Kill My Vibe” EP at Apple Marché Saint-Germain Check out the photo gallery below.

Straits Times reports that the ground floor is used to display both main products and accessories, while the focus of the upper floor is on space for the company’s Today at Apple creative sessions … NordVPN The paper says that one of the photos sees staff being briefed prior to the grand opening on Saturday. MyAppleSingapore has additional photos, including ones of construction workers removing the window coverings. The store has been a long time coming. Apple first confirmed its plans to open a Singapore store back in 2015 following earlier rumors. A construction works notice had suggested the store would be opening late last year, but that of course didn’t happen. Apple finally confirmed the opening date last week after revealing the location through a giant love note. The store opens at 10am on Saturday May 27, and will be open daily from 10am to 10pm.

(Photo by Tristan Fewings/Getty Images for Apple) View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit We noted last summer that many UK payment terminals were allowing Apple Pay transactions above the standard £30 ($39) limit for contactless cards – and Apple says this is now true of the majority of terminals. The news was revealed by Jennifer Bailey, head of Apple’s payments business … NordVPN Bailey told the Telegraph: “We think the majority of the contactless terminals [in the UK] are now limitless,” Ms Bailey said. Retailers now accepting the higher-value payments include supermarkets such as Waitrose and Sainsbury’s and restaurants including Pizza Express and Nando’s. It should be noted that ‘limitless’ may need to be qualified. One retailer told me that there is still a limit to Apple Pay transactions, but not one that would be hit by most purchases. A figure of around £6-700 was mentioned. The higher transaction values allowed when using Apple Pay is likely to have helped the growth of the service in the UK. The company says Apple Pay transactions in the UK have grown by 300pc in the last year, with 23 banks now supporting the service. “Our momentum has been fantastic. We’re really excited about the progress,” Ms Bailey said. Britain was already an ideal market for the service as the majority of retailers, large and small, already supported contactless payment – at least in major towns and cities. The first contactless cards were launched in the UK ten years ago, in 2007. Bailey also repeated hints she made last year that the company’s ambition to have iPhones and Apple Watches replace our wallets weren’t limited to payment cards. “If you think about all the things in your wallet, we’re thinking about all those things, we’re probably actively working on most of them,” she said. “We’re starting with payments. Some are longer term, we see this as a long term journey rather than something we can solve in the next 12 months.” The UK’s Driver Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA)  last year shared an image of a British driving license stored within an Apple Pay wallet.

The official photo of the event, below, shows singer Dua Lipa performing one of the tracks from her upcoming new album, while smiling customers enjoy the show. That was an accurate reflection of the event. The singer gave an excellent performance to an appreciative audience. But it didn’t provide the complete picture. The top photo, taken with my iPhone from my position close to the stage area, shows another aspect of the event: massive crowding with basically zero attempt at controlling those crowds … NordVPN You had to register to attend the concert, and places were theoretically limited to 250. But there was nothing at all to control numbers. The area wasn’t roped off in any way. You could voluntarily check-in with staff, but it was clear that many of those who didn’t get places turned up anyway, and there were also people who were in the store when they saw from the huge screen that it was happening and decided to stay for it. There was no attempt by staff to find out who was registered and who wasn’t – and no system in place to make this a practical proposition. We were fortunate to get there early enough to get places close to the front, but there would have been many more registered people who arrived before the start and would have been left standing just inside the front doors. There was also a woman who told staff she was unable to stand for an hour, and while a couple of members of staff said they would try to find her a seat, the crowds meant this was basically an impossible task at which they failed. Not great for a company which says accessibility is a core value. The crowds additionally meant that it would have been a nightmare to either try out any of Apple’s products or make a purchase. The display tables were packed with people watching the show, and staff wanting to sell anything had to fight their way through the throng to fetch products. Granted, this was a special event designed to highlight the initiative. The vast majority of the events are the same workshops that have been offered for many years, and even with extra publicity aren’t going to attract those kind of crowds. But if Apple intends to make special events a regular feature, it has to manage the space a lot better than it did at the weekend. I wrote before that I’m all in favor of Apple highlighting one of its best-kept secrets. Workshops are a great way to learn how to get more from Apple hardware and software, and also a place to get inspired about creative projects. I also support the notion of Apple Stores becoming places you go to try products, and to get informed about them, while most sales are made online. But Apple also needs to remember that the primary function of a retail store is to allow customers to see the products, experience them and – yes – buy them. Almost every Apple Store I’ve visited has already been unpleasantly crowded. Adding special events into the mix requires it to develop proper processes to handle the crowds. Otherwise all that is achieved is that a lot of would-be customers get driven out of the stores. Ben Lovejoy @benlovejoy Ben Lovejoy is a British technology writer and EU Editor for 9to5Mac.

Kenneth P. Weiss, received 13 patents for authentication systems that use a smartphone, biometric identification such as a fingerprint and the generation of secure one-time tokens to conduct financial transactions. While it’s not unusual for more than one company to be simultaneously working on the same technology, Weiss says that in this case both Visa and Apple were aware of his technology four years prior to the launch of Apple Pay … NordVPN In 2010, prior to the launch of Apple Pay in 2014, Weiss realizing the promise of USR’s new patented technology approached the world’s largest corporation, Apple Inc., and Visa Inc., the largest payment network in the United States, in attempt to partner with the companies to develop commercial implementation of the technology. Weiss reached out to both corporations with letters and meeting requests to discuss his cutting-edge technology. The lawsuit states, “during the meeting with Visa, USR made detailed presentations of the patented technology under protection of a non-disclosure agreement.” After these attempts, no partnership was struck. However, according to the lawsuit “Apple and Visa began working together on Apple Pay at least as early as January 2013, and Visa dedicated approximately 1,000 people towards the development project with Apple.” In an interview with the NY Times, Weiss said that he was filing the lawsuit before asking for royalties on the advice of his lawyers. Universal Secure Registry did not seek a license agreement or royalties from Apple or Visa after the release of Apple Pay. Mr. Weiss said the law firm representing his company, the patent specialists Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, advised him to file the suit first. Those lawyers do at least have experience in court battles with Apple. Quinn Emanuel, which filed the Apple Pay suit on behalf of Universal Secure Registry, represented Samsung Electronics in some of its long-running patent litigation with Apple over software in its Android-based smartphones. Apple declined to comment when approached by the NYT, and Visa did not respond. It’s of course not unusual for Apple to be sued for patent infringement by companies large and small, in cases with and without merit.

Apple’s HomeKit feature allows you to control heating and cooling settings with Siri, automation, and Apple’s Home app. Sony A6500 The first of the two models is called Sensi Wi-Fi Thermostat and retails for $129.99. This budget-friendly model includes the typical smart thermostat features like remote control, smart alerts, and geofencing. The display is also backlit so it can be read in the dark. Emerson says Sensi Wi-Fi Thermostat can be installed without a c wire which can enable compatibility with homes that don’t already have a common wire, but HomeKit features will require the extra power. Its $129.99 price tag is comparable to iDevices Thermostat with HomeKit for the same price. The fancier version is called Sensi Touch Wi-Fi Thermostat and retails for $199.99. This model features a more modern design with a color shifting touch screen that adjusts based on heating and cooling modes. You can also adjust backlighting from the smart thermostat to add accent lighting to a dark room at night. The LCD touch screen display on the unit measures 4.3-inches diagonally with a 272 x 480 resolution. Its $199.99 price tag is comparable to Ecobee’s 2nd generation Ecobee3 Thermostat with HomeKit currently discounted to $185.00. Emerson says both new thermostats will hit stores “early summer at retail stores, online marketplaces, through HVAC contractors and at sensicomfort.com.” Both units also support Amazon Alexa for voice control from Echo devices as well; just look for the latest models when available to ensure HomeKit compatibility.

The new collection includes four Nike Sport Band colors previously not available, including two shades of blue and two shades of pink/violet. These new bands feature the same style as the existing Nike Sport Bands with a perforated design similar to the standard Sport Bands for Apple Watch. Nike says the new colors will launch alongside the new shoe collection on June 1 with each band retailing for the standard $49 price on nike.com and select Nike stores. The new bands will show up at Apple Stores including apple.com later in June. Nike only started selling standalone versions of their unique Nike Sport Bands for Apple Watch earlier this year, and the Light Bone version that ships with the Apple Watch NikeLab is not sold separately. 9to5Toys has also reviewed look-alike bands that match the style of the Nike Sport Band for less money. New Nike Apple Watch face colors were separately introduced in watchOS 3.2 including Blue Orbit and Violet Dust. Check out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple Watch news!

The case, manufactured by Pelican, helps gives us clear direction on what to expect with Apple’s upcoming iPad Pro. We spent some time with the case and compared it to Apple’s current 9.7-inch iPad Pro and Silicon Case. The first question that arises when a case leaks is often whether or not the company that manufactured it is credible. Pelican, the maker of this particular case, has been making accessories for Apple products over the past few years. Its current lineup of iPad products all feature some sort of ruggedized protection for the tablet. After reaching out to the company to confirm the validity of the case we have in hand, the representative wasn’t able to give us a clear answer. The supplier that we bought the case from ensured us that it was in fact real, and that they had recently received shipments of it. Based on Pelican’s history, we feel confident that this case is one that will come to market soon. The Case The Pelican case we got our hands on is ruggedly built with a silicon interior, and hard plastic exterior shell. The protective design is something akin to OtterBox cases. It includes an Apple Pencil holder built into the side, and a built-in stand on the rear. The first noticeable difference this case shows is the microphone’s location. Instead of the cutout being near the camera like current models, the case has a cutout for the microphone at the top-center rear of the case. This matches the layout of Apple’s latest $329 iPad, and falls in line with the leaks we saw earlier today. Outside the microphone, the biggest difference has to be case’s size. Thanks to having one in hand, we were able to get measurements to estimate the upcoming iPad Pro’s size. 10.5-inch iPad Pro Dimensions This case’s use of an inner silicon and hard outer shell, makes getting accurate measurements a bit tricky. We pulled the inner silicon out and measured from that, ignoring the hard outer shell. After measuring multiple times, we were able to estimate the new iPad’s dimensions.   Based on the case’s measurements, we’re estimating that the 10.5-inch iPad Pro will have a length of 10.13 inches (257 mm), width of 7.06 inches (179 mm), and a thickness of 0.25 inches (6.4 mm). Though thinner bezels have been thought to come to the new iPad Pro, it will most likely be fractionally smaller. With an increase of nearly an inch diagonally, helping to fit that 0.8-inch larger display, the bezels may not be as thin as some have hoped. In measuring we also discovered that the upcoming iPad Pro may not be getting any thicker. The current 9.7-inch iPad Pro comes in at 0.24 inches and the 12.9-inch at 0.27-inches. The measurements we took today show the 10.5-inch iPad will be roughly 0.25 inches. Comparing it to the 9.7-inch iPad Pro Nestling the 9.7-inch iPad Pro into the 10.5-inch case really gives perspective as to how much bigger the upcoming iPad will be. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro fit inside the case easily, with plenty of room leftover up top and a few millimeters to either side. Stacking the iPad atop the Silicon Case and 10.5-inch iPad Pro case also helps visualize the overall difference. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro case sticks out just a tad from the iPad without feeling too large. This small display size increase feels strange coming from Apple. With reports indicating that the iPad mini is being phased out, this leaves Apple’s iPad lineup all too similar. With no clear advantages between the sizes, it will be interesting to see what benefits Apple hopes this new 10.5-inch iPad Pro will offer.

While there’s still no tvOS version of YouTube TV, Google’s new video service updated its iOS app today with support for Apple’s AirPlay feature on iOS. Sony A6500 AirPlay lets you send audio and video from an iPhone or iPad to an Apple TV on the same Wi-Fi network. It’s not as easy to use as just launching an app on an Apple TV, but it’s a workaround solution for YouTube TV subscribers for now. Amazon Prime Video subscribers have had to rely on this same method for years now, although Amazon may be planning to introduce an Apple TV app as soon as next month at WWDC. For YouTube TV, the bigger limitation for most potential customers is market availability, not just client platforms. YouTube TV is currently limited to Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, and the San Francisco Bay Area. You can grab the latest version of YouTube TV for iOS on the App Store.

Apple highlights superior performance, camera quality, privacy, and other factors in appealing to potential new iPhone customers. Sony A6500 The ad campaign currently includes five short clips seen below that compare the iPhone experience through music, speed, photos, and more. Apple has also revamped its apple.com/switch microsite alongside the new campaign to turn Android users into iPhone owners. Both the video descriptions and the updated microsite highlight Apple’s Move to iOS app for Android which helps users migrate between platforms. Will it be easy to switch to iPhone? Yes, it will. There’s no need to save your stuff elsewhere before switching from Android. Just download the Move to iOS app from the Google Play Store and it securely transfers your content for you. That means things like your photos, videos, contacts, calendars, mail accounts, message history, and free apps — including Google Apps. And you can trade in your old smartphone, if eligible, for credit toward your new iPhone. Check out the new videos below: Apple CEO has described what he calls as a pause in iPhone sales as due in part to increased interest in the next generation iPhone 8; Apple has also boasted switcher numbers in the past.

The big question: Is it worth the cost? Christina Farr | @chrissyfarr 9 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Christina Farr One Drop finger prick Apple CEO Tim Cook has tried using a glucometer to track his blood sugar. So I decided to give it a shot, too. Millions of people with diabetes monitor their glucose levels on a daily basis. Some are even tracking it continuously. But in Silicon Valley, the trend is now spreading to tech workers who don't have the disease, but feel they'll more easily avoid sugary treats if they can visualize the data. Some are reporting dramatic results with weight loss and increased productivity. show chapters Tim Cook testing glucose monitor on his apple watch: Sources    Friday, 19 May 2017 | 2:33 PM ET | 01:56 Nothing quite that profound happened to me after 10 days of tracking, but I did learn a few things. Before I share these insights with you, there are a few things you need to know. I'm a reasonably healthy person, as far as journalists go, so I wasn't expecting to see many extreme fluctuations in my blood sugar. I pricked my finger 5 times per day, rather than use a continuous tracker. And I very occasionally treat myself to sugary foods, like chocolate, but work out a moderate amount three to four times a week. Getting started I ordered my kit from a startup called One Drop, which sells a glucose meter, lance and unlimited test strips by subscription. Those who are curious and don't have type 1 diabetes will likely have to pay fully out-of-pocket. The price tag is $99 for the system, not including the cost of subscription-based test strips and coaching. The company on Monday expanded its offering to include a new product for those who are at high risk for diabetes, called One Drop Plus. The One Drop glucose monitor. Setting up the system was fairly intuitive, once I paired the One Drop app with my glucose meter, which displayed all my readings. With a short delay, those readings synced up with the app, so I was able to review all the trends over time. Christina Farr Track blood sugar with One Drop I had the option to manually input my meals, which I failed to do with any consistency (it was time-consuming to look up and log every item that I ate). I also synced up the app with Apple's HealthKit, which meant I could automatically share my steps. The hardest part involved the actual finger-pricking. That experience gave me a lot more empathy for people with diabetes, who need to do this many times a day. It wasn't painful, but it was cumbersome and I had to find ways to covertly prick myself in front of friends and colleagues at restaurants and bars. Apple's Cook shared a similar sentiment when he described his own experience to a group of students in Scotland: "It's mentally anguishing," he said. Once I figured out how to squeeze enough blood from my finger, with the help of warm water, gentle massaging and gravity, I started taking readings at random points in the day. What I learned  The first thing I did wrong was to approach the experience without having done my research. I tended to prick myself when I remembered to, rather than with any kind of strategy. So I gave Aaron Neinstein, assistant professor of endocrinology at UC San Francisco and a director of clinical informatics, a call. Christina Farr Taking a glucose reading Neinstein suggested the following: Look at the impact from exercise. Get a reading before and after a workout. After doing that, I learned that my blood sugar fell, often for several hours after a workout. Get a reading first thing in the morning. A normal reading, according to Neinstein, is around 70 to 100 mg/dL. Make sure you haven't eaten food for about 6 to 8 hours. Try a reading after eating a meal. It's normal to see a spike after sugary foods, which could prove to be a deterrent. After following Neinstein's advice, I got fairly hooked on visualizing how my body reacted to things that are generally considered healthy (exercise, nutritious food) versus those things I love that aren't advisable except in moderation (alcohol, gummy bears, milk chocolate). By the end of the first week, I started working out more regularly and eating healthier. This is common sense -- and advice that doctors routinely give -- but actually visualizing my data was surprisingly helpful. https://twitter.com/chrissyfarr/status/865702699358068736 The bigger question is whether it's worth the cost. In the wake of the experiment, I wouldn't pay out-of-pocket for a subscription. The week-and-a-half long snapshot was enough for me. Several medical experts have already made the case that it's pointless for healthy people to track blood sugar. "The truth is that we don't know if it's useful yet," Neinstein said. "What we do know is that there's a huge benefit to feedback, but a healthy person might draw the wrong or right conclusions from that." Do you track your blood sugar, but you don't have diabetes?

The iPhone maker on Monday launched a website aimed at persuading people who currently have an Android phone to buy an iPhone from Apple. The colorful webpage includes a link to buy an iPhone as well as answers to questions about why people should switch and how difficult the transition would be. One example: "Will it be easy to switch to iPhone?" Apple's reassuring answer: "Yes, it will. There's no need to save your stuff elsewhere before switching from Android. Just download the Move to iOS app from the Google Play Store and it securely transfers your content for you." The iPhone giant has been focused on been focused on luring Android users for a while, and Apple CEO Tim Cook likes to throw out statistics about the number of "switchers" from Android to iPhone, indicating it is one of the data points Apple closely watches. View photos Mac PC John Hodgman Justin longMore (A "Get a Mac" ad.) "We saw the largest absolute number of switchers outside of greater China that we've ever seen in the same period," Cook said on the company's latest earnings call, according to MacRumors. Apple has targeted Android customers before with a separate website, which has been taken down. And two years ago, it released an app called Move to iOS for Android designed to help switchers. Apple launches single-topic sites like this for many of its programs, including its recent push to hold classes at Apple retail locations, as well as a page heralding the number of jobs Apple says it is responsible for creating in the US. The targeting of Android is reminiscent of Apple's campaign in the 2000s to persuade Windows PC users to "Get a Mac."

There are a few bug fixes and minor improvements in this thing, too. But mostly AirPlay,” reads the changelog for YouTube TV on App Store. Prior to today’s update, YouTube TV only supported broadcasting content from the app to a television set via Google’s Chromecast HDMI dongle. Google launched its new streaming television service back in April 2017. In exchange for $35 per month, cord-cutters can enjoy live TV streaming from Fox, ABC, CBS, NBC and other popular cable networks along with content from an additional 39 local broadcast networks and channels, like ESPN.

Apps iPhone Apps iPad Apps Mac Apps Apple TV Apps Apple Watch Apps The Best Apps Tutorials Jailbreak Jailbreak Tweaks Jailbreak Guide Unlock Guide Deals Latest Deals Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV More Download Wallpapers iPhone Photography Expert Tips Podcasts Apple’s revamped “Switch to iPhone” webpage offers additional information to Android users Christian Zibreg on May 22, 2017 1 Apple’s webpage dedicated to Android users who would switch to an iPhone has been refreshed with a modern web design and additional FAQ-style information on key iPhone features like speedy Apple-designed chips, Apple Pay, iMessage and more. The refreshed webpage is divided into the following sections: Will it be easy to switch to iPhone? “Yes, it will,” says Apple. “There’s no need to save your stuff elsewhere before switching from Android.” This section promotes Apple’s “Move to iOS” Android app. Available at no charge on Google’s Play Store, the app can securely transfer a switcher’s content from an Android phone to their brand spanking new Apple smartphone. “And you can trade in your old smartphone, if eligible, for credit toward your new iPhone,” reads the section. Is the camera as good as they say? Apple prides itself with the fact that more pictures are taken on iPhone than any other camera in the world, as per Flickr’s camera stats. This section mentions some of the most popular iPhone photography features and shooting modes, such as Slo-Mo, Portrait and Time-Lapse. “iPhone also has cool features like Memories, which automatically compiles your favorite moments into a movie,” says the company. As of recently, Apple is promoting iPhone photography via a series of mini-video tutorials on getting the most from your iPhone 7 camera, hosted on its “How to shoot on iPhone” webpage. Why is iPhone so fast? Even the last year’s A9 chip that powers iPhone 6s is faster in single-core CPU benchmarks than today’s top of the line Android handsets with quad-core chips outfitted with four gigabytes of RAM or even more. As you know, iPhones run on high-performance chips that are custom-designed by Apple for power efficiency. “Combine all that with the latest iOS updates offering smart new features, and everything you do on iPhone feels fast and fluid,” says Apple. Will iPhone be easy to use? Apple promotes its legendary ease of use, which it says is at the core of everything it creates. “With a swipe of your finger or a single tap, you can open apps, make a purchase with Apple Pay or customize your iPhone,” reads the webpage. Apple also mentioned the Tips app, preloaded on each iOS device to help users get the most out of their device, but that’s hardly something I’d choose to highlight iOS’s simplicity and intuitiveness. How does iPhone help protect my personal information? This is all about Apple’s commitment to privacy and security, two major priorities with them. Since iOS 8, everything on your iPhone is “encrypted from the start” and protected by your passcode. Most flagship Android handsets have encryption disabled by default because full-disk encryption makes them sluggish due to the lack of hardware-assisted encryption. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube “Apple will not sell your information to anyone for any reason,” adds the mini-website. The Cupertino giant notes yet another huge advantage it has over Android: its timely and easy-to-install software updates that don’t have to be vetted by carriers and device vendors like major Android firmware updates do. Can I get help from a real person? “No matter where you are, we have real human beings ready to help,” says the firm. Apple’s support team will help Android users learn about topics ranging from the switching process and software on their new iPhone to troubleshooting any issues they may have with their new phone. Support options listed here include phone, online chat, Apple’s Support app and a dedicated Twitter handle @AppleSupport. What makes Messages so great? The expressive Messages app on iOS 10 “doesn’t just send messages, it also lets you hail rides, book restaurants, and even shoot lasers.” Apple is referring to new Messages features on iOS 10, like downloadable stickers, fullscreen effects and iMessage apps, as well as strong end-to-end encryption. “And, of course, you can use other messaging apps like WeChat, WhatsApp, or Facebook Messenger, too,” adds the company. What about the environment? Apple says: We think about the environment all the time. Every time you send an iMessage, make a FaceTime call, or ask Siri a question, those tasks are handled by Apple data servers running on 100 percent renewable energy. And when you switch to iPhone, we’ll even recycle your Android phone for you. Will I love my iPhone? Of course you will. Tim Cook likes to highlight Apple’s customer satisfaction numbers that are the envy of the industry (customer sat, as he likes to put it), with a 451 Research-estimated 97 percent of people who have an iPhone saying they love it. “That’s a lot of smiling selfies. A lot of happy emoji. And a lot of people who are glad they chose the world’s most loved smartphone,” reads the webpage. How do you like Apple’s reworked “Switch to iPhone” mini-site?

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Brash CEO of LeEco who Likened Apple to Hitler Steps Down as CEO and out of the Limelight | Main | Samsung will unveil a new 'Stretchable Display' tomorrow that Apple has shown an Interest in » May 22, 2017 Foxconn-Sharp to Acquire a U.S. Micro-LED Display Startup   In April Patently Apple posted a report titled "Foxconn to make 'Capital Intensive' Investment in the U.S. that will be revealed at a Special Event this Summer." Foxconn is one of the Vision Fund contributors along with Apple and SoftBank. The fund played a role over the weekend with the U.S. President and Saudi Arabia signing a deal for $93 billion to invest in U.S. technology. SoftBank's Chief Masayoshi Son followed the President to Saudi Arabia who was behind the deal. Today we learning about another potential deal with Foxconn and a U.S. company.   The Nikkei is reporting today that "Sharp and other Hon Hai Precision Industry group companies will acquire an American startup working on next-generation display technology, aiming to commercialize products such as large displays for which liquid crystals are less suited.   The Japanese electronics maker will team with CyberNet Venture Capital, panel maker Innolux and Advanced Optoelectronic Technology to buy Delaware-based eLux in October, Sharp said Monday. All of the acquirers are owned by or affiliated with Taiwanese contract manufacturer Hon Hai, also known as Foxconn.   The American startup develops technology for micro-LED displays, which consist of small, light-emitting diodes. The company was established in October 2016 by researchers formerly employed at Sharp research facilities in the U.S.   Sharp will hold a share of just over 30% in eLux, a stake valued at $7 million, in exchange for related patents.   There's intense interest of late for micro-LED displays. Patently Apple posted a report on this earlier this month titled "Samsung Seeks to Join the Micro-LED Display Race along with Apple, Sony and Oculus." Last month we covered another report titled "Korea's Deep Paranoia is Setting in as Apple Considers a Supply Shift to China and Apple Watch 3 Shifts to Micro-LED."   Korea's OLED display manufacturers are paranoid that Apple will kick-start micro-LED for a future Apple Watch. This is where experts believe micro-LED displays will begin in 2018 and steadily ramp-up to other products as the chart from Yole Development illustrates above.   Earlier this month 'Yole Development' put out a document supporting the chart above. They noted that "Micro-light emitting diodes or MicroLED are an emissive display technology. Just like OLED, they offer high contrast, high speed, and wide viewing angle. However, they could also deliver wider color gamut, dramatic – orders of magnitude – higher brightness, significantly reduced power consumption and improved lifetime, ruggedness and environmental stability.   In addition, MicroLEDs allow the integration of sensors and circuits, enabling thin displays with embedded sensing capabilities such as fingerprint identification and gesture control.   The first MicroLED commercial product was unveiled by Sony in 2016 in the form of a small-pitch LED video display where traditional packaged LEDs are replaced by MicroLEDs. The first consumer killer-app could come in the form of smartwatches, propelled by Apple, and its acquisition of LuxVue.   MicroLEDs could also eventually dominate augmented and mixed reality displays thanks to their unique ability to deliver both the brightness and low power consumption required for the application." Of course that translates to a head mounted display with MicroLEDs. "   In the end, the industry believes Apple will be the first to introduce a commercial product with MicroLEDs and so it becomes interesting that Foxconn-Sharp want to invest billions in an LCD plant in the U.S. that may also move into MicroLED production by acquiring eLux.   Last week Patently Apple posted a patent report about an Apple/LuxVue invention relating to both Micro-LED displays for future products like a smartwatch and TV. The drumbeat for Micro-LED displays is getting louder by the week.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

But the iPhone maker is also tipped to launch a variety of new products at the show, including the Siri speaker, a 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and new MacBooks. A new report says that Apple is indeed expected to launch new laptops this quarter, and there’s reason to be excited. Don't Miss: Leaked iPhone 8 mold suggests device will be slightly larger than the iPhone 7 In a new research note to customers, TrendForce said that notebooks are having a little moment, again. Shipments for the first quarter of the year grew by 6.1% compared to last year, totaling around 37.81 million. That’s a 15.6% decline from the Christmas quarter, but still an impressive result for the period. Apple placed fifth in TrendForce’s top, with 3.4 million MacBook laptops shipped during the period — that marks a 15.8% decline compared to the December quarter, but a 15.4% increase compared to last year. TrendForce quotes the MacBook Pro with TouchBar as the device that contributed significantly to the overall shipments. Similarly, the researchers believe the 12-inch MacBook will help Apple ship 10% more laptops in the second quarter of this year than last year. That’s because Apple reportedly plans to launch a new version of the 12-inch MacBook that will feature a new processor. The report notes that promotional pricing for some older models might also be in order. A previous report said that Apple will update the MacBook Pro as well, even if it only launched a new model in late 2016. TrendForce makes no mention of other MacBook updates for the quarter.

 Corporate America’s rush for cheap money in Europe is devastating for investors there Wolf Richter, Wolf Street May 22, 2017, 4:34 PM 942 facebook linkedin twitter email print Dan Kitwood/Getty Images Apple is doing it, everyone is doing it: US companies are issuing record amounts of bonds denominated in euros. On Thursday, Apple announced in an SEC filing that it would issue €2.5 billion in euro bonds, the proceeds of which will be used to fund share buybacks and dividends to be paid in dollars. These bonds will come in two tranches: €1.25 billion of 8-year notes and €1.25 billion of 12-year notes, with coupon payments of 0.875% and 1.375% respectively. Yields are not yet established since the bonds have not been priced yet. But they will likely not be far off from the coupon. And they won’t even compensate investors for the loss of purchasing power based on the current rates of inflation: 2.2% in the US and 1.9% in the eurozone. Yet, demand is hefty in yield-starved eurozone, where the ECB has imposed its negative interest rate policy (NIRP) on investors and is buying €60 billion a month in all kinds of paper assets: Underwriters have received over $5 billion in orders for those Apple notes. Issuance of these “reverse Yankee” bonds – euro-denominated bonds issued by US companies – has surged because the cost of borrowing in the eurozone has plunged to ludicrously low levels. Even for the riskiest non-investment-grade corporate debt – called junk bonds, for good reason – the average yield is currently 2.9%. This chart of the BofA Merrill Lynch Euro High Yield Index (data via FRED, St. Louis Fed) shows this Eurozone absurdity: Wolf Street With the inflation rate in the eurozone at 1.9%, investors accept a “real” yield of on average 1%, in return for lending their money to junk-rated companies that have an appreciable risk of default with subsequent hefty losses for those investors. By comparison, what is considered the most liquid and safe paper, the 10-year US Treasury note, trades at a yield of 2.24%. The yield of the US high-yield bond index – a basket of junk bonds that is roughly equivalent to the euro junk-bond index above – is 5.7%. Riskier CCC-rated junk bonds trade at an average yield of 10.1%. These yields in the US are extraordinarily low too. But they’re multiples higher than the yields of equivalent debt in the Eurozone. For US companies, this is as close to free money as they can get. In 2015, after the ECB had announced its QE and other measures, issuance of reverse Yankee bonds soared 46% from 2014. And this trend has continued. With the Fed now in the mood of raising its target rate and unwinding QE, 2017 looks like another record year for reverse Yankee bonds. According to Dealogic, issuance year-to-date has reached €57.4 billion. Dealogic cites additional reasons: “The reverse Yankee market is also primed for further growth, amid currency volatility and rumored changes to US tax law, specifically the end of tax deductibility for interest expenses on debt.” The two main components of that €57.4 billion are nonfinancial US corporations and US megabanks. US corporations have issued €32.6 billion so far this year. This includes the recent €8 billion “megadeal” by GE but it does not include the Apple deal which hasn’t been completed. US megabanks have jumped with both feet into this cheap money: Issuance of reverse Yankee bonds has soared to a record €24.7 billion so far this year. According to Dealogic, “The heavy issuance comes as banks raise debt to satisfy the total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirement and to boost their net stable funding ratios.” This chart shows that surge, with issuance up 150% year-to-date from the same period in 2014: Wolf Street In 2017, the bank deals include: Bank of America: €4.5 billion Morgan Stanley: €3.5 billion Goldman Sachs with two issues, €2.3 billion and €2.0 billion Wells Fargo with two issues, €2.0 billion and €1.5 billion The winners in this ECB-designed game are US companies. And the losers? Euro investors. In theory, they could just say no. In practice, many can’t. They’re forced buyers. Institutional investors, such as bond funds and life insurers, are obligated to buy euro bonds. They’re facing the relentless bid from the ECB, whose objective is to overpay to drive down yields, not to make money. Everyone else is in the same boat, whether they want to or not. But ultimately, the forced buyers don’t care. As long as they follow the market, they’re fine. They’re getting paid to play with other people’s money. And these other people who have their nest eggs tied up in these things can’t really complain because the interest they get at the bank is even worse – and in some cases negative. For now, as yields fall, bonds issued in prior years show capital gains on paper. It soothes a lot of nerves. But as bonds get closer to maturity, their value falls toward face value regardless of what the ECB does, and these capital gains turn into fondly-remembered optical illusions replaced by capital losses. It’s associated with a recession. The last time was the Financial Crisis. Read…  Oops, this Wasn’t Supposed to Occur in a Rosy Credit Scenario Read the original article on Wolf Street.

Zeman   @phonescooper Universal Secure Registry, a small firm from Boston, has filed a patent complaint against Apple and Visa over the technology used to create Apple Pay. According to the lawsuit, Kenneth P. Weiss, CEO of Universal Secure Registry, holds 13 patents pertaining to the use of fingerprints and one-time tokens in order to authenticate secure financial transactions. Weiss pitched the technology extensively to Visa in 2010. Visa agreed to a 10-year nondisclosure agreement and even assigned engineers to understand how Universal Secure Registry's process worked. Visa never adopted the technology, but several years later worked with Apple, MasterCard, and American Express to create Apple Pay, which launched in 2014. Apple Pay relies on fingerprints and one-time tokens to facilitate iPhone-based mobile payments. Patent law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan — one that represented Samsung and its fight against Apple over Android patents — suggested Universal Secure Registry take Apple to court over the patented technology. Apple has not yet responded publicly to the lawsuit. more info at New York Times » Related Apple Hit with $533 Million Judgment in Patent Trial Apple was found guilty of infringing on three patents held by a company called Smartflash and must pay the firm $532.9 million. A federal jury in Texas reached the verdict Tuesday and said Apple violated the patents willfully. Apple Vindicated in Another Patent Troll Lawsuit Apple beat back a lawsuit brought on by a small Honolulu-based company over mobile device patents. GPNE alleged that nine Apple products, including the iPhone and iPad, violated certain patents it holds regarding pager technology. Apple Pay Pushes Into Canada Apple today made Apple Pay available to consumers in Canada. At launch, only cards issued by American Express are compatible with Apple Pay in Canada. Apple Sues Qualcomm In China Apple has filed a fresh lawsuit against Qualcomm, this time in China where it alleges Qualcomm abused its market position to score higher patent-licensing fees. Apple also said Qualcomm failed to honor its promise to license standard essential patents at fair rates, reports Reuters. Apple Tackles Mobile Payments with Apple Pay Apple today announced its intent to reshape the way people pay for goods and services with Apple Pay. Rather than develop a system that benefits Apple, Apple said it designed Apple Pay so that it offers the best user experience possible for consumers. more news about:   AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

The company's shares are up 32 percent this year and have a current market value of just under $800 billion. Tae Kim | @firstadopter 11 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Getty Images The world's largest company by market value may still be under-owned by investors. Apple is crushing the market this year. The company's stock is up 32 percent year-to-date through Friday compared with the S&P 500's 6 percent return in the same time period, ballooning its market value to nearly $800 billion. Yet Apple, on average, makes up just 1.3 percent of the portfolios of global active fund managers, according to UBS. That's well below its average weighting of 2 percent in global indexes like the S&P 500 that they benchmark against, according to UBS. The company's weighting in the S&P 500 is even higher, at about 4 percent. show chapters RSA founder sues Apple over alleged infringement    10 Hours Ago | 00:34 UBS shared a list of the top 10 most crowded and non-crowded stock lists to investors on Monday, and Apple was at the top of the non-crowded list. Analyst Shanle Wu's team aggregated all the positions from global active fund managers, using FactSet institutional ownership data. They then compared the weightings versus the "relevant equity index benchmark" to calculate the investor and active net weight percentages. Apple made the top of the underweight list because it has a weighting 70 basis points below the average index benchmark weight. The level of how crowded a stock is in terms of institutional ownership is a key metric fund managers use to assess a position's risk. Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Savita Subramanian has said it's more difficult for crowded stocks to move higher since everyone is already in the trade. The flip side is also true, as investors can pile into a non-crowded stock when sentiment becomes more bullish. In another report Monday, RBC Capital explained how Apple stock can get to a $1 trillion market cap in 2018.

That's a shame, since competing TV services from Sling, DirecTV and Hulu all have apps of their own. At least Youtube TV subscribers aren't just stuck using Chromecasts to get their big screen fix.

Life is easier on iPhone. And that starts as soon as you turn it on. The company answers ten questions for Android users considering the switch. Will it be easy to switch to iPhone? Yes, it will. There’s no need to save your stuff elsewhere before switching from Android. Just download the Move to iOS app from the Google Play Store and it securely transfers your content for you. That means things like your photos, videos, contacts, calendars, mail accounts, message history, and free apps — including Google Apps. And you can trade in your old smartphone, if eligible, for credit toward your new iPhone. Is the camera as good as they say? More pictures are taken on iPhone than any other camera in the world. We design the hardware and software together using second-to-none technology, so you can shoot amazing photos and videos in modes like Slo-Mo, Portrait, Time-Lapse, and more. iPhone also has cool features like Memories, which automatically compiles your favorite moments into a movie. Why is iPhone so fast? iPhone runs on high-performance chips that are custom-designed by Apple — including the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone. And because these chips are so efficient, iPhone delivers long battery life. Combine all that with the latest iOS updates offering smart new features, and everything you do on iPhone feels fast and fluid. Will iPhone be easy to use? You bet. Ease of use is at the core of everything Apple creates, and iOS is designed to be both simple and intuitive. With a swipe of your finger or a single tap, you can open apps, make a purchase with Apple Pay, or customize your iPhone. It also comes with the Tips app, so you can get the most out of your device. How does iPhone help protect my personal information? Privacy is a priority with Apple. Unlike many other phones, important data on your iPhone is encrypted from the start and protected by your passcode. Apple apps like Maps and Safari help to keep private all the places you go and the sites you visit, and Apple will not sell your information to anyone for any reason. Best of all we provide easy-to-install software updates that help to protect your device and your data from security threats. What makes Messages so great? The Messages app is both simple and powerful. It doesn’t just send messages — it also lets you hail rides, book restaurants, and even shoot lasers. All your conversations will be kept private, because every message is encrypted from end to end. And, of course, you can use other messaging apps like WeChat, WhatsApp, or Facebook Messenger, too. Can I get help from a real person? No matter where you are, we have real human beings ready to help. Whether you want to know more about switching, or about software on your new iPhone, Apple’s award-winning support team offers assistance of any kind. Just call a Specialist, chat online, or visit an Apple Store. There’s also an Apple Support app and a dedicated Twitter handle @AppleSupport. Can I switch at an Apple Store? Absolutely. Apple Specialists are friendly, knowledgeable, and ready to assist you in switching. They can activate your new iPhone with a carrier of your choice and help you transfer your important content to your new device. You can also attend How To sessions, which are part of the Today at Apple program, to learn how to do even more with iPhone. What about the environment? We think about the environment all the time. Every time you send an iMessage, make a FaceTime call, or ask Siri a question, those tasks are handled by Apple data servers running on 100 percent renewable energy. And when you switch to iPhone, we’ll even recycle your Android phone for you. Will I love my iPhone? iPhone has industry-leading satisfaction rates — in fact, 97 percent of people who have an iPhone say they love it. That’s a lot of smiling selfies. A lot of happy emoji. And a lot of people who are glad they chose the world’s most loved smartphone. Check out the site at the link below...

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States May 23, 2:44 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology Apple iPhone 8 Touch ID Sensor Is Placed Below Apple Logo In Leaked Presentation By Corazon Victorino On 05/22/17 AT 4:08 PM Close Contrary to previous reports, Apple could place the iPhone 8's fingerprint scanner on the back instead of embedding itd into the display panel. This is based on the latest leak about the highly anticipated iOS-running smartphone from Tim Cook’s company.  During the weekend, a photo of what appears to be a PowerPoint presentation of the iPhone 8 was published on Slashleaks. It isn’t clear what the presentation contains because everything is in Chinese. What’s quite noticeable from the picture though is the featured back panel of the handset. It has cutouts for the vertically aligned dual-camera module, the Apple logo and a circular one that is believed to be made for the fingerprint reader.  Leaked PowerPoint presentation on iPhone 8. Photo: Slashleaks If this leaked presentation is based on fact, it could mean Apple failed to successfully develop the display-embedded Touch ID reader in time for production of the iPhone 8. This could disappoint many fans who were expecting the advanced biometrics display technology this year. Apparently, ever since news about the iPhone 8 started popping out early this year, there was mention of a possible display-embedded Touch ID.  READ: How to check if you bought a stolen iPhone Another interesting thing about the newly leaked illustration is the small cut-out just under the camera module. AppleInsider called this an odd thing to have because the flash is not in-between the lenses but underneath the module. It is also important to note at this point the presentation is dated March 3, and there is no way to confirm if it was from the manufacturer.  Recently leaked photos suggest the back panel would only have a cutout for the dual-lens camera and nothing more. However, anything is possible at this point considering Apple has yet to confirm the specs and features of the next-generation flagship iPhone. Besides, there is no way of verifying all of the leaks and rumors about the iPhone 8. The only thing that is certain for now is the fact that Apple will be releasing new iPhones in September. The tech giant reportedly is launching the iPhone 8 alongside the successors to last year’s models, the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. Of the three rumored handsets, the iPhone 8 is believed to be special because it will have all the premium features. It is said to sport the advanced edge-to-edge OLED display, a large battery and advanced 3D face-scanning technology. The device is also expected to be a complete redesign from the usual form factor of the latest iPhones. Plus, there have been reports claiming the 10th anniversary iPhone will come equipped with wireless charging technology.  READ: Apple reportedly chooses Lightning over USB-C for new iPhones The news about the PowerPoint presentation comes in the wake of a leak shared on Twitter by leaker Benjamin Geskin. The images Geskin uploaded show the different molds for the upcoming iPhones. Geskin did not give the dimensions of the three molds, but he did indicate the sizes of the next-generation iPhones are now 100 percent confirmed thanks to the templates. The leaker also noted it’s quite certain the Touch ID sensor won’t be placed on the back of the new iPhones. Instead, it will be embedded either into the power button or the display of the handsets.  The next-generation iPhone is now believed to have its fingerprint scanner on the back.

Mon, 22 May 2017, 13:41:09 EDT   |   Source: Wondershare Inc.   Share   Tweet LONDON, UK, May 22, 2017 (SEND2PRESS NEWSWIRE) — For many, Apple’s iPhone is the number one choice for security and safety of user data, says dr.fone toolkit. It’s been widely accepted for many years that Apple puts privacy high on the agenda when it comes to its operating systems and smart devices. So the tech world was taken by surprise in 2016 when following the San Bernardino terrorist attack, the FBI commissioned a private company to “hack” the suspect’s iPhone – a figure that reportedly totalled $900,000! Whilst Apple’s security clearly stands up to the test, there are a number of ways user data can be vulnerable to hackers. 1) ICloud — Useful as it is in the event of loss or corrupted data, automatically backing your iPhone up to an iCloud account can leave you open to having your information exploited. Having your images, videos and other important data sitting in your iCloud account can be hacked considerably easier than your device itself. 2) ITunes — Many Apple users fail to realise how dangerous a hacked iTunes account can be. As with an iCloud account, iTunes copies information and data from your device and stores it on iTunes. Hackers are able to find this data and exploit it to identify your purchased music, videos and films along with more worrying data such as credit and debit card details. 3) Recently deleted items — Despite believing deleted data is gone for good, recently deleted data such as photos and videos does not get fully deleted. In fact it simply gets moved to another location where it can still be accessed. So the burning question is simply, how can I enhance my privacy and secure my data? Thankfully, there are a number of steps that can be taken to ensure your data remains safe. Disable iCloud back-up, to disable iCloud backup users can go to ‘settings’ and tap ‘Apple ID.’ Scroll right to the bottom of the page and selecting ‘sign out’, then type in your password and then tap ‘turn off’ at the bottom of the page. The other option is to delete iTunes backup files to prevent them getting into the wrong hands. Within iTunes click ‘preferences’ and then ‘devices’ before selecting the back-up file you’d like to remove. Click ‘delete back-up’ and your data will no longer be stored. However, although there are some easy and effective steps to take, software developer Wondershare have now launched dr.fone – iOS Full Data Eraser to guarantee a complete and irrecoverable wipe of all Apple iPhone data from a device.

On June 5, Apple will kick off its annual developer conference, and it looks as if it might launch some new products in addition to announcing software updates for iPhones, Macs, and Apple Watches. Apple is planning to release three new laptops next month, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Apple may update its MacBook Pro, MacBook, and MacBook Air with new Intel chips, according to the report. It most likely won't be a groundbreaking update, but the new models should be faster than the current ones. The MacBook Air, for example, hasn't been updated since 2015. Apple's other laptops have been updated more recently, but none uses the latest Intel chip. While the new laptops Apple is rumored to launch probably won't sport a redesign, the latest chips would help them last longer before they feel sluggish. And when Apple launches laptops with new chips, the older models often are discounted. So if you're in the market for a new Apple laptop, wait two more weeks — there's a chance it could save you some money. There are also rumors that Apple could launch a new iPad or voice-activated speaker next month, although it's unclear whether Apple plans to do so.

Apple previously had a webpage dedicated to customers coming to an iPhone from Android devices, but it featured less information on the iPhone itself and focused primarily on the Move to iOS app, a dedicated app that helps Android users transfer contacts, message history, photos, mail accounts, calendars, and more. The new site, while featuring a section on Move to iOS, also attempts to lure Android users with details on the iPhone's camera and its processor, along with information on Apple Pay, Apple's privacy policy, the Messages app, Apple's commitment to the environment, and Apple Support. The site, which features clever animations and a simple design that's quick to scroll through, ends with an iPhone comparison chart and direct links to purchase iPhones from Apple's current lineup, including the iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6s, and iPhone SE. Apple continues to see a growing number of customers who are switching to the iPhone from an Android device, which Apple CEO Tim Cook covers in nearly every earnings call. During the second quarter earnings call in early May, Cook had this to say: "We saw the largest absolute number of switchers outside of Greater China that we've ever seen in the same period." Update: To go along with the new site, Apple has uploaded a series of 16 second videos on its YouTube channel. Each video (there are five in total) highlights how easy it is to switch from Android to iPhone with the Move to iOS app or points out iPhone features like speed and privacy.

Coincidence?? I dont think so... "Life is easier on iPhone'', not at all Apple. After 7 years using every new released iPhone I can tell you my life is much, much more easier (and a lot more productive) with my new S8 then every other iPhone from the past.

Rating: 17 Votes keysofanxiety 11 hours ago at 12:44 pm Contradictorily enough, over the past couple years, I've had an increasing desire to try out an Android phone. Not that I dislike my 7 Plus, it's just over the past 10 years, I now find iOS structured and boring. I'll take structured and boring. I like my devices to be secure and work consistently. Wasting time endlessly troubleshooting things that stop working for no reason is far from my idea of fun; though granted, it's certainly not boring. If that's the worst people can say about iOS, personally I think that says why it's the best.

Not that I dislike my 7 Plus, it's just over the past 10 years, I now find iOS structured and boring. I keep switching back to iPhone every time a new flagship Android phone is released. So ... I do keep giving Android a try, but I just can't make it my go-to phone. I used to care about tweaking my phone all the time, but now I just want simplicity and crap that just works out of the box. Android is getting better, though ... and both have their pros and cons ... but there are just some things about the iPhone that Android will probably never have. If Apple fix their software, up their game and make killer hardware (like they used to), then they wouldn't need to 'lure' people. They're not having any problems getting people to use the iPhone ... considering it's their primary means of gross income.

The Bangalore City Police (BCP) is now asking for assistance from the city’s app developers after a section of iPhone users complained of not being able to use apps on their phones. Bugs in some apps for the iOS platform have resulted in several users uninstalling the app or not being able to use them at all. “We have three apps which have seen plenty of downloads on Google Play as well as the Apple App Store. But many users have reported problems with the (recently launched) Suraksha-Bengaluru City Police App, when they use it on their iPhones,” said Praveen Sood, City Police Commissioner. According to him, there have been nearly 10,000 downloads of the app from the Apple store, but around 7,000 users have chosen to uninstall it. “There are issues with receiving the one-time password (OTP) as well as other bugs that are spoiling the user experience. We have not been able to determine what is wrong with the design,” he said. On Sunday, another app, FindMyPoliceStation, which helps citizens locate their jurisdictional police station based on their GPS location, was launched. However, this is only for Android users currently. “We are having trouble with the app submission to Apple’s App Store. If someone can come forward and help us get this app running on iOS, it would be helpful,” Mr. Sood said. Developers say that it is much easier to get an app on Google Play Store rather than on the Apple App Store. “Getting an application accepted by Apple usually takes a week. They also have a lot of restrictions on what tasks the app can perform. For example, a screen recorder app will not be accepted,” said Rohit Singh, an app developer. Many a thumbs up for BCP’s social media posts The latest in the series of meme-based tweets and posts by the Bangalore City Police features screenshots of the popular Netflix series Narcos that chronicles the life of notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar. A tweet by the @BlrCityPolice handle three days ago with the underlying threat to ‘visit’ drug sellers in the city and images of Escobar from the series caught the eye of Netflix India which airs the series. This led to an exchange between the two on Twitter where @NetflixIndia said Murphy and Pena (two of the detectives who bring down Escobar in the series) might want to work for BCP. This prompted a tongue-in-cheek reply from BCP who responded with another famous meme saying ‘we got this’ and said they would call if they needed help. The exchange had Twitterati in splits. “This is a great way to reach out to the public and assure them that BCP is keeping up with recent trends. I can’t wait to see which TV series they use next in their campaign,” said Rakesh M., a resident of Indiranagar who follows BCP on Twitter.

Universal Secure Registry filed a lawsuit Sunday in U.S. District Court in Delaware. With Apple Pay, users enroll a credit card on their phone, touch a finger to the iPhone's Touch ID sensor and pay a merchant with a signal using one-time tokens from the phone USR said its chief executive, Kenneth P. Weiss, who invented corporate encryption technology called RSA SecurID, has 13 patents related to a digital payment system. When Apple announced its Apple Pay service in September 2014, the company "touted the same benefits that USR had introduced to Apple and Visa in 2010," according to the complaint. "Just as USR disclosed to Apple and Visa that its patented technology eliminated the need to store or transmit payment-card account numbers, Apple bragged to its users that with Apple Pay 'the credit card isn't stored on the device,' " lawyers for USR said in the complaint. In 2010, USR said it sent Apple letters describing its patented technology and seeking a partnership but didn't hear back from the company. Weiss also said he had extensive meetings in 2010 with Visa officials, including its chief executive at the time, about working together on the technology. In an interview with The New York Times, Weiss said that Visa had signed a 10-year nondisclosure agreement for access to the technology but a license was never signed. Weiss said patent specialists Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan advised him to file the suit instead of first seeking a license agreement or royalties from Apple or Visa. He founded Security Dynamics in 1984 and the company acquired RSA Data Security in 1996. The RSA SecurID token system is now used by people to authenticate and secure communications with corporate and government computer systems. RSA was acquired by Dell EMC last September. After leaving Security Dynamics in 1996, Weiss focused on payment technologies and planned to license them to larger companies.

Follow Kyle: Twitter | IG  May 22, 2017 Share Tweet Image via Mac Rumors The iPhone has taken over a larger percentage of the cell phone market share with each passing year, and fans of the iconic device have benefited from leaps forward in technology with each new iteration. What was once seen as a luxury device for the hungriest of tech junkies is now a staple around the world; iPhone and iOS represent about 42 percent of the market share in America, a staggering number for a single line of devices competing against a multitude of Android phones. But if you're a loyal Apple customer, there's some bad news on the way. The price of the upcoming iPhone 8 is rumored to be trending upward after years of costs remaining relatively stable thanks to price drops in manufacturing. And these aren't cheap devices as it is—the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus currently cost between $649 for the cheapest version and $969 for the high-end version of the Plus.  Nobody likes to hear that a device they need to replace every few years will now cost in the neighborhood of $1,000, even if cell phones are a fixture in your life. So why is the cost of your favorite cell phone going up? New screens don't come cheap 3D Touch has been a welcome addition to the iOS universe since it was implemented for iPhone models from the 6S onward. A lot of actions that were previously tied to the home button are now able to be accessed through a variety of touch sequences on your screen, and you can conveniently pull up quick options for individual apps by long-pressing on the icon. Unfortunately, the magic of 3D Touch—and most of what your favorite devices are capable of—is made possible through help from third parties and tech developers who work alongside giants like Apple. 3D Touch specifically goes through a firm called TPK Holdings, who previously charged between $7-9 per phone to attach 3D Touch sensors to the LCD display panels iPhones use, which kept the cost of the parts manageable. Apple is making the switch to OLED displays in the 10th anniversary version of their phone, and that makes the manufacturing process a lot more delicate for the companies they work with. Despite some of their advantages over LCD display panels, OLED screens are more fragile, and thus have to be treated differently in the mass production lines. Glass panels will now be necessary on either side of the display in order to implement the 3D Touch sensors, and that extra step will necessitate a price hike. Here's the kicker—while the solution for the new display will only cost about 50 percent more for the manufacturers, experts believe the cost will rise about 150 percent on the consumer end. Each set of 3D Touch sensors will now cost between $18-22. Independent of the implementation of 3D Touch, new OLED screens are expected to add about $35 in costs, based on analysis from investors at Goldman Sachs. Screen sizes in the standard version and the "Plus" will reportedly go up, and more territory to tweet and text on will come with a cost. The addition of wireless charging Many of the features of the iPhone's anniversary addition have yet to be confirmed, but there has been one constant in the build-up: wireless charging. The technology has been available for some time now, but Apple has resisted making it a key feature. If you believe the leaks about the device, however, it looks like that's the direction they're headed. Reports from Reuters and staffing changes at Apple have hinted at their desire to modify the charging capabilities of the iPhone. Even the smallest editions of the new iPhones appear to have glass backs, which makes it possible to integrate wireless charging. Since iPhone users lost the headphone jack and now rely solely on the Lightning port for their connectivity, the ability to charge your phone without using the valuable port space should be a hit with consumers. Though the technology itself isn't particularly expensive, it is a new feature iPhones have not previously had. The ability to charge your phone a different way will free up space for use of other devices, but you can't get new things without adding parts and cost. Low storage options are likely gone Nobody likes to run out of space on their iPhone, but consumers often don't want to pay "extra" for the version of the iPhone that has a higher storage capacity. The cost of capacity has dropped a ton over the last decade, which helped stabilize costs as Apple continued to add more and more features to their devices. But the iPhone 8 is expected to eliminate the lowest storage option, and the 128 GB model that is currently the mid-tier edition will now represent the base phone. In the three current versions of the iPhone 7, the price jump from each model to the next is currently another $100 each time you go up a tier. Even if that pricing structure for space simply holds in the iPhone 8, the elimination of the 32 GB model—which Apple already got rid of entirely in the Jet Black version of the iPhone 7—represents a major jump in price for the standard edition compared to the phones many of their customers are using. This jump in price will be a little more palatable for iPhone users, since the elimination of low-capacity options should help curb the need for users to constantly clear out storage space on their phones. A 2014 survey found 91 percent of iPhone users in the U.K. had the smallest capacity device, so while storage is a big piece of the jump in price, at least you'll have plenty of space on your new iPhone if you get the cheapest version. One thing to note, because consumers often get the two things confused—storage is a separate entity from memory, which is also being tweaked in the iPhone 8. Apple is expected to upgrade to better, faster memory in the next edition of their phones, and that's expected to cost somewhere between $16 and $29. Part of this is a problem that extends beyond Apple, however—costs for mobile DRAM chips have risen, and in many cases this has prevented manufacturers from upgrading RAM (and subsequently, speed) in their phones. Possible dual cameras for selfies ​Front-facing cameras have been a point of emphasis for phone companies the last few years, as the selfie has become a phenomenon so big even your grandmother has probably taken one or two. From the looks of things, this could mean adding an additional camera to the front of your phone, with leaked images of the phone showing off what looks like a second camera on the front of the phone: Image via Engadget Apple already implemented this feature in the primary camera for the iPhone 7 Plus in order to improve picture quality for consumers, particularly when zooming. Although you probably don't need to zoom more when you're taking a selfie, the new iPhones look like they're going to factor your Snapchat game into the new design. And as always, progress and pulling off a fire pose comes at a cost.  Why you shouldn't panic Though all of this sounds gloomy from a consumer perspective—I certainly don't want to pay an extra $100-200 whenever I have to upgrade—the silver lining is the jump in price coming attached to a boatload of upgraded features for the phone. You would definitely sign up if someone told you your current phone was going to add wireless charging, better and bigger displays, faster memory, and more storage. Smart phones have become a massive part of how the average person interacts with the world around them, replacing other devices as they've added features over time. It used to be that you could simply call in a reservation to a restaurant on your phone. Now you can use your iPhone to match with someone on a dating app, set a reservation for dinner, read hundreds of reviews on the place, call a car to take you there, and then find an after-dinner spot in the area if the date goes well, all without having to speak a word out loud. Apple knows how beholden you are to your phone, and they're all-in on the expensive design for the next iPhone as a result. "Apple usually explores multiple designs in parallel," said an analyst for Goldman Sachs. "However, with only four months left until launch, we believe Apple has now locked down the design." But if you don't want to pony up for the latest and greatest iPhone when it drops, you always have the option to grab one of the older models once the iPhone 8 hits stores. You'll still be close to the cutting edge if you decide to buy an iPhone one or two generations behind the current model, and no one will fault you for refusing to pay a small fortune for a new cell phone as soon as it hits the market. What once was an experimental product is now an annual fixture, which helps bring prices down quicker than you might think. You may not feel as cool if you don't get the iPhone 8 on release day, but the only thing as inevitable as the next iPhone is the next iPhone's eventual price drop.  Related There's Already Chatter About a Glass iPhone 8 in 3 Different Sizes 8 Things We Want the New iPhone to Do For Our Style See How Much The iPhone's Camera Has Improved Over Time WatchNow Tags: News, Apple, iPhone, iOS, Tech, News Feature, Original News  Like  Follow  Chat Show Comments Lateststories Music Ariana Grande Shares Message After Manchester Explosion: ‘I Don't Have Words’ By Shawn Setaro 3 hours ago Life Virginia Woman Exposed on Camera for Pretending to be Homeless By Jose Martinez 5 hours ago Music 19 Deaths Confirmed After Reported Explosion Following Ariana Grande Concert By Jose Martinez 7 hours ago Life 18-Year-Old Florida Man Converts From Neo-Nazism to Islam, Kills Roommates for Disrespecting His Religion By Gavin Evans 8 hours ago Life Cop Joins Rock Band on Drums After Lame Neighbors Complain About Noise By Trace Cowen 10 hours ago Life Here's Why the iPhone 8 Might Cost You $1,000 By Kyle Neubeck 12 hours ago Life Melania Trump Appears to Slap Donald's Tiny Hand Away in Viral Video By Trace Cowen 12 hours ago Life Tomi Lahren Tells ‘Snowflakes’ How to Keep a Job, Conveniently Forgets That Time She Got Fired By Trace Cowen 13 hours ago Life PROMO: Complex Life Teams Up With the NHTSA to Tell Y’all to Click It or Ticket!

Of course if history has taught us anything, we’ll know practically everything there is to know about Apple’s new iPhones long before the company’s big announcement event comes along. Months of consistent leaks and rumors led up to BGR’s big exclusive last week, where we published photos of a mockup believed by sources to depict Apple’s final iPhone 8 design. Now, new photos of a similar mockup have appeared from a different source, providing possible further reinforcement that this is indeed what Apple’s hotly anticipated new iPhone 8 will look like when it launches later this year. Don't Miss: This is the iPhone of our dreams and it probably won’t ever exist There are some characteristics of Apple’s upcoming next-generation flagship iPhone that are still open to debate. For example, the rumor mill still seems unsure if the iPhone 8 will feature a new Touch ID fingerprint scanner that’s embedded in the display, or if it’ll be shifted to the back of the phone instead. We certainly hope the former is the case, because the latter would be awful. Of course, there’s plenty of info out there that everyone seems to agree on, such as the vertical dual-lens rear camera, the glass back for wireless charging, and the stainless steel midframe with polished edges that will continue the lines of the curved 2.5D glass around the perimeter of the phone. Now, all of those characteristics can be seen again in newly leaked photos showing an iPhone 8 mockup that matches the one we posted last week. The new photos were shared on Chinese microblogging site Weibo, and you can see them below. Apple’s iPhone 8 isn’t expected to be unveiled until September, of course, but we’ll undoubtedly learn plenty more about the phone between now and then.

By Cella Lao Rousseau Monday, May 22, 2017 at 11:00 am EDT 7 Comments Apple created a customized version of the gold Apple Watch specifically for French designer Karl Lagerfeld. Maybe she's born with it, maybe you shouldn't wear a fitness tracker and a smartwatch at the same time… Whether you're a big fan of the FitBit, totally gaga about the Apple Watch, or in love with any other fitness tracker or smartwatch model out there, you've probably had the thought cross your mind at least once: Is it actually cool to wear both of them at the same time? In the fashion world, it's not inappropriate in the slightest to wear a watch and a bracelet on the same wrist (although it has been debated before, and men seem to have an even harder time deciding what looks good as there are instructional videos about the topic online), but when it comes to wearable tech, is it fashion forwards or backwards to mix your Apple Watch and your FitBit? 0pusX 05-11-2016 03:58 PM “ I really miss the friends/social aspect of FItbit, but I love the technology aspect of my Apple Watch. Does anyone use both? I was thinking of grabbing a Fitbit Alta for everyday use, and then keeping my Apple Watch for when I am not outside working, or not working out. Does anyone wear both, all the time?? Reply Why it doesn't really always sorta kinda maybe work.... Nina Garcia: I'm a big believer that accessories can make or break a look. Wearable tech has become infinitely more fashionable in the last number of years. You have everything from big name fashion brands like Hermès designing watch bands for the Apple Watch, to stunningly modern and simple smart rings that help you keep track of things like your steps, the distance you've traveled, your heart rate, and so much more. Not only do these pieces of wearable tech look incredible and like something you'd see on a Chanel runway, but their functions, capabilities, and what they're designed to do are increasing every day, making it less and less necessary to have 4 or 5 pieces gadgets that literally almost do the exact same thing. From a fashion standpoint, it doesn't make a lot of sense to have two bulky accessories tethered to your wrist every day. "But Cella!" I hear you exclaim (somehow… from my apartment... in Canada...) "My fitness tracker is itty bitty! It's barely noticeable! And I don't use a smelly Apple Watch, I use something that looks like a classic wristwatch!" To which I reply "... Well, it actually depends…" How it can actually work If you're wearing your Apple Watch with your FitBit, chances are things are going to look a bit… Off. Sure, neither wearable is terribly intrusive or in your face or in the way, but the look probably doesn't look 100% right, or like both pieces of tech match-up or wear well together. PROTIP: If you're wearing wearable tech from the same brand, you can actually get around the whole smartwatch and fitness tracker at the same time argument! Most of the time, brands (especially fashion-based brands that make tech, and not tech-based brands that venture into fashion) will design their gadgets to seamlessly fit with one another on the wrist. The best examples I can think of are Fossil's fitness trackers like the Q Reveler and their not-super-computer-looking smartwatches. Both wearables aren't super 'techy' and resemble more standard, classic looking jewelry rather than two tiny computers strapped to your wrist, making it a bit less obvious that you're setting out to monitor your sleep, track your steps, etc. If you're wondering what I mean by techy, I mean smartwatches that have a square face, silicone wristbands, colorful plastic, obviously blinking or beeping lights, and blatant LED or light-up screens. TLDR; Wearing a fitness tracker and a smartwatch is a fashion faux pas… if they're super techy-looking. If they look like your classic wristwatch or pretty leather bracelet, or if one resembles something more clinical and tech-based while the other is more sleek and stylish, then you can get away with wearing both. What do you think? Are you a big fan or wearing a smartwatch and a fitness tracker at the same time, or would you rather wear one at a time? Or one on each wrist? Or would you prefer a fitness tracker that functions as a ring or a necklace? Let us know what your thoughts are in the comments below!

I wear my Series 2 on my left wrist and my Garmin Forerunner 935 on my right wrist. This was a necessity with the Series 1 watch, but having GPS on the Series 2 doesn't make the Garmin a necessity any more. I am just not willing to lose all of my Garmin data so I wear one on each wrist. Plus for my job I need to control music and have a timer running at times and I need to have access to both simultaneously. Plus the clocks are different at the two buildings I work at so the watches keep me from being late/early. 0 11 hours ago Reply Derrick4Real i find most smart watches quite ugly and unfashionable. I do not own one however i do own a nice dress watch that fits with a nice suit of dressed down. I would always pick the dress watch when trying to look fashionble.

I’ve also had the fun of contributing my $.02 on the topic at Computerworld, Engadget, Macworld, SlashGear and now iMore. Most recently I spent a few years at Apple as Sr. Director of Worldwide Product Marketing. On Twitter I’m an unverified @gartenberg. I still own some Apple stock. An Apple for the teacher... or time to open up some Windows? It takes more than revenue to succeed in the technology industry. There's also something called relevance. In recent years, that's been something Microsoft has sorely lacked. At least until now. Not only does Microsoft seem to have found its relevancy footing, it seems ready for a while new fight. In recent months, Microsoft has made it clear that it wants to own the creative market. That's a market that has traditionally been owned by Apple. Products such as Windows Creative and devices like Surface Studio showed Microsoft was serious. Microsoft wasn't just content with targeting creatives, though. At their last event, the company set its sights on education as well. Forget music. If anything is part of Apple's DNA it is education. An entire generation grew up with the Apple ][, Oregon Trail, and Reader Rabbit (formerly owned by Shark Tank shark, Mr. Wonderful). Another generation, the iMac. Today, Apple in education is under siege, though. On the low-end, Google is hitting hard with Chromebooks and services-as-software. Now Microsoft is re-joining the fray. There's a new Surface Laptop that could best be described as the retina MacBook Air Apple never shipped. It's not just beautiful, it comes with Windows S, a version of Windows that would bring all the traditional benefits of Microsoft's desktop but with iOS-style security, including being lock-downed to the Windows Store. A number of Microsoft's partners will be shippings Windows S devices as well. They'll be as cheap as a Chromebook but with a lot more horsepower. Certainly a lot cheaper than an Apple device, including iPad. Google may still have an ace-in-the-hole, though: Those aforementioned services-as-software. Talking to several principals and superintendents, more and more often I'm hearing it's the Google cloud that matters to them the most. We'll have to wait and see how it all shakes out but one thing's clear: Microsoft might have lost the phone battle but it's getting ready for a whole new chapter in the personal computing war.

They have abandoned these "fringe" markets with their special needs in order to sell to the broader, more general (but higher-end) consumer marketplace with iPhones, iPads and MacBooks. Yet, it was the education and Pro markets that kept Apple going in tough times. Now, they're seemingly willing to just give it away to Microsoft and Google. Maybe the increased competition in the Education and Pro markets will cause Apple to rethink their strategy, but in the meantime, it looks like Windows 10 S and Chrome OS are here to stay. 0 14 hours ago Reply m4mario Microsoft will lose in the classroom too.

Here's the fix! By Lory Gil Monday, May 22, 2017 at 3:00 pm EDT 3 Comments If your Apple ID doesn't work when signing back in to third-party apps, it's possible you have an app-specific password set up for it. Here's how to find out. Some third-party apps allow you to connect to iCloud by signing in with your Apple ID. Apple provides the option to, instead, use app-specific passwords to ensure your Apple ID is protected (this becomes a requirement for third-party apps as of June 15). You may have used an app-specific password to sign into iCloud with a third-party app in the past and forgotten you had done so. If you then try to sign back in to iCloud in that third-party app, but you use your actual Apple ID instead, it won't accept that password as proper credentials. If you have trouble using your Apple ID to sign into a third-party app, you should check to see whether you've used an app-specific password instead. How to check to see if a third-party app is using an app-specific password to sign in to iCloud You can view whether you have an app-specific password assigned to an app by viewing your list at Appleid.apple.com. Hopefully, you labeled your password to be easily identified when you first created it. Navigate to Appleid.apple.com from your web browser and sign in with your Apple ID and Password. Verify your identity with two-factor authentication. Under the Security section, select Edit. Under the App-Specific Passwords section, select View History. Under this list, you'll see labels for all app-specific passwords you've created in the past. Check to see if any of them match the third-party app you are trying to sign into. How to reset an app-specific password for a third-party app if you forgot it You can view a list of your app-specific passwords at Appleid.apple.com, but you can't see the actual password. If you don't have that app-specific password stored in a password manager and don't remember what it was, you can revoke it and create a new one. Navigate to Appleid.apple.com from your web browser and sign in with your Apple ID and Password. Verify your identity with two-factor authentication. Under the Security section, select Edit. Under the App-Specific Passwords section, select View History. Select the Remove icon next to the password you want to revoke. It looks like an X. Select Revoke to confirm that you want to revoke access to the app-specific password. Select Done when you are finished. What to do if you no longer have your trusted device to sign in to your iCloud account using two-factor authentication. In order to create an app-specific password, you'll need to enable two-factor authentication (which is different than two-step verification). Once enabled, you'll get a verification code sent to your trusted device when signing into a new device or browser, and when signing into Appleid.apple.com. If you don't have access to your trusted device, you can still get a verification code so you can sign into your account and access or revoke app-specific passwords. If you have access to a device that can receive phone calls from your trusted phone number (on iPhone, iPad, or Mac), you can get a code texted to you or sent via a phone call. At the iCloud sign-in screen, select Didn't get a verification code. Then select to have a code sent to your trusted phone number. You can use that code to sign into your account. If you don't have access to your trusted device or your trusted phone number (and know you never will again), you can request account recovery. This process takes a few days (possibly longer) but will help start the process of helping you regain access to your iCloud account. Navigate to Appleid.apple.com from your web browser. Select Didn't get a Verification code? Select Need Help?. Choose start account recovery. Enter a phone number where you can receive a text message or phone call when your account is ready for recovery. When you receive notification that your account is ready for recovery, navigate back to iforgot.apple.com and enter your Apple ID. Enter the phone number you provided for account recovery. Apple will send you an Account Recovery code to the verified phone number. Enter the code in the required field. Select a new device and/or phone number to use as your trusted device. Once you have a trusted device or phone number again, you can follow the steps to view and revoke app-specific passwords associated with your Apple ID. Any questions?

Are these going to still work? 2.

Like with anything else, you need to customize social content for every type of audience. Read More , called Clips. It’s simple enough to use and free to download, but we thought we’d explore the features a little deeper to see what the app is really capable of. Before you can download Clips you’ll need to update your iPhone to the latest version of iOS 10, which includes a few notable improvements Apple IDs, AirPods, and APFS: What's New in iOS 10.3? Apple IDs, AirPods, and APFS: What's New in iOS 10.3? Apple ID management, AirPods support, and the debut of APFS -- wondering what all of that means? Let's take a closer look at iOS 10.3. Read More over the last version. Photos, Videos, and a Little Bit of Snapchat One of the more puzzling aspects of Clips is trying to figure out why it exists at all. An app for making short videos and slideshows for social media seems like it should be bundled into the Camera app. Yet, after playing around with it, Clips clearly sits between the Camera app and full featured video editor like iMovie How To Create Awesome Slideshow Presentations In iMovie How To Create Awesome Slideshow Presentations In iMovie Want to produce slideshows that go beyond simple cross dissolves and single track background music? Apple's iMovie for Mac OS X can help you create a professional looking slideshow presentations with few prior skills. Read More . Clips was not pushed out to everyone, so you need to download it before you can experiment. The app greets you with a quuick intro video that provides a few examples of the sort of videos you can create. It is missing a lot of the details, but it does a decent job of demonstrating both the videos and photo slide shows. So What Do I Do Now? If you don’t share many videos on social media, you might be wondering what to do next. Considering that Apple is leaning hard on using this to share videos with friends, we’ll start there. The recording interface is pretty simple. Choose the front or back camera first, though it defaults to the front facing camera. Press and hold the big red button, and the camera starts recording audio and video. If you want to stop there, you can. Next, hit the share button and send your video via Messages or to your social network of choice. Yet, we can already do that with the built-in Camera app. What Clips excels at is adding effects and text to your video. If you prefer to use photos. You can take a photo and hold the red button for as long as you want it shown on screen. You can use existing photos and videos from your library 5 Things You Need To Know About iCloud Photo Library 5 Things You Need To Know About iCloud Photo Library Here's what you need to know about iCloud Photo Library, how it works and what it will cost you. Read More  for this. So far, so basic. Filters, Filters, Filters Filters are probably still something that you could apply with the regular Camera app. If you want to apply a filter to your whole video Top 11 iOS Photo Editing Apps for Tweaks, Filters & Artwork Top 11 iOS Photo Editing Apps for Tweaks, Filters & Artwork There are plenty of free and paid iPhone apps to edit your photos, turn them into artwork, and make you looking stunning — here are our favorites. Read More , tap the three overlapping circles to see the available filters. You can do this before or after you set up your recording. There are seven filters in total. These are not all the same filters built into the Camera app. There are a few overlaps, but the Clips filters are Noir, Instant, Transfer, Fade, Comic, Ink, and Chrome. The Ink and Comic features are a nice touch. Each filter makes your photo or video look like stylized art. These filters are a nice nod to the number of apps used to transform photos and videos this way. Adding Text Frames and Narration Subtitles If you want an overlay with narration or subtitles for your video How To Transcribe A YouTube Video How To Transcribe A YouTube Video Everyone loves watching YouTube videos. But did you know it's incredibly easy to turn them into text files? Read More , you can tap the speech bubble at the top of the screen. This feature transcribes the audio adding a defacto closed captioning. If you would rather add text over specific frames of your video, tap the star icon in the top toolbar. This menu contains word art and shapes you can pop on each section of your video. They have some default text, but you can tap on them to edit the text. There are some basics shapes you can add here as well. When you are in the main menu to either add more video or photos, you can tap the T icon in the toolbar to get full frame text. These options are an easy way to create titles or interstitial frames, allowing you to label the sources or set up the video that follows. Adding Music One of the more impressive features of Clips is the ability to quickly add a soundtrack to your video Need A Soundtrack? Download Free Creative Commons Music [Sound Sunday] Need A Soundtrack? Download Free Creative Commons Music [Sound Sunday] Music is free to download and comes with a Creative Commons license that allows you to share the material, if you give attribution, use it non-commercially, and don't distribute derivatives. Read More . It overlays the audio from your video, though you can mute sections of the video by tapping the speaker icon in the edit view. Tap the musical note in the upper right corner, and you’ll see a choice of music, drawing from selections that Apple has cleared and your personal collection. Adding music from your personal collection comes with some limitations. The only things that I was able to get to show up were music I owned and bought from iTunes. It also needs to be downloaded locally. Apple breaks down their pre-cleared music by theme, with only some of them downloaded. There’s a good variety here, and with enough tracks to ensure that you are not using the same music every few videos. But What Do I Use This For? Clips creates short videos perfect for social networking. Also, it does not care what network you use to upload them. It uses the integrated share sheet in iOS, and anything that can process a video can receive it. You can even send your video as an email attachment, or send it to iCloud Drive What is iCloud Drive & How Does it Work? What is iCloud Drive & How Does it Work?

Use these 6 ways to get notified when your favorite bands are in town. Read More . I played around with the video, but didn’t realise the app had opened a previous project rather than the new one I thought I was creating. This a mistake caused Clips to put the audio at the beginning of the slide show. After I had played around with the app for a while, I figured out how I could have fixed my mistake. Unfortunately, once you delete something from clips, it is gone forever. I used the pictures I took to create a new slide show along with a track I owned from iTunes. My only real complaint about the app is that it does not open ready to create a new video. In a way, this is a tool that frees you from having to use the in-app tools provided by Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. It has a neat interface that facilitates video creation without tying you to a specific service when you finish. Ultra simple editing also makes this a great way to make a short YouTube video.

 Now is the worst time to buy a new MacBook from Apple Kif Leswing May 22, 2017, 2:02 PM 24,007 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty If you're hoping to buy a new Apple laptop, you should wait two weeks before pulling the trigger. On June 5, Apple will kick off its annual developer conference, and it looks as if it might launch some new products in addition to announcing software updates for iPhones, Macs, and Apple Watches. Apple is planning to release three new laptops next month, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Apple may update its MacBook Pro, MacBook, and MacBook Air with new Intel chips, according to the report. It most likely won't be a groundbreaking update, but the new models should be faster than the current ones. The MacBook Air, for example, hasn't been updated since 2015. Apple's other laptops have been updated more recently, but none uses the latest Intel chip. While the new laptops Apple is rumored to launch probably won't sport a redesign, the latest chips would help them last longer before they feel sluggish. And when Apple launches laptops with new chips, the older models often are discounted. So if you're in the market for a new Apple laptop, wait two more weeks — there's a chance it could save you some money. There are also rumors that Apple could launch a new iPad or voice-activated speaker next month, although it's unclear whether Apple plans to do so.

Tim Graham/Getty Images When you stream a song on Spotify, it's delivered in an audio format — imagine these formats to be containers as literal as a phonograph record — cheekily named "Ogg Vorbis." YouTube, one of the most popular music streaming "services" in the world by volume, prefers something called AAC, or "Advanced Audio Coding." Radio stations, whenever possible, tend to prefer lossless WAV files. If you've played music from your hard drive as far back as the early aughts or as recently as this morning, you may have clicked play on an MP3. You'll be able to tomorrow, next week or a decade from now, provided your music player of choice still has the electricity to do so. The Record The MP3 Is Officially Dead, According To Its Creators We've been the source of some confusion on that subject recently. An article published here 11 days ago quoted Bernhard Grill — one of the developers of the MP3 format and also of the AAC format for the German research institution Fraunhofer — saying AAC is technologically superior to the MP3 and also that AAC is one of the most widely used formats for listening today, through its ubiquity within streaming, if nothing else (and there's more). That article's headline oversold Dr. Grill as having characterized the MP3 being dead. It would have been more accurate — and more interesting really — if the writer of that article (the same as this one) wrote that the MP3 may be dying. (That article did say explicitly that people would go on using MP3s, but hey.) To parse this tipping point (and to explore whether we're even in the midst of one) we called Jonathan Sterne — after he reached out to us in response to that earlier article — the author of MP3: The Meaning of a Format and a professor of communication studies at McGill University. As with VHS tapes and cassettes, no format is "dead," as long as the equipment to play it is still alive. The resurgence of vinyl records is illustrative of that point. But the tide seems to have turned — and that turn, like most of media history within capitalism, is complicated by economic interests, advances in technology, an ever-increasingly ephemeral connection to media and, either most or least importantly, the subjectivity of our personal experiences. All of which we explore with Sterne. Fraunhofer's patent on the MP3 may literally be dead, and with it the institution's monetization of it — but there are, as Fraunhofer itself points out, still trillions of MP3s out there. Or, as Sterne explains: "MP3s are still the most widely used audio format in the world." Andrew Flanagan: What does Fraunhofer's patent lapse allow developers to do now that they couldn't do before? Jonathan Sterne: "That's a great question. So... people have a really hard time understanding intellectual property. If you think of it like a trade monopoly, it's really easy to understand. Who has the right to trade in a certain code or perform or record or claim authorship over a song? Things like that, those are trade monopolies. They're not property in the sense of 'If you steal my car I can't use it.' Right? So the patent is a monopoly — which, actually, Fraunhofer didn't fully exercise. First of all, users like me, listening to music at home, never had to pay for the rights to use the MP3 decoding protocols. In fact, if you build a little free software thing that made no money, you also wouldn't have to pay. So there are already unlicensed MP3 encoders and controllers out there." Like LAME. "Yes. So they're not paying Fraunhofer already. But, if Apple puts out an MP3 decoder, they pay Fraunhofer. And that's what's going to stop. Fraunhofer has always maintained that AAC is better than MP3. It's more efficient and, at low bitrates in test situations, people can sometimes hear the difference in terms of fewer coding artifacts and things like that. When you put on earbuds and get on the metro, you won't hear the difference at all." If you're using pretty nice headphones you might? "Not on the Metro. One of the people involved in the MPEG group said it's like when you buy a new home. First, you noticed a nice view out the living room window, and it's only later that you notice a little crack in the window. It's like that. You have to learn to hear the artifacts. "And that's just the way it works. That's true for any new audio or video format, people start noticing things that they didn't used to. Whether those things bother listeners is entirely subjective and it's entirely situational. If you think of the way people listen to music most of the time, to say AAC is better than MP3 — yes, by technical standards, absolutely. If you're sitting in a quiet room paying rapt attention to the music, sure. The minute you put it through earbuds, or go for a walk, or play it in your car, or listen distractedly, those differences matter less and less." At the root of a lot of the feedback I got from the article is the availability of the underlying technology of the MP3. I'm wondering: If the MP3 is not dead but finally free, what is it free to do? "Honestly, I don't think much is going to change. I wouldn't say 'oh the MP3 is finally free and all these things are going to change.' All it's going to happen is Apple is going to stop paying Fraunhofer, or whoever. (I don't actually know that Apple's paying Fraunhofer because I'm not privy to their licensing agreements, but whoever's paying them is going to stop paying.) "That's why I pushed back on the 'MP3 is dead.' It's not like the switch from vinyl to compact disc, where U.S. record distributors stopped accepting returns on unbought records from record stores, at which point stores had to switch over to CDs or take on additional financial risk. There's nothing that Fraunhofer can do to prevent people from using MP3s. "So, since it's the most common form of audio format in the world — right now — a more likely scenario, if you look at the history of audio formats, is that over time its use will continue and then eventually it will decline, like all audio formats before it. It will eventually be replaced by something else, but that won't be because Fraunhofer stopped supporting it. It'll be because something else came along, and people will have a reason to switch either in terms of consumer motivation or because of some digital rights management scheme, or some kind of technological system that is a closed system." So things aren't really going to change, regardless of the patent, or regardless of the availability of superior technology, whether they be OGG or AAC. "So, the one story you get with audio is that there's this inevitable march of progress towards higher definition, and higher definition is better and more realistic — which isn't always true — and that MP3 is some great aberration where we took a step back. That has nothing to do with how the history of audio technologies have actually unfolded. Yes, the CD has much more theoretical dynamic range than an Edison cylinder. Of course. But what you see are, every few decades, format wars, where one format ekes out another, usually because of social conditions, like which players in the industry are more powerful. Or accidental conditions — the reason MP3 took off in the first place was because their shareware program was hacked and people started using MP3 encoding for file sharing — and then companies caught up to it, and Fraunhofer benefitted. They actually didn't very successfully market it. "When things started going well for them, they were able to seize the opportunity. And, you know, they use a lot of money to fund their research. It's not like there's some big corrupt media corporation. It's just that, the minute they invented AAC they said 'this is better.' So they've been saying that for probably, I don't know, 20 years now, give or take. And now they have no financial interest in MP3s carrying on. "So it's a great headline to say MP3 is dead, but they're still all over the Internet, people's hard drives are still full of them. This is really saying like, '45rpm vinyl is dead but 33rpm vinyl continues.' It's a sort of narcissism of small differences." His quote — Bernard Grill's, who helped develop the MP3 and AAC — was that AAC is in such wider use on platforms like YouTube and streaming services. What I took was that it's dead as far as the usefulness from now into the future. "I would totally disagree with that, I think it's totally useful for people who want to listen to their music that they've already acquired or paid for. "You know, I was actually getting e-mails from people saying 'does this mean I have to like, re-encode all of my music or acquire it in some different format?' And that's exactly what you don't want. This sort of media industry model where everybody buys the same movies TV over and over again." Let's make that very clear: MP3 and AAC are free for any user (not company) to take advantage of. "Yes, absolutely. I mean the reason why the free software people didn't like MP3 was because it was tied to royalties and Fraunhofer, whereas OGG was completely open source, anybody could use it anyone could contribute to it." The MP3 and other formats are based on some psychoacoustic assumptions that I was told last year were at least mildly off the mark. "Any psychoacoustic assumption is a generalization, because we're all walking around with two sets of ears and one brain, and psychoacoustics are all based on aggregate data populations. And in some cases, weird populations. So like 20Hz to 20kHz — the frequency range for 'normal' hearing, is based on research done on New York City schoolchildren. My colleague Mara Mills has written about that. "The original psychoacoustic assumptions that Karlheinz Brandenburg tried to code into the OCF, which was the format before MP3, he took out of Eberhard Zwicker's book Psychoacoustics — he literally took those numbers and put them into the software. And they sounded terrible. The reason they sounded terrible is because psychoacousticians do tests using tones or noise bursts, and MP3 was designed to encode speech and music. And so they started doing this basic research to say: 'If we tweak it this way, do the cymbals sound worse or better? If we tweak it this way, does the articulation of the voice get muddier or clearer?' "A lot of the things that people complain about with MP3s are not the result of the removal of data but rather the imprint of the format on that sound. So things like changes to the stereo image, that's not a result of removing data, that's the result of the way the format codes. "So yeah, it's always a compromise, and especially as you get to lower bit rates, you're asking the algorithm to basically choose. 'Where is the stuff people are least likely to miss?' And it can guess wrong, because it's an algorithm, not a person. And it has limited information. What's amazing is how well the MP3 worked, and that speaks I think to the standardization of recording, and audio, and radio sound across the world. People expect well-recorded or well-broadcast sound to sound a certain way, regardless of where it comes from and what genre it is." Now I'm wondering about the end game of fidelity. "If you look at history, which is really the only empirical evidence we have, sound fidelity has been used to market new audio formats basically since the invention of the cylinder phonograph. So in 1878 you can find articles saying that Edison's tinfoil phonograph reproduces sound with perfect fidelity. So there's always the story where we're at 'the end stage of high-definition,' and that greater definition will bring people greater musical pleasure. "What actually happens is the aesthetics switch — so people want more bass, they want less bass, they want more high-end, they want less high-end. People talk about how 'organic' [vinyl] records sound, but of course every record, in the U.S. anyways, goes through the RIAA curve. So it is in fact a highly processed and arbitrary and standardized sound, in exactly the same way that WAV or AIFF or MP3 is. So it's been a successful technique for marketing audio. "The second thing is, I want audio engineers and record industry professionals to care about audio quality. Does that mean that higher audio quality will save the music industry (which is still highly profitable, it's just not as profitable as it was)? Does it mean that it will get more young people interested in paying for music? Does it mean that the people who pay for music will pay more for music? I think that's a social question. The person who buys the nicer speakers for their home stereo is going to be interested in this. The person that's like, playing music out of their telephone speaker in the back of the bus for their friend, this isn't going to make any difference to." It might be apocryphal, but it reminds me of that Steve Jobs quote. They don't know what high-fidelity is until they hear it. "And when they do, they may or may not care. This has been true since the term high-fidelity was invented. And it's independent of love for music. You can find people who are incredibly devoted to classical music and listen to it out of a small six-inch mono speaker on a desktop radio. That's fine for them, and they will tell you they love the music. They might even go to the symphony and give money. High fidelity isn't part of their experience. High definition has sold more TVs lately, but is it going to sell more music, is it going to save the music industry? I don't know. Probably not." There was a lot of, I think, misinterpretation of the article, from open information advocates and open source software advocates. I was curious if the availability of the source code for most of these formats has been pretty widespread for almost two decades. What are they missing out on? "I mean, I think it's just a matter of ethical commitments, that software that's widely used ought to be ought to be... well first of all, it ought to be free. It ought to be freely available to modify yourself. I mean, I'm sympathetic, but I'm not a member of that community. I use plenty of proprietary software in my daily life. So I can't claim to be an authentic open source person and I don't code." Like Richard Stallman. "Yeah no, I'm certainly not Richard Stallman. The kernel of it is this, and I think that this is true for all technology, which is that a more democratic technology is a technology that you as a user, even if you don't understand it, you have the potential to understand it, repair it and modify it. Where the inner workings of the technology are not controlled by a third party over whom you have no power and on whom you are dependent. "I wrote a paper with Dylan Mulvin on the history of the switch from monochrome to color TV in the 1950s. In the 1950s the US government told the TV industry — remember that the broadcast bandwidth is a public resource and it's managed by the government, they control the national television system. The government said sure, by all means move to color, but you can't change the standard in such a way that you will force people to buy new televisions. Completely different business model from Apple releasing a new iPhone every year to get you to buy a new one. "In Europe they have things like extended product responsibility, where companies are legally liable for the disposal of the products that they produce. In the software world like it seems like this is all just about code, but of course code runs on hardware you need something to run it. And so every time you obsolete a standard, that's a chance for a company to either force or try to persuade someone to buy something new, which means something else is likely to go into a landfill." Which brings us back to the MP3. "Yes, it does."

When you stream a song on Spotify, it's delivered in an audio format — imagine these formats to be containers as literal as a phonograph record — cheekily named "Ogg Vorbis." YouTube, one of the most popular music streaming "services" in the world by volume, prefers something called AAC, or "Advanced Audio Coding." Radio stations, whenever possible, tend to prefer lossless WAV files. If you've played music from your hard drive as far back as the early aughts or as recently as this morning, you may have clicked play on an MP3.

The latest flyover drone video of Apple Park has made its way to the web, which shows just how massive the spaceship has become just days before its first residents are expected to move in. The clip has captured the curved glass panels that are being installed around the 2.8 million-square-foot main building and the large courtyard area that will boast thousands of drought-resistant trees. Scroll down for video  It is a stunning scene – the sun setting over what Steve Jobs had called ‘the best office building in the world’.

Share this article Share KEY FEATURES OF THE SPACESHIP-LIKE CAMPUS  Appearing as a giant saucer, the Silicon Valley site near the 280 Highway will be home to 13,000 Apple employees.  There will be jogging and cycling trails, with more than a thousand bikes kept on site at all times, which staff can use to make their way around.  The Spaceship will have 360-degree curved glass fronted walls and central courtyard as well as a 1,000-seater auditorium, a gym and 300,000 square feet of 'research' space.  Apple Campus 2 will additionally have underground parking hidden from view, meaning 80 per cent of the site can be covered in trees.  The site was previously owned by Hewlett Packard and the majority of the area is currently covered in asphalt.  Elsewhere underground, the auditorium will be where Apple's CEO Tim Cook will present the companies keynotes ahead of product launches, for example.  This auditorium will be covered with a circular glass pavilion that will also be an access point for employees and guests.  Natural gas will, primarily, provide the building's power and the local energy grid will only be accessed in emergencies.  The glass structure will also be fitted with solar panels.  The circular, four-story building will be around a mile in circumference and a third of a mile wide and was recently described by the San Francisco Weekly as a 'massive glass doughnut'.  The building stays eco-friendly with natural ventilation that works instead of air-conditioning for 70 percent of the year, low energy LED lighting where natural light doesn't reach, and on-site recycling. The video shows parts of the spaceship lighting up as the sun starts to go down and although the main building looks near complete, the landscape suggests otherwise. Parts of the campus still looks very much like a construction zone- there are mounds of dirt and empty space that should be filled with lush vegetation. Wired had shared earlier this month that the area will welcome its visitors with artificial hills, a mini-forest that will eventually contain 9,000 drought-resistant indigenous trees, and a 'breathing building' powered by 805,000-square-feet of solar paneling.  The building will be home to scores of glass-encased 'pods' designed for the many different activities that will take place within its walls, from work and collaboration to socializing. Jobs' vision of the campus saw harmony between nature outside and the building itself, and to ensure the right flora would be perfect, he sought out tree expert David Muffly It seems the firm has finished the massive underground parking garage, as the tunnel that leads to it appears to be lit (pictured). The underground parking will allow the campus to be filled 80 percent with trees But as of now, it still appears to be under construction. The project is estimated to cost a staggering $5 billion (£4 billion), and it isn't hard to see why; stunning new images shared to the web had revealed the unimaginable attention to detail at work in the nearly completed 'Apple Park' campus, giving rise to everything from specially crafted door handles to a 'building that breathes.' APPLE'S PATENTED PIZZA BOX  The building will have a massive four-story atrium as its café, which will have four-story glass doors that will open up on nice days so employees can eat outside. The Apple Park café will make use of Apple's patented pizza box, as well (pictured) In 2012, Apple published a patent for a special food container that requires no assembly before use, and will minimize storage space. It would have several uses, including the storing and transport of food 'in any shape and size,' from eggs and fruits to meat products, or to store got foods such as pizza. And, it could prevent pizza from becoming soggy. 'In one embodiment, the elevated portion can take the form of concentric rings that elevate the pizza from the bottom surface of the container,' the patent explains. 'Elevating the pizza from the bottom surface ensures that any steam that is emitted from the bottom of the pizza can flow away from the bottom of the pizza. 'Allowing such steam to flow away from the bottom of the pizza prevents moisture from becoming trapped between the pizza and the bottom surface of the container and subsequently reabsorbed by the pizza causing it to get soggy.' According to Wired, the campus will also have a 100,000 square-foot Fitness and Wellness Center – and, this will contain a two-story yoga room built from distressed stone from 'the right quarry in Kansas,' to mimic the stone at Jobs' favorite Yosemite hotel.  Appearing as a giant saucer, the Silicon Valley site near the 280 Highway will be home to 13,000 Apple employees. Inside the circular building, each floor will be lined with fins called 'canopies,' which will be equipped with soffits on the under that will allow the Ring to 'inhale' air. And, shafts placed elsewhere will allow it to exhale warm air to the outside The video shows parts of the spaceship lighting up as the sun starts to go down and although the main building looks near complete, the landscape suggests otherwise.

THE OBSESSION WITH DETAIL INSIDE 'APPLE PARK'  Construction on Apple's futuristic campus has been estimated to cost roughly $5 billion.  Apple has specified every part of the project with rules for contractors, and features include:  'Breathing building' that uses soffits beneath the canopies to inhale, and shafts to exhale warm air - as Steve Jobs hated air conditioning and fans Artificial hills and a mini-forest of 9,000 native trees, all drought-resistant with hopes they can 'survive a climate crisis' with some hand picked by Jobs  100,000-square-foot Fitness and Wellness Center (including a two-story yoga room made of distressed stone to look like Steve Jobs favorite Yosemite hotel) Canopies (fins along the glass) on every floor to help the building 'breathe'  A cafe with four-story glass doors that will open up on nice days so employees can eat outside   Pods' designed for the many different activities that will take place within its walls, from work and collaboration to socializing  1,000-seat Steve Jobs Theater 805,000 square-feet of solar paneling 755-foot tunnel adorned with thousands of tiny white tiles Shock absorbers to withstand earthquakes Offices panelled with 'custom timber veneer' from recycled wood - and guidelines for the special wood used frequently throughout the building ran to some 30 pages Patented pizza boxes to keep food from getting soggy Contractors were told no vents or pipes could be reflected in the glass The clip has captured the curved glass panels that are being installed around the 2.8 million-square-foot main building and the large courtyard area that will boast thousands of drought-resistant trees The campus is something of an exception to the trend of radically open offices aimed at fostering collaboration, said Louise Mozingo, a professor and chair of the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning at University of California, Berkeley Jobs' vision of the campus saw harmony between nature outside and the building itself, and to ensure the right flora would be perfect, he sought out tree expert David Muffly. Apple hopes that the campus will be finished by spring this year. Since Apple unveiled its plans in 2011, the move-in date has slowly receded. Jobs' initial projection was 2015, but this spring now seems most likely, according to people involved in the project. Apple hopes that the campus will be finished by spring this year.

Apple recently became the first American company to cross the $800 billion mark. An analyst ponders how long until it hits $1 trillion. By Emily Bary May 22, 2017 12:35 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Illustration: Getty Images Apple recently hit a big milestone when it became the first company to reach an $800 billion market value. Investors now have their sights on bigger goals. On Monday, one analyst outlined a path for the company to hit $1 trillion over the next 12 to 18 months. More from Barron’s Next Why Mobile Wallets Are a Rare Struggle for Apple What Warren Buffett Learned About the iPhone at Dairy Queen iPhone Users Have Seen the Galaxy and They’re Not Impressed A number of factors could propel Apple to the $1 trillion mark, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani wrote. They include higher prices for iPhones, increased profitability as “services” become a bigger portion of the business, and more share repurchases, which serve to boost how much money the company makes on a per-share basis. Together, these developments could send Apple shares up to about $192, Daryanani argued, which would make the company worth a trillion. [Get more smart takes on the companies you care about. Sign up for the Barron’s Next daily newsletter.] Apple would be the first to reach the mark, and it has a pretty sizable lead on the companies behind it. Immediately trailing Apple are a host of tech companies, including Google-parent Alphabet, which is the only one even in the vicinity. It has a market value of $653 billion. Next up are Microsoft ($523 billion), Amazon.com ($459 billion) and Facebook ($429 billion). Apple has a far wider lead on some other much-hyped tech companies. The company is now worth approximately 33 Snaps and 60 Twitters. The social networks are worth $24 billion and $13 billion, respectively.

The news comes courtesy of a Hacker News thread discussing Apple's default scrolling behavior vs. the scrolling behavior of webpages that use Google AMP, a discussion inspired by a Daring Fireball post on the subject. Google AMP (or Accelerated Mobile Pages), for those unfamiliar, is an online publishing format created by Google that's optimized for mobile web browsing and rapid page loading. It is used by multiple news sites, including CNN, ABC, and The Washington Post. On mobile Safari, AMP uses its own scrolling behavior, making AMP pages stand out from non-AMP pages. In the Hacker News discussion, Malte Ubl, who created Google AMP, says the AMP team filed a bug report about the scrolling discrepancy, and as a result, Apple is going to implement a change that makes all webpages scroll like AMP pages. With respect to scrolling: We (AMP team) filed a bug with Apple about that (we didn't implement scrolling ourselves, just use a div with overflow). We asked to make the scroll inertia for that case the same as the normal scrolling. Apple's response was (surprisingly) to make the default scrolling like the overflow scrolling. So, with the next Safari release all pages will scroll like AMP pages.Another Hacker News responder, "Om2," who appears to work on WebKit, explains that Safari webpage scrolling is inconsistent from all other scrolling, an intentional decision implemented several years ago. Following a review of scrolling rates, Apple has decided to implement a change to introduce a more consistent scrolling experience. In current iOS Safari, webpage scrolling is inconsistent from all other scrolling on the system. This was an intentional decision made long ago. In addition, overflow areas are consistent with the rest of the system, and thus inconsistent with top-level webpage scrolling. This is semi-accidental. In reviewing scroll rates, we concluded that the original reason was no longer a good tradeoff. Thus this change, which removed all the inconsistencies: https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/211197/webkit Having all scrolling be consistent feels good once you get used to it.At the current time, the difference between scrolling on an AMP page and a standard webpage is noticeable, with the AMP pages scrolling faster and more smoothly. It's not entirely clear when the scrolling change will be implemented in mobile Safari, as the new scrolling behavior is not available in the current iOS 10.3.3 beta.

Rating: 37 Votes dontwalkhand 12 hours ago at 11:51 am How about Google AMP just go away? Links never work and I always accidentally scroll sideways and get a totally different page. Stop Google from trying to make itself the internet. Rating: 17 Votes d5aqoëp 12 hours ago at 12:00 pm AMP should be destroyed. I think Google has done it intentionally to cripple the browsing experience on iOS phones. Now Google is pointing fingers at Apple for AMP being buggy! Well Google, stop shoving your crap down our throats. I have actually stopped browsing on macrumours from my iPhone. The comments were not loading on articles. AMP scrolling reminds me of the terrible Android scrolling experience. You are either at the top or bottom of the page. No in-between. Rating: 8 Votes campyguy 12 hours ago at 12:07 pm I'd prefer a "Disable AMP" in the Safari app Settings to go along with a definable scroll behavior. Rating: 7 Votes bboucher790 13 hours ago at 11:24 am So Safari will FINALLY become more snappy! I used to use a jailbreak tweak that allowed for faster scrolling. I never realized how slow scrolling was in Safari by default, until I installed this tweak. I'm surprised that Apple doesn't allow scrolling speed customization. Rating: 7 Votes HarryT 12 hours ago at 11:47 am I must be blind. What's the difference in scrolling? Tried both the AMP page and macrumors.com and thought scrolling was the same on both (iPhone 7 Plus latest iOS). Rating: 6 Votes d5aqoëp 13 hours ago at 11:34 am I HATE the scrolling in AMP pages and tap the chain icon to load full page just for Apple's awesome scrolling. But it would be damn funny to know that Apple wants to regress in this area and join the ranks of Android for inaccurate and uncontrolled web-page scrolling.

What the heck is the point of displaying the mobile or "responsive tablet" site on a 1024x768 HiDPI or larger screen? Especially on the 1366x1024 HiDPI screen of the 12.9" - it was a major factor in me going back to my iPad mini. If I'm going to lug around the 12.9" iPad Pro, it should at least offer the same web experience as my 12" rMB, which has a lower default HiDPI resolution of 1280x800, but fits more on the screen and gets a proper desktop layout?!?

Universal Secure Registry alleges the company and founder Kenneth Weiss "was the first in the space, and the secure payment technology that [Weiss] developed goes right to the core of Apple Pay." Read: Apple Pay Vs PayPal: Apple's Digital Wallet Could Be The Next Big Thing For Luxury Fashion Markets Universal Secure Registry claims Weiss met with Visa in 2010 to propose working together on a mobile payment system. Universal Secure Registry owns several patents related to mobile payments, including authentication systems and the use of biometric tools for fingerprint identification. As the New York Times noted, Weiss said Visa had assigned engineers to explore the technology but did not come to a formal agreement with Universal Secure Registry. Weiss had also reached out to Apple, but never met with the company. However, Apple and Visa eventually partnered up with MasterCard and American Express to launch Apple Pay. The mobile payment option, which launched in 2014, can tie a credit or debit card to your iPhone and it can be used to make payments at stores or other locations. To do so, you simply have to tap your iPhone onto a checkout console at a store and the smartphone will remotely make the payment from your personal account. Universal Secure Registry is represented in the suit by law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. Previously, Quinn Emanuel represented Samsung in its own long-running lawsuit against Apple over its patent dispute over features used on its Google Android-based smartphones. In a statement, Weiss said outside litigation was Universal Secure Registry’s remaining and best option to protect its patents from outside abuse. "It is not uncommon for large companies to be unresponsive to outside suggestions for innovation or improvements to their product or technology," Weiss said. "Occasionally, these companies infringe patents and force a patent owner to file a lawsuit as the only way to financially benefit from the technology he invented." Apple Pay has been a major part of Apple’s iPhone releases since it was first introduced on the iPhone 6, but the feature has struggled to maintain major market penetration. While the service did around $36 billion in transactions during 2016, only around 13 percent of iPhone users are estimated to use the service regularly. For many retailers and buyers, the upsides of Apple Pay have not necessarily been enough to justify either replacing checkout hardware or replacing a standard credit or debit card. Apple has also seen competition in the space from Samsung Pay, which is tied to Sansung's own Galaxy series of smartphones. Read: Apple Looking Into Launching Venmo-Like Money Transfer Service Earlier this year, Apple reportedly was looking to supplement Apple Pay with a Venmo-like side feature that would allow iPhone users to transfer cash directly to and from one another. This new service reportedly would come alongside a debit card-like feature for iPhone users. Join the Discussion Most Read The Newsletter Exclusive articles delivered to your inbox daily.

Scroll down for video  An image of a PowerPoint presentation has revealed the Touch ID could be placed on the back, just underneath the Apple logo - putting to rest the many rumors that said it would be under the display IPHONE 8 RUMORS   Several rumors have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have:  - Dual-lens 3D camera  - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings  - Curved glass casing - Plastic OLED screen  - Wireless charging   - New 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimeter) models with a wraparound OLED screen - 5.8 inch will be designed with the Touch ID finger print sensor 'under the glass or on the back  - Aluminum back will be replaced with two reinforced glass panes and a metal frame in the middle  - Facial recognition -Premium model could cost $1,000 The image was posted to Slashleaks, which highlights a slide from a PowerPoint presentation dating back to March 3, Apple Insider reported.

These details coincide with a leak from March 29th of an image claiming to be ‘a late stage iPhone 8 prototype’, which showed the home button also on the back and underneath the Apple logo. If these reports are true, this method could allow the firm to add facial recognition to the device. The 'prototype' image was obtained by iDropNews ‘from a source with intimate knowledge of Apple’s manufacturing facility’. The anonymous source from Foxconn noted that other leaks floating around the web do look similar to the final product, but with a few exceptions..

The note had also stated that the smartphone will boast an OLED display, 3D sensors and augmented reality technologies. Regarding Apple's highly anticipated next generation phone was revealed to CNBC by Simona Jankowski. The reposition of the Touch ID is mainly to make room for the edge-to-edge screen and other cutting edge components  in the iPhone 8(artist impression) LARGER BATTERY  Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has revealed that Apple plans to put a larger battery in the 4.7-inch iPhone 8.  Kuo explained that it will be designed with a 2,700 mAh battery - putting its battery capacity on par with the iPhone 7 Plus.  Another feature rumored to appear in Apple's next iPhone is a larger 'L' shaped battery (middle', which would put battery capacity on par with the iPhone 7 Plus Will use a 'substrate-like PCB mainboard', which will allow the firm to implement an OLED display in the flagship handset.  The new components are believed to be much more expensive in anything used in an iPhone before, which could increase manufacturing costs by 80 percent.  However, it was revealed last week that iOS users should expect to pay a hefty price tag for their next iPhone. 'The first $1,000 iPhone can drive meaningful upside,' Jankowski wrote in a note to clients Thursday. 'The bottom line is that we are raising our FY18/19 EPS estimates further above consensus 'We think the higher demand for the larger (5.8″) form factor will be supported by the fact that the iPhone 8 will have compelling new features not available in the smaller form factors,' she wrote. She predicted that the 128GB will go for $999, but the 256GB will boast a $1,099 price tag – Apple's most expensive iPhone, the 128GB iPhone 7, is only $749. A research note shared by a Goldman Sachs analyst this month had suggested that the 256GB iPhone 8 (artist impression) will cost consumers $1,099  'We think the higher demand for the larger (5.8') form factor will be supported by the fact that the iPhone 8 will have compelling new features not available in the smaller form factors,' Jankowski wrote. ‘The production level of development on various models are being done such as the models with IPS TFT, AMOLED, the model with or without home button, in addition to the models with a new glass, aluminum chassis, white ceramics etc.’ However, the report also noted that Apple has decided on a few features, which includes a 5-inch display, dual-cameras and wireless charging capabilities.   Read more: Here's Why Apple's 10th Anniversary iPhone Will Likely Cost More Than $1,000 | Fast Company | Business + Innovation Apple News on iPhone, iPad and Macbooks | Daily Mail Online ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿iPhone Edition¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ | Rumor | Mac ...

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background.

Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile iPhone 8’s brand new design shown off again in new photos Image Source: Moe Slah, ConceptsiPhone Zach Epstein @zacharye May 22nd, 2017 at 12:09 PM Share Tweet We still have about four months to go before Apple finally unveils its next-generation iPhone lineup in September. Of course if history has taught us anything, we’ll know practically everything there is to know about Apple’s new iPhones long before the company’s big announcement event comes along. Months of consistent leaks and rumors led up to BGR’s big exclusive last week, where we published photos of a mockup believed by sources to depict Apple’s final iPhone 8 design. Now, new photos of a similar mockup have appeared from a different source, providing possible further reinforcement that this is indeed what Apple’s hotly anticipated new iPhone 8 will look like when it launches later this year. Don't Miss: This is the iPhone of our dreams and it probably won’t ever exist There are some characteristics of Apple’s upcoming next-generation flagship iPhone that are still open to debate. For example, the rumor mill still seems unsure if the iPhone 8 will feature a new Touch ID fingerprint scanner that’s embedded in the display, or if it’ll be shifted to the back of the phone instead. We certainly hope the former is the case, because the latter would be awful. Of course, there’s plenty of info out there that everyone seems to agree on, such as the vertical dual-lens rear camera, the glass back for wireless charging, and the stainless steel midframe with polished edges that will continue the lines of the curved 2.5D glass around the perimeter of the phone. Now, all of those characteristics can be seen again in newly leaked photos showing an iPhone 8 mockup that matches the one we posted last week. The new photos were shared on Chinese microblogging site Weibo, and you can see them below. Apple’s iPhone 8 isn’t expected to be unveiled until September, of course, but we’ll undoubtedly learn plenty more about the phone between now and then.

Governor Ballots and Bills Economic Development Articles: Political Opinion Business Finance NonProfit Entertainment Events Tech Top Cities Los Angeles News San Diego News San Francisco News National Home National News Desk According to dr.fone, the FBI Can’t Find Anything on Your iPhone, Even Spending $900,000+ According to dr.fone, the FBI Can’t Find Anything on Your iPhone, Even Spending $900,000+ By Valerie Gotten - May 22, 2017 11:08 AM PDT 479 SHARE Facebook Twitter LONDON, UK, May 22, 2017 (SEND2PRESS NEWSWIRE) — For many, Apple’s iPhone is the number one choice for security and safety of user data, says dr.fone toolkit. It’s been widely accepted for many years that Apple puts privacy high on the agenda when it comes to its operating systems and smart devices. So the tech world was taken by surprise in 2016 when following the San Bernardino terrorist attack, the FBI commissioned a private company to “hack” the suspect’s iPhone – a figure that reportedly totalled $900,000! Whilst Apple’s security clearly stands up to the test, there are a number of ways user data can be vulnerable to hackers. 1) ICloud — Useful as it is in the event of loss or corrupted data, automatically backing your iPhone up to an iCloud account can leave you open to having your information exploited. Having your images, videos and other important data sitting in your iCloud account can be hacked considerably easier than your device itself. 2) ITunes — Many Apple users fail to realise how dangerous a hacked iTunes account can be. As with an iCloud account, iTunes copies information and data from your device and stores it on iTunes. Hackers are able to find this data and exploit it to identify your purchased music, videos and films along with more worrying data such as credit and debit card details. 3) Recently deleted items — Despite believing deleted data is gone for good, recently deleted data such as photos and videos does not get fully deleted. In fact it simply gets moved to another location where it can still be accessed. So the burning question is simply, how can I enhance my privacy and secure my data? Thankfully, there are a number of steps that can be taken to ensure your data remains safe. * Disable iCloud back-up, to disable iCloud backup users can go to ‘settings’ and tap ‘Apple ID.’ Scroll right to the bottom of the page and selecting ‘sign out’, then type in your password and then tap ‘turn off’ at the bottom of the page. * The other option is to delete iTunes backup files to prevent them getting into the wrong hands. Within iTunes click ‘preferences’ and then ‘devices’ before selecting the back-up file you’d like to remove. Click ‘delete back-up’ and your data will no longer be stored. However, although there are some easy and effective steps to take, software developer Wondershare have now launched dr.fone – iOS Full Data Eraser to guarantee a complete and irrecoverable wipe of all Apple iPhone data from a device. Now featured as part of the dr.fone toolkit, the iOS Full Data Eraser module is the ultimate solution for permanently wiping all data from iPhones — that the FBI cannot recover. This is a simple but effective way to boost your security. After connecting the iPhone via the USB device, users can fully erase the device in only a few simple steps.

Merrill Lynch reckoning, Apple is 40% more ‘valuable’ than the Windy City, lagging only L.A. and N.Y. MarketWatch photo illustration/Getty Images By RyanVlastelica Markets reporter If Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook wanted to, he could, in a sense, make the Windy City his new corporate headquarters—all of it. Technology companies have grown so large that they’ve surpassed the economic values of major American cities, according to data from Bank of America–Merrill Lynch, which compared company market capitalizations to metropolitan gross domestic product. At current levels, Apple Inc’s AAPL, +0.61% market capitalization of about $803 billion is 38% larger than the real GDP of Chicago, $581 billion in 2016. Apple isn’t the only Silicon Valley notable to top Chicago (and all other U.S. cities save two), either. Google parent Alphabet GOOGL, +0.99% has a market capitalization of $657.9 billion, making its pockets about 13% deeper than the GDP of the home of deep-dish pizza. While Alphabet’s market valuation is a ways from topping the GDP of either of the country’s other two biggest cities, Apple’s market cap is less than 4% away from surpassing the GDP of Los Angeles, which had a real GDP of $832 billion last year and was the second biggest city in the country by this metric. The iPhone maker has its work cut out for it, however, if its market value is to exceed the GDP of New York City. Apple, in fact, would need to grow in market cap by about 85% for that figure to top the Big Apple‘s GDP, checking in last year at the eye-popping level of $1.483 trillion. While some analysts speculate that Apple could surpass $1 trillion in market cap within 12 to 18 months—itself an unprecedented feat—the City That Never Sleeps can rest easy for a while. Even if you combine Apple’s and Alphabet’s market values, New York’s GDP figure would stand 2% above. Still, the combined $1.54 trillion value of the two companies is bigger than the financial sectors in Japan and the eurozone, which total $1.31 trillion. B. of A. Merrill called this a “breathtaking valuation stat.” The table below, which doesn’t account for Monday’s market action—both Apple and Alphabet were higher on the day—shows how other companies stack up to U.S. cities in this market caps–vs.–municipal GDPs comparison. Shares of Apple are up nearly 33% so far this year and are up 61.5% over the past 12 months. Alphabet is up 21% in 2017, and its value has grown by a third over the past year.

Merrill Lynch reckoning, Apple is 40% more ‘valuable’ than the Windy City, lagging only L.A. and N.Y. MarketWatch photo illustration/Getty Images By RyanVlastelica Markets reporter If Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook wanted to, he could, in a sense, make the Windy City his new corporate headquarters—all of it. Technology companies have grown so large that they’ve surpassed the economic values of major American cities, according to data from Bank of America–Merrill Lynch, which compared company market capitalizations to metropolitan gross domestic product. At current levels, Apple Inc’s AAPL, +0.61% market capitalization of about $803 billion is 38% larger than the real GDP of Chicago, $581 billion in 2016. Apple isn’t the only Silicon Valley notable to top Chicago (and all other U.S. cities save two), either. Google parent Alphabet GOOGL, +0.99% has a market capitalization of $657.9 billion, making its pockets about 13% deeper than the GDP of the home of deep-dish pizza. While Alphabet’s market valuation is a ways from topping the GDP of either of the country’s other two biggest cities, Apple’s market cap is less than 4% away from surpassing the GDP of Los Angeles, which had a real GDP of $832 billion last year and was the second biggest city in the country by this metric. The iPhone maker has its work cut out for it, however, if its market value is to exceed the GDP of New York City. Apple, in fact, would need to grow in market cap by about 85% for that figure to top the Big Apple‘s GDP, checking in last year at the eye-popping level of $1.483 trillion. While some analysts speculate that Apple could surpass $1 trillion in market cap within 12 to 18 months—itself an unprecedented feat—the City That Never Sleeps can rest easy for a while. Even if you combine Apple’s and Alphabet’s market values, New York’s GDP figure would stand 2% above. Still, the combined $1.54 trillion value of the two companies is bigger than the financial sectors in Japan and the eurozone, which total $1.31 trillion. B. of A. Merrill called this a “breathtaking valuation stat.” The table below, which doesn’t account for Monday’s market action—both Apple and Alphabet were higher on the day—shows how other companies stack up to U.S. cities in this market caps–vs.–municipal GDPs comparison. Shares of Apple are up nearly 33% so far this year and are up 61.5% over the past 12 months. Alphabet is up 21% in 2017, and its value has grown by a third over the past year.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman According to dr.fone, FBI Can’t Find Anything on Your iPhone, Even with $900,000 or More LONDON, UK, May 22, 2017 (SEND2PRESS NEWSWIRE) — For many, Apple’s iPhone is the number one choice for security and safety of user data, says dr.fone toolkit. It’s been widely accepted for many years that Apple puts privacy high on the agenda when it comes to its operating systems and smart devices. So the tech world was taken by surprise in 2016 when following the San Bernardino terrorist attack, the FBI commissioned a private company to “hack” the suspect’s iPhone – a figure that reportedly totalled $900,000! Whilst Apple’s security clearly stands up to the test, there are a number of ways user data can be vulnerable to hackers. 1) ICloud — Useful as it is in the event of loss or corrupted data, automatically backing your iPhone up to an iCloud account can leave you open to having your information exploited. Having your images, videos and other important data sitting in your iCloud account can be hacked considerably easier than your device itself. 2) ITunes — Many Apple users fail to realise how dangerous a hacked iTunes account can be. As with an iCloud account, iTunes copies information and data from your device and stores it on iTunes. Hackers are able to find this data and exploit it to identify your purchased music, videos and films along with more worrying data such as credit and debit card details. 3) Recently deleted items — Despite believing deleted data is gone for good, recently deleted data such as photos and videos does not get fully deleted. In fact it simply gets moved to another location where it can still be accessed. So the burning question is simply, how can I enhance my privacy and secure my data? Thankfully, there are a number of steps that can be taken to ensure your data remains safe. Disable iCloud back-up, to disable iCloud backup users can go to ‘settings’ and tap ‘Apple ID.’ Scroll right to the bottom of the page and selecting ‘sign out’, then type in your password and then tap ‘turn off’ at the bottom of the page. The other option is to delete iTunes backup files to prevent them getting into the wrong hands. Within iTunes click ‘preferences’ and then ‘devices’ before selecting the back-up file you’d like to remove. Click ‘delete back-up’ and your data will no longer be stored. However, although there are some easy and effective steps to take, software developer Wondershare have now launched dr.fone – iOS Full Data Eraser to guarantee a complete and irrecoverable wipe of all Apple iPhone data from a device. Now featured as part of the dr.fone toolkit, the iOS Full Data Eraser module is the ultimate solution for permanently wiping all data from iPhones — that the FBI cannot recover. This is a simple but effective way to boost your security. After connecting the iPhone via the USB device, users can fully erase the device in only a few simple steps. To find out more about the brand new iOS Full Data Eraser module in the dr.fone toolkit, please visit https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-full-data-eraser.html About dr.fone toolkit: dr.fone is the world’s leading specialist in iOS/Android data erasing software specifically for Apple/Android Phones.

The new bands work with any Apple Watch model, not just with the special-edition Apple Watch Nike+ collection, and are made from a flexible fluoroelastomer material that’s lightweight and perforated for ventilation and sweat management, like other Sports bands. The new bands are priced at $49 each as with other Sports bands. They’ll be available via Nike’s online and retail stores on June 1, and Apple.com, select Apple Authorized Resellers and select specialty and department stores in early June. The new Air VaporMax Flyknit “Day to Night” running shoe collection celebrates runners whenever they choose to run: at twilight, sunset and everything in between. Each of the new (previously unavailable) band colors is inspired by a shade of the sky, from dawn to dusk, according to the apparel giant. The new band collection was designed to allow runners to “make a statement by matching their Apple Watch Nike+ bands to their footwear,” reads the press release. Nike’s new running shoe collection launches next Thursday, June 1, at 10am, priced at $190. In April 2017, Apple and NikeLab launched another limited-edition Apple Watch in the form of Apple Watch NikeLab, which pairs a Space Gray aluminum case with a new Light Bone band in a creamy color combination with black perforations. Nike’s new Light Bone/Black band combination for Apple Watch NikeLab coordinates nicely with their similarly neutral-toned “Oreo” and “White/Blue” VaporMax sneakers. watchOS 3.2 added some new unique face colors, including the new band-matching Blue Orbit and Violet Dust options for Apple Watch Nike+ wearers and Camellia, Flamingo, Pollen, Mist Blue, Azure and Pebble as the new watch face color options for all Apple Watch models. Nike began selling standalone versions of its unique Sports bands for Apple Watch earlier this year. Last but not least, earlier this month the company began selling iPhone 7 cases based on its Rosche and Air Force 1 sneakers, priced at $35 each. Apple recently refreshed its own band lineup for Apple Watch with some interesting new Spring-themed straps.

By Gene Munster Updated May 22, 2017 1:44 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Gene Munster is a founding partner with venture capital firm Loup Ventures. Illustration: Rebecca Dilley [Editor's note: Gene Munster was for many years a sell-side stock analyst with Piper Jaffray covering Apple stock. Recently, he moved on to form his own venture capital firm, Loup Ventures, investing in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and augmented reality. Munster still keeps an eye on Apple, and today he offers up his opinion on why the shares deserve to trade up to $1 trillion in market capitalization. With Apple having 5.26 billion shares outstanding as of the last earnings report, that would imply a share price of $190, 24% above today's $153.83. Full disclosure, Munster owns a position in Apple shares worth about $30,000.] Apple’s (AAPL) market cap crossed $800 billion for the first time two weeks ago. Not long ago, we predicted that Apple would be the world's first trillion-dollar company. We've had ups and downs since then, but now we're closer than ever. We think Apple deserves the largest valuation of any company in history. Investors are finally giving the company credit for its defensible, recurring business of selling high margin hardware and software, layering in services revenue growing in the high-teens. While not a traditional recurring business with quarter-to-quarter predictability, 600 million+ iPhone customers with 96%+ satisfaction rates generate predicable revenues over longer periods of time. Year-to-date, shares of AAPL are up 32.8% vs the Nasdaq at 13.8%, as of this writing. A key reason for the stock’s outperformance is mounting expectations for the iPhone X coming this fall, which should reaccelerate growth in the iPhone business. We expect iPhone units to be up around 7%, year over year, for the iPhone X cycle (fiscal year 2018), and flattish in 2019 and 2020. The stock currently trades at about 15 times forward EPS, which is in line with historical multiples of  about 16 times heading into new iPhone cycle debuts (iPhone 5 and iPhone 6). The stock only traded at around 11 times forward EPS heading into iPhone 7, which was viewed as more of a stepping-stone to the iPhone X. More importantly, the iPhone X will be Apple’s first meaningful step into augmented reality, or “AR," as the new phone will have the ability to map the real world through new cameras and sensors. Google (GOOGL) did this first with its Tango smartphone platform, but Apple will take it mainstream and could have over 100 million AR-enhanced smartphones in the market by this time next year. As we wrote previously, Apple is well positioned to be one of the major winners in AR. Design remains their unique core competency relative to other competitors like Google and Microsoft (MSFT), and they will also have an early-mover advantage in AR-enhanced smartphones through the iPhone X. A note of caution from years of seeing iPhone product cycles: A near-term pull back in shares may happen as we get closer to the typical late September iPhone launch date. Investors notoriously 'sell on the news' as Apple’s product pipeline is well telegraphed at this point and the company typically does not announce unexpected products. Beyond trying to time the public markets, which we’re avoiding now as venture capitalists, Apple remains in a strong position. The iPhone business should show growth this year and relative stability over the next several years. The company should be able to repatriate a meaningful amount of its overseas cash in the next year. The Services business should continue to grow in the low-double digits for multiple years, providing incremental high margin software revenue driven by growth in the iPhone user base. Plus, there is optionality in Apple’s development of AR glasses, AirPods as “hearables," and the potential for an Apple car. Bigger picture, large cap tech is a great place to be. Apple's market cap makes it king, but Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and, our current favorite, Tesla, have all performed well in the current optimistic market environment. These six companies are investing heavily in the core focus themes of our fund that we see as the future of computing: AI, robotics, VR, and AR. They, too, see the next wave of technology coming and Apple, in particular, is well positioned to benefit.

The next iPhones' designs, two of which will be just like the 7 and 7 Plus pictured here, could be settled. Image: lili sams/mashable By Brett Williams2017-05-22 15:42:51 UTC We've officially gone beyond the iPhone 8 specs and supply chain rumor phase — now we're in full-on production photo leak territory. New leaked images purported to be the molds used to make the new iPhone models have hit the web, surfacing first on Slashleaks. The pics give us a sneak peek at what could be the final design of the upcoming iPhone 8 — the molds fall in line with what we're expecting from Apple in its next line of phones, and appear to be identical to other recently leaked images of a dummy version of the phone. SEE ALSO: Why I refuse to delete old, unused apps from my iPhone The images on Slashleaks aren't the only photos of the iPhone 8 molds. Graphic designer and leaker Benjamin Geskin also posted photos of the molds, which look just like the dummy model he first shared back in April. He tweeted that the upcoming iPhone designs have been confirmed by these images — but that ultimately can't be determined until we hear from Apple itself.  iPhone X (#iPhone8) with iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. Form is 100% confirmed. Touch ID in power button or display. (99% NOT on the back) pic.twitter.com/Hzj0dihcFe — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) May 22, 2017 The molds show the three models expected from Apple in its next iPhone cycle: a 7S and 7S Plus  — with the same dimensions as the current 7 and 7 Plus handsets at 4.7 and 5.5 inches, respectively —and the deluxe iPhone 8 handset measuring in the middle at around 5 inches. The 8 is expected to take advantage of an edge-to-edge design for more screen space, with a projected 5.8-inch display, but there's no insight on the screen size from the molds, which only show the shells of the devices.     These production molds don't show us anything we haven't already seen from other iPhone leaks. The 7S and 7S Plus rigs have the same camera orientations as the current models, while the 8 has the expected vertically-oriented design that was teased in the photos of the dummy units.  The leaked images also suggest the next iPhone's fingerprint sensor won't be on the back of the device — Geskin is extremely confident Apple won't repeat Samsung's mistake — but, like the size of the screen, there's no way to know from just a production mold. Geskin speculates the sensor will actually make it under the display, which has been a long held rumor, or it could be integrated into the power button on the side of the device.   These photos give the rumors of the "finalized" version of the iPhone 8 that've been floating around some more legitimacy, but remember, nothing about the new iPhones is set in stone — not the supposedly exorbitant price or even its name — until Apple officially unveils the upcoming devices. That probably won't be until September, barring a shocker in June at the World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC), so a real, 100 percent confirmation is still months away.

Apple Fights Bill That Could Make Fixing iPhone Easier, Cheaper Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple Fights Bill That Could Make Fixing iPhone Easier, Cheaper Image courtesy of Michael Gil May 22, 2017 12:03 pm EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akieler right to repair apple tech companies verizon medtronic filings NEW YORK repair devices cybersecurity lobbying legislation When iPhones first came on the market, customers could only get their devices fixed at an actual Apple store. Now that the phones have become ubiquitous, phone repair store have popped up on nearly every block and in every mall, providing owners with a plethora of options and prices when it comes to seeking repairs for their devices. But a new report shows that Apple and other tech manufacturers and organizations are fighting against these choices, pushing to eliminate state legislation that aims to make it easier for anyone to repair electronics.  Motherboard reports that a number of tech giants including Apple, Verizon, medical device company Medtronic, machinery company Caterpillar, and others, have begun lobbying against a proposed New York state bill that would require manufacturers to provide parts and guides for the independent repair of devices. According to New York State’s Joint Commission on Public Ethics, the companies have spent more than $366,000 lobbying against the Fair Repair Act [PDF] in the five months since it was introduced. A lobbying report from Roffe Group, the company contracted by Apple to conduct lobbying on the tech giant’s behalf, shows it spent $18,000 in March and April on lobbying efforts related to three New York measures including the so-called “right to repair” bill (S618A). Conversely, the lobbying filings cited by Motherboard show that just one group – the Digital Right to Repair Coalition, composed of independent repair shops – has lobbied for the legislation, spending about $5,000. The New York bill, which was introduced in January, would require electronic manufacturers to provide diagnostic and repair information — such as tools, replacement parts, and repair guides — to outside companies or individuals who want to carry out their own device repairs. Additionally, the Fair Repair Act would ban manufacturers from creating software locks, or otherwise restricting companies or individuals from fixing devices. Apple was accused of such an incident earlier this year by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The agency claimed that Apple used the infamous “Error 53” issue in software updates that rendered devices useless after owners had common repair work done by an unauthorized service provide. According to the agency’s allegations, once the repair work was completed and a service provider tried to update or restore the software to the device, the error message appeared, locking down the phone. Motherboard notes that Apple and other tech companies have previously been rumored to have lobbied against similar right to repair legislation in other states. Although the companies haven’t admitted to lobbying against such legislation, they have previously expressed concern that allowing just anyone to repair devices puts customers at risk. In one instance, Motherboard reports an Apple lobbyist told a Nebraska state legislator that if a right to repair bill was passed, residents would be the target of bad actors. Consumerist has reached out to Apple for comment on the reported lobbying. We’ll update this post when we hear back.

According to official sources in the Taiwan consulate, the company’s decision comes as a natural progression following the commencement of iconic Apple iPhones in Bengaluru by Wistron, another Taiwan-based company recently. “Foxconn has already announced to set up 12 factories in India and create about 1 million jobs. Bengaluru is an ideal place where electronic manufacturing ecosystem is already in place with the presence of major public and private companies,” a Taiwan consulate official told DH. This will be Foxconn’s third such facility in India after Navi Mumbai and Sri City. When contacted, the sources privy to the development said, Foxconn has expressed its willingness to work with the Karnataka government. “The company finds the government in Karnataka as very proactive led by an young and dynamic IT minister Priyank Kharge who is very much interested in expanding the state’s manufacturing capability in electronic sector,” the sources said. The Foxconn’s decision comes at a time when Apple iPhone’s leading original equipment manufacturer Wistron started its manufacturing facility in Bengaluru. DH reported last week that Wistron commenced trial assembly of the iPhone SE smartphone at its Peenya plant. The complete Made in Bengaluru product will hit shelves in June first week. Commenting on the decision, Karnataka IT and BT minister Priyank Kharge said, “Karnataka has always framed policies which will help companies to set up units here. We have got solid support with the arrival of Apple and its OEM Wistron. Foxconn’s decision to invest in Bengaluru is a natural corollary to that.” Email this page Print this page Tweet Go to Top Videos UK business sounds alert on election pledges China-Hong Kong bridge to unity, or tentacle of Beijing control?

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Apple's IPhone 8, IPhone 7S And IPhone 7S Plus Molds Leaked Posted: May 22 2017, 8:21am CDT | by M. Affan, Updated: May 22 2017, 8:45am CDT, in News | Apple   Leaked Molds show Sizes of Apple’s 2017 iPhones in Relation to Each Other Gallery 4 images   A series of molds have shown the sizes of Apple’s iPhones in relation to each other for this year. A number of images have been leaked online which show molds of Apple 2017 iPhones. The relative sizes of these iPhones were obvious in these pictures. It is still all just rumors but if rumors are anything to go by, the leaks may show that where there is smoke, there is fire. Don't Miss: Today's Best Deals on Amazon.com According to Macrumors, Apple plans on introducing three novel iPhones this year. These include two upgrades to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus and a redesigned iPhone 8. It is indeed a possibility that these molds, that have enthralled so many by their leakage online, may have been churned out for use in the making of third party iPhone cases. It is all pretty much unconfirmed data we have right now because that is the way things work in today’s complex world. The iPhone 8 is bigger than the 4.7 inch iPhone 7 chassis. The redesigned iPhone 8 has a 5.8 inch display screen. Thus this makes it closer in size to the 5.5 inch iPhone 7 Plus.    There is furthermore a paucity of bezels in this device. There is also a longer power button in the middle. Previous leakages of this longer power button led to speculation regarding a fingerprint scanner being somewhere among the works. Apple has indeed not had an easy time with this feature among its iPhones. The news regarding this feature have been at best uncertain. Apple may place the sensor on the back side like its main rival Samsung did in the past. Besides 3D sensing technology, there will be a front camera, a speedier microchip, facial and iris recognition, a waterproof case, wireless recharging facility and a glass exterior.  What the holes in the molds were for was the ultimate question among the speculative details. It had everyone in a full-on thinker’s mode. The iPhone 8 has several augmented reality features that make it a cool and classy handset. While the iPhone 8 will probably not have a home button, it will definitely have Touch ID imbedded somewhere among its structure. The iPhone 8 will have a steep price though. That is for sure. Apple could put a price tag on it that amounts anywhere from $999 to $1099. Also whether there will be a delay in its launch or not remains a moot point.

This morning, MacRumors reader Andrew was able to capture some video of one of the SUVs, giving us our closest look yet at the vehicles Apple is using to test its system. The SUV is equipped with multiple sensors and cameras, making it easy to see when it's out on the road. It uses a top-end Velodyne 64-channel lidar, two or more radar, and several cameras to navigate. The video was captured on the 101 North, with Apple's vehicle exiting towards University Avenue in Palo Alto. Apple received a DMV permit to test autonomous vehicles on April 14 and wasted no time getting the cars out on the road. With the SUVs, which are driven by six Apple employees with expertise in autonomous vehicles, Apple is testing a self-driving vehicle system it has in development. The company has been working on self-driving car technology for several years and was originally rumored to be planning to introduce its own Apple-branded vehicle. That didn't pan out, however, and Apple pivoted to an autonomous driving software platform being developed under the leadership of Bob Mansfield. Apple has reportedly given its car team until the end of 2017 to prove the feasibility of an Apple-designed autonomous driving system. Such a system could allow Apple to partner with vehicle manufacturers for something akin to a much more advanced version of CarPlay, or it could be built into a future Apple vehicle should Apple decide to revisit manufacturing its own car down the road. While Apple is notoriously secretive, its ongoing autonomous car testing will be done under the public eye. In California, companies that participate in the Autonomous Vehicle Testing Program must file Disengagement Reports that share many details on the testing process, including miles traveled and any incidents or accidents that occur. Apple has asked the DMV to alter the rules that govern exactly what data needs to be included in public Disengagement Reports, but it is not yet known if the DMV will comply.

Rating: 5 Votes coolfactor 14 hours ago at 10:20 am So many people (especially the news media) are making a big deal about self driving cars and that human drivers will soon become obsolete. Ever driven in the snow (cant' see the lines), how about pounding rain so heave the roads are partially flooded. Yes being human does not mean you are necessarily a responsible driver, there are plenty of rotten human drivers, but I think we have a very long way to go before self driving cars can truly replace humans. Too many people uunderestimate the computing power of the human brain and the incredibly complex software/hardware necessary to replicate human ability. Nobody is questioning the power of the human brain, but intelligence is secondary to that. And then layer on factors like influence from drugs and alcohol and distractions. The human brain may be powerful, but the human can be very, very dumb. Rating: 4 Votes myrtlebee 14 hours ago at 10:04 am Interesting. I was going to comment that I'm glad this isn't being tested on roads near me, but then I remembered how crazy humans drive here and that it would be so much safer if all cars were like this. Rating: 4 Votes sp3k0psv3t 14 hours ago at 09:55 am On the way now Apple. Great progress. Just curious to know if it's Apple HW or Apple SW making the action go... Either way, interesting to see positive progress in a forward direction of any capacity. Best, USVet Rating: 2 Votes AngerDanger 14 hours ago at 10:39 am I'm more curious about why some driver had their phone out and recording in the first place. What were they [I]doing? Rating: 2 Votes cwt2nospam 13 hours ago at 11:43 am Wow. I would have thought that on a computer related forum people would be more aware of where the technology is and how soon it will get here. Self driving cars are generally closer than most people think, not further away. The $35,000 Tesla Model 3, which is due to begin production in July (less than 6 weeks from now) will have all the hardware necessary for self driving. Yes, the software will add to the cost but that's sure to drop soon, and it's really more a matter of legal concerns to enable fully autonomous driving at this point. As for mud and snow, that's part of why there are multiple sensors. Naturally, if visibility drops the car will need to slow down or stop, just as with a human driver, but most of the time the car will have better situation "awareness" than a human can.

Rating: 2 Votes 1984 13 hours ago at 11:15 am Since the autonomous driving software works in the background I don't know where Apple is going with this unless they're going to make their own car to go with it. It's not like there's an open the standard for self driving cars were you can just plug-in any autonomous driving software you want. The hardware and software are deeply integrated.

Being in a relationship when you live a few blocks away from one another is already hard enough. The idea of being hundreds of miles away from your loved one seems daunting, or at the very least problematic. It’s like your partner vanished from your life, but not entirely. You can’t have any of the good stuff, like cuddling up in front of a TV, or backrubs, but you get to keep the quarrels, jealousy, and all your insecurities. Is there a solution How You Can Use Technology To Spice Up Your Relationship How You Can Use Technology To Spice Up Your Relationship Being in an relationship is exciting, isn’t it?

Indeed, the web is full of advice How Can Technology Help A Long-Distance Relationship Succeed? How Can Technology Help A Long-Distance Relationship Succeed? Read More on the matter. It almost seems like there’s nothing that technological progress and a good internet connection can’t fix nowadays. Already using Whatsapp, Facebook How Does Facebook Hurt Or Help You And Your Relationships? How Does Facebook Hurt Or Help You And Your Relationships? Love it or hate it, Facebook is here to stay. Almost everyone you know probably uses the social network, and it's hard to stay away from it. Read More , and Skype to communicate with your loved one? What if we told you that you can not only maintain the late night conversations and romantic texting but also send your partner a warm cuddle, kiss, or even a physical hug? And that’s not even the end of it. We’ve put together a small collection of some useful (and not so useful) gadgets (and apps) which promise to keep the spark between you and your partner during this difficult period of your relationship. Whatever first popped into your head – the gadgets we’re about to introduce you to are more advanced and interesting, also sometimes hilarious.  So buckle up for some of the weirdest internet inventions in online dating 4 Online Relationship Tips That Actually Work 4 Online Relationship Tips That Actually Work There are plenty of examples to show that Happily Ever After is attainable for online and long distance relationships. Here are some of the best tips and advice to keep you on the right path. Read More . 1. Kissenger Kissenger (think “Kiss Messenger”) is a long-distance kissing machine. According to the developers, the device’s main purpose is to bring that third dimension that you’ve been missing in digital communication with your partner. There are plenty of platforms out there to help you get sight and sound. Kissenger is here to allow you to feel the touch of your partner — of your partner’s lips in particular. You simply kiss the device (which use to look like a little robotic pig but now has a more graceful look) and it transmits your lip movements to another Kissenger in a different location. Interesting Fact — A long-distance relationship wasn’t all the developers had in mind when creating Kissenger. “Human to Human” is only one of the three possible modes of interaction. The inventors mention briefly in the device description that they see Kissenger becoming a link between the virtual and real worlds one day, enabling humans to have a closer relationship with a robot or helping to give a physical form to a virtual character. Price — You can pucker-up for $30 from the Kissenger’s official website (discounted price from $75) or get a set of two for $50. 2. Pillow Talk While kissing strangely-shaped devices with lips might make you feel a little too weird, some gadgets on our list might make you want to order them right this moment. Because some things hit too close to home. Imagine coming back home after a bad day, when the only place you want to be is your loved one’s arms. Pillow Talk is designed to make you feel as if you’re lying on your partner’s chest, no matter how far away you are from them. The Pillow Talk set consists of a wristband that picks up your heartbeat and sends it to your partner’s little speaker. That way, when both of you wear the wristbands and place your speakers under the pillows it creates a simulation of a very intimate moment. Price — The price of falling asleep to your loved one’s heartbeat is $179 per set (two wristbands and two speakers, free iOS and Android app). 3. The Hug Shirt This one was created back in 2002 when people decided that sending each other hugs over distance could be fun. It connects with your smartphone via Bluetooth, records an actual hug (strength, duration, and warmth of a hug and your heartbeat to be exact), sends the data to your loved one’s smartphone, which is then transmitted to their Hug Shirt. In 2006 the Hug Shirt made it to Time‘s Best Inventions of the Year section but doesn’t seem to attract as much attention today. The inventors promise to make sending hugs “as easy as sending a text message or chatting.” Although, it hasn’t yet made it to mass-production, so maybe it’s not so simple after all. Price — N/A. 4. Touch Room This somewhat creepy video clip is actually an ad for an app called Touch Room. The main purpose of the service is to bring back one thing that we miss out on when we’re away from our partners: their touch. After you download the app, you can create a “touch room” for you and your partner. The parts of the screen your loved one is touching will light up and give you a comforting buzz when your fingertips virtually touch. While it certainly won’t replace a physical hug, with Touch Room you and your partner can practically hold hands. Price — Free on iTunes. 5. Avocado If you feel like Facebook, Snapchat, and other messaging apps are getting too crowded for you two, consider switching to Avocado: a social network for just the two of you. Aside from sending private messages, you can enjoy the network’s features like sharing photos and videos, as well as lists and calendar events. Avocado is compatible with Google Calendar, so you can keep on making plans and setting dates even when you aren’t physically together. Some extra perks include exchanging your locations with your partner and getting notified when their battery’s low, which will probably save some nerves to a lot of people. Price — Free for download on iPhone, Android, and on the Web. 6. The Aura Lamp The Aura Lamp, created by a designer Christian Sallustro, promises to deliver your feelings to your partner not through words but through action. More accurately, through light. This table light comes as a set of two twin pieces, so you can keep one and give the second to your loved one. Aura doesn’t actually work like a normal lamp. Instead, it glows when your partner strokes the switch of their identical device, letting you know they’re thinking about you. The lamp was created in 2011, but unfortunately never made it to mass-production. Price — N/A. 7. Apple Watch Digital Touch For Apple fans, there’s another thing that you can use to send your love and thoughts from afar. Digital Touch is an Apple Watch Get Ready for Apple Watch with These 5 Sites Get Ready for Apple Watch with These 5 Sites Excited about the Apple Watch?

When you receive taps or someone’s heartbeat you can physically feel it on your wrist. You can also control the duration of both your taps and your heartbeat before you send it. Price — The feature is free as long as both you and your partner have an Apple Watch.

You can discuss the movie live on chat, have a small session in the middle or at the end of the movie to share your thoughts and theories with your partner. Play Games Together What if your physical worlds happen to be separated? Sync up your virtual words to make up for it by playing some online games together. Have Breakfast Briefings Inspire and motivate one another during morning breakfast meetings. The point is not to have breakfast together (though feel free to do so) but to give each other an energy boost for the rest of the day. Make it a late night coffee catch-up if neither of you have time in the morning. A Good Surprise Is Key While showing up at their doorstep unannounced is certainly a great surprise, it can have your partner shocked, and not in a good way. In order to stay on the safe side opt for little gifts to remind your loved one that you’re thinking about them. Amazon and Etsy have you covered with an infinite range of items and flexible delivery terms. Is your special one into flowers? With services like ProFlowers and Teleflora you can send them customized real-life flower bouquets from anywhere in the world. They accept PayPal payments, so your life couldn’t be easier. Know Your Goals One of the best ways to keep your long-distance relationship stress-free is to have a clear plan.

And what’s worse, if you fall for it, it’s incredibly likely that you won’t get your money back. So what does it entail? How can you avoid it? And should you really be concerned? What’s the Scam? It’s a very simple scam — so simple, in fact, you might find it bizarre that people are actually falling for it. Nonetheless, you shouldn’t immediately scoff. Stick with us because it’s worth knowing about. It might not trouble you specifically, but it’s affecting many who don’t necessarily know much about iTunes.

Notably, fraudsters in America purport to be ringing in regards to additional fees for services including insurance cover, shipping, or any other unpaid debt.

They work in pretty much the same way as other gift cards: you simply load them with money and, using the code revealed on its reverse, you can buy music or apps using it. But that doesn’t mean everyone knows the specifics of iTunes. An older generation, for example, might be unfamiliar with how they work. Indeed, some call this a “grandparent scam” as some con artists trick their victims into thinking they’re helping a family member in financial trouble. It was even claimed, in one instance, as bail money! Image Credit: Mike Mozart via Flickr Of course, the vast majority of scams play on such worries. Common sense can disappear when faced with the prospect of police or debt-recovery involvement (and that’s what criminals are threatening, should supposed charges not be paid).

Few would turn down the chance to get a $100 iTunes code, albeit without the actual gift card, for the price of $50 or even $75. Naturally, however much cash a con artist can get is pure profit.

Let them know that if they’re ever asked to pay off fees using a gift card, it’s a scam. It doesn’t matter if that’s an iTunes one or another gift card. Image Credits: Blake Patterson via Flickr If you think you’ve been scammed: Contact Apple immediately. The company might be able to cancel the card before funds are drained. Criminals have streamlined the process so you need to be quick. Of course, if it’s another gift card (Google Store, for example), you need to contact the respective firm. If you’re a shop assistant: Be aware of this scam and let your peers know about it. It might be worth asking managerial employees to put a sign up about it in the staff room. That way, if a customer is purchasing a suspect amount of cards, you can feel confident about finding out more. You could save someone from being a victim.

Tim Graham/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Tim Graham/Getty Images A man listens during a high fidelity demonstration in April, 1974. Tim Graham/Getty Images When you stream a song on Spotify, it's delivered in an audio format — imagine these formats to be containers as literal as a phonograph record — cheekily named "Ogg Vorbis." YouTube, one of the most popular music streaming "services" in the world by volume, prefers something called AAC, or "Advanced Audio Coding." Radio stations, whenever possible, tend to prefer lossless WAV files. If you've played music from your hard drive as far back as the early aughts or as recently as this morning, you may have clicked play on an MP3. You'll be able to tomorrow, next week or a decade from now, provided your music player of choice still has the electricity to do so. The Record The MP3 Is Officially Dead, According To Its Creators We've been the source of some confusion on that subject recently. An article published here 11 days ago quoted Bernhard Grill — one of the developers of the MP3 format and also of the AAC format for the German research institution Fraunhofer — saying AAC is technologically superior to the MP3 and also that AAC is one of the most widely used formats for listening today, through its ubiquity within streaming, if nothing else (and there's more). That article's headline oversold Dr. Grill as having characterized the MP3 being dead. It would have been more accurate — and more interesting really — if the writer of that article (the same as this one) wrote that the MP3 may be dying. (That article did say explicitly that people would go on using MP3s, but hey.) To parse this tipping point (and to explore whether we're even in the midst of one) we called Jonathan Sterne — after he reached out to us in response to that earlier article — the author of MP3: The Meaning of a Format and a professor of communication studies at McGill University. As with VHS tapes and cassettes, no format is "dead," as long as the equipment to play it is still alive. The resurgence of vinyl records is illustrative of that point. But the tide seems to have turned — and that turn, like most of media history within capitalism, is complicated by economic interests, advances in technology, an ever-increasingly ephemeral connection to media and, either most or least importantly, the subjectivity of our personal experiences. All of which we explore with Sterne. Fraunhofer's patent on the MP3 may literally be dead, and with it the institution's monetization of it — but there are, as Fraunhofer itself points out, still trillions of MP3s out there. Or, as Sterne explains: "MP3s are still the most widely used audio format in the world." Andrew Flanagan: What does Fraunhofer's patent lapse allow developers to do now that they couldn't do before? Jonathan Sterne: "That's a great question. So... people have a really hard time understanding intellectual property. If you think of it like a trade monopoly, it's really easy to understand. Who has the right to trade in a certain code or perform or record or claim authorship over a song? Things like that, those are trade monopolies. They're not property in the sense of 'If you steal my car I can't use it.' Right? So the patent is a monopoly — which, actually, Fraunhofer didn't fully exercise. First of all, users like me, listening to music at home, never had to pay for the rights to use the MP3 decoding protocols. In fact, if you build a little free software thing that made no money, you also wouldn't have to pay. So there are already unlicensed MP3 encoders and controllers out there." Like LAME. "Yes. So they're not paying Fraunhofer already. But, if Apple puts out an MP3 decoder, they pay Fraunhofer. And that's what's going to stop. Fraunhofer has always maintained that AAC is better than MP3. It's more efficient and, at low bitrates in test situations, people can sometimes hear the difference in terms of fewer coding artifacts and things like that. When you put on earbuds and get on the metro, you won't hear the difference at all." If you're using pretty nice headphones you might? "Not on the Metro. One of the people involved in the MPEG group said it's like when you buy a new home. First, you noticed a nice view out the living room window, and it's only later that you notice a little crack in the window. It's like that. You have to learn to hear the artifacts. "And that's just the way it works. That's true for any new audio or video format, people start noticing things that they didn't used to. Whether those things bother listeners is entirely subjective and it's entirely situational. If you think of the way people listen to music most of the time, to say AAC is better than MP3 — yes, by technical standards, absolutely. If you're sitting in a quiet room paying rapt attention to the music, sure. The minute you put it through earbuds, or go for a walk, or play it in your car, or listen distractedly, those differences matter less and less." At the root of a lot of the feedback I got from the article is the availability of the underlying technology of the MP3. I'm wondering: If the MP3 is not dead but finally free, what is it free to do? "Honestly, I don't think much is going to change. I wouldn't say 'oh the MP3 is finally free and all these things are going to change.' All it's going to happen is Apple is going to stop paying Fraunhofer, or whoever. (I don't actually know that Apple's paying Fraunhofer because I'm not privy to their licensing agreements, but whoever's paying them is going to stop paying.) "That's why I pushed back on the 'MP3 is dead.' It's not like the switch from vinyl to compact disc, where U.S. record distributors stopped accepting returns on unbought records from record stores, at which point stores had to switch over to CDs or take on additional financial risk. There's nothing that Fraunhofer can do to prevent people from using MP3s. "So, since it's the most common form of audio format in the world — right now — a more likely scenario, if you look at the history of audio formats, is that over time its use will continue and then eventually it will decline, like all audio formats before it. It will eventually be replaced by something else, but that won't be because Fraunhofer stopped supporting it. It'll be because something else came along, and people will have a reason to switch either in terms of consumer motivation or because of some digital rights management scheme, or some kind of technological system that is a closed system." So things aren't really going to change, regardless of the patent, or regardless of the availability of superior technology, whether they be OGG or AAC. "So, the one story you get with audio is that there's this inevitable march of progress towards higher definition, and higher definition is better and more realistic — which isn't always true — and that MP3 is some great aberration where we took a step back. That has nothing to do with how the history of audio technologies have actually unfolded. Yes, the CD has much more theoretical dynamic range than an Edison cylinder. Of course. But what you see are, every few decades, format wars, where one format ekes out another, usually because of social conditions, like which players in the industry are more powerful. Or accidental conditions — the reason MP3 took off in the first place was because their shareware program was hacked and people started using MP3 encoding for file sharing — and then companies caught up to it, and Fraunhofer benefitted. They actually didn't very successfully market it. "When things started going well for them, they were able to seize the opportunity. And, you know, they use a lot of money to fund their research. It's not like there's some big corrupt media corporation. It's just that, the minute they invented AAC they said 'this is better.' So they've been saying that for probably, I don't know, 20 years now, give or take. And now they have no financial interest in MP3s carrying on. "So it's a great headline to say MP3 is dead, but they're still all over the Internet, people's hard drives are still full of them. This is really saying like, '45rpm vinyl is dead but 33rpm vinyl continues.' It's a sort of narcissism of small differences." His quote — Bernard Grill's, who helped develop the MP3 and AAC — was that AAC is in such wider use on platforms like YouTube and streaming services. What I took was that it's dead as far as the usefulness from now into the future. "I would totally disagree with that, I think it's totally useful for people who want to listen to their music that they've already acquired or paid for. "You know, I was actually getting e-mails from people saying 'does this mean I have to like, re-encode all of my music or acquire it in some different format?' And that's exactly what you don't want. This sort of media industry model where everybody buys the same movies TV over and over again." Let's make that very clear: MP3 and AAC are free for any user (not company) to take advantage of. "Yes, absolutely. I mean the reason why the free software people didn't like MP3 was because it was tied to royalties and Fraunhofer, whereas OGG was completely open source, anybody could use it anyone could contribute to it." The MP3 and other formats are based on some psychoacoustic assumptions that I was told last year were at least mildly off the mark. "Any psychoacoustic assumption is a generalization, because we're all walking around with two sets of ears and one brain, and psychoacoustics are all based on aggregate data populations. And in some cases, weird populations. So like 20Hz to 20kHz — the frequency range for 'normal' hearing, is based on research done on New York City schoolchildren. My colleague Mara Mills has written about that. "The original psychoacoustic assumptions that Karlheinz Brandenburg tried to code into the OCF, which was the format before MP3, he took out of Eberhard Zwicker's book Psychoacoustics — he literally took those numbers and put them into the software. And they sounded terrible. The reason they sounded terrible is because psychoacousticians do tests using tones or noise bursts, and MP3 was designed to encode speech and music. And so they started doing this basic research to say: 'If we tweak it this way, do the cymbals sound worse or better? If we tweak it this way, does the articulation of the voice get muddier or clearer?' "A lot of the things that people complain about with MP3s are not the result of the removal of data but rather the imprint of the format on that sound. So things like changes to the stereo image, that's not a result of removing data, that's the result of the way the format codes. "So yeah, it's always a compromise, and especially as you get to lower bit rates, you're asking the algorithm to basically choose. 'Where is the stuff people are least likely to miss?' And it can guess wrong, because it's an algorithm, not a person. And it has limited information. What's amazing is how well the MP3 worked, and that speaks I think to the standardization of recording, and audio, and radio sound across the world. People expect well-recorded or well-broadcast sound to sound a certain way, regardless of where it comes from and what genre it is." Now I'm wondering about the end game of fidelity. "If you look at history, which is really the only empirical evidence we have, sound fidelity has been used to market new audio formats basically since the invention of the cylinder phonograph. So in 1878 you can find articles saying that Edison's tinfoil phonograph reproduces sound with perfect fidelity. So there's always the story where we're at 'the end stage of high-definition,' and that greater definition will bring people greater musical pleasure. "What actually happens is the aesthetics switch — so people want more bass, they want less bass, they want more high-end, they want less high-end. People talk about how 'organic' [vinyl] records sound, but of course every record, in the U.S. anyways, goes through the RIAA curve. So it is in fact a highly processed and arbitrary and standardized sound, in exactly the same way that WAV or AIFF or MP3 is. So it's been a successful technique for marketing audio. "The second thing is, I want audio engineers and record industry professionals to care about audio quality. Does that mean that higher audio quality will save the music industry (which is still highly profitable, it's just not as profitable as it was)? Does it mean that it will get more young people interested in paying for music? Does it mean that the people who pay for music will pay more for music? I think that's a social question. The person who buys the nicer speakers for their home stereo is going to be interested in this. The person that's like, playing music out of their telephone speaker in the back of the bus for their friend, this isn't going to make any difference to." It might be apocryphal, but it reminds me of that Steve Jobs quote. They don't know what high-fidelity is until they hear it. "And when they do, they may or may not care. This has been true since the term high-fidelity was invented. And it's independent of love for music. You can find people who are incredibly devoted to classical music and listen to it out of a small six-inch mono speaker on a desktop radio. That's fine for them, and they will tell you they love the music. They might even go to the symphony and give money. High fidelity isn't part of their experience. High definition has sold more TVs lately, but is it going to sell more music, is it going to save the music industry? I don't know. Probably not." There was a lot of, I think, misinterpretation of the article, from open information advocates and open source software advocates. I was curious if the availability of the source code for most of these formats has been pretty widespread for almost two decades. What are they missing out on? "I mean, I think it's just a matter of ethical commitments, that software that's widely used ought to be ought to be... well first of all, it ought to be free. It ought to be freely available to modify yourself. I mean, I'm sympathetic, but I'm not a member of that community. I use plenty of proprietary software in my daily life. So I can't claim to be an authentic open source person and I don't code." Like Richard Stallman. "Yeah no, I'm certainly not Richard Stallman. The kernel of it is this, and I think that this is true for all technology, which is that a more democratic technology is a technology that you as a user, even if you don't understand it, you have the potential to understand it, repair it and modify it. Where the inner workings of the technology are not controlled by a third party over whom you have no power and on whom you are dependent. "I wrote a paper with Dylan Mulvin on the history of the switch from monochrome to color TV in the 1950s. In the 1950s the US government told the TV industry — remember that the broadcast bandwidth is a public resource and it's managed by the government, they control the national television system. The government said sure, by all means move to color, but you can't change the standard in such a way that you will force people to buy new televisions. Completely different business model from Apple releasing a new iPhone every year to get you to buy a new one. "In Europe they have things like extended product responsibility, where companies are legally liable for the disposal of the products that they produce. In the software world like it seems like this is all just about code, but of course code runs on hardware you need something to run it. And so every time you obsolete a standard, that's a chance for a company to either force or try to persuade someone to buy something new, which means something else is likely to go into a landfill." Which brings us back to the MP3. "Yes, it does."

This wasn't a marketing stunt by Apple. Wozniak really enjoyed being part of an Apple event with other fans. In an interview with Business Insider, Wozniak compared the night before an Apple release to waiting in line for concert tickets, which he often did when he was younger. Sure, as an Apple co-founder he could have probably pulled strings to get the new iPhone, but he says he's "just not a favor asker." Following is a transcript of the video:   Of all the Apple products that had lines — the earlier iPhones, the earlier iPads, yes I always waited in line overnight. Something inspiring in me, something said, “This is a big, important deal.” I want to be a part of it, just like you want to be a part of a huge festival, you know Coachella maybe. This is going to be an inspiring, great time in my life. That’s how I thought about it, it was just like waiting overnight to get tickets to an important concert. The earliest I've gotten in line for an Apple product is generally, close to 24 hours in advance. Coming by maybe in the morning to noon time and then sitting out all night long till the store opens at whatever 8 in the morning. When I'm waiting in line for products, of course I'm very anxious inside and I feel all the adrenaline flowing. But I still have to keep up with my email coming in on my computer. Usually I'm sitting in a chair on my computer watching the new Apple product being opened in New Zealand. And then I'm watching it in Australia. Then I'm watching eventually in Tokyo and then London. And by the time it gets to California 17 hours later, it's sort of like the whole thing already happened. The glamour of being first already happened. I don't really do it anymore. Pretty much just know the products are coming out and they're not going to be available on day one, especially the version I want. So I just order it online and accept it. I got a lot more patient now. As an Apple founder I wouldn't try to get one that way, because before Apple, I had my own philosophical code. I try to be like normal people, do it the same way everyone else does. Get in line, buy it, pay full price. I'm sure I could probably ask and get some favors, but I'm just not a favor asker. There were times — like the first iPhone, Steve Jobs actually sent me one. And there were other computers he would send me one, but not asked for. I buy most of the important Apple products because technology is my excitement in life, you know, just like movies and popular culture. These are all things, oh my gosh I want to be a part of it. Would you miss the next “Star Wars” movie? You know, some people wouldn't miss it. It’s that deep a part of their life.

The company says it holds 13 patents covering Apple Pay technology, and hasn’t been able to get Apple or Visa to pay for licensing. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Delaware and states that RSA’s SecurID patents cover secure one-time financial transaction tokens, biometric identification, and other authentication systems for smartphones. The company drew a fairly detailed image of Apple Pay with its patent list. RSA targets Apple Pay with patent infringement lawsuit Apple Pay is a system that lets users complete credit card transactions with their iPhone, Apple Watch, or iPad while keeping their actual card number secure. Users can hold their device near payment terminals in stores to initiate payment, to tap an on-screen button for online payments. RSA says it participated in several meetings with Visa in 2010 about collaborating on the cardless payment system, according to the New York Times. Visa signed a 10-year nondisclosure agreement, but walked away from the discussions after its own engineers had been fully briefed on how RSA’s SecurID system worked. Fast forward to 2013, and Visa starts working on Apple Pay with Apple, American Express, and MasterCard. Apple Pay officially launched in 2014 and iPhone owners have been tapping payment terminals in stores ever since. Apple apparently wasn’t ever involved in discussions with RSA SecurID, and never responded to the company’s requests to license its payment technology. RSA, Patents, and Lawsuits RSA’s lawsuit isn’t a big surprise considering it hasn’t had any luck licensing its secure payment tech to bigger companies. Since that hasn’t worked out so far, the company is working on its own Apple Pay-like device while pursuing its litigation. If its device is something users need to carry in addition to their smartphone, maybe RSA SecurID should stick with lawsuits because consumers won’t want yet another payment system in their pocket. RSA is owned by Dell, and its SecurID technology is commonly used in systems where two-factor authentication is required. Corporate controlled secure logins, for example, often rely on RSA SecurID key fobs to generate one-use token numbers users need to access their accounts. RSA is being represented by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, which is the same law firm that represented Samsung for part of its patent infringement lawsuit battle with Apple. Odds are RSA’s lawsuit won’t reach the same epic level as the Apple versus Samsung fight has, but odds are there will be some money exchanging hands before the case wraps up.

The images, shared Monday by Benjamin Geskin on Twitter, give us an idea of the sizes of Apple’s three new iPhones, MacRumors reported. The Cupertino giant is rumored to launch its 10th anniversary iPhone 8, the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, and the leaked image shows three sizes. Read: iPhone 8 Price, Rumors: Goldman Sachs Predicts New iPhone Will Cost $1K, Have 3D Sensing, No Home Button Previous rumors have said Apple will launch a 4.7-inch iPhone, as well as 5.5-inch and a 5.8-inch versions. The iPhone 7S is expected to be the smallest, followed by the iPhone 8, and the iPhone 7S Plus is rumored to be the biggest. Here are the photos of the alleged molds: iPhone 8 Embedded Touch ID The leaked photos of iPhone molds show the iPhone 8 will not come with a Touch ID on the back of the device, similar to how it is placed on Samsung’s Galaxy S8. Multiple reports have said the 10th anniversary phone (which could also be called the iPhone X, iPhone Pro or iPhone Edition) will come with a Touch ID embedded in the display screen. However, an analyst from Cowen and Co. claims the feature is the one Apple is having the most trouble with. He suggested Apple could move the Touch ID to the back of the iPhone 8 as a solution to the problem, but that doesn’t seem to be the case, the recently leaked photos indicate. Meanwhile, a schematic of the iPhone 8 leaked last month by Sonny Dickson shows a circular hole underneath the Apple logo, which suggests the Touch ID could be placed on the back. iPhone 8 Vertical Camera System The leaked mold photos show the iPhone 8 could come with a vertical dual-camera system on the back of the device, different from last year’s horizontal position on the iPhone 7 Plus. A photo of an iPhone 8 case leaked last month and Dickson’s schematic also suggested the device will come with a vertical camera system. iPhone 8 Release Date, Price, Rumors: Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone is expected to be released in September, but some reports say the smartphone could have a delayed release date because of key components for the device’s rumored 3D-sensing camera. Another report said the iPhone 8 could be delayed until late October or November, pointing to trouble with Apple’s OLED display order. Meanwhile, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chu Kuo said the 10th anniversary iPhone could face "severe supply shortages" when it releases. Read: iPhone 8 To Get LG Facial Recognition System Module For 3D Front-Facing Camera The iPhone 8 is rumored to feature an edge-to-edge OLED display screen, a wireless charging feature and an enhanced Siri.

Will Apple’s new iPhone monitor blood sugar levels—without pricking your skin? Written by Jean-Louis Gassée Editor, Monday Note May 22, 2017 Ouch! (Reuters/Jessica Rinaldi) Share Written by Jean-Louis Gassée Editor, Monday Note May 22, 2017 Apple appears to be working on blood glucose monitoring as a way to address type 2 diabetes.“Stick it in your ear.” Literally. Not all Apple product rumors are equal. Speculation that the headphone jack will reappear with the iPhone 8 has been rightly ridiculed. But the evidence Apple will introduce a glucose monitoring device is worthy of our interest. “Glucose monitoring” is a code word for fighting the growing scourge of type 2 diabetes. Unlike type 1 diabetes, which is unpreventable, the type 2 variety is, to be polite, a “lifestyle” disease, meaning we eat too much and don’t exercise enough. (As usual, the French are more brutal: for them, Type 2 is diabète gras, “fat diabetes.”) A 2016 Harvard School of Public Health study places the global cost of type 2 diabetes at $825 billion per year and growing [as always, edits and emphasis mine]: … in the last 35 years, global diabetes among men has more than doubled—from 4.3% in 1980 to 9% in 2014—after adjusting for the effect of aging. Meanwhile diabetes among women has risen from 5% in 1980 to 7.9% in 2014. This rise translates as 422 million adults in the world with diabetes in 2014—which has nearly quadrupled since 1980 (108 million). In theory, there is, of course, an “easy” remedy: Eat less and exercise more…for the rest of your life. A healthy lifestyle adds days to one’s life, and life to one’s days. Easier nagged than done. In reality, a growing percentage of the human population keeps growing. Enter blood glucose monitoring. Devices that tell you your blood sugar concentration, once the province of the lab, have moved into the home. With just a minuscule drop of blood—as little as 0.3 microliters—you can get an answer in seconds. The subject is immediately alerted to an anomalous rise in blood sugar, a circumstance that could result in limb amputation, blindness, and kidney failure if left untreated. But drawing blood, even in minute quantities, is painful, and pain, or fear of it, limits acceptance. This leads us back to the rumor that Apple is getting into the blood sugar monitoring business. Let’s return for a moment to Tim Cook at the Startup Fest Europe in May, 2016 (full video here). If you think about some of society’s biggest problems and challenges, one of the ones that we are really focused on is health…the health care system can be made much simpler, …that bring out the best in the medical professionals…I think the runway there is enormous. More recently (Apr. 12, 2017), we have a substantial CNBC article that discusses a “supersecret” team of biomedical engineers hiding out in Palo Alto: They are part of a super secret initiative, initially envisioned by the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, to develop sensors that can noninvasively and continuously monitor blood sugar levels to better treat diabetes, according to three people familiar with the matter. Such a breakthrough would be a “holy grail” for life sciences. Many life sciences companies have tried and failed, as it’s highly challenging to track glucose levels accurately without piercing the skin. When he accepted an an honorary degree at the University of Glasgow, Apple CEO Tim Cook “admitted” that he wears a glucose monitoring device: “I’ve been wearing a continuous glucose monitor for a few weeks,” he said. “I just took it off before coming on this trip.” All of this is positive, “science forward” news…but what are the political and regulatory implications? In a Nov. 2015 interview for UK’s The Telegraph, Tim Cook explains that he doesn’t want Apple’s Watch to become a medical device that’s subjected to the uncertainties of regulations by government agencies around the world: Cook hints that Apple may have more plans for the health sphere […], but he doesn’t want the watch itself to become a regulated, government-licensed health product. “We don’t want to put the watch through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) process. I wouldn’t mind putting something adjacent to the watch through it, but not the watch, because it would hold us back from innovating too much, the cycles are too long. But you can begin to envision other things that might be adjacent to it—maybe an app, maybe something else.” Put the pieces together and this is what we have: The type 2 diabetes epidemic has created a broad (pardon the heartless expression) “consumer base.” Apple is serious about blood glucose monitoring. The glucose monitor would be a separate device, an accessory to the Watch. And it would be “bloodless.” The last point is, in my view, the most important. I can’t see Apple Stores demoing blood drawing Watch accessories, and while bloodless monitoring systems exist, they’re laden with caveats. There’s this device from GlucoWise…promised for “next year.” And one from GlucoTrack…approved in Italy and Spain, but not the UK, France, Germany, or the US. Search for “bloodless glucose monitors” and you’ll find many more, all of them in the “study” stage. You can walk into the neighborhood CVS and buy a blood pressure monitor for less than $100 and a pulse oximeter (measuring blood oxygen) for less than $50, but you can’t buy a bloodless glucose monitoring device. This is such a “holy grail for life sciences,” as the CNBC article explains, that if any company were near to an actual breakthrough, the exciting news would leak and it would be all over the Web, TV news, and print media. The bloodless breakthrough may still be in an indeterminate future, but that shouldn’t prevent us from indulging in a bit of hopeful speculation. For this, the GlucoTrack earlobe clip device is a particularly interesting model. Add Bluetooth connectivity, miniaturize the glucose sensor so it fits next to an AirPod-like transducer….we already have devices that measure body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure via the tympanic canal.… You see where this is going. Back down on earth, let’s recall, yet again, Horace Dediu: Those who predict the future we call futurists. Those who know when the future will happen we call billionaires. Billions will be made, but we don’t know when or by whom. This post originally appeared at Monday Note. Learn how to write for Quartz Ideas. We welcome your comments at ideas@qz.com.

Here's how to sell an old handset and save up for a new model by Ashleigh Macro | 22 May 17 Contents > Prepare your iPhone for sale > Best places to sell an iPhone > How much is your old iPhone worth? > How to recycle an old iPhone Want to sell your old iPhone - perhaps with one eye on the iPhone 8 launch later this year? You might want to consider how much you'll get for your old one, and the best methods and places for selling a second-hand iPhone. In this article, we're going to take a look at some of the options that will get you the most money for your old iPhone, whether it's an iPhone SE, iPhone 6s or 6s Plus, an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, an iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c or something older. We'll also offer some advice on how to prepare your iPhone for sale. Finally, we talk a little about methods for recycling an old iPhone, which is generally a good idea if you care about the environment, and may earn you a little cash too. Read next: Complete guide to buying a second-hand iPhone See also: Which iPhone should I buy? Prepare your iPhone for sale Before you sell your iPhone, you'll need to make sure that you've wiped everything you've got stored on it, to prevent the person who buys it getting access to your sensitive data and details. This isn't just about privacy and the embarrassment of a stranger seeing your personal conversations and pictures: it could lead to fraud or identity theft. Wiping an Apple device is a fairly simple process, which we explain in how to reset an iPhone. We'd advise you not to be tempted to sell your iPhone with data intact because you believe the data itself adds to the object's value. (When the game Flappy Bird was removed from the iOS App Store this year, for example, users began selling older iPhones for slightly more cash on eBay by advertising the fact that Flappy Bird was installed.) An app or game might seem an innocent piece of software that couldn't be exploited, but it will be connected to your Apple account and, to a clever hacker, could offer the opportunity to acquire personal data. It's better to be on the safe side. You'll also want to gather together all of the cables, accessories and packaging you've got for the iPhone. Make sure you specify what the iPhone comes with in terms of cables and packaging, particularly if you're selling on eBay. Best places to sell an iPhone You can buy and sell second-hand iPhones with Mresell, a partner of Macworld that runs a service via which you can sell your unwanted Macs, iPhones and iPads. The iPhone is thoroughly checked, refurbished and reconditioned, and listed for sale on Mresell's website. For more information, see: Sell your Apple product through Macworld's Mresell. Apple itself offers a fair deal through its iPhone Trade-Up programme, which could get you up to £290 to put towards a new iPhone. The Renew and Recycling programme allows customers to trade in their old iPhone by visiting an Apple Retail Store with their old iPhone, or visiting Apple's Reuse and Recycling webpage. Apple is no longer offering trade-ins of the original iPhone, as it has "no resale value" according to the company. If you decide to take your old iPhone into an Apple Retail Store, Apple's staff will look it over and give a trade-in price estimate. This price is based on the condition of the hardware and the model of iPhone. Customers can then get that value subtracted from the price of a new iPhone or other Apple product should they decide to trade in. If you choose to go through the trade-in process online, you'll need to visit Apple's Renew and Recycling web page, answer a set of questions to help Apple come up with an estimated value of the device, then send your iPhone to Dataserv for evaluation. Once Dataserv (Apple's recycling partner) has checked your device and determined the accurate trade-in value, you'll get that money deposited into your bank account. You can get a reasonable amount of money from Apple or third-party buyback companies in exchange for your old iPhone, particularly if you've kept that iPhone in good condition. You can also sell it on eBay, Gumtree or similar. How much is your old iPhone worth? The price you can get for a second-hand iPhone depends on what model you've got and where you sell it. Typically you'll get more cash from a private sale than from a shop or services (as they need to include a markup when they sell it on). But it's less hassle to take it somewhere like Computer Exchange or Cash Generator. Original iPhone Generally speaking a smartphone that's a decade old wouldn't be worth selling, but the original iPhone has a nostalgia factor that can't be equalled by later models. If you're looking to offload the original iPhone, however, you probably won't be too pleased with Apple's valuation. Ahead of the iPhone 6 launch, we found that the maximum Dataserv estimate for the first iPhone was £5. Now, though, Apple says the original iPhone has "no resale value". You'll probably get something for your original iPhone by selling it on eBay. In fact, if it's completely sealed in its original packaging it's possible you could get enough to pay for a brand-new iPhone - they're sometimes seen on eBay for more than £1,000. That's pretty optimistic, though, and a more realistic expectation might be £20 to £100. And don't forget that you'll need to pay eBay and PayPal fees on top of postage if you sell through the online auction site. It's worth investigating Gumtree to avoid such charges, though you won't get the support you get from eBay and PayPal if you use that service. iPhone 4 Similarly, those with an iPhone 4 might want to think about an alternative way of getting money from their old device: it's just too old to be appealing to most buyers. Mind you, GAME offers a trade-in value of £50 for the iPhone 4. On CEX, meanwhile, the highest offers we're seeing at the moment are £42 (in cash) or £58 (in vouchers). These offers are dependent on model (colour, storage capacity) and condition. iPhone 4s It's tricky to trade in an iPhone 4s as many places will no longer accept them. If it's in really good condition, though, you might find that you can get something towards you next purchase from the likes of GAME (the most we've seen recently is £41) and CEX (up to £42/£58). iPhone 5 If you've got an iPhone 5, we'd recommend taking it to eBay or CEX. Alternatively, Envirofone offers up to £60 for the iPhone 5. We've seen used iPhone 5 models go for up to £100 on eBay, but by the time you've paid postage and eBay's fee you might be better off with CEX or Envirofone. GAME is another option, and it often price-matches with CEX if you enquire. iPhone 5c You can sell your iPhone 5C to GAME for up to £84, or on Envirofone for up to £55. You may be able to sell your iPhone 5c on eBay for around £150, but there's a lot of competition so don't be surprised if you find it hard to find a bidder (or end up selling it for much less). It might be better to aim for around £130 on a private Gumtree sale. iPhone 5s You'll find that you can get around £100 for a good-condition iPhone 5s on eBay or GAME, or about £63 on Envirofone. iPhone 6 GAME will give you up to £215 for a 128GB iPhone 6 in excellent condition. You're liable to get more on eBay or through a private sale, though. We've seen 16GB iPhone 6 models going for £260 to £270 at the best-condition end of the range, and over 300 for 128GB models. Read next: How to set up a new iPhone How to recycle an old iPhone At its iPhone SE launch event in March 2016, Apple spent a surprising amount of time at the start talking about its recycling programmes, and in particular a new robot it's designed - called, apparently, 'Liam' - for rapidly and accurately disassembling old handsets and recovering their parts. This is all very interesting, and obviously nice PR for a company that prides itself (justifiably, I would say) on its much-improved attitude to environmental matters. But it also means that people looking to offload an old iPhone can do so with an easier conscience about the rare and/or hazardous materials inside, and where they will end up. And better still, you may be able to make a little money while you do it. First of all, Apple pledges to take any and all electrical devices for recycling, if you bring them to an Apple Store. They don't need to be Apple-branded: the company will dispose of "old electronic equipment such as smartphones, tablets, computers or batteries" in a responsible way, for free. There will obviously be exceptions to this offer, and if in doubt we'd suggest ringing the store before you turn up, especially if your item is unusually cumbersome. You don't want to haul it home again afterwards. For certain models of iPhone (and iPad and Mac, for that matter), Apple will sweeten the deal by giving you a gift certificate so you can get a little money off your next purchase; it will also send you a prepaid postage label so you can send it to them for free. This applies to the iPhone 4 and later. The money you'll get varies from case to case (depending on the condition of the phone), so we can't offer any useful advice here except to shop around, as it were - assuming money is a factor for you, find out how much you could get for the device from other sources so you can make an informed decision. Contact Apple via its recycling policy page. If you've got an original iPhone, iPhone 3G or iPhone 3GS, Apple will recycle the device for you but doesn't offer any money, and you still need to take it into an Apple Store. On the other hand, devices of that vintage wouldn't fetch much second-hand anyway, unless it's in mint condition and you find someone who loves old tech. We'll look at selling options in the rest of this article. Tags: iPhone , Apple , iPhone 5s , iPhone 5c , iPhone 6 , Buy/Sell , iPhone 6s Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi.

Tim Graham/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Tim Graham/Getty Images A man listens during a high fidelity demonstration in April, 1974. Tim Graham/Getty Images When you stream a song on Spotify, it's delivered in an audio format — imagine these formats to be containers as literal as a phonograph record — cheekily named "Ogg Vorbis." YouTube, one of the most popular music streaming "services" in the world by volume, prefers something called AAC, or "Advanced Audio Coding." Radio stations, whenever possible, tend to prefer lossless WAV files. If you've played music from your hard drive as far back as the early aughts or as recently as this morning, you may have clicked play on an MP3. You'll be able to tomorrow, next week or a decade from now, provided your music player of choice still has the electricity to do so. The Record The MP3 Is Officially Dead, According To Its Creators We've been the source of some confusion on that subject recently. An article published here 11 days ago quoted Bernhard Grill — one of the developers of the MP3 format and also of the AAC format for the German research institution Fraunhofer — saying AAC is technologically superior to the MP3 and also that AAC is one of the most widely used formats for listening today, through its ubiquity within streaming, if nothing else (and there's more). That article's headline oversold Dr. Grill as having characterized the MP3 being dead. It would have been more accurate — and more interesting really — if the writer of that article (the same as this one) wrote that the MP3 may be dying. (That article did say explicitly that people would go on using MP3s, but hey.) To parse this tipping point (and to explore whether we're even in the midst of one) we called Jonathan Sterne — after he reached out to us in response to that earlier article — the author of MP3: The Meaning of a Format and a professor of communication studies at McGill University. As with VHS tapes and cassettes, no format is "dead," as long as the equipment to play it is still alive. The resurgence of vinyl records is illustrative of that point. But the tide seems to have turned — and that turn, like most of media history within capitalism, is complicated by economic interests, advances in technology, an ever-increasingly ephemeral connection to media and, either most or least importantly, the subjectivity of our personal experiences. All of which we explore with Sterne. Fraunhofer's patent on the MP3 may literally be dead, and with it the institution's monetization of it — but there are, as Fraunhofer itself points out, still trillions of MP3s out there. Or, as Sterne explains: "MP3s are still the most widely used audio format in the world." Andrew Flanagan: What does Fraunhofer's patent lapse allow developers to do now that they couldn't do before? Jonathan Sterne: "That's a great question. So... people have a really hard time understanding intellectual property. If you think of it like a trade monopoly, it's really easy to understand. Who has the right to trade in a certain code or perform or record or claim authorship over a song? Things like that, those are trade monopolies. They're not property in the sense of 'If you steal my car I can't use it.' Right? So the patent is a monopoly — which, actually, Fraunhofer didn't fully exercise. First of all, users like me, listening to music at home, never had to pay for the rights to use the MP3 decoding protocols. In fact, if you build a little free software thing that made no money, you also wouldn't have to pay. So there are already unlicensed MP3 encoders and controllers out there." Like LAME. "Yes. So they're not paying Fraunhofer already. But, if Apple puts out an MP3 decoder, they pay Fraunhofer. And that's what's going to stop. Fraunhofer has always maintained that AAC is better than MP3. It's more efficient and, at low bitrates in test situations, people can sometimes hear the difference in terms of fewer coding artifacts and things like that. When you put on earbuds and get on the metro, you won't hear the difference at all." If you're using pretty nice headphones you might? "Not on the Metro. One of the people involved in the MPEG group said it's like when you buy a new home. First, you noticed a nice view out the living room window, and it's only later that you notice a little crack in the window. It's like that. You have to learn to hear the artifacts. "And that's just the way it works. That's true for any new audio or video format, people start noticing things that they didn't used to. Whether those things bother listeners is entirely subjective and it's entirely situational. If you think of the way people listen to music most of the time, to say AAC is better than MP3 — yes, by technical standards, absolutely. If you're sitting in a quiet room paying rapt attention to the music, sure. The minute you put it through earbuds, or go for a walk, or play it in your car, or listen distractedly, those differences matter less and less." At the root of a lot of the feedback I got from the article is the availability of the underlying technology of the MP3. I'm wondering: If the MP3 is not dead but finally free, what is it free to do? "Honestly, I don't think much is going to change. I wouldn't say 'oh the MP3 is finally free and all these things are going to change.' All it's going to happen is Apple is going to stop paying Fraunhofer, or whoever. (I don't actually know that Apple's paying Fraunhofer because I'm not privy to their licensing agreements, but whoever's paying them is going to stop paying.) "That's why I pushed back on the 'MP3 is dead.' It's not like the switch from vinyl to compact disc, where U.S. record distributors stopped accepting returns on unbought records from record stores, at which point stores had to switch over to CDs or take on additional financial risk. There's nothing that Fraunhofer can do to prevent people from using MP3s. "So, since it's the most common form of audio format in the world — right now — a more likely scenario, if you look at the history of audio formats, is that over time its use will continue and then eventually it will decline, like all audio formats before it. It will eventually be replaced by something else, but that won't be because Fraunhofer stopped supporting it. It'll be because something else came along, and people will have a reason to switch either in terms of consumer motivation or because of some digital rights management scheme, or some kind of technological system that is a closed system." So things aren't really going to change, regardless of the patent, or regardless of the availability of superior technology, whether they be OGG or AAC. "So, the one story you get with audio is that there's this inevitable march of progress towards higher definition, and higher definition is better and more realistic — which isn't always true — and that MP3 is some great aberration where we took a step back. That has nothing to do with how the history of audio technologies have actually unfolded. Yes, the CD has much more theoretical dynamic range than an Edison cylinder. Of course. But what you see are, every few decades, format wars, where one format ekes out another, usually because of social conditions, like which players in the industry are more powerful. Or accidental conditions — the reason MP3 took off in the first place was because their shareware program was hacked and people started using MP3 encoding for file sharing — and then companies caught up to it, and Fraunhofer benefitted. They actually didn't very successfully market it. "When things started going well for them, they were able to seize the opportunity. And, you know, they use a lot of money to fund their research. It's not like there's some big corrupt media corporation. It's just that, the minute they invented AAC they said 'this is better.' So they've been saying that for probably, I don't know, 20 years now, give or take. And now they have no financial interest in MP3s carrying on. "So it's a great headline to say MP3 is dead, but they're still all over the Internet, people's hard drives are still full of them. This is really saying like, '45rpm vinyl is dead but 33rpm vinyl continues.' It's a sort of narcissism of small differences." His quote — Bernard Grill's, who helped develop the MP3 and AAC — was that AAC is in such wider use on platforms like YouTube and streaming services. What I took was that it's dead as far as the usefulness from now into the future. "I would totally disagree with that, I think it's totally useful for people who want to listen to their music that they've already acquired or paid for. "You know, I was actually getting e-mails from people saying 'does this mean I have to like, re-encode all of my music or acquire it in some different format?' And that's exactly what you don't want. This sort of media industry model where everybody buys the same movies TV over and over again." Let's make that very clear: MP3 and AAC are free for any user (not company) to take advantage of. "Yes, absolutely. I mean the reason why the free software people didn't like MP3 was because it was tied to royalties and Fraunhofer, whereas OGG was completely open source, anybody could use it anyone could contribute to it." The MP3 and other formats are based on some psychoacoustic assumptions that I was told last year were at least mildly off the mark. "Any psychoacoustic assumption is a generalization, because we're all walking around with two sets of ears and one brain, and psychoacoustics are all based on aggregate data populations. And in some cases, weird populations. So like 20Hz to 20kHz — the frequency range for 'normal' hearing, is based on research done on New York City schoolchildren. My colleague Mara Mills has written about that. "The original psychoacoustic assumptions that Karlheinz Brandenburg tried to code into the OCF, which was the format before MP3, he took out of Eberhard Zwicker's book Psychoacoustics — he literally took those numbers and put them into the software. And they sounded terrible. The reason they sounded terrible is because psychoacousticians do tests using tones or noise bursts, and MP3 was designed to encode speech and music. And so they started doing this basic research to say: 'If we tweak it this way, do the cymbals sound worse or better? If we tweak it this way, does the articulation of the voice get muddier or clearer?' "A lot of the things that people complain about with MP3s are not the result of the removal of data but rather the imprint of the format on that sound. So things like changes to the stereo image, that's not a result of removing data, that's the result of the way the format codes. "So yeah, it's always a compromise, and especially as you get to lower bit rates, you're asking the algorithm to basically choose. 'Where is the stuff people are least likely to miss?' And it can guess wrong, because it's an algorithm, not a person. And it has limited information. What's amazing is how well the MP3 worked, and that speaks I think to the standardization of recording, and audio, and radio sound across the world. People expect well-recorded or well-broadcast sound to sound a certain way, regardless of where it comes from and what genre it is." Now I'm wondering about the end game of fidelity. "If you look at history, which is really the only empirical evidence we have, sound fidelity has been used to market new audio formats basically since the invention of the cylinder phonograph. So in 1878 you can find articles saying that Edison's tinfoil phonograph reproduces sound with perfect fidelity. So there's always the story where we're at 'the end stage of high-definition,' and that greater definition will bring people greater musical pleasure. "What actually happens is the aesthetics switch — so people want more bass, they want less bass, they want more high-end, they want less high-end. People talk about how 'organic' [vinyl] records sound, but of course every record, in the U.S. anyways, goes through the RIAA curve. So it is in fact a highly processed and arbitrary and standardized sound, in exactly the same way that WAV or AIFF or MP3 is. So it's been a successful technique for marketing audio. "The second thing is, I want audio engineers and record industry professionals to care about audio quality. Does that mean that higher audio quality will save the music industry (which is still highly profitable, it's just not as profitable as it was)? Does it mean that it will get more young people interested in paying for music? Does it mean that the people who pay for music will pay more for music? I think that's a social question. The person who buys the nicer speakers for their home stereo is going to be interested in this. The person that's like, playing music out of their telephone speaker in the back of the bus for their friend, this isn't going to make any difference to." It might be apocryphal, but it reminds me of that Steve Jobs quote. They don't know what high-fidelity is until they hear it. "And when they do, they may or may not care. This has been true since the term high-fidelity was invented. And it's independent of love for music. You can find people who are incredibly devoted to classical music and listen to it out of a small six-inch mono speaker on a desktop radio. That's fine for them, and they will tell you they love the music. They might even go to the symphony and give money. High fidelity isn't part of their experience. High definition has sold more TVs lately, but is it going to sell more music, is it going to save the music industry? I don't know. Probably not." There was a lot of, I think, misinterpretation of the article, from open information advocates and open source software advocates. I was curious if the availability of the source code for most of these formats has been pretty widespread for almost two decades. What are they missing out on? "I mean, I think it's just a matter of ethical commitments, that software that's widely used ought to be ought to be... well first of all, it ought to be free. It ought to be freely available to modify yourself. I mean, I'm sympathetic, but I'm not a member of that community. I use plenty of proprietary software in my daily life. So I can't claim to be an authentic open source person and I don't code." Like Richard Stallman. "Yeah no, I'm certainly not Richard Stallman. The kernel of it is this, and I think that this is true for all technology, which is that a more democratic technology is a technology that you as a user, even if you don't understand it, you have the potential to understand it, repair it and modify it. Where the inner workings of the technology are not controlled by a third party over whom you have no power and on whom you are dependent. "I wrote a paper with Dylan Mulvin on the history of the switch from monochrome to color TV in the 1950s. In the 1950s the US government told the TV industry — remember that the broadcast bandwidth is a public resource and it's managed by the government, they control the national television system. The government said sure, by all means move to color, but you can't change the standard in such a way that you will force people to buy new televisions. Completely different business model from Apple releasing a new iPhone every year to get you to buy a new one. "In Europe they have things like extended product responsibility, where companies are legally liable for the disposal of the products that they produce. In the software world like it seems like this is all just about code, but of course code runs on hardware you need something to run it. And so every time you obsolete a standard, that's a chance for a company to either force or try to persuade someone to buy something new, which means something else is likely to go into a landfill." Which brings us back to the MP3. "Yes, it does."

Problem Solving | 03 Apr 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (5) PDF Problems Continue in 10.12.4, but Primarily Affect Developers by Adam C. Engst Numerous readers have asked me if last week’s macOS 10.12.4 update resolved more of the PDF problems we outlined in “Sierra PDF Problems Get Worse in 10.12.2” (2 January 2017). The previous 10.12.3 update addressed the most serious bug, which caused a PDF edited in Preview to lose its OCR text layer (see “Apple Releases macOS Sierra 10.12.3, iOS 10.2.1, tvOS 10.1.1, and watchOS 3.1.1,” 23 January 2017). Last week, I polled the developers who had commented on the topic for my first article. The consensus was that Apple’s rewritten-for-Sierra PDFKit framework continues to improve, while simultaneously introducing new bugs. Christian Grunenberg of DEVONtechnologies said, “Since January I have added several new workarounds and improved old workarounds. The 10.12.4 release makes only one workaround obsolete and introduces a new bug.” He followed that up a few days later by saying, “In the last 24 hours I received various bug reports related to 10.12.4. In one case a PDF document freezes both DEVONthink and Preview; in another case pages are rendered white (in DEVONthink but also sometimes in Preview and both DEVONthink’s and Preview’s sidebar aren’t rendered at all); and in the last case PDF documents are rendered fuzzy.” Michael Tsai of C-Command Software initially outlined four bugs that Apple fixed in 10.12.4 and four that remain open, and a day later said that one of his customers had reported another crash that’s new in 10.12.4. The story for users is somewhat better because developers are either working around the bugs they find or quietly removing functionality until PDFKit works correctly. Michael Tsai also said that there’s a middle ground of display and scrolling glitches that can’t be worked around or avoided. Nonetheless, users continue to have problems, particularly with large or encrypted PDFs in Preview and other apps that rely on PDFKit for their PDF-related functionality. Nothing seems to be as severe as the OCR text layer deletion bug that 10.12.3 fixed, but if you experience trouble with Preview, try a different app. For merely viewing a PDF, use the free Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. If you need to manipulate a PDF, turn to Smile’s $74.95 PDFpen, which doesn’t use PDFKit and is thus immune from these issues. Similarly unaffected is Adobe Acrobat DC, which requires a subscription that costs either $24.99 per month if billed monthly or $14.99 per month billed annually (that’s $179.88 per year). Acrobat DC is also included in the full $49.99 per month Creative Cloud subscription. To answer those who have asked if they can now upgrade to Sierra, I’d have to say that if you rely heavily on apps built on top of PDFKit for viewing and manipulating non-trivial PDFs, it’s probably worth continuing to hold off. If you mostly just read PDFs in Preview, you likely won’t hit any stumbling blocks unless you work with large or encrypted PDFs.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

On page 16 are the cards that I print out to provide proof of coverage and keep in the glove box..

Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-04-04 08:04 This is reminiscent of the networking issues that were introduced in OS X 10.10 Yosemite, which also involved new technology developed by Apple. Whether this is a pattern, and what the pattern reveals about Apple's development expertise is, I'm sure, a matter of opinion. I think it's safe to say, though, that neither of these developments is a positive for the company. In the case of Yosemite, Apple was eventually obliged to revert to the old networking technologies that had been working perfectly well in OS X for years, while Yosemite never did develop into a reliable version of OS X. Nor were the problems with the new networking tech ever resolved so that it might be reintroduced. It's anybody's guess whether Apple will scrap this new version of PDFKit. If you're waiting for them to fix the bugs therein, I don't recommend holding your breath. Their track record with this sort of thing is hardly encouraging. In the meantime, spending $75 for software to work around Apple's mistakes seems to me to be a less than optimal solution, however necessary in some cases. OS X 10.11 El Capitan is a stable and supported version of OS X. If you rely on PDFs in your workflow even occasionally Sierra seems like a risky gamble. Which raises serious questions about the pending changes to the Apple file system, which have the potential to bring about problems on an unprecedented scale. If they mess this up they will stop macOS development cold and turn the whole platform into a pathetic joke. There's nothing more fundamental and essential to any OS than the file system. The longer they wait to introduce APFS the better in my opinion. They cannot spend too much time proofing their work. Apple seems to have forgotten, if they ever knew, the carpenter's maxim, measure twice, cut once. These days they don't even seem to be measuring once. That's not to say the macOS file system isn't in need of an overhaul. The issue is whether Apple is competent to implement such an overhaul. This latest boondoggle with PDFKit isn't a good sign. My gloom and doom may seem excessive; no one would be more pleased than I if Apple stopped this self-destructive cycle of behavior and gave me reason to change my toon. I don't know about you, but I'm not encouraged by this latest failure in Apple's quality control procedures. Clearly they just won't learn from their mistakes. Which means they will continue to make more of them—and we will continue to pay the price for their neglect of the fundamentals of good business. Reply barefootguru   2017-04-04 17:08 'The longer they wait to introduce APFS': Apple's busy converting some billions of iPhones & iPads, Watches and TVs to APFS as they're upgraded to iOS 10.3, tvOS 10.2, and watchOS 3.2. Reply Andrew Hazlett  2017-05-21 10:01 I thought my pdfs were being glitchy because maybe there was something wrong with my graphics card. It's a relief and a frustration to realize it is Sierra. There are certain sets of users who *live* in pdfs, e.g., lawyers, academics, journalists, and more. I find it very depressing that Apple left these issues unattended or half-addressed. There are certain basics a user has got to be able to count on, but I guess wielders of pdfs make up a tiny micropercentage of Apple's customers at this point. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-22 12:28 I've checked with my sources and as far as I can tell, there are no PDFKit-related fixes (or new bugs) in 10.12.5.

Here's why Uber should be worried.  Economies of scale: Didi has become the world's largest ride-hailing company, and it's not even close. Uber and Lyft combined handle 70 million bookings per month. Didi alone gets 600 million. That's a stunning number for a company that got started in 2012 Driven leaders: Company founder Cheng Wei is an intensely competitive 35-year-old chemistry major from a small town in mountainous south central China. In 2014, Cheng brought 39-year old Jean Liu on board as president. Ms. Liu, formerly a Goldman Sachs banker and Harvard grad, knows how to win investor confidence.   Deep pockets: Tencent and Alibaba, China's two most valuable companies, have invested in Didi. Other big-name backers include Temasek Holdings of Singapore, Japan's Softbank and Apple Inc., which bought a $1 billion (6.9 billion yuan) stake last year.  China monopoly: Didi controls 88 percent of China's ride-hailing market, giving it near-total dominance of its home turf.   You might recall that Uber had grand plans to conquer China when it entered the market in 2013. But Travis Kalanick & Co. were forced to capitulate last summer.  The battle was painful. Both companies lost billions of dollars subsidizing rides.  In the end, Didi won a short and nasty war of attrition and Uber's China business was folded into Didi's.  Throughout the clash, Cheng exhorted his employees to hold their ground against Uber: "No Chinese Internet company on Chinese soil has ever lost to foreigners and Didi will not be the first!"  Top valuation  Didi Chuxing was formed in 2015 from the merger of Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache, two ride-hailing rivals backed by Tencent and Alibaba, respectively. They joined hands to launch a counter-attack on Uber.  Leaders in Beijing, eager to exert maximum Chinese control over internet-based businesses, gave their blessing to the marriage.  At the time of the merger, Beijing-based Didi Chuxing was valued at  $6 billion. Today, the number is $50 billion, making Didi the world's most valuable start-up after Uber. Lyft, with a $7.5 billion valuation, looks tiny by comparison.  So what's next for Didi?  Mr. Cheng and Ms. Liu make no secret about their plans. This month, the company raised $5.5 billion to "pursue global expansion and self-driving technologies."  And where better to pursue those goals than in America?  Didi moves fast. In March, the company opened an r&d center to develop self-driving cars in Mountain View, Calif. Yes, that Mountain View, home to Apple headquarters.  That same month, Didi hired Charlie Miller away from Uber to lead its safety and security team. Miller made headlines when he successfully hacked and remotely controlled a Jeep.  Keep your eye on Didi Labs. Ride-hailing services such as Didi, Uber and Lyft are likely to provide the first real-world test of driverless vehicles. These companies are willing to pay extra for driverless technology -- which initially will be pricey -- because they can dispense with human drivers. Automakers also would prefer to have their car fleets tested, maintained and housed every night in a company garage. And if you are Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook, you can let a trusted partner beta-test your driverless technology without having to paste your Apple logo on the grille. So Didi and Uber -- which has formed a partnership with Waymo -- may prove to be combatants in a proxy war between Apple and Google for world domination. Clearly, the war between Uber and Didi is not over. The battleground has simply shifted from China's east coast to America's west coast.   Roles have shifted, too. This time, Didi is the attacker. Uber finds itself on the defensive, distracted by intellectual property lawsuits, sexual harassment claims and the new alliance between Lyft and Waymo.  One other important difference: Uber did not have many friends in China. By contrast, Didi is tight with Apple, the world's most valuable company. And Didi is a major shareholder in Lyft -- and Uber as well, for that matter. As part of their peace agreement in China, Didi acquired a $1 billion stake in Uber, while Uber gained a 20 percent share of Didi.  But this seems more like a temporary truce than a permanent treaty. Cross-ownership simply gave Uber a way to unwind its Chinese operation. Both companies still want to be No. 1.  Mr. Cheng, Didi's founder, was proud to say that no Chinese Internet company had ever lost to foreigners on Chinese soil. Will Didi be the first Chinese Internet firm to triumph on American shores?  Beep-beep!  -- Michael Dunne is president of Dunne Automotive Ltd., a Hong Kong-based company that facilitates investments between the U.S. and China.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Apple Is Boring -- and That's OK Critics may say Apple has lost its innovative luster, but the company's recent quarterly results prove that may not matter much. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) May 22, 2017 at 12:42PM I read an article recently that questioned whether Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had lost its "innovation mojo." It's not the first piece of journalism to address Apple's ability to impress consumers like it once did, and it won't be the last. And, to be fair, I think it's a perfectly reasonable question to ask. Apple's so-called innovations over the past few years have, for the most part, been slight upgrades (fingerprint sensors for the iPhone, a larger iPad with Apple Pencil, the Apple Watch, etc.) or a move into markets that were already established by other companies. In short, there's been nothing earth-shattering from Apple for quite some time. Image source: Getty Images. And for that reason, the case could be made that Apple is, well, a little boring. But the company has made it very clear, particularly in its latest quarter, that boring can be beneficial for investors. Here are five quick reasons why a perceived, or real, lack of innovation from Apple hasn't mattered all that much. 1. Revenue, profits, and share buybacks are up Apple reported a revenue increase of 4.5% year over year in the fiscal second quarter of 2017 and an earnings per share jump of 10.5%. That's not all that exciting, but consider that Apple's fiscal Q2 was the second consecutive quarter of growth after three consecutive quarters in 2016 of declining revenue. As a result of the strong quarter, Apple increased its share buyback program. "Given the strength of our business and our confidence in our future, we are happy to announce another $50 billion increase to our capital return program today," Apple CEO Tim Cook said. This boosts the company's capital return program to $300 billion and increases Apple's value for investors (what a snooze-fest, right?) 2. iPhones are still flying off the shelves The company sold 51.8 million iPhones in the third quarter, which accounted for about 63% of the company's total revenue. "We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus," Apple Cook said.  Strategy Analytics estimated that the iPhone 7 was the best-selling smartphone worldwide in the first quarter of this year, with the iPhone 7 Plus taking the No. 2 spot. Apple is still creating one of the most sought-after mobile devices, even after nearly a decade of iPhone sales. Seriously, can this company get any duller?   3. Service revenue is growing  Apple brought in $7 billion from the company's service segment in the most recent quarter, an increase of 18% year over year. This segment may not be as flashy as the iPhone, but it's been Apple's second-largest revenue stream for two straight quarters now, and it accounted for 13% of total revenue in Q2. Image source: Apple. This is an important category because it shows Apple's ability to bring in recurring revenue in addition to its hardware sales. Apple's active subscriptions now total 165 million, up from 150 million in the quarter ending in December. Wake me up when it's over.  4. Stock price is rising, yet still priced relatively cheap Apple's strong performance over the past few quarters has helped push the company's share price up more than 40% over the past six months and more than 60% over the past year.  Even with its share price gains, the company's stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 18,which is far below the average P/E ratio of 24 for stocks in the S&P 500. So, one of the world's most valuable companies is trading at a relatively inexpensive price...I think I need a nap. Chris Neiger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Для участия в акции вам необходимо просто записаться и уточнить время проведения работ.Выберите удобный для вас офис — метро Полежаевское или город Мытищи.Качественно выполненная замена масла, качественным маслом + гарантии + скидки. Ваша машина будет счастлива. доверяйте только профессионалам. Никаких скрытых наценок, только точная цена, только скидки!Цена у официалов цена у конкурентов Наша цена по акции Современные автоматические коробки передач Volvo очень технологичны и имеют сложную конструкцию. Их стоимость весьма значительна (более 200 тысяч рублей). По этим причинам АКПП современных автомобилей Вольво (Volvo) требуют более ответственного и квалифицированного отношения к своему обслуживанию.МАСЛО+РАБОТА=Узнай свою цену. Автоматические трансмиссии автомобилей в России работают в более тяжелых условиях, чем в Европе. Исследуя особенности работы масла в коробке Вольво (Volvo) в различных регионах, крупнейшие производителя трансмиссий пришли к выводу, что в России переключения передач происходит в два раза чаще.Это объясняется: переменчивым уровнем дорог относительно горизонта (спуски, подъемы) движение автомобиля в пробках (частые переключения N-1-2) высокая интенсивность движения по автомагистралям (обгоны)Важные функции в работе Вашего Вольво играет масло в коробке автомат, обеспечивающее правильность и долговечность работы коробки передач. Оно передает усилие на исполнительные механизмы, смазывает и охлаждает трущиеся поверхности. Оно регулярно находится под высоким давлением и температурами. Под воздействием этих факторов масла volvo окисляются, разрушается заводской пакет присадок. В нем теряются смазывающие, вязкостные и чистящие свойства. При больших перепадах температур в масла попадает конденсат, который также негативно влияет на его качестве. Фрикционы – основной элемент в АКПП Вольво (Volvo) для передачи крутящего момента. В процессе эксплуатации они изнашиваются, и абразивные частицы попадают в масла. Когда это происходит, масло АКПП сильно темнеет и появляется запах гари. Абразивные частицы, циркулируя по масляным каналом в коробке передач, приводят к выходу из строя блока гидравлических клапанов и других компонентов. Эксплуатация коробки передач с горелым, потерявшим свои свойства маслом, приводит к её преждевременному выходу из строя, поэтому вашему volvo необходима замена масла.Ремонт АКПП Вольво (Volvo) – от 110 тысяч рублей, замена на новую – более 250 тысяч рублей, замена масла — примерно 18 000 тысяч рублей.Первые симптомы неисправности АКПП: рывки при переключении R-D толчки при разгоне и ускорении рывки при переключении на пониженную передачу посторонний звук(гул) при движении из АКПП Замена масла акпп Вольво поможет избежать проблем, связанных с неправильной работой коробки передач на Вашем Вольво (Volvo).Как показывает наш опыт, на пробегах 40 — 80 тысяч километров (в зависимости от условий эксплуатаций) на автомобилях Вольво замена масла в коробке становится актуальна, поскольку масло теряет свои свойства.Что касается продолжительности данной процедуры — замена масла в АКПП Вольво занимает как правило около 2 часов.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Four New Nike Apple Watch Bands Launched By Adnan Farooqui on 05/22/2017 09:14 PDT Soon after launching iPhone cases made from sneaker soles, Nike today announced the launch of four new Apple Watch bands. The new bands have been coupled with a new shoe launch from Nike. The new Nike Sport Band colors for the Apple Watch have been designed to match the company’s new Air VaporMax Flyknit “Day to Night” running shoe collection. Nike is marketing these new bands for the Apple Watch Nike+ but given that there’s no major difference between that variant and others, the bands will be compatible with almost every other Apple Watch model. All of the four new bands will be sold through Nike’s online and retail stores starting June 1st. Apple and its resellers will have then in stock as well early next month. They’re going to cost $49 each. This is a result of the expanding partnership between Apple and Nike. The Nike+ Watch, launched in 2016, was a major step forward in this partnership. The co-branded NikeLab watch was launched earlier this year in April. We can expect both companies to continue this partnership in the months to come and launch more products that bring out the best in their own products. Nike fans can keep their fingers crossed for more in the future. Filed in Gadgets. Read more about Apple Watch, nike and Wearable Tech.

The iPhone 8 is expected to be just one of a trio of new iPhones that Apple launches in 2017, part of its annual upgrade cycle. However, in marking the tenth anniversary of the series, the iPhone 8 will not only debut all-new features but a new premium tier of pricing. It’s been the subject of speculation since the idea of an “anniversary edition” iPhone first began filtering through the rumor mill. On the one hand, Apple is expected to do its usual revamp of its existing devices. The iPhone 7 will be upgraded to the iPhone 7S, while the iPhone 7 Plus will be upgraded to the iPhone 7S Plus. Those changes are believed to be fairly evolutionary. The real revolution should come in the iPhone 8. There, the prediction is a much-anticipated switch from LCD to OLED for the new phone’s display. It’ll have twin cameras, like the iPhone 7 Plus, but with the dual lenses rotated 90-degrees with the potential benefit of improvements in Portrait mode photography and other things. Maybe most importantly, however, it’ll squeeze in-between the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in size. Physically, the iPhone 8 is believed to be more akin to the smaller phone. However, courtesy of OLED’s minimal bezels – which will allow for a virtually edge-to-edge screen – and the replacement of a physical home button with a virtual one, the handset is expected to be able to fit a display closer in size to the iPhone 7 Plus. None of that comes cheap, mind. Apple’s strategy, as far as we can tell so far, is to add to the iPhone line-up rather than replace it. The iPhone 8 will be a “halo device” at the top of the range, and price to match. Some early predictions have pegged that starting price at a whopping $1,000 or thereabouts. That’s based on the value-add of features like wireless charging, which have never before been offered on an iPhone without accessories. They weren’t improbable, either, given a high-storage iPhone 7 Plus will set you back $969 unlocked and SIM-free. Now UBS analyst Steven Milunovich has waded in, Business Insider reports. In a note to clients today, he predicted a more conservative figure, with the iPhone 8 priced at $870. A 256 GB version, he went on to suggest, would be $1,070. NOW READ: The iPhone 8 design molds reportedly just leaked That’s still expensive, of course, but a lot more attainable than some previous estimates we’ve seen. Milunovich bases his numbers on the supply chain and other factors, and predicts that despite the price tag, the iPhone 8 will be very popular among buyers. Indeed, he predicts that 45-percent of all the new 2017 iPhone handsets sold will be the OLED iPhone 8. At the same time, there’s ongoing speculation that a revolution in iPhone tech proved a little more challenging than Apple might have anticipated. Several reports have suggested that the iPhone 8 will be released later than planned, perhaps even in October or November. Meanwhile, as has been the case in previous years, supplies of the phone are expected to be fairly scarce; expect long waiting lists for your expensive iPhone 8.

Tuesday, May 23, 2017  |  Shaban 27, 1438 Business Things to do today UAE Prayer Times People & Politics UAE Weather Sign In Edit Profile Sign Out UAE World Business Sport Arts & Life Opinion Blogs Personal Finance Aviation Banking Economy Energy The Life Markets Media Property Retail Technology Telecoms Travel & Tourism Masayoshi Son, the chairman and chief executive of SoftBank Group, says he has a 300-year plan for his company that includes making it the world’s most valuable firm. Kiyoshi Ota / Bloomberg Masayoshi Son charts a fast track to the future – with Middle Eastern backers May 22, 2017 Updated: May 22, 2017 08:52 PM Topics: Mubadala When Masayoshi Son was a boy growing up on Japan’s southern island of Kyushu, he kept a notebook to scribble down new inventions he hoped to create one day. Today, the SoftBank founder has almost US$100 billion to invest on making the next big thing a reality. Mr Son’s SoftBank Group has just closed the first round of a planned $100bn investment fund, with money raised from Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Company, as well as Apple and Qualcomm. The Softbank Vision Fund gives the 59-year-old access to a pool of capital unparalleled in the worlds of private equity or venture capital. Mr Son is not one for understatement. He has said, without irony, that he has a 300-year plan for SoftBank and aims to build the world’s most valuable company. With the Vision Fund, Mr Son vows to become the biggest investor in tech over the next decade, as he bets on the future of artificial intelligence, connected devices, satellites and the integration of computers and humans. Indeed in April, he led the $5.5bn investment in China’s Didi Chuxing, the largest venture funding on record. "We saw a big bang in PCs, we saw a big bang in the internet," Mr Son said in February. "I believe the next big bang is going to be even bigger. To be ready for that, we need to set the foundation and that foundation is SoftBank Vision Fund." Mr Son has some enthusiastic supporters. The Saudi deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman agreed to make his country the cornerstone investor with a $45bn cheque after meeting Mr Son. Mubadala, meanwhile, made a $15bn commitment to the fund. "Our participation in the SoftBank Vision Fund perfectly complements Mubadala’s strategy as a long-term global investor and partner to the technology sector’s high-growth companies," Khaldoon Al Mubarak, the chief executive of Mubadala, said in a statement on Saturday. "Technology and innovation are central to the UAE’s economic diversification strategy, and we believe the Vision Fund has the scale to deploy significant capital into these disruptive industries that are shaping the future." Besides Apple and Qualcomm, Foxconn Technology and Sharp are also putting in capital. SoftBank said in the same statement on Saturday the fund has $93bn in committed capital and aims to reach $100bn with a final close within six months. Mr Son’s mega-fund will unleash an unprecedented amount of money into sectors already seen as overcapitalised. Private equity returns have plummeted in recent years because there is too much money chasing too few deals. Venture capital faces similar issues. "A $100bn fund is mind boggling," says Steven Kaplan, a professor at University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business who co-founded its entrepreneurship programme. "There’s too much capital now so bringing in more capital doesn’t make any sense." Mr Kaplan struggles to think of a precedent for what Mr Son is attempting. He says the closest parallel may be the late 1990s when money poured into US internet companies, fuelling sky-high valuations – right until the market crashed. Private equity firms are sitting on record piles of cash. The amount of unspent money hit $820bn at the end of 2016, up from $755bn a year earlier, according to the research firm Preqin. The venture total hit $142bn, compared with $127bn at the end of 2015. "There is already a tremendous amount of dry powder out there," says Felice Egidio, Preqin’s head of venture capital products. "Investment opportunities are getting harder and harder to come by." In other words, Mr Son may be more than the most powerful investor in tech – he may be the most dangerous, too. A flood of capital into AI or driverless cars, can inflate valuations and spawn too many competitors, leaving everyone struggling to make money. Mr Son has spent his life defying expectations. He left Japan at 16 to study in the United States. While in school, he invented an electronic translator that he sold to Sharp, making his first $1 million. "It’s like he’s from the future," says Hong Lu, who began working with Mr Son in California 40 years ago and went on to co-found UTStarcom Holdings. Mr Son founded his own company in 1981 and began to distribute software for companies such as Microsoft. He then built it through a series of high-stakes bets. In a deal that would supply him with cash for other investments, he acquired Vodafone’s struggling Japan business and turned it into a profit machine. His fearlessness almost cost him his company. During the internet bubble, he invested in about 800 companies, vowing to create a "netbatsu", the digital age equivalent of Japan’s zaibatsu industrial conglomerates bound by cross-share ownership. SoftBank shares surged and Mr Son’s net worth hit $68bn in 2000, almost surpassing Microsoft’s Bill Gates as the world’s richest man. Then the bubble burst and hundreds of his investments went under. His stock fell 99 per cent. But among the wreckage, Mr Son had some winners. He was an early backer of Yahoo and he bet on China’s Alibaba Group, which turned into one of the best venture bets of all time. He parlayed an initial $20m investment into a stake that is now valued at more than $90bn, or 4,500 times his original investment. If Mr Son was unnerved by the crash, he never let it show. He continued to cut big deals, including the $22bn acquisition of the US wireless carrier Sprint. Last year, he made the biggest deal of his career, buying the chip designer ARM for $32bn. After the announcement, his stock got hammered as stunned investors fled. "It would be unfair to Masa Son if we said we were not warned that some ‘crazy ideas’ were on anvil," Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies Group, wrote at the time. "To us, the ARM acquisition ... appears largely inconsistent with SoftBank’s investment strategy … It does not inspire much confidence." Mr Son was unfazed. "People think this was a stupid move, they’ve voted with their money," he said at the time. "It’s easy to look at where your pieces are now and place the next one nearby. This one is 10, 20, 50 moves ahead." That set the stage for the Vision Fund. Mr Son saw once-in-a-lifetime opportunities, while SoftBank’s investors fretted the risks. The question was where he could find a new set of backers willing to finance his vision of the future. Then the Saudi deputy crown prince went to Tokyo last September just as he was looking for ways to diversify the economy beyond oil and invest billions of petro-dollars in new industries under the kingdom’s Vision 2030. SoftBank’s Vision Fund was announced publicly in October and Mr Son’s deal-making synapses have been firing even before the fund closed. He agreed to invest $1bn in OneWeb, a start-up that aims to beam internet connectivity to every corner of the globe. He is also putting $300m into WeWork, a New York-based start-up that rents out offices to small businesses and freelancers. Mr Son is raising the Vision Fund as he sees deals he thinks are even more promising than Alibaba. In February, he cited the leaders of the sharing economy, including Uber Technologies and Airbnb. SoftBank is behind major funding for rivals to Uber. Didi, the biggest ride-hailing service in China, last month announced its record $5.5bn fundraising, led by the Japanese company. The South East Asian operator Grab plans to raise more than $1.5bn in a round backed by the Japanese company, insiders have said. "Uber is redefining the transportation industry now; Airbnb is doing it to the hotel industry. You can expect that to happen in every single industry," Mr Son said. He has given a few details of how he plans to use the capital. It is likely to be a mixture of many investments on the scale of OneWeb with a handful of very large deals. "This won’t be a typical fund," he said. "Most of our investments will range between 20 and 40 per cent, making us the largest shareholder and board member, in a position to discuss strategy with the founders." The Vision Fund will be based in West London’s Mayfair and advised by SoftBank subsidiaries collectively called SB Investment Advisers. Rajeev Misra, SoftBank’s head of strategic finance, will be the chief executive of SB Investment Advisers and a member of the fund’s investment committee. Mr Son will have unusual influence. He will be the only so-called key man in the fund, according to a person familiar with the matter. There are typically several people with such a designation in investment funds, which gives limited partners the option to withdraw from the fund if one of those key men leave. Deal makers are cautious. Ted Gooden, the managing director at Berkshire Capital, predicts returns are likely to decline given the excess of capital. "There is so much money in the system, it changes the industry," he says. Not everyone outside of Mr Son’s orbit is a sceptic, though. David Brophy, a finance professor at the University of Michigan, says the sheer size of SoftBank’s fund will give Mr Son advantages no other investor has. He can jump into deals that are more capital intensive than anyone else can handle and he can keep funding them longer. "You can walk in with muscle that no one else has," says Mr Brophy. "I wouldn’t focus too much on what we see in the rear view mirror. It’s more important to look ahead." * Bloomberg business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Economy How to know a business has begun to lose its way Careem launches “Box” courier delivery service Masayoshi Son charts a fast track to the future – with Middle Eastern backers Gulf investors eye France MOST VIEWED Business | All Noon.com chief technology officer steps down Aldar to build twofour54’s Yas home Emirates to tap into China demand with A380 expansion on Beijing and Shanghai routes Careem launches “Box” courier delivery service BlackBerry backs brand appeal in region Lebanese in cars are jamming progress Change of taps at Abu Dhabi mosques to reduce water consumption and save Dh20m annually Maldives resort operator’s job is being an island companion Arabtec wins Dh1.46bn contract to build tower in Dubai Masayoshi Son charts a fast track to the future – with Middle Eastern backers More Most Viewed Some Abu Dhabi restaurants to open in the day during Ramadan 2017 Noon.com chief technology officer steps down Dubai Police recruit UAE’s first ‘Robocop’ Some Dubai restaurants to open in the day during Ramadan 2017 Melania and Ivanka hail progress by Saudi women Suicide bomber kills 22 at UK Ariana Grande concert Dubai opens night beach in bid to protect swimmers The real test for an Arab Nato will come the day after Raqqa falls UK terror attack: 22 dead at Ariana Grande concert in Manchester – live updates Philippines Airline scraps flights between Abu Dhabi and Manila More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Debt Panel helps reduce personal debt stigma in UAE Marsa Al Arab project near Burj Al Arab to feature two new luxury islands Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, Q1 2017 – in pictures Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, Q1 2017 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT What Trump said in Riyadh: full transcript of US president’s speech on Islam Saudi women on course to increase presence in corporate landscape Switch to Mobile Site About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae
Skip to content comics cosplay tv/film games Submit tip Contact CGC Insider Search for: Details Of The Softbank Vision Fund Show Why Apple Buying Disney Is Probably A Bad Idea Posted by Mark Seifert May 22, 2017 One Comment The financial news is breathless this morning with details of the details of the Softbank Vision Fund, a staggering $93 Billion tech investment fund which includes partners such as Apple, Qualcomm, ARM, Foxconn, Sharp, and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment.  I think I like The Register‘s take the best, which is basically ‘The world’s biggest tech fund focused on AI and robotics, what could possibly go wrong?‘ Still, everybody VC on the planet is rushing into this area — if robots are going to run the world, you probably want to be the one who makes those robots — and that includes SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son. Apple is in the fund to the itune of one billion dollars, which is pretty much nothing to them, as they famously have cash reserves of over $250 Billion. When you have that sort of money, other people enjoy telling you how you should spend it.  And as Apple’s cash has piled up past that quarter-trillion (trillion!) dollar mark, there’s been rising calls from analysts who think they should use it to buy Disney.  It’s a bad idea for lots of reasons, but it does make for a lovely headline, so here we are. But relative to the Softbank Vision Fund news, the Wall Street Journal dropped this little tidbit recently: SoftBank Group Corp. scrapped a planned $100 million investment in a smartphone startup founded by the creator of Google’s Android software, partly because of the Japanese investor’s increasingly close relationship with Apple Inc., according to people familiar with the matter. Does that sound like a company who should run a large chunk of the hardware, distribution methods, and — if they acquired Disney — content creation that provides the world with quite a lot of its entertainment?  What happens when want to buy or play Warner Bros, Universal, Paramount, etc content on your Apple device?  Perhaps nothing, but perhaps it’s also better that we don’t have to find out.

If Apple can continue to increase revenue, expand both gross and operating margins, and sustain share buybacks, the Cupertino tech company could reach the $1 trillion threshold within the next 12 to 18 months, according to a report released by RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani. RBC Capital Markets' also raised its price target for Apple from $157 to $168 per share, based on optimism that Apple can reach $12+ earnings per share in 2019. Reaching that price would push Apple stock into the $192-195 per share range, which would push its market cap of over $1 trillion, according to RBC.  "We believe AAPL’s current stock price creates an attractive entry point for investors to benefit from its ability to return to revenue and EPS growth in FY17," writes Daryanani. The report said that Apple's unique advantages over its competitors should help it continue to lead the field. "We believe AAPL’s true differentiation is its unique computing ecosystem: iOS," the RBC Capital Markets report said. "iOS provides users with an integrated, scalable, and seamless experience across multiple devices, which we believe will be difficult for competitors to replicate in scale." Others believe Apple is in need of a "narrative shift" to significantly boost it's stock price. "Is Apple a hardware company subject to rapid commoditization or a sticky consumer-brand capable of driving sustainable growth at a high margin?" asked a recent UBS report. "Further price upside is more likely to come from earnings upside than continued multiple expansion." There are already positive signs in Apple's customer loyalty metrics heading into the iPhone 8 release later this year, and the company is preparing to launch three new laptops in June at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference.Markets Insider SHARE THIS POST News for AppleMORE Ford just fired its CEO — and the stock price is going nowhere (F, TSLA, AAPL, GOOG) Business Insider 10h Ford's new CEO will have to tell Wall Street a different story (F, TSLA, AAPL, GOOG) Business Insider 10h Apple just launched a new attack on Android (AAPL) Business Insider 10h US STOCKS-Wall St ends up; defense, tech stocks a boost (GD, RTN, LMT, BA, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, F) Reuters 10h US STOCKS-Wall St gain as defense, tech stocks rise (GD, RTN, LMT, BA, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, F) Reuters 11h Now is the worst time to buy a new MacBook from Apple (AAPL) Business Insider 11h US STOCKS-Wall St extends gains as defense, tech stocks rise (GD, RTN, LMT, BA, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, F) Reuters 13h Italy offers multinationals voluntary "webtax" to avoid wrangles (AMZN, AAPL) Reuters 14h your MARKET VIEW Your Personalized Market Center Related Stocks AAPL 154.05 1.15 (0.75%) 5/22/2017 Disclaimer Get real-time AAPL charts here >> Find News GO Home / Stocks / Apple-Quote / News for Apple Apple / RBC: Here's how Apple becomes a $1 trillion company (AAPL) Follow us on: Also check out: * Copyright © 2017 Business Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

Morgan analysts Rod Hall raises his rating on Qualcomm's stock to the equivalent of a Buy, arguing that investors should look past the company's legal battle with Apple because the shares are too cheap given the potential payoff from its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors later this year. By Tiernan Ray May 22, 2017 11:14 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Shares of wireless chip giant Qualcomm (QCOM) are up $1.46, or 2.5%, at $59.14, after J.P. Morgan’s Rod Hall this morning raised his rating on the shares to Overweight from Neutral, with a $68 price target, writing that there is “fundamental upside given the expected closure of the NXPI acquisition by the end of this year," referring to the pending acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Despite the company’s ongoing tussle with Apple (AAPL), which has compelled its own contract manufacturers to stop paying royalties owed to Qualcomm, Hall thinks that the “valuation gap is too large” given the NXP deal. Regarding the dispute, it’s likely to result in “incremental discounting” of Qualcomm’s royalty rate, but that alone shouldn’t deter investing in the stock: While we acknowledge that Apple’s attack has been broader than we have seen with other disputes we believe it is ultimately in Apple’s interest to complete a new deal with Qualcomm. We would expect the deal to involve incremental discounting but we believe our valuation of Qualcomm in the next section adequately accounts for this. Hall thinks that the battle with Apple will be "resolved by 2018, with royalties coming back to normal levels in 2019." That leads him to present his sum-of-the-parts analysis of Qualcomm’s valuation, justifying his $68 target. He notes, "We also use a 2018 PE multiple of 11.9x for the QCT business, in-line with Intel." "We note that this feels conservative to us considering current market sentiment around Intel and what we believe are solid growth prospects for Qualcomm in automotive and IoT oriented applications for their silicon." Underlying that is his assumption that there will be "well over 50% earnings accretion due to the NXPI deal and we believe this deal could close as early at CQ3 though Qualcomm has simply said that closure is expected by the end of the year." Here's his model: In case you were wondering about competition from Intel (INTC) for Apple’s baseband, Hall writes, "We also believe that loss of further baseband share in the iPhone to Intel is a possibility later this year as the dispute wears on." Interestingly, Hall provides some historical insight into the Apple dispute. It all goes back to an IEEE decision in 2015, one that’s not exactly “workable” for anyone, he writes: We believe the story dates back to February of 2015, when the IEEE issued a new patent policy whereby it explicitly spelled out that royalties may be charged based on the value of the smallest salable component of the overall product. Given that Qualcomm has been charging royalties based on the value of the smartphone, this opened up the company to a number of litigations claiming that Qualcomm should instead charge royalties based on the value of its chips among other things. We do not believe this structure is workable for either the chip makers or the industry as a whole but, nevertheless, the press around this IEEE recommendation has increased public pressure on Qualcomm and been included in multiple global trade disputes.

The iPhone maker has started charging customers in Australia, Spain, and Switzerland to access Apple Music for three months, Apple-tracking site AppleInsider is reporting. Apple's divisions in those countries are charging the equivalent of 99 cents in the local currency. Fortune separately confirmed the charges, which are listed on Apple's site. Since its release in 2015, Apple Music has provided customers a paid streaming-music option. Apple (aapl) has also offered a free, three-month trial for customers to try out the service before they buy. Upon gaining access to Apple Music, users can stream millions of songs from Apple's library and create playlists. Apple Music also has a recommendation engine that will recommend songs based on user taste. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter It's unclear why Apple is charging for access to its service and why some countries are affected and others are not. AppleInsider speculated that Apple pays royalties on all streams, including those played over free trials, and might be trying to defray some of those costs by charging customers. For its part, Apple hasn't commented on the change and whether other fees will be assessed on people trying out Apple Music in other countries. The company did not respond to a Fortune request for comment on the move. Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers © 2017 Time Inc.

Two of them, likely to be called iPhone 7S and 7S Plus, would retain the design of the current flagship devices. The 10th-anniversary model, iPhone 8, will sport an entirely new design. A fresh leak shows the molds of all three iPhones coming this year. With the iPhone 8 launch just a few months away, Apple is likely to have finalized its design. The device will sport a 5.8-inch curved OLED display. The leaked pictures of molds were posted on the Chinese micro-blogging site Weibo and first spotted by SlashLeaks. The three iPhones are placed side by side to show the key differences between them. Read more here. Image Credit: SlashLeaks / Weibo UPDATE: 05-05-2017: As Apple continues preparations for the next generation iPhone 8, one key individual within the corporation will play a particularly central role in its ultimate outcome. Jonny Ive has been the Chief Design Officer for some years, and has become woven into the fabric of the company since designing a laptop for Apple. Ive considered Steve jobs to be his closest friend, and will once again play a critical role in the design and manufacturing of the iPhone during 2017. Image Source: iDrop News Single sheet of glass The Wall Street Journal noted around 12 months ago that Ive had “expressed a desire for the iPhone to appear like a single sheet of glass”. With this in mind, concept design ideas for the iPhone 8 have reflected this comment, with most concepts suggesting that the screen will absolutely dominate the external visage of the 2017 iPhone. Thus, several credible sources are now suggesting that the iPhone 8 will feature a wraparound OLED display with bezels so slim that they are barely perceptible. In fact, this week it was suggested that the surrounding border of the iPhone 8 screen will be just 4mm, making it significantly sleeker than the rival Galaxy S8. Apple is certainly likely to take its design cue from the Samsung device, as smartphones with slimmed down bezels are becoming very much the zeitgeist. This will enable Apple to extend the screen real estate in the iPhone 8 generation, while also delivering an extremely compact smartphone. Indeed, over the years Apple’s emphasis has been very much on delivering ever slimmer and sleeker devices, and of all the design parameters associated with the iPhone recently, the idea of a wraparound display would seem to mesh most obviously with its ethos. And a new iPhone 8 concept video has confirmed this notion, delivering an eye-catching glimpse of how the immersive display may appear in the flagship handset. The concept in question indicates that Apple may produce an even more screen-dominated iPhone 8 than the existing Galaxy S8 when its next generation smartphone emerges. It certainly seems that an edge-to-edge display is one new iPhone 8 feature that is highly likely to dominate the new mobile. Qualcomm wrangle Elsewhere, there have been alarming reports for Apple this week, with suggestions that a significant legal issue could block the release of the iPhone 8. It has been reported that Apple is currently locked in a major dispute with Qualcomm, with the chip manufacturer supposedly seeking a ban on the forthcoming iPhone 8. This would not merely affect some niche market either; reports suggest that it would cover the entirety of the United States; a multi-billion marketplace for Apple. Bloomberg cites a source close to Qualcomm who suggests that the chipset manufacturer is seeking to acquire an important ban on all iPhones entering the United States, which would come via the International Trade Commission. Not only would this impact on the iPhone 8, but it would also potentially affect the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone SE and iPhone 6S. This is obviously an extremely serious issue, and could even mean that the iPhone 8 fails to appear on the shelves of retailers in September. It would also certainly end any collaboration or positive relationship between the two companies, which would certainly represent a gamble on the part of Qualcomm. While this may seem an extreme scenario, it wouldn’t be the first time that Apple has been involved in major sales bans. For example, between 2013 and 2015 Apple and Samsung found themselves engaged in a lengthy legal battle over infringed patents. At that time, Apple sought to have a number of Samsung handsets removed from the market in the United States, before the legal wrangle was eventually resolved. Nonetheless, it would be extremely surprising if this ultimately came to fruition, as not only would it delay the most important mobile product of the year, but it would be potentially damaging to the future of Qualcomm. It must also be said that winning a legal battle against Apple’s lawyers will be a major challenge, and we shouldn’t expect to see the iPhone 8 delayed as a result of this rumor. Deutsche Bank report Meanwhile, in a week in which the CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, denied that there is any arrangement between Apple and Tesla for the former to buy out the latter, a report from ValueWalk on the iPhone 8 became particularly big news. Forbes and Deutsche Bank both picked up on our article on the possibility that there will be no iPhone 8 release at all in 2018. While this would be an unpalatable prospect for Apple, the reality is that the consumer electronics giant is always careful about any device releases. There is no way that the Californian corporation will commit to releasing the iPhone 8 until it has been perfected, particularly as this tenth anniversary device is set to fulfil a special purpose for the company. It has generally been assumed that this landmark iPhone will come complete with a particularly outstanding set of features and specs, and this could pose some logistical difficulties for the Cupertino-based company. There is no doubt that Apple would love to release the device in its usual September window, but the main thing for Apple will be ensuring that the iPhone 8 delivers the sort of user experience that the company desires. Big changes Nonetheless, when the iPhone 8 arrives, whether that is in 2017 or next year, we can definitely expect an outstanding smartphone release. Aside from the major design changes being linked with this smartphone, Apple is also expected to implement a curved screen design for the first time, while dual-cameras will also deliver augmented reality functionality. Apple will also remove the physical Home button from the device, including a fingerprint scanner as well, and updating Touch ID and a Siri functionality. Many users have also called on the consumer electronics behemoth to improve the battery life of the iPhone, and it will be interesting to see how Apple responds to these requests. UPDATE: 04-21-2017: Apple is expected to stick to its usual release schedule for the iPhone 8, meaning that the smartphone will likely appear in September. There will be huge anticipation surrounding this device that marks the tenth anniversary of the iPhone range, and rumors surrounding the handset are beginning to intensify. And reports this week have suggested that Apple is already considering design parameters for the iPhone 8, with a leaked image purported to be of the next generation smartphone garnering attention. hurk / Pixabay iPhone 5 resemblance The photograph depicts a smartphone that somewhat resembles a slimmed down iPhone 5, with an extra hole notable beneath the Apple logo. Analysts have suggested that this hole can be considered the relocated Touch ID fingerprint scanner. Apple has been working on the technology required in order to embed this sensor for several years, and the iPhone 8 was expected to debut this innovation. However, it is also suggested that Apple is struggling to develop this technology to the point where it can be satisfactorily mass-produced for a major device such as the iPhone 8. In order to deal with this problem, Apple is supposedly considering the possibility of relocating the scanner to the back of the smartphone. But there having been tentative suggestions that the consumer electronics giant could even push the release date of the iPhone 8 back a few weeks, or even months. Release date delay This latter suggestion, though, seems rather unlikely, with Apple surely far more likely to make compromises to the design of the iPhone 8 than risk a later release date. It seems almost certain that the Californian corporation is experimenting with several designs at present, as preparations for the iPhone 8 continue. If it is remotely practical to implement one of these, rather than change the release schedule that has worked so well for the consumer electronics giant, then Apple will surely do so. Analyst murmurings Nonetheless, this hasn’t prevented some analysts from suggesting that the iPhone 8 will indeed be pushed backwards. In order to compensate for this difficulty, the consumer electronics giant is expected to release two iPhone 7S models, probably with the same screen size as the existing iPhone 7. Meanwhile, the release date of the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 will then be moved back several weeks. Apple analyst Brian White noted that “our contact strongly believes the 5.8in iPhone 8 will be delayed by several weeks due to challenges around the 3D sensing technology, but still in time for the December holidays.” White suggests that several supply problems are hampering the preparation for the iPhone 8, and Apple may be forced to delay delivery as a consequence. Green credentials In other iPhone 8 news, it seems that Apple is looking to enhance its already credible green credentials by producing particularly environmentally-friendly versions of future smartphone releases. In its annual environmental responsibility report, Apple indicated that it intends to mine materials from the earth in order to manufacture future gadgets. “Traditional supply chains are linear. Materials are mined, manufactured as products, and often end up in landfills after use. Then the process starts over and more materials are extracted from the earth for new products. We believe our goal should be a closed-loop supply chain, where products are built using only renewable resources or recycled material,” the report noted. Apple has gone to significant lengths to ensure that customers return used in products for recycling, while the company also melts down iPhone aluminum enclosures in order to manufacture minicomputers utilized in his factories. “For tin, we took a different approach,” the company stated. “Unlike aluminum, there is an existing market supply of recycled tin that meets our quality standards.” Thus, Apple has been able to use recycled tin for the manufacturing of the iPhone 6S. And the Cupertino-based company has indicated that its goal is “to one day end our reliance on mining altogether.” While Apple has been reluctant to disclose the precise percentage of recycled materials utilized in its products, there is no doubt that this is significant. Greenpeace praise And the company has been praised by environmental groups for its commitment to environmentally-friendly procedures. Greenpeace senior analyst Gary Cook is one such individual keen to acknowledge that a company sometimes criticized for its industrial practices has made significant efforts in this area. “Apple’s commitment to 100 percent recycled materials is ambitious, and highlights the need for greater urgency across the sector to reduce resource consumption and e-waste that are causing significant impacts on the environment and human health,” Cook asserted. Greenpeace believes that manufacturing new gadgets with reclaimed materials increases the tendency for devices to be recycled. Naturally this is to be encouraged, and Apple has done rather well with achieving a brand image that has positive connotations with green issues. Apple has also received plaudits from environmental campaigners for investing strongly in green energy for its operations. This is one area in which Apple has made specific claims, with the hardware manufacturer stating that 96% of the electricity utilized at its global facilities emanates from renewable sources. Furthermore, the new ‘spaceship’ main campus of Apple is now powered entirely by renewable energy. New updates Apple is also expected to include a wide variety of upgrades in the iPhone 8, with the most important being the introduction of OLED technology. Changing the form of display technology included in the iPhone 8 poses certain challenges for Apple, and could make the reports of release date delay more credible. There have already been reports which have suggested that Apple is struggling to locate satisfactory quantities of OLED displays, with Samsung, of course, already utilizing this technology in its Galaxy devices. Even though Apple seemingly intends to release only one model of the iPhone 8 generation with an OLED screen, it will still be logistically challenging for the company to acquire enough units. So it will be interesting to see how the iPhone 8 develops in the coming months, and what announcements Apple makes. UPDATE: 03-31-2017: With Samsung having unveiled the Galaxy S8, attention will now turn to Apple and the iPhone 8 later this year. This tenth anniversary device will have to answer to a Galaxy S8 release that has delivered arguably the most innovative package that Samsung has ever produced. Thus, it is not surprising that rumors about this critical hardware release are already multiplying rapidly. Ultrasonic sensor The Galaxy S8 is notable for its radical design, and a new patent suggests that Apple may also introduce innovative new features into the iPhone 8. The document indicates that Apple is considering replacing the Touch ID system with an ultrasonic sensor, which will deliver two main advantages over the existing system. cicwdn / Pixabay Apple firstly suggests that the new technology would be unaffected by contaminants such as greece, lotion, and sweat. This is naturally a massive problem; who hasn’t attempted to utilize their iPhone on a crowded beach having applied sunscreen and encountered difficulties? The second advantage, as the consumer electronics giant sees it, is that the new technology will no longer struggle with too much or too little pressure influencing the quality of fingerprinting garnered. There is no news on where this technology could be manufactured for the iPhone 8, but it is possible that Apple could recruit Qualcomm in order to deliver this. Ceramic design Other reports this week suggest that there will be a third iPhone 8 unit released by Apple later this year. This would be a landmark in the iPhone range, as the Californian corporation has never previously released three handsets simultaneously. And the latest leaks suggest that this third iPhone device could actually be ceramic, at least if a report authored by Fast Company is to be believed. This ceramic device would cost in excess of $1,000, with Fast Company describing it as “something like a smooth black monolith, with few visual interruptions to its sleek design”. There still seems to be some disagreement over whether or not all models in the iPhone 8 series will benefit from OLED technology, or whether it will merely be the premium version. But there is broad agreement that this third version of the iPhone 8 will indeed diverge from LCD. Japanese website Mac Otakara is one of the sources suggesting that the most premium and newest features in the iPhone 8 will only be applied to a new version. The East Asian source suggests that this smartphone will be branded as the iPhone 8 Edition, just as Apple released a premium Apple Watch Edition previously. However, this publication also explodes the idea that Apple will release three models simultaneously, instead suggesting that the iPhone edition could be released several months after the standard iPhone 8 handset. 3D sensing linked Elsewhere, rumors of 3D sensing features being included in the next generation of iPhone continue to accelerate. Taiwanese Himax Technologies has reportedly been recruited by Apple in order to form part of the supply chain for the iPhone 8, with the company responsible for providing glass for a module constructed by Lumentum. It is believed that Lumentum, a component supplier, will provide the 3D sensing models to be utilized in the iPhone 8, with the front camera then delivering both 3D sensing and 3D modelling capabilities. Facial recognition will be a natural fit for this technology, while augmented reality and virtual reality functions will also likely feature. Tim Cook has previously spoken of the potential of augmented reality for the iPhone range. According to Digitimes, the module being developed will use technology known as vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser-based DOE (diffractive optical elements). A bit of a mouthful, I’m sure you’d agree! Chip-on-glass construction will also be utilized, with Himax and ChipMOS also involved in the process. This latest report is rather timely, as it follows on the back of Morgan Stanley analyst Charlie Chan writing on the possibility of Himax being involved in the Apple supply chain for the iPhone 8. Other reports suggest that innovative technology developed by the company has the ability to reduce the size of 3D sensing components, making them more suitable for mobile products. Wraparound display Following on from the release of the Galaxy S8, it know seems extremely unlikely that the iPhone 8 will feature a similar wraparound display. Infamous Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has previously indicated his belief that the forthcoming Apple mobile will feature an edge-to-edge screen, enabling the Cupertino-based manufacturer to slim down the bezels included in the iPhone 8 significantly. Kuo also believes that Apple will be increasing the screen size of the iPhone 8 to approximately 5.8-inches, which would make perfect sense after Samsung showed off its latest 5.8-inch S8 release. If Apple does indeed release three models of the iPhone 8 in September, it is likely that the other two releases will retain the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays used in previous iPhone series. There is no word on branding as of yet, but these could also be named differently to the iPhone 8 module, possibly as the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. Wireless charging There is also good reason to believe that Apple will include wireless charging technology in the iPhone 8. One interesting morsel of information that has slid under the radar to some extent was the Californian corporation joining the Wireless Power Consortium just weeks ago. This organisation is responsible for overseeing standards involved with wireless charging technology, indicating that Apple may be about to produce devices that can be charged wirelessly for the first time. Meanwhile, although Apple is expected to embrace curved screen technology in the iPhone 8 generation, its approach may be slightly different to its Korean rival. JP Morgan analyst Rod Hall suggests that the screen in the tenth anniversary iPhone will be slightly less curved that the Galaxy S8, with Hall writing that “current indications are for less use of curved OLED which may result in a slightly less ‘infinity’ screen form factor.” UPDATE: 03-24-2017: We are well accustomed by now to seeing huge queues for new iPhone releases. And this may be even more prominent with the release of the iPhone 8, following news which has emerged this week. Paltry stock Three iPhone releases are expected in September, with the iPhone 8 been accompanied by two iPhone 7S models. But a new report suggests that the initial stock of the iPhone 8 will be so minimal that consumers can expect it to sell out almost immediately once preorders begin. It is noted that production for certain components to be utilized in the iPhone 8 can only commence in the third quarter, suggesting that Apple is likely to have enough stock to meet demand when the device launches. Image Source: iphone8plus.com This prediction is contained in a major new research note from the investment bank Barclays. It suggests that the majority of iPhone 8 stock may not be available until later in Q4. “Suppliers generally had good things to say about the upcoming iPhone 8 launch (for our purposes iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone Pro) as new features drive a more complicated manufacturing process and higher ASPs,” the report suggests. Barclays also provided some additional details regarding the next iPhone generation in its report. “We now believe that all three devices will feature wireless charging and will all be launched in the normal September timeframe, although the majority of iPhone Pro volumes may not be available until Q4”. This is consistent with previous rumors related to the iPhone 8, suggesting that this report can be considered particularly credible. Technology manufacturers producing a rather paltry number of units for release dates is certainly not unusual. Recently both the PlayStation 4 virtual reality unit and Nintendo Switch console sold out extremely rapidly, after Sony and Nintendo released a relatively conservative number of models for the release date. Aside from making economic sense, this approach also offers PR benefits, making it seem that demand for the devices is particularly high. While this is hardly likely to be a problem for the relentlessly successful iPhone, it hardly creates an enviable impression if technology companies have large amounts of unsold stock on their hands. Prototypes under testing Elsewhere this week, Macotakara, a Japanese tech website, revealed that Apple is currently testing several prototypes as part of the process of finalising the makeup of the iPhone 8. This suggests that the consumer electronics giant is yet to settle on a final design for the next generation smartphone. It also implies that the physical construction of the iPhone 8 will be taken extremely seriously, with Apple possibly considering a significant redesign of the iPhone concept. Macotakara suggests that some of the models being tested do not feature a physical Home button, while others are notable for differing chassis designs. Glass, ceramic and aluminum designs are all included in the prototypes being assessed, meaning that the all-glass predictions being made for the iPhone 8 may yet be premature. It is suggested by the Japanese website that Apple is currently validating tests of the iPhone 8 units, and it requires more time in order to procure materials needed to finalize its design decisions. “Multiple prototype models exist for this model and the development continues to be carried out in parallel with EVT,” Macotakara asserted. “The production level of development on various models are being done such as the models with IPS TFT, AMOLED, the model with or without home button, in addition to the models with a new glass, aluminum chassis, white ceramics etc”. 5-inch display linked Reports from Japan, though, also suggest that Apple has decided on a few features that will form part of the iPhone 8 armory, with a 5-inch display expected. This would mean that the iPhone 8 possesses a somewhat larger screen then previous iPhone releases, although the attendant iPhone 7S handsets may retain the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays that have been used before. It is also believed that the dual-camera technology so strongly linked with the iPhone 8 will indeed materialise, while the Japanese publication also echoes predictions on wireless charging capabilities of the smartphone. OLED update Meanwhile, Nikkei Asian Review, another publication with strong links to the Apple supply chain, suggests that two of the three models released later this year will feature the traditional liquid-crystal displays, while a third will benefit from a 5.8-inch organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen. This obviously contradicts the opinion of Macotakara, suggesting that the iPhone 8 will feature the largest display ever included in an Apple device. Possible delay It was also interestingly suggested by this source that Apple will announce the iPhone 8 – or iPhone Edition as the Nikkei Asian Review dubbed it – alongside the other two iPhone 7S devices, but that the release date of the iPhone 8 will actually be later in the year. This is an interesting proposition, and perhaps meshes accurately with previous reports regarding components. There have already been suggestions that the iPhone 8 will be a pricey smartphone when it is released, and Nikkei certainly agrees with this verdict. “By adding more large-screen options to the lineup to meet grousing demand for BIG, Apple intends to raise the average iPhone price, which has already gone up by about 10% in the past three years to nearly $700,” Nikkei reported. It had already been reported previously that the iPhone 8 could retail at over $1,000 when released, making it the most expensive handset that Apple has ever produced. It has also been reported this week that augmented reality features will be among the defining functionality of the iPhone 8. This tallies with previous comments from CEO Tim Cook, who has explicitly suggested that the technology has huge potential. “I think AR is extremely interesting and sort of a core technology. So, yes, it’s something we’re doing a lot of things on,” Cook stated some months ago. Apple may even release the iPhone 8 with a pair of eyeglasses especially designed to accompany augmented reality technology. It all adds up to an intriguing iPhone 8 release later this year. UPDATE: 03-17-2017: A new report from TrendForce has reiterated the idea that Apple will release three separate modules in its iPhone range in 2017. One of the devices will be branded the iPhone 8, with the other two possibly attracting the iPhone 7S moniker. Thus, we will likely see an iPhone 8 released alongside iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus devices. Sales positive TrendForce also suggested that iPhone sales will pick up significantly in 2017, and that the calendar year could be something of a landmark one for the Californian corporation. Apple hasn’t exactly struggled over the last 18 months, but its sales have slowed down slightly as the smartphone niche begins to recede somewhat. It has been suggested by numerous publications that we may already have reached ‘peak smartphone’, and the big players in this niche must now demonstrate that they can reinvigorate the public imagination. FunkyFocus / Pixabay But the opinion of TrendForce has been backed up by a major investment bank Morgan Stanley. Kate Huberty, an analyst at the corporation, suggests that demand for the iPhone 8 has been grossly underestimated, predicting an upsurge in sales of approximately 20 per cent for 2018. This would be a massive improvement for the Cupertino-based company, and one which would undoubtedly see the iPhone get back on track. “We do not think the super cycle is fully appreciated,” Huberty told CNBC PRO. “What we expect in September is a phone that has significant advancements in technology: OLED screens, 3-D sensors, wireless charging [and] likely some more advanced software in the area of artificial intelligence.” 100 million units In order to meet this demand, TrendForce suggests that Apple will produce 100 million iPhone 8 units; a massive figure even by the prolific standards of Apple. However, this initial production run will account for less than 50 per cent of total iPhone sales during the fiscal year, with the analyst expecting Apple to shift in the region of 230 million iPhones throughout the fiscal period. This would represent a 6 per cent increase on 2016, and would almost certainly have a positive impact on the Apple stock price. OLED expected TrendForce also suggests that Apple will indeed embrace OLED technology with the iPhone 8, something that has become almost a cliché in tech circles. Clearly preparations have been made for the move from LCD to OLED at Apple, and the analyst report suggests that Apple will indeed include OLED in the iPhone 8 generation. It is also suggested that the iPhone 8 display will be increased somewhat over previous releases, with a 5.8-inch screen linked with the device according to TrendForce. However, this screen will not result in a larger handset, as the slimming down of bezels and removal of the Home button on the iPhone 8 will allow a similar sized chassis to previous releases. TrendForce also suggests that the display of the iPhone 8 will be based on 2K resolution, with a display ratio that is likely to exceed 2:1. The panel will also feature a slight curve, although TrendForce believes that this will not be as pronounced as in some of the Samsung handsets. Samsung has practically made its reputation on curved screen displays in recent years, but analysts believe that Apple will not entirely follow suit with the iPhone 8, but will still go its own way while also introducing some form of curved technology for the first time. “The curve will be gentler than screens in Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge handsets. This is partly due to the challenges of making curved glass covers to match screens, according to the source,” Nikkei’s Debby Wu suggested. “While the curved screen will allow a viewable area of about 5.2 inches and make the iPhone even sleeker, it will not offer significant new functions”. $1,000 smartphone However, the inclusion of an OLED panel could have an impact on the price tag of the iPhone 8, as the technology costs significantly more than the LCD that the iPhone has been based on previously. Reports this week have suggested that the OLED panel will cost Apple significantly more than the display included in the iPhone 7, and that this expense will have to be passed on to the consumer. And with other components also expected to increase the price tag of the device, the consensus of opinion among analysts is that consumers can expect to pay in excess of $1,000 for this next generation Apple handset. Camera tech KGI Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo, probably the most renowned analyst anywhere within the mobile sphere, has also opened up on the camera technology that he believes will form part of the iPhone 8 armory. Central to this will be a revolutionary front camera setup, which will incorporate a 3D sensor intended to deliver several new features. The sensor will reportedly work in tandem with 2D images produced by the camera to create what are described as unique 3D selfies. What this precisely represents is not entirely clear, but there will obviously be a strong sharing aspect to this technology. Reports have previously suggested that Apple will particularly embrace augmented technology in the forthcoming Apple generation, but it seems to also have an eye on some unique 3D features. Facial recognition It is believed that the technology will also play a major role in the facial recognition features included in the iPhone 8, which will only strengthen the rumors that Apple will replace and / or supplement the TouchID functionality included in the iPhone series. Facial recognition could be used in order to unlock the smartphone, deliver remote payments and make purchases via Apple Pay. Apple already owns Israeli tech firm RealFace, meaning that the mega-corporation is well placed to deliver this technology in the iPhone 8 generation. Sensors utilized by the new camera will be able to perform depth of field calculations using a dedicated infrared transmitter and receiver, according to reports. Sony and Foxconn are both expected to get involved with this technology, and its inclusion could enable Apple to significantly update the dual-camera system included in the iPhone 7 Plus. UPDATE: 03-10-2017: There is some stark new news about the iPhone 8…it might not even exist! Recent reports suggest that the next generation smartphone from Apple, likely to launch in September, may not feature the iPhone 8 moniker that has been widely anticipated. iPhone Edition A new report from the highly regarded Japanese blog Mac Otakara suggests that Apple will instead brand the tenth generation of the iPhone as the iPhone Edition. This name would seemingly signify that the new smartphone is a top-of-the-range device, in accordance with the approach taken previously with the Apple Watch Edition. Image: Sheeraz Raza, ValueWalk The prestigious smartwatch cost in excess of $10,000, and while the Apple Watch Edition would obviously not be so highly priced, it has already been suggested that it could retail at a price point in excess of $1,000. Apple may also produce accompanying versions of the smartphone, which would then be branded differently. Aside from the branding of the iPhone 8, the report from Mac Otakara also claims that Apple is currently working on several different prototypes for the next generation flagship. It seems that the Californian consumer electronics giant has a wide range of possibilities available for the iPhone 8 generation, and is thus floating several different ideas ahead of finalizing its design parameters. Reports from Japan suggest that Apple is currently experimenting with numerous different display technologies and materials in an attempt to find the perfect setup for the iPhone 8 / Edition. Some of these prototype versions of the smartphone include an LCD display, while others benefit from the highly anticipated OLED panels. Home button’s days numbered Elsewhere, Apple is working on eliminating the physical Home button, something that has been predicted for many years. According to Japanese sources, smartphones are already being passed around the Apple headquarters that have the Home button removed, and instead such functionality is integrated within the display. If Apple does indeed remove the Home button, it is expected that the bezels of the device will be slimmed down significantly in order to make space for a wraparound display. Another aspect of the iPhone 8 that Apple is working on currently is the physical design of the unit. Further reports from Japan have suggested that the Cupertino-based corporation is currently experimenting with glass, aluminum and white ceramic chassis for the device. It has been widely assumed that Apple had settled on an all-glass design for the iPhone 8 generation, but this may yet turn out not to be the case. However, the Japanese publication does suggest that the consumer electronics market-leader has settled on a a few features for the final device. Interestingly, a 5-inch display size is being linked with the iPhone 8, suggesting that the screen in the smartphone versions will be larger than previous releases. But this 5-inch figure refers to the touchscreen properties of the smartphone, with the overall display size reckoned to be 5.15-inches. The remainder of the phone will be reserved for a row of virtual non-screen buttons, effectively revolutionizing the iPhone concept. Wireless charging linked Apple is also expected to include wireless charging in the iPhone for the first time when the iPhone 8 hits the stores, suggesting that the the technical difficulties that the company was experiencing have indeed been resolved. Reports had indicated that the ambitious wireless charging system that Apple had earmarked for the iPhone 8 was causing technical problems, but the latest reports suggest that they may have been solved and wireless charging will indeed feature. And Apple is also expected to include a dual-camera in every version of the iPhone this time round, if the latest reports from Japan are to be believed. Camera technology is becoming increasingly important in the smartphone niche, and Apple has made significant efforts to improve this aspect of its flagship in recent releases. Ming-Chi Kuo also suggests that the overall footprint of the smartphone will be similar to that of the iPhone 6, iPhone 6S and iPhone 7, meaning that a significant redesign of the iPhone 8 will be a necessity. Chief Design Officer Jony Ive is reportedly designing the iPhone 8 with the intention of ensuring that it resembles a single sheet of glass. Meanwhile, a research note published by the investment bank UBS has noted that over 1,000 engineers are currently working on augmented reality technology for the iPhone 8. It seems that Apple is less committed to supporting virtual reality at this time, but this could be another niche that the mega-corporation explores in the foreseeable future. But Tim Cook has expressed support for augmented reality, speaking extensively about the potential that this technology has in the iPhone range. Touch ID Kuo has also been speaking on the subject of the Touch ID fingerprint sensor in the next generation iPhone. This device is usually located within the physical Home button, but is said to be shifted beneath the glass display in the iPhone 8. Kuo suggests that the system which Apple has relied on for fingerprint recognition is not compatible with the revolutionary all-glass design mooted. Instead, Apple will instigate a new fingerprint system with optical sensors, Kuo believes. This will require several new custom solutions to be produced by the panel manufacturers for the iPhone 8. But the KGI securities researcher believes that Apple has enough power and contacts within the industry to ensure that the system is in place before the release of the iPhone 8. Kuo also suggests that facial tracking sensors will be included within the flagship smartphone, in an attempt to beef up the verification of identity. Kuo floats the idea that the fingerprint recognition system will “ultimately be replaced by a facial recognition system” in an attempt to ensure that the iPhone 8 is even more secure than previous releases. “However, if the technical challenges cannot be overcome, we believe a combination of fingerprint and facial recognition is another possible solution,” Kuo suggests. Clearly Apple is making serious progress on the iPhone 8, and the eventual makeup of this device is coming sharply into focus. UPDATE: 03-07-2017: It has long since been suggested that OLED technology will feature in the iPhone 8, and a new report suggests that those looking forward to this possibility will not be disappointed. Korean publication The Bell believes that OLED will indeed debut before the year is out, but also made some interesting predictions about the future of the iPhone range. OLED to dominate iPhone The Bell states that by 2019 all iPhone releases will benefit from OLED displays, with Apple looking to completely alter the way that its display technology works. It still seems likely that only one of the iPhone models released in 2017 will feature OLED, with many asserting that there will be three devices in the iPhone 8 generation. This would obviously be a departure from previous releases, but Apple is looking to cover all bases with future devices. This has become a major focus of the consumer electronics giant, with the Apple Watch introducing this ethos into what is increasingly fragmented and complex marketplace. Reporting on Apple’s switch away from LCD, The Bell states that Apple supplier Interflex is currently working on building a nw flexible printed circuit boards facility that will ultimately be tasked with the manufacturing process. It is believed that Apple intends to ship 60 million OLED iPhone 8 handsets in 2017, which represents approximately 40 per cent of overall sales. Furthermore, Apple will double the figure in the following generation, ensuring that OLED becomes the predominant screen technology in the calendar year, working towards a total adoption of OLED in 2019. It is also suggested that the iPhone 8 will be the most expensive handset in the history of the device. This is due to the new technology that Apple will incorporate into the next generation mobile. A wraparound display, numerous premium components and several new features have been linked with the Apple flagship, although it is also believed that the Californian corporation could produce more affordable alternatives to the mainstream smartphone as well. JP Morgan bullish While Apple has endured a challenging period in its history, it seems that the Cupertino-based company may experience an upturn when the iPhone 8 is released. Mammoth investment bank JP Morgan has assessed the potential of the next generation handset and concluded that most investors are bullish on its prospects. “We agree that street expectations of ~100M units of new iPhone builds in 2H17 are now hard to exceed, but upside is likely to come from OLED iPhone mix and much higher ASPs. We have been advising investors to position into explicit OLED iPhone plays like Hon Hai, Samsung SDI or content gainers like WinSemi, LG Innotek and Lens Tech,” JP Morgan stated. Patent mooted Meanwhile, Apple has been awarded a patient which suggests that facial detection software will be a primary feature of the iPhone 8. Published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the document outlines algorithms that have the ability to identify the presence of faces in a live video. This new system is not yet capable of bio-recognition, but it is an important step towards such authentication. UPDATE: 03-02-2017: A note from Apple to major investors suggests that the company will focus a significant amount of attention on the augmented reality capabilities of the iPhone 8. Business Insider reports that over 1,000 Israeli employees are already working on augmented reality for the company, with the Californian corporation apparently of the belief that augmented reality will play a huge part in its future. Image Source: Apple Inc. / USPTO (screenshot) UBS report Business Insider quoted the vast investment bank UBS, and a report which suggests that Apple will indeed integrate augmented reality into the iPhone 8 later this year. There are minimal details regarding exactly what this will constitute, but some form of moderate 3D mapping and augmented reality software development kits have been suggested. Legendary Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI securities has suggested that the level of research that Apple is investing in augmented reality will ensure that it is three to five years ahead of other companies focusing on VR. Apple has also made a raft of acquisitions related to the technology, including PrimeSense and Metaio, along with the recent purchase of RealFace. Researcher Steven Milunovich, a managing director at UBS, notes that “Apple appears more interested in AR rather than virtual reality (VR), because the former connects people whereas the latter is often an isolating experience involving a headset that renders the user blind to the real world. AR, by contrast, takes the existing environment and adds a new layer of information to it. For instance, AR apps let you hold up a phone with images superimposed onto the real-world view seen through the camera screen.” Kuo weighs in In accordance with this augmented reality focus, Apple is also expected to improve the photographic capabilities of the camera in the iPhone 8, including 3D hardware. This will enable the iPhone 8 to produce live 3D characters of users in order for gaming avatars to be created from them. USB-3 linked Meanwhile, other rumors this week suggest that Apple will remove the familiar Lightning connector from future models of the iPhone series, probably beginning with the iPhone 8. Reports from the UK indicate that the Cupertino-based company is tinkering with the idea of including USB-3 in the iPhone 8. This may not be an entirely popular move with Apple consumers, as it would seem certain to alienate those who already own headphones compatible with the Lightning jack. However, a big plus point would be the universality of the USB-3 technology, meaning that users would no longer have to rely on proprietary Apple hardware. Home button and OLED More credible reports this week have also suggested that the Home button will be removed from the iPhone 8, and the bezels slimmed down significantly. DisplayMate Technologies president Raymond Soneira indicated his belief that the display of the iPhone 8 will take up the entire screen, with virtual buttons included as well. Soneira expects Apple to embrace the OLED technology that has been strongly linked with the iPhone 8, also producing the first ever curved display iPhone this year. UPDATE: 02-15-2017: Apple’s biggest selling product of all time is rarely out of the headlines, as is the yet to be confirmed iPhone 8. Long before the current crop of handsets was released by the Cupertino-based outfit, 2017’s addition was an established part of the rumor mill. However, the company as always remains tight-lipped and speculation is all we have. So let’s take a look at what Ming-Chi Kuo and others are suggesting right now! iPhone 8 Screen Size The DigiTimes is reporting that the 10th anniversary model of iPhone could come with a 5.8-inch display. Which does fit with reports we’ve seen previously. However, it’s also rumored that 4.7 and 5.5-inch models could be released. If accurate, the smaller two are likely to be a 7s and a 7s Plus not additional iPhone 8 models. OLED Technology One persistent rumor that continues to be talked about is Apple’s move away from tried and tested LCD technology. Apparently, this year will see an iPhone for the first time use OLED panels. A move which has been asked of Apple for a long time. Coming via the much respected Ming-Chi Kuo, he suggests Apple has been in talks with Samsung a supplier of OLED’s for some time. Leading to the South Korean firm receiving an order for more than 60-million of the display units. Improved Battery Recently MacRumors got to see a leaked report which suggests the iPhone 8’s battery will be an improvement over previous. However, it is apparent that no major improvements are expected in the technology. Instead, efficiencies will be gained by using a stacked logic board, also known as a “substrate-like PCB mainboard.” It’s thought that with the inclusion of an edge-to-edge display and the above, these will provide room for a larger battery. On this matter, Ming-Chi Kuo told MacRumors: “As battery material tech isn’t likely to see significant breakthroughs in the next 3-5 years. The mainboard area must be reduced via stacked SLP, which makes space for larger battery and extended usage time. Thanks to stacked SLP, we expect the OLED iPhone 8 to have similar dimensions to a 4.7” iPhone. Additionally, it will have comparable battery capacity (equipped with around 2,700 mAh L-shaped 2-cell battery pack) to a 5.5” TFT-LCD iPhone. The battery life of the OLED iPhone could be better than that of the 5.5” TFT-LCD model as OLED panels are more energy-efficient than their TFT-LCD counterparts.” Cost $1000 Rumors of a reinforced glass chassis and a stainless steel metal frame have been circling for some time. However, if true, they’re likely to be supplied by Foxconn and US-based Jabil Circuit. While Catcher Technology will provide the aluminum-alloy chassis, with these in place The DigiTimes claims the handset could cost $1000 or more! No Dual Camera Another report that has its origins from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggests the 7 Plus’s dual-snapper won’t appear on the 8. It looks as though the cost of incorporating such technology into a smartphone means it will bypass a standard 8. Instead, it could be found on a later iPhone 8 Plus model. However, another analyst has said the iPhone 8 would have a single sensor. While there will be two models of the iPhone 8 Plus, both with dual-lens cameras. RAM and Chipset Due to the overwhelming success of the A10 Fusion chip, many rumors suggest Apple has its partners working on a second. Possibly called the A11 Fusion it is expected to be almost perfectly efficient and use a Quad-Core CPU. Now, depending on screen size, it’s thought that a minimum of 3GB will be used and a maximum of 4GB. Right now the iPhone 7 Plus uses 3GB, so some improvement is to be expected. Final Thoughts There’s this theory going around that Apple has played it safe for the past few years offering minor improvements. One area in which this theory is accurate is in design, however, could 2017 be the year that changes? We expect Apple will make the iPhone 8 or a variation of it, their most advanced handset ever! In fact, it’s hard to believe they could be so arrogant as to think consumers will stick around without innovation. Surely looking to the past, and lessons learned too late by the likes of Nokia and BlackBerry are enough to spur it on. UPDATE: 02-10-2017 The latest news on the iPhone 8 suggests that the next generation Apple iPhone may be the most expensive mobile the corporation has ever released. While rumors about the extensive hardware and software updates included in the handset have undoubtedly got tongues wagging, it seems that these improvements will come at a premium. A source close to the company’s East Asian supply chain divulged to Fast Company that the iPhone 8 could be the first smartphone from Apple to break through the $1,000 price tag. The most expensive model of the current iPhone generation retails for around $969 currently, and that is even for the premium 256GB version. Image Credit: Energous Corporation / YouTube video (screenshot) There is no news on which model of the iPhone will retail for this jaw-dropping $1,000 figure, but it is believed that the inclusion of an OLED display for the first time will have a serious impact on production costs. The aforementioned source indicates that Apple is currently working hard to acquire as many OLED displays as possible, but the limited number of manufacturers available means that availability is relatively scarce. What the high price tag mooted does suggest is that the next generation iPhone 8 will indeed be a truly premium mobile. Wireless charging coming Elsewhere, the ongoing saga of whether or not Apple will include wireless charging in the iPhone 8 seems to have taken another turn in the last couple of days. Renowned KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggests that Apple will include this transformative technology in its next phone, after some analysts previously indicated that Apple may turn its back on wireless charging due to technical difficulties. A new report by Mac Rumors authored by Kuo suggests that Apple will finally introduce wireless charging in the next iPhone generation. Some additional details related to this are also interesting to note, with Kuo indicating that wireless charging technology has a tendency to increase the internal temperature of mobile phones. This means that Apple must include OLED and glass casing in order to include a new 3D Touch module with what Kuo describes as “additional graphite sheet lamination” in order to prevent the device from overheating. “While we don’t expect general users to notice any difference, lamination of an additional graphite sheet is needed for better thermal control and, thus, steady operation; this is because FPCB is replaced with film, which is more sensitive to temperature change of the 3D touch sensor in OLED iPhone,” Kuo stated in the research note. New features mooted In other iPhone 8 news, several other new features have been suggested for the next generation smartphone. It is believed that Apple will offer several new color options to consumers of this smartphone, with a vibrant red color being linked with the smartphone in some quarters. It also looks increasingly likely that Apple will include an iris scanner with the iPhone 8, considering that security is ever more important in the mobile niche. Finally, the demise of the Home button seems to be imminent, with numerous publications now announcing this as being decided at Apple internally, even if the Californian corporation has yet to confirm this publicly. UPDATE: 02-08-2017 With reports having recently emerged that Apple is to ramp up production of the iPhone 8 to meet what it anticipates to be high demand, analysts are already suggesting that Apple needs a spectacular smartphone release in 2017 to get the company’s financial performance back on track. The Verge executive editor Walt Mossberg told CNBC that Apple fans are anticipating something special and spectacular for the tenth anniversary of the iPhone range later this year. Mossberg asserted that it is absolutely essential for Apple to deliver on expectations for the iPhone 8, otherwise the share price of the Californian corporation could slide still further. Concept image emerges An intriguing glimpse into the possible future of the iPhone series also emerged this week, with an attractive concept image of the iPhone 8 being released. Graphic designer Moe Slah is responsible for what most agree is a sleek and impressive representation of what the iPhone 8 may look like. Slah envisages a design for the iPhone 8 in which the bezels included in the device are slimmed down to virtually zero. Slah also believes that the Touch ID scanner will be embedded within the display, a possibility that has been widely reported on by the media, including ValueWalk. Home button’s days are numbered While concept images quite frequently differ significantly from the final finished product, this latest attempt to guesstimate the future does suggest that Apple will indeed remove the physical Home button from the iPhone 8. We can expect the 2017 iteration of the iPhone to be a significant redesign of the Apple smartphone concept, and central to this will be slimming down the unit and ensuring that it is more compact. Removing the Home button will make this process far easier, and it does seem to be something of a racing certainty for the iPhone 8 at present. It also looks increasingly likely that there will be three models of the iPhone 8 released in 2017, although the branding of these devices remains open to speculation. Many believe that a new premium version of the smartphone will be dubbed the iPhone X, while others believe that iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 8 Pro are likely monikers. OLED negotiations Reports have been circulating this week that Apple continues to negotiate behind the scenes in order to ensure that OLED technology is involved in the iPhone 8 generation. Samsung will supply this screen technology for the iPhone 8, but this will naturally require some communication between the two mega-corporations and rivals. Finally, Apple CEO Tim Cook has also waxed lyrical about the potential for Siri to automate devices within the home, suggesting that the iPhone 8 will be significantly focused on such smart home functionality. This could be a major growth area for Apple in the foreseeable future, with artificial intelligence, personal assistants and smart home technology all embryonic niches that Apple intends to dabble in. Samsung has already announced its Bixby rival for Siri, which will debut in the Galaxy S8. UPDATE: 02-07-2017 In a busy week of iPhone 8 news, the head honcho of Apple has given his take on the smartphone. Tim Cook suggested that “the smartphone is still in the early innings of the game,” perhaps hinting at some major technological changes coming in the next generation iPhone. Of course, it is far too early for the CEO of the consumer electronics giant to provide any explicit information, but the notion that Apple will produce a revolutionary iPhone 8 is very much in line with the expectations of analysts. With considerable hype already building up for the release of the iPhone 8, it seems that some of this buzz may translate into improved sales. Apple has perhaps struggled to retain the exaulted market position it has enjoyed historically over the last year or so, but BlueFin Research Partners analysts John Donovan and Steve Mullane expect this to change when the iPhone 8 hits the stores. A research note released by the company outlines that the Cupertino-based corporation has already begin to reduce production of the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone SE as it prepares for the iPhone 8 launch. And BlueFin believes that this will result in an extremely successful iPhone 8 device. Earlier production schedule Citing supply chain sources, the analysts firmly suggested that production of the iPhone 8 will begin earlier than usual, with Apple expected to ramp up production of the device in the June quarter. However, this may not result in an earlier release than usual, but may instead be indicative of Apple planning to increase its inventory ahead of massive consumer demand. And this will be a wise move if Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi Jr. is to be believed. The analyst suggested that the installed base of iPhone users for the iPhone 8 will be so massive that it will ensure huge popularity for the iPhone range for years to come. “Our analysis indicates that iPhone’s installed base will be nearly ~80% larger entering the iPhone 8 cycle than it was entering the strong iPhone 6 cycle,” Sacconaghi Jr. suggests. While Apple sales have slipped over the last couple of years, with 212 million iPhone sales in 2016 representing an 8% decline, its installed user bases improved. This bodes well for the future of the iPhone handset in a competitive mobile marketplace. Numerous sources have also suggested this week that Apple is ready to drop the iPhone 8 moniker and instead call its next generation smartphone the iPhone X. This is a possibility that ValueWalk has reported on previously, so this is not entirely new speculation, but it is a suggestion that is gaining momentum. Alongside the premium iPhone X could be iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus releases, providing spec upgrades over existing models. Finally, an interesting concept image of the iPhone 8 emerged this week, featuring an entirely transparent display. While this is never likely to actually appear in the iPhone 8, it nonetheless gives an interesting impression of some of the physical tricks that Apple could consider for the next generation handset. The iPhone 8 will undoubtedly be the most important smartphone release of 2017, as indeed the iPhone series is in any calendar year. But the iPhone 8 will be particularly significant for Apple for two reasons. Firstly, there is evidence that its core smartphone business has receded slightly in the last year or so. And, secondly, the iPhone 8 will mark the tenth anniversary of the iPhone range; something that Apple is likely to mark with an outstanding release. Image source: Apple designer – YouTube Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha has already made bullish predictions regarding Apple in the next couple of years, suggesting that the corporation will indeed achieve the $150 share target that he set for the Californian company some time ago. Garcha also suggested that iPhone sales will be healthy in the next couple of years, with 215 million units sold predicted for this year, and a whopping 250 million units expected by the analyst in 2018. iPhone 8 release date In previous years, Apple has fluctuated between releasing a new generation of the iPhone smartphone and an S range update. The latter is usually a more incremental upgrade of the mainstream smartphone, but the smart money is on Apple veering away from this with the iPhone 8, possibly indefinitely. Nonetheless, despite the fact that this tenth anniversary device is massive for Apple, also being the first release in the incredible new headquarters of the corporation, the likelihood is that Apple will stick to the release schedule of previous devices. This would mean that we should expect the iPhone 8 to surface at some point in September. Design More and more individuals in the Apple-following community are suggesting that Apple will significantly redesign the iPhone 8 ahead of its release. And one of the increasingly common suggestions about this process is that it will involve a prominently glass-based design. Prominent tech blogger Robert Scoble has suggested precisely this, indicating that the next generation smartphone will effectively be a huge shard of clear glass. Scoble also predicts that the battery and antennas in the device will be hidden around the edges of the screen, marking another major design change after the elimination of the headphone jack in the iPhone 7. Meanwhile, the ever reliable Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities suggests that Apple will upgrade the scratch-proof qualities of the iPhone 8, with the device featuring a more durable glass front and rear; a suggestion which fits in with the opinion of Scoble. Colors Many rumors are already circulating suggesting that Apple will offer new color choices when the iPhone 8 is released. Two radical possibilities have been particularly touched on by the media, with dark blue and red both being floated as mooted colour choices. Digital crown Another suggestion which has emerged in the last few weeks is the idea that Apple will include a digital crown, akin to the one included with the Apple Watch, when the iPhone 8 is released. While this may seem an unlikely prospect, a patent describing precisely this technology has recently emerged. The patent in question suggested that a rotating control in Apple devices could be utilized in order to adjust volume, resize text and access other functions. The patent cites an iPad as an example, but it could equally easily be applied to the iPhone 8 as well. TouchID built into screen Apple may also dispense with the Home button when the iPhone 8 is released, and instead build TouchID into the display of the smartphone. This has been suggested for quite some time, but Apple has clearly been investigating these prospects internally. Again, Apple has been granted a patent for this possibility, with the document in question referring to a touch-sensitive fingerprint sensor which intriguingly has the ability to work through a physical display. Patent 9,460,332 describes a “capacitive fingerprint sensor including an electrostatic lens”, and the text goes to describe that “one or more other device components, such as a display stack and/or a touchscreen may be interposed between the contact surface of dielectric structure 202 and array 206 of capacitive sensing elements”. The Korea Herald has already reported on this technology, citing sources close to the Apple supply chain, and it does seem that the Cupertino-based company could be ready to introduce this new TouchID system in the 2017 iPhone 8. Changes to the Home button could also be made, with Apple having been linked with a revolutionary joystick system to attract gamers. Curved wraparound display The aforementioned Kuo also believes that the iPhone 8 will feature a curved display for the first time. This would not be hugely surprising, with Apple taking its cue from the successful example set by Samsung. Kuo suggests that Apple will also switch to OLED technology for the first time. Interestingly, though, the KGI analyst also believes that the forthcoming iPhone 8 will feature a 5.8-inch display. This would be a significant increase in size over existing iPhone units, and would undoubtedly garner attention and excitement. Apple patent 9,146,590 has already made reference to an “electronic device with wraparound display”, and it is clear that Apple is ready to unveil this technology. Specs Aside from the more radical alterations that Apple will enact with the iPhone 8, specs in the smartphone are also likely to benefit from significant upgrades. This could mean that a quad HD screen is fitted in the iPhone 8 Plus for the first time, with the smartphone models shifting up to full HD. Analysts also suggest that that will be a dual-camera in all models of the iPhone 8, while we may see the iPhone range embrace octa-core processing for the first time. Apple will also boost the RAM of the device up to 3GB, although storage is likely to remain flat at a maximum of 256GB. Finally, Apple is beavering away behind the scenes to ensure that a larger battery can be included in the iPhone 8; addressing a bugbear of the series for several years.

Our latest Sensi thermostats combine enhanced capabilities, including support for Apple HomeKit with simple and secure controls, and a sleek new interface with a proven home comfort experience that puts users firmly in control of their environment, anytime and from anywhere.” The new Sensi Touch Wi-Fi Thermostat with color display and Sensi Wi-Fi Thermostat both offer a new geofencing proximity detection feature and flexible scheduling options to achieve energy savings. Both thermostats use smart alerts to notify customers of extreme temperatures and humidity levels. The Sensi mobile app has also received extensive updates, including a dashboard with individual thermostat cards. This enhanced display provides multiple thermostat users an easy overview into their whole-home comfort settings. In addition to the Apple HomeKit integration, both Sensi thermostats are compatible with smart home platforms Amazon Alexa and Wink. Highlights: ● The Sensi Touch Wi-Fi Thermostat has a high-definition, color touchscreen and a clean design to fit the modern home. The Sensi Touch Wi-Fi Thermostat also has illuminated terminals for increased visibility while wiring and easy-click terminals that eliminate the need for a screwdriver. ● Additional menu options enable users to customize the information on the home screen display and to choose a continuous back glow for soft lighting in dark hallways or rooms. ● The updated Sensi Wi-Fi Thermostat doesn’t require a common wire (c-wire) for most installations. Apple HomeKit users will require the c-wire for Siri voice control. The new Sensi thermostats will be available in early summer and can be purchased from the link below for $199.99.

In March, an Australian woman traveling from Beijing to Melbourne on a long-haul flight had the wireless headphones she was wearing explode while she slept. Before managing to remove them, the headphones caused burns to both her face and neck. It also meant the rest of the flight was spent with the smell of burning hair, plastic, and electronics in the cabin. At the time, we didn't know the brand of the headphones she was wearing, but now we do. They were Beats, and the woman is asking for compensation for the incident from Apple. The problem is, Apple is refusing, and the company has a very good reason for doing so. Buy a pair of wireless headphones today and they'll likely use a rechargeable battery for power. But older headphones, including the pair of Beats this woman was wearing, use a pair of AAA batteries instead. According to Apple, the reason the headphones exploded was due to a faulty third-party battery and therefore is not in any way Apple's fault. Related Beats Solo3 Wireless Beats Solo3 Wireless According to Digital Trends, the woman (and her legal team) is arguing that nowhere on the headphones or packaging does it state which brands of battery are allowed. That may be the case, but why is the compensation claim being aimed at Apple and not the maker of the battery that caused the explosion and subsequent injuries? It seems unlikely Apple will end up having to pay out compensation to the woman. Maybe a guiding hand towards the battery manufacturer and a free pair of new wireless Beats could help make this go away quickly? More likely Apple will just keep saying no until her lawyers give up or a court decides for them.

Rare Apple 1 computer fetches less than £100,000 at auction Five years after the death of Steve Jobs, hype around retro Apple tech appears to be dying down  Share  Comments BySophie Curtis 17:23, 22 MAY 2017 Technology Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to playTap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now  Share  Comments Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A rare Apple-1 computer that is in full working order 41 years after Steve Jobs built it in his garage has sold for substantially less than expected. The machine fetched €110,000 (£95,000) at auction in Germany on Saturday - well below the expected price range of €180,000 to €300,000. Auction house Team Breker, which oversaw the auction, sold another Apple-1 computer in 2013 for €516,000. Uwe Breker, who specialises in the sale of technical antiques, said the disappointing figure suggested the spike in prices after Jobs' 2011 death is now over. (Photo: AuctionTeamBreker/BNPS) "From our point of view we are back at normal levels," he told AFP. "Five years after the death of (Apple co-founder) Steve Jobs the 'hype' has settled back." The collector's item machine was one of 200 the late Apple founder and his associate Steve Wozniak designed, created and sold in 1976. Read More The first computer ever built by tech giant Apple expected to fetch huge sum at auction The groundbreaking computer that gave birth to the Apple empire was the first ready-made PC to ever come on the market, selling for $666 at the time. It came with a tiny 8K memory - around 600,000 times less than is standard with today's Apple computers. It would not even have had the capacity to store one song. (Photo: Getty Images) There are believed to be about 60 Apple-1 computers that survive today, with eight still in working order. This particular machine, No. 01-0073, belonged to a software engineer from Berkeley in California's Silicon Valley, who has had it ever since he bought it new. Read More Apple co-founder makes dramatic predictions about the future of technology It came with a rare white ceramic 6502 microprocessor and a complete set of time-correct chips and historical documents, including receipt of purchase from November 1976 and the earliest provisional manual. It even had contemporary notes of telephone conversations between the owner and Wozniak from 1977. (Photo: AuctionTeamBreker/BNPS) Of the 200 units made by Jobs and Wozniak, 50 of them were sold to a local shop called Byte. The shop marketed it with the slogan "Byte into an Apple" which gave Jobs the idea for the iconic logo we know so well today. "The Apple-1 really is the symbol for the American dream. Two students had an idea, built and marketed it, and 40 years later it is the highest valued company ever," said Breker.

Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak (Photo: Reuters) "As with all Apple products the Apple-1 wasn't around long before a better model was launched, but a legend had begun. The rest is history." Breker added that you couldn't actually do very much with the Apple-1. "You had to load your program each time on a cassette and it only had eight kilobytes of memory - enough for only the most basic of word processing," he said Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @MirrorTech Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Apple Silicon Valley PLC Steve Wozniak Steve Jobs Computers Technology all Most Read Most Recent Manchester Arena explosionFacebook activates Safety Check in Manchester after suspected terror attack at Ariana Grande gig Users of the social network can use the tool to let their friends know they are safe iPhone 8iPhone 8: Release date, price, rumours and news about Apple's 2017 iPhone Apple's iPhone 8 - which could be called the iPhone Edition or iPhone X to mark its tenth anniversary - is expected to be the company's biggest smartphone launch in years Worldwide Developers ConferenceWWDC 2017: Siri speaker to be unveiled alongside iOS 11 and macOS 10.13 at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference Apple will announce3 its latest software developments at its annual developer event in June SonySony Xperia XZ Premium: Release date, price and specs of Sony's new flagship smartphone Sony's latest device has a 4K HDR display an advanced camera technology capable of recording an incredible 960fps CopyrightPirate Bay's biggest rival shut down permanently as illegal content sharing crackdown continues ExtraTorrent has announced it is closing for good - leaving content pirates with one less place to hide Manchester Arena explosionFacebook activates Safety Check in Manchester after suspected terror attack at Ariana Grande gig Users of the social network can use the tool to let their friends know they are safe Worldwide Developers ConferenceWWDC 2017: Siri speaker to be unveiled alongside iOS 11 and macOS 10.13 at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference Apple will announce3 its latest software developments at its annual developer event in June TeethWorld's first 'clear coffee' provides your daily caffeine fix without staining your teeth Each bottle contains 100mg of caffeine, which is roughly an equivalent of double espresso Summer SolsticeWhen is Summer Solstice 2017?

Apple is shoring up Siri for its next generation of intelligent devices Posted May 16, 2017 by John Mannes (@JohnMannes) 0 SHARES Next Story Apple could release MacBook updates soon Advertisement Apple once led the pack with its intelligent assistant Siri, but in just a few years, Amazon, Microsoft and Google have chipped away at its lead. Siri is a critical component of Apple’s vision for the future, so integral that it was willing to spend $200 million to acquire Lattice Data over the weekend. The startup was working to transform the way businesses deal with paragraphs of text and other information that lives outside neatly structured databases. These engineers are uniquely prepared to assist Apple with building a next-generation internal knowledge graph to power Siri and its next generation of intelligent products and services. Broadly speaking, the Lattice Data deal was an acquihire. Apple paid roughly $10 million for each of Lattice’s 20 engineers. This is generally considered to be fair market value. Google paid about $500 million for DeepMind back in 2014. At that time, the startup had roughly 75 employees, of which a portion were machine learning developers. Give or take a few million, the math pretty much works out. But beneath the surface, the deal signals that Apple is willing to spend significant capital shoring up the backbone of Siri. Apple and its peers grapple with the challenge of teaching conversational assistants basic knowledge about the world. Apple relies on a number of partnerships, including a major one with Yahoo, to provide Siri with the facts it needs to answer questions. It competes with Google, a company that possesses what is largely considered to be the crème de la crème of knowledge graphs. Apple surely has an interest in improving the size and quality of its knowledge graph while unshackling itself from partners. Lattice’s experienced engineers are particularly important to Apple as it designs future products for an AI-first world. Companies like Microsoft, Facebook and Google have already declared their intentions to build up infrastructure to support the implementation of machine learning in as many products and services as possible. Apple brought on Rus Salakhutdinov in October 2017 to lead research efforts at the company, and it has acquired startups like Turi and RealFace, but it still has a lot of work to do if it intends to remain competitive in AI in the long run. “Google is applying machine and deep-learning to about 2,500 different use cases internally now. Apple should be doing the same,” asserted Chris Nicholson, CEO of Skymind, the creators of the DL4J deep learning library. Latest Crunch Report Ford Gets A New CEO | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes At Apple, the Lattice Data team could start by helping Apple get its knowledge graph up to speed. This infrastructure is integral to Apple’s plan to embed Siri into each of its products. It’s an ideal place to start because it both improves existing offerings like Siri search on Apple TV and lays the groundwork for future products like its rumored Amazon Echo competitor. Siri for Apple TV allows for complex multi-part natural language searches. A knowledge graph is a representation of known information about the world. Information within a knowledge graph can either come from structured data from a database or unstructured data scraped from a document or the internet. When you use Siri to search iTunes, the results have to come from somewhere. A knowledge graph makes it possible to draw complex relationships between entries. Today, Siri on Apple TV allows for complex natural language search like “Find TV shows for kids” followed up by “Only comedies.” A surprising amount of information is required to return that request and some of it might be buried in the summaries of the shows or scattered on the internet. “Machine learning algorithms produce better results the more data you expose them to,” explained Nicholson. “So if you can find a way to extract value from unstructured data, you’re tapping the largest data set in the world, and the expectation would be that it produce the best results.” Crunchbase Steve Jobs Bio Steve Jobs was the co-founder and CEO of [Apple](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/apple) and formerly [Pixar](/company/pixar).

The problem with extracting data from unstructured sources is that it’s difficult to verify the accuracy of the information being pulled. Dr. Dan Klein, chief scientist at Semantic Machines, a startup building its own conversational AI, explained to me that companies typically run shallow natural language models to pull dates and facts from text sources. Initially this process is probabilistic, meaning that what text is labeled as important data is a matter of confidence and likelihoods, but once that data is extracted, it’s effectively treated as a certainty. “You can do a better job of extracting unstructured data if you track confidence all the way through,” added Klein. This is the idea behind Stanford professor Christopher Ré‘s work on DeepDive that was ultimately commercialized as Lattice Data. Classical databases assume everything is correct, so any future queries might unwittingly return false information.  You can better account for this dangerous uncertainty by tracking how vetted information is. A unified rather than pipeline approach increases accuracy and makes it clear what is known, unknown and uncertain at any given time, Klein told me. Greater confidence in the information you’re extracting allows you to create larger, more connected, knowledge graphs that can accommodate more complex searches. This gives any machine intelligence-powered services that sit on top of the data an edge over competitors. Siri could be improved to answer a wider variety of questions — accounting for its own uncertainty to deliver a better customer experience.

Apple Pay now supports higher value transactions at most UK contactless tills Posted 15 hours ago by Natasha Lomas (@riptari) 0 SHARES Next Story Uber debuts a “smarter” UberPool in Manhattan If the UK’s £30 contactless payment limit was holding back greater adoption of Apple’s biometric contactless payment tech, Apple Pay, the company should expect to see uplift in usage as it believes that a majority of UK contactless POS now supports limitless transactions. The Telegraph quotes Jennifer Bailey, head of Apple’s payments business, asserting that half of contactless payment terminals in the UK are able to take Apple Pay transactions of any value. Previously most contactless card readers had been restricted to £30 — aka, the default upper limit for contactless card transactions. “We think the majority of the contactless terminals [in the UK] are now limitless,” she said yesterday. Retailers supporting the higher value payments are said to include supermarkets such as Waitrose and Sainsbury’s and restaurants such as Pizza Express and Nando’s. Apple says use of Apple Pay has grown 300 per cent in the UK in the last year, with 23 banks now supporting the service. Although it’s apparently not breaking out any hard user numbers yet. The removal of the transaction cap in the UK from the majority of contactless POS terminals — which requires them to be upgraded — is relevant given that UK consumers have had access to contactless bank cards for multiple years, denting the utility of Apple Pay, as shoppers have long been able to just tap a debit or credit card on a contactless POS to make a payment. When Apple launched Apple Pay in the UK in 2015 payments made via the tech were also capped at £30 — despite it having an additional security layer in the form of a fingerprint biometric. Apple is evidently now hoping that majority POS support for limitless transactions will start to generate more momentum for its payment tech. Albeit, from the consumer’s point of view, with no easy way to know for sure ahead of time whether a POS will accept higher value transactions there’s still no clear cut incentive to rely on paying more expensive bills via Apple Pay. At least not until all tills have been upgraded. Also worth noting here: traditional payments firms are not sitting idly by waiting for Apple to eat their lunch with its own commission-charging payments service. For example, MasterCard is currently trialling bank cards with embedded fingerprint readers, and has plans to combine fingerprint readers and contactless bank cards — thereby working to squeeze the hardware differentiator for Apple Pay. Still, Apple is forging ahead — and last week launched the contactless payment service in Italy, its sixteenth market for Apple Pay. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Pay Description Apple Pay is a Apple's mobile payment solution for the iPhone 6 and Apple Watch.

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile If this leaked iPhone 8 case is real, we have some good news and bad news Image Source: Benjamin Geskin Zach Epstein @zacharye May 22nd, 2017 at 11:21 AM Share Tweet Last week, BGR exclusively showed you photos of what is believed by sources to be the iPhone 8’s final design, and it’s a fairly big departure from the iPhone design Apple has used for the past three years. The overall shape is similar, of course, but the iPhone 8 is believed to ditch the home button and the LCD display in favor of an OLED screen with an embedded Touch ID fingerprint sensor. The aluminum housing is expected to be replaced with a glass back and a stainless steel midframe, and a new vertical dual-lens camera can be seen on the back. On Monday, photos were posted on Twitter of a third-party case that reinforces all of the design details shown in those exclusive photos. The case, if it does indeed resemble Apple’s final iPhone 8 design, also reaffirms two longstanding rumors, one of which would be good news and one that would be bad news. Don't Miss: This is the iPhone of our dreams and it probably won’t ever exist The good news is that according to the photos, which come from an unknown source and were posted on Monday morning by Twitter user Benjamin Geskin, the iPhone 8 will not have a fingerprint scanner on the back. Some reports have suggested that Apple is having difficulties creating an iPhone 8 with a fingerprint scanner embedded in the screen that could be mass-produced at the scale Apple needs. As a result, the company supposedly had to move the scanner to the back of the phone. According to this case, however, there will be no scanner on the back. That’s the good news, and now for the bad news. In another photo that shows an iPhone 8 case next to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus cases, it appears as though the iPhone 8 is thicker than both of Apple’s other models. Apple has continued to make its iPhones thinner each year for the most part, but that trend may come to an end with this year’s iPhone 8. That said, users may be happy to opt for a thicker iPhone if the added space means the handset will have a larger battery and a fingerprint scanner embedded in the screen.

The next iPhones' designs, two of which will be just like the 7 and 7 Plus pictured here, could be settled. Image: lili sams/mashable By Brett Williams2017-05-22 15:42:51 UTC We've officially gone beyond the iPhone 8 specs and supply chain rumor phase — now we're in full-on production photo leak territory. New leaked images purported to be the molds used to make the new iPhone models have hit the web, surfacing first on Slashleaks. The pics give us a sneak peek at what could be the final design of the upcoming iPhone 8 — the molds fall in line with what we're expecting from Apple in its next line of phones, and appear to be identical to other recently leaked images of a dummy version of the phone. SEE ALSO: Why I refuse to delete old, unused apps from my iPhone The images on Slashleaks aren't the only photos of the iPhone 8 molds. Graphic designer and leaker Benjamin Geskin also posted photos of the molds, which look just like the dummy model he first shared back in April. He tweeted that the upcoming iPhone designs have been confirmed by these images — but that ultimately can't be determined until we hear from Apple itself.  iPhone X (#iPhone8) with iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. Form is 100% confirmed. Touch ID in power button or display. (99% NOT on the back) pic.twitter.com/Hzj0dihcFe — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) May 22, 2017 The molds show the three models expected from Apple in its next iPhone cycle: a 7S and 7S Plus  — with the same dimensions as the current 7 and 7 Plus handsets at 4.7 and 5.5 inches, respectively —and the deluxe iPhone 8 handset measuring in the middle at around 5 inches. The 8 is expected to take advantage of an edge-to-edge design for more screen space, with a projected 5.8-inch display, but there's no insight on the screen size from the molds, which only show the shells of the devices.     These production molds don't show us anything we haven't already seen from other iPhone leaks. The 7S and 7S Plus rigs have the same camera orientations as the current models, while the 8 has the expected vertically-oriented design that was teased in the photos of the dummy units.  The leaked images also suggest the next iPhone's fingerprint sensor won't be on the back of the device — Geskin is extremely confident Apple won't repeat Samsung's mistake — but, like the size of the screen, there's no way to know from just a production mold. Geskin speculates the sensor will actually make it under the display, which has been a long held rumor, or it could be integrated into the power button on the side of the device.   These photos give the rumors of the "finalized" version of the iPhone 8 that've been floating around some more legitimacy, but remember, nothing about the new iPhones is set in stone — not the supposedly exorbitant price or even its name — until Apple officially unveils the upcoming devices. That probably won't be until September, barring a shocker in June at the World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC), so a real, 100 percent confirmation is still months away.

Since then contactless payments have grown in number, plus Apple and Android Pay have been widely adopted. Apple has now said more than half of the contactless pay points in the UK can be used with no limit when paying using its iOS and Apple Watch payment method. READ NEXT How to boost productivity with noise How to boost productivity with noise By Bonnie Christian "We think the majority of the contactless terminals [in the UK] are now limitless," Jennifer Bailey, the firm's head of payments, said according to The Telegraph. As Apple Pay uses a biometric identifier it is possible for payments of more than the contactless limit to be made. Apple says the use of its contactless technology has increased by 300 per cent in the last year and Apple Pay is now available with 23 banks. Original story 01/09/2015: ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT Here's what Twitter and Facebook know about you Here's what Twitter and Facebook know about you By Matt Burgess The spending limit on contactless payments has been increased to £30. The new limit, up from £20, means the average supermarket spend of £25 will now be covered by the increasingly popular payment method. Most card terminals should already be able to process the higher transaction, but some might not be updated for "a number of weeks", according to industry trade body The UK Cards Association (UKCA). More than £2.5bn has already been spent on contactless cards in the UK this year, compared to £2.32bn for the whole of 2015. The increase in the contactless payment limit was introduced in response to the popularity of the technology. "The growth in contactless payments shows people want to use contactless cards and increasing the limit gives customers even more opportunities to pay in this way," said Graham Peacop, chief executive of UKCA. There are already more than 69 million contactless payment cards in circulation in the UK, with more than 9.3 million of those issued between January and June 2015. ADVERTISEMENT The increase to £30 was first announced in February and since then the popularity of contactless has continued to rise with the launch of Apple Pay and Barclay's bPay service giving further options to pay without chip-and-pin. Despite increased use fraud on contactless cards was still "extremely low" at one penny for every £100, according to UKCA.

With a release on the horizon, we want to help first timers prepare for the iOS 11 beta release date. An iOS 11 update isn’t confirmed for WWDC 2017 but it will almost certainly be one of the stars of the show on June 5th. If Apple follows its standard release protocol, we should see an early version of iOS 11 emerge shortly after the keynote concludes. Thanks to Apple’s Beta Software Program, anyone can try iOS software early, for free. And with an official iOS 11 release date probably months away, we expect the iOS 11 beta to draw a bunch of first-time beta testers. If you’re thinking about trying the iOS 11 early, make sure you’re ready. This is particularly important if this beta will be your first excursion into the world of early iOS software. While it might feel like it’s too early, we recommend doing some prep work ahead of WWDC 2017 and the inevitable iOS 11 beta release. Read the Rules Before the iOS 11 beta arrives you’ll want to get familiar with Apple’s rules and regulations. If you think you might want to register as a developer, you’ll want to take a look at Apple’s beta website for developers. If you think you’ll opt for the free Beta Software Program, you’ll want to read Apple’s official FAQ for the Beta Software Program. Make sure you understand what you’re signing up for before the iOS 11 beta arrives. Decide How to Download the iOS 11 Beta There will almost certainly be two versions of the iOS 11 beta, a developer version and a public version. You’ll want to decide which is right for you, ahead WWDC. Here are a few things to consider before June 5th. An iOS developer account is $99 USD per year. Last year, developers got the iOS 10 beta first. Apple released the iOS 10 beta to developers shortly after the WWDC 2016 keynote in mid-June. Public beta testers got access to the iOS 10 beta in July. Incremental beta releases typically roll out to developers first. The public beta is free. In our experience, we’ve found public iOS betas less buggy than the developer versions. You’ll also want to get familiar with the download process itself. It can be a little confusing for first-time beta users. We’ve put together a walkthrough that will take you step-by-step through the iOS beta download and installation process. Make sure you feel comfortable with it before June 5th. How to Signup for the iOS 11 Beta If you’re determined to try the iOS 11 update ahead of its release date it might be a good idea to get the signup process out-of-the-way. If you want to go the developer route, you can pay your $99 entry fee right now and sit back wait for June 5th to arrive. If you don’t want to pay for access, you can use a valid Apple ID and signup via Apple’s Beta Software Program. The developer signup is normally down for a while after the announcement at WWDC so signing up now will ensure that you’ll be among the first to try the early version of iOS 11. Prepare for iOS 11 Beta Problems Testing iOS software months ahead of release might sound like a dream but it can quickly turn into a nightmare. The main purpose of the iOS 11 beta will be to stress test unfinished software for bugs ahead of its public release date. If you can’t handle dealing with major problems (battery drain, apps not working, etc), you’ll want to avoid the iOS 11 beta. The first versions of the iOS 11 beta will probably be the buggiest so it’s a good idea to get familiar with fixes for common iOS beta issues. Our list of fixes for common iOS 10 problems is good places to start. There, we outline potential fixes for battery drain, app issues, installation problems, AirPod problems, and more. Bookmark the pages, commit some of these fixes to memory and you’ll be in better position when you do run into an issue with iOS 11 beta. Get Familiar with the Downgrade Process If you get tired of testing early software you’ll always be able to downgrade to the most up-to-date version of iOS 10. If you aren’t familiar with the downgrade process now would be a great time to get familiar with the steps you’ll need to take in order to get off the iOS 11 beta. Our downgrade guide will walk you through the most important things you need to know ahead of the iOS 11 beta release. If you don’t feel comfortable with these steps, you might want to avoid the iOS 11 beta. Find Another Device if You Only Have One If you only own one iOS device we recommend finding another “test device” before Apple releases the iOS 11 beta. In its FAQ for the public Beta Software Program, Apple makes two recommendations that we strongly agree with. Install only on non-production devices that are not business critical. We strongly recommend installing on a secondary system or device, or on a secondary partition on your Mac. Installing early software like iOS 11 beta on your primary device has the potential to drive you mad and it could also interfere with your job or schoolwork. If you really want to test iOS 11 you’ll want to dig up, borrow, or buy an old iOS device. That way, if you run into a performance problem or an issue with one of your apps or services, your productivity won’t take a hit. Find Another Device If You Own an iPhone 5 or iPhone 5c All signs point to Apple dropping support for 32-bit devices with the release of iOS 11 beta. At this point, we aren’t expecting an iOS 11 beta release for popular 32-bit devices like the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c. If you own one of these devices, and you really want to try iOS 11 and the beta, you’ll want to investigate an upgrade ahead WWDC. You probably don’t want to commit real cash until we know for sure (and we’ll know for sure on June 5th) but you’ll certainly want to get the wheels in motion now. Start Backing Up Your Data If you don’t regularly back up the data stored on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, now would be a good time to make it a habit. Installing a piece of beta software on your device can be unpredictable so you’ll want to make sure all of your important data s safe up before you make the move. If you don’t know where to start, allow us to take you through the backup process via iTunes. If you don’t want to make a backup through iTunes, you can also make a backup via Apple’s iCloud service. Backing up your device’s data is extremely important and you’ll want to do it on a regular basis throughout the year. Clean Up Your Device We expect iOS 11 beta should be a pretty sizable update. We expect the iOS 11 beta to be a couple hundred megabytes, maybe even 1GB or so depending on the device. If you’re running out of space on your device’s hard drive, and you plan to test iOS 11, now would be a good time to do some spring cleaning. Head into your Settings > General > Storage & iCloud Usage and start deleting apps and other files you no longer need or use. Freeing up a few GB of space will ensure that your device is ready for the iOS 11 beta download and it could also have a positive impact on your device’s performance. Know the Limitations You should also get familiar with the limitations that often come with early software. Here are a few items to keep in mind as we push toward WWDC. If you have to downgrade from iOS 11 beta you won’t be able to downgrade to older versions of iOS. Apple isn’t signing off on old iOS 10 updates, iOS 9 or iOS 8. Once you download the beta, you’re stuck with iOS 10 and its changes. There probably won’t be an iOS 11 beta jailbreak available on day one. If you download the iOS 11 beta and there’s no jailbreak available, you’ll lose your jailbreak. If Apple releases a watchOS beta for Apple Watch and you want to test it, you’ll need to download the iOS 11 beta to a device. You can’t downgrade the Apple Watch, so if you do that you might not be able to downgrade your iPhone and use both. If Apple’s iOS 11 update comes with cross-platform functionality for macOS or tvOS, you’ll need to download one or both of those betas to get access to those features. iOS 11 Beta: 7 Things to Expect & 5 Things Not To Expect an iOS 11 Beta Release Date in June   1 / 12 If Apple decides to release an iOS 11 beta, and we're very confident it will, you can expect the company to confirm the release during its WWDC 2017 keynote on June 5th.  On June 5th, we expect Tim Cook and other Apple executives to address developers in attendance and the thousands of Apple enthusiasts and consumers watching the keynote in countries around the world.  Apple isn't talking about the announcements it will make at the keynote but there's a very good chance it will use the stage time to talk about iOS 11, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. We also expect it to briefly talk about beta updates for the new operating systems.  If Apple sticks to the protocol its used for several years now, you can expect an iOS 11 beta release shortly after the conclusion of the WWDC 2017 keynote on June 5th.    1 / 12 One Response 05/22/2017 Charles Reply This is indeed a great in-depth article on iOS 11. I guess it would be better if you mention the iOS 11 provisioning profile which will allow users to install the iOS 11 beta update without registering as an iOS developer.

RANKED: The 8 best keyboards for your iPhone Jeff Dunn May 22, 2017, 9:42 AM 40,888 facebook linkedin twitter email print REUTERS/Adnan Abidi Apple makes good hardware. It does not always make good software. Its default keyboard is one example of that. Thankfully, anyone in search of something else has worthy alternatives to choose from. As a recent iOS convert, I’m one of those people. So, for everyone’s benefit, I’ve tried to find the best of the bunch. A couple of notes: I focused on keyboards that are explicitly designed for typing — sorry, Kim — and tried to weed out options with poor user reviews. Here's how the iPhone's virtual keyboard market breaks down today. View As: One Page Slides 8. Blink Keyboard This is what Blink's one-handed mode looks like.Jeff Dunn/Business Insider I don’t really think you should use Blink Keyboard: It has no swipe typing — i.e., the ability to slide your finger across the keyboard to form words, instead of manually tapping each key — and the notes from its last developer update in March merely say “fix bug.” It works like a less accurate version of Apple’s default keyboard that's also slightly more sluggish. When you make a mistake, it too often autocorrects to gibberish; being forced to be precise is the last thing you want from a smartphone keyboard. Still, it does have a few things going for it: The “fast delete” button lets you quickly scrap whole words at a time; there’s a one-handed mode that lets you crunch the keys over to one side of the screen; and, when your phone is in landscape mode, it splits apart like an ergonomic keyboard, making it feel a little more natural for your thumbs. But all of that only means so much when the keyboard itself is sloppy. 7. Go Keyboard Jeff Dunn/Business Insider Go Keyboard lets you adjust the height and spacing of the keyboard on the fly, download a bunch of cutesy themes and stickers, and use swipe typing. But again, it’s not quite as fluid or reliable as its peers when it comes to actually typing. It’s fine, but there isn’t much incentive to go out of your way for it. 6. Minuum Jeff Dunn/Business Insider Minuum is one of the more technically impressive keyboards for iOS. Its big hook is that it can shrink the whole keyboard down to a single row, saving screen space and letting you see more of your web page or text conversation. That actually works, too, because Minuum’s prediction and autocorrecting skills are much more aggressive than most of its peers. When everything goes right — either in the mini or full-size mode — you can fire off texts very quickly. I also appreciate how developer Whirlscape doesn’t go out of its way to obscure the app’s privacy settings. The problem is those autocorrections can be too forward for their own good; Minuum learns quickly enough, but it can still spurt out the wrong word, slow you down, and force you to type again. There’s no swipe typing, either. And it hasn’t been updated since January 2016. And the whole thing costs $4. Unless the mini mode appeals to you, you can probably pass. 5. TouchPal Jeff Dunn/Business Insider TouchPal supports swipe typing, and is generally more reliable than the likes of Blink Keyboard or Go Keyboard. Its big thing is that it has a good chunk of goofy but cutesy themes and text art; the one here makes a “Super Mario” jump sound with every key press, for instance. But if that doesn’t matter, you aren’t missing much. TouchPal is competent, but you’ll likely make fewer mistakes with one of the options below. That the app hasn’t been updated since late 2015 doesn’t help. 4. Apple QuickType Keyboard Jeff Dunn/Business Insider To be clear, Apple’s default keyboard has improved. The new thing with iOS 10 was smarter suggestions; if you type "Joe's email address is," for instance, Apple can scrape your contacts for said address, then present it as a shortcut. This isn't perfect, but when it works, it's handy. In general, Apple’s prediction skills are sharp. That QuickType can suggest the emoji equivalents of certain words, and give different suggestions based on which app you’re using, is great. And if you don’t care about swiping, QuickType is still the most reliably accurate keyboard on iPhone. That makes sense, given that it’s baked into iOS. It never crashes, you’ll have to use it whenever you enter a password or text from the lock screen, and it doesn’t need any workarounds to let you text with your voice. That’s all important. But just because it’s the default doesn’t mean it’s fast. Apple’s rejection of swipe typing is just weird at this point, and the best alternatives find a better balance between speed and accuracy. A one-handed mode couldn’t hurt, either. QuickType works, but people download third-party apps for a reason. 3. SwiftKey Jeff Dunn/Business Insider Now we get to the three keyboards you should really consider. From a pure typing perspective, SwiftKey is tops. You have to use it a little bit for it to get there, but once you do, it requires the least amount of effort to get things right, quickly. It does this in part with a “tap map,” which tailors the shape of the keyboard to the autocorrections it most frequently makes. Nothing looks different, but behind the scenes it could make, say, the Y and G keys more spacious, so you have less of a chance of hitting nearby letters by accident. You can tie it to your Gmail and Facebook account to personalize things further. Just know that you have to be comfortable sending your data to Microsoft, which bought SwiftKey last year. None of this is flawless. Swiping is a bit less accurate than standard touch typing, and sometimes SwiftKey’s autocomplete will toss more common words in place of what you’re actually trying to type. But, again, it learns quickly enough, and I found its word predictions to be excellent (if not on Apple’s level). A recent redesign has made it look pretty slick, too: There are a good chunk of themes, and the whole thing now supports more than 100 languages. So there’s a lot to like. SwiftKey’s problem is that the next two choices are almost as smooth to use, yet much more connected. 2. Microsoft Word Flow Jeff Dunn/Business Insider Word Flow, the keyboard Microsoft puts it brand on, has grown from an experiment to a charming and fully-realized alternative in recent months. Word Flow’s big hook is that, with a couple of taps, you can contort the keyboard to a shape that rounds out on the left or right. This is less accurate than its full-sized mode, but it does work, and it makes Word Flow the most convenient option to use with one hand. The keyboard itself isn’t as snappy or active with suggestions as SwiftKey, but it yields few complaints with both swipe and touch typing. It’s all stable and smooth. There are several themes to use with it, too. Word Flow’s narrow lead comes from its search function — as of late last year, you can search Bing for GIFs and web links that can be shared right from the keyboard. You can look up Microsoft-using contacts as well. This is all much faster than going in and out of a browser.  Put it all together, and you have a surprisingly full-featured option that’s both smart and comfortable. 1. Google Gboard Jeff Dunn/Business Insider Google’s Gboard is just a bit better. Again, it’s neither as fast nor as proactive as SwiftKey, but it’s still quick and responsive across the board. It has swipe typing, which gives it a leg up on Apple’s QuickType Keyboard. That swiping is constantly snappy. And though it's close, I've found it more likely to suggest and autocorrect in the right words compared to Word Flow. It also has a web searching tool built in, which gives it the GIF finding and connectivity that SwiftKey lacks. Since it uses Google instead of Bing, I’d give it the edge over Microsoft's Word Flow. And unlike Word Flow, or any other non-Apple keyboard, Gboard also lets you create texts with your voice. It requires an internet connection, and it bumps you over to a new screen — Apple works offline and lets you dictate right from the text convo — but it works well all the same. You have to be okay with sending everything to Google’s mother brain for this to be as useful as it can be, but if so, Gboard is the most well-rounded keyboard for your iPhone. It's a familiar story by now: If you need a change on Apple’s hardware, look to Google’s software first. EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

In April 2016 the brash CEO Jia Yueting confidently stated on CNBC that Apple was simply an outdated company. Reality hit LeEco and its egotistic CEO in December 2016 when the company lost millions in smartphones and was forced by the banks to go into super cost cutting mode to save the company. Today the CEO of LeEco has stepped down.   Today Digitimes is reporting that "Jia Yueting, chairman and CEO of China-based LeEco, has stepped down as CEO of the company but will retain his position as chairman, according to a recent stock exchange filing."   This move was likely forced upon LeEco by the banks. The brash Yueting made a number of high profile gaffs and overspent wildly.   Meanwhile, the company promoted its incumbent vice president Liang Jun to serve as its new CEO. Liang, a veteran of the Lenovo Group, joined LeEco as an executive in 2012.   LeEco has reduced significantly orders for parts and components recently for its smartphones.   The WSJ reported in December that in LeEco's financial filing they noted that "To protect the interests of the company and of many investors, the company needs to halt trade and investigate these matters."   The company was forced to cut 13,000 – 14,000 jobs in December. If the CEO is now stepping down, it can't be seen as a good move, because he was already working on restructuring back then and continues to do so. In fact Variety noted in their report on this story that LeEco's sports business LeSports is cutting 70% of its staff and 30% of its U.S. staff. Ouch!   All the while, Apple has further soared to new heights and remains the most profitable technology company in the world.

 Here's why Steve Wozniak used to wait in line overnight for new Apple products Darren Weaver and Melia Robinson May 22, 2017, 10:00 AM 18,425 Loading video... facebook linkedin twitter email embed A few years ago, if you were waiting overnight outside an Apple Store ahead of a new product launch, you just might have found Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak sitting next to you on the sidewalk. This wasn't a marketing stunt by Apple. Wozniak really enjoyed being part of an Apple event with other fans. In an interview with Business Insider, Wozniak compared the night before an Apple release to waiting in line for concert tickets, which he often did when he was younger. Sure, as an Apple co-founder he could have probably pulled strings to get the new iPhone, but he says he's "just not a favor asker." Following is a transcript of the video:   Of all the Apple products that had lines — the earlier iPhones, the earlier iPads, yes I always waited in line overnight. Something inspiring in me, something said, “This is a big, important deal.” I want to be a part of it, just like you want to be a part of a huge festival, you know Coachella maybe. This is going to be an inspiring, great time in my life. That’s how I thought about it, it was just like waiting overnight to get tickets to an important concert. The earliest I've gotten in line for an Apple product is generally, close to 24 hours in advance. Coming by maybe in the morning to noon time and then sitting out all night long till the store opens at whatever 8 in the morning. When I'm waiting in line for products, of course I'm very anxious inside and I feel all the adrenaline flowing. But I still have to keep up with my email coming in on my computer. Usually I'm sitting in a chair on my computer watching the new Apple product being opened in New Zealand. And then I'm watching it in Australia. Then I'm watching eventually in Tokyo and then London. And by the time it gets to California 17 hours later, it's sort of like the whole thing already happened. The glamour of being first already happened. I don't really do it anymore. Pretty much just know the products are coming out and they're not going to be available on day one, especially the version I want. So I just order it online and accept it. I got a lot more patient now. As an Apple founder I wouldn't try to get one that way, because before Apple, I had my own philosophical code. I try to be like normal people, do it the same way everyone else does. Get in line, buy it, pay full price. I'm sure I could probably ask and get some favors, but I'm just not a favor asker. There were times — like the first iPhone, Steve Jobs actually sent me one. And there were other computers he would send me one, but not asked for. I buy most of the important Apple products because technology is my excitement in life, you know, just like movies and popular culture. These are all things, oh my gosh I want to be a part of it. Would you miss the next “Star Wars” movie? You know, some people wouldn't miss it. It’s that deep a part of their life.

 Wall Street analyst predicts iPhone 8 will start at $870 and could cost as much as $1,070 Kif Leswing May 22, 2017, 10:23 AM 4,960 facebook linkedin twitter email print COMPUTER BILD TV There are two big questions on the mind of Apple investors, suppliers, and other people that are invested in the financial success of the iPhone.  When Apple comes out with a new, redesigned iPhone with a next-generation OLED screen this fall, what will it cost? And what percentage of iPhones will sport the new design?  UBS analyst Steven Milunovich believes the iPhone 8 will start at $870, and an upgraded model with 256GB of space in this scenario would cost $1,070, he wrote in a note distributed to clients on Monday. Currently, Apple charges $649 or more for an iPhone 7, and the iPhone 7 Plus costs $769 and up.  Some analysts have previously entertained the possibility that the iPhone 8 could cost $1,000 or more, but under Milunovich's assumptions, that would be the high-end price, not the starting price.  Milunovich also forecasts that the redesigned iPhone, which is rumored to feature a glass case, wireless charging, and an edge-to-edge screen, will make up 45% of sales next year. Many believe Apple is preparing two updated models of the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in addition to the redesigned iPhone 8.  Last week, I was speaking to a representative of one of Apple's suppliers, and she said one of the big questions they're facing in terms of their business is what percentage of this year's iPhones will be redesigned, and they don't have any specific inside knowledge on that point.  It's important to realize that the marketing and thought process pertaining to any iPhone pricing change is almost certainly one of Apple's most closely guarded secrets — and it's not information that Apple's partners would have any inside knowledge about.  Wall Street analysts don't necessarily have any specific insight on the discussions going on inside Cupertino on Apple's pricing strategy, but they can make educated projections based on what the parts Apple is buying cost and previous years' pricing.  "Assuming that the OLED model constitutes 45% of sales, we estimate the [iPhone average selling price] could be $730 ($783 bull, $664 bear)," Milunovich wrote.  UBS rates Apple as a "buy" and increased its price target to $170 from $165.  EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

The company said that the new colors of bands and shoes are "inspired by a shade of the sky, from dawn to dusk," and mark the first time that Apple Watch owners can directly match their band choice to their Nike sneakers. Similar to previous Nike+ Apple Watch bands, the new options are made of the same flexible fluoroelastomer material that Apple uses in its own Sport bands, but include a perforated design for ventilation and sweat management. The most recent Nike and Apple partnership was in the cream and black NikeLab band that launched in April, following the first Apple Watch Nike+ device that debuted last September. Users will be able to purchase the new Nike Apple Watch sport bands for $49.00 each beginning on June 1 on Nike.com and in select Nike stores. The company said that the bands will be available on Apple.com, in Apple retail locations, authorized resellers, and specialty department stores from "early June." The running shoes will also go on sale on June 1, and will be priced at $190.00.

Rating: 16 Votes Relentless Power 15 hours ago at 09:06 am Are you somehow trying to convey there are differences in the chemical composition between fluoroelastomer and some common rubber to justify Apple's application of the material as a watch band in addition to its $50 price tag? Who cares about the price tag. If someone wants to pay $50.00 for the Watch band, so be it. What is apparent is you don't understand the differences between rubber and flueroastamer. "Fluoroelastomer comes from the two words "fluorinated" and "elastomer". Fluoroelastomers are famous for their durability resistance to heat, oils, solvents and fuels. They are often used for fuel-distribution systems or for high-quality lab gloves. It is not a material that will stretch out easily, get damaged by extreme heats, or get deformed by being excessively sweat on. It is also much less prone to induce any allergic reactions than, for example, latex." Where as rubber, doesn't have the consistency and durability as Flueroastamer does. Flueroastamer easily is the preference For fitness for reasons stated above. Rating: 15 Votes TheTruth101 16 hours ago at 08:15 am Oh the forum is just going to love this...

They look great, but I just can't fathom paying that much money for some cloth and rubber. They aren't "rubber", nor do they cost $0.05 to produce. Pretty easy to see this when comparing Apple bands to ones purchased from Amazon or Best Buy. It's an extremely noticeable feel and durability difference. The sport bands I bought with my first gen watch are still going strong.

There ARE differences in the chemical composition, which create significant differences in the look, feel, flexibility and durability of the Apple/Nike bands. No justification is needed. You either like it and see the value, or you don't. Why are so many people on this forum threatened by this watchband? It's really strange. It's also strange that anyone would spend $400 or $800 on a watch, and then buy the cheapest band for it they can find. That's akin to buying a brand new Audi and then scouring EBay for the cheapest knock-off tires available. You either appreciate quality or you don't. But no reason to judge those who do. Rating: 9 Votes HowEver 16 hours ago at 08:22 am These are not for me, but I'm already tired of comments by people who haven't sold a million of anything hating something because it's a different colour, or whatever non-reason that doesn't affect their lives. Rating: 8 Votes DaveOP 15 hours ago at 08:47 am Exactly. I love how Apple uses "fluoroelastomer." Oh my God, just say "rubber." It's a rubber band. Nothing special about "fluoroelastomer." And I bet it really does cost 5 cents. But since it has a giant Apple logo on it, people buy it. Just like Glock guns. They're plastic. But they use "polymer nylon something." Just say plastic. You've obviously never used one, and then tried a knock off. They are not in the same universe when it comes to quality or feel. Edit: My day-1 sports band still feels great, but some pricey knock-offs I bought from Amazon lasted less than a month before they started to shine and feel terrible. Well worth the cost for the real thing. Rating: 8 Votes j3T 16 hours ago at 08:38 am You just described absolutely all of Apple's 1st party accessories. All over priced crap. I don't fully agree though. I've tried a lot of the aftermarket rubber straps, each time hoping to find that one that rivaled the original rubber strap. They're all made of crap silicone rubber. My Apple rubber strap still looks like new and keeps holding up. It's just decent stuff.

In a note to investors on Monday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said that Apple could surpass a $1 trillion valuation within the next 12 to 18 months. The analyst, who isn't the first to float the idea, said that a host of "levers" could ultimately help Apple reach the $1 trillion mark, including revenue growth, improved margins, and higher earnings. "We believe the fundamental reality remains that Apple’s valuation is materially sub-par to what we anticipate is its long-term revenue and earnings-per-share potential," Daryanani wrote to investors. Apple (aapl) is currently valued at a little over $800 billion, which means the company would need to boost its shares rather quickly to reach $1 trillion. However, Apple's valuation has been soaring in recent months, thanks to a growing share price. This year alone, Apple's shares are up 32% to $153.33. Apple hit the $800 billion market earlier this month after Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White raised his price target range to $185 to $202. If Apple hits that range, the company's market cap would reach $1 trillion. Like Daryanani, White believes Apple's shares are undervalued at their current level and thinks the company's financial performance will only improve in the next year. His range prediction suggests Apple could reach the $1 trillion mark within the next year. No company has ever exceeded a $1 trillion valuation, which makes the possible feat all the more important. However, while Apple is considered the frontrunner in a race to $1 trillion, several other companies might get there first. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter In March, for instance, Barclays analyst Ross Sandler said Amazon might get there first, thanks to a soaring stock price and market cap. At the time, Amazon (amzn) had a $424 billion market cap, but Sandler said its value growth is accelerating. As of this writing, Amazon is valued at $463.6 billion. Several other companies—including Microsoft (msft) and Alphabet (googl)—have also been floated as possible $1 trillion companies, though their market caps—$525.3 billion and $658 billion, respectively—are still far behind Apple's. While Daryanani didn't say whether Apple would be first to reach $1 trillion, he did say that the company's success is built not only on hardware, like smartphones and Macs. He told investors that Apple's mobile operating system iOS creates an opportunity for Apple to keep generating revenue long after customers buy hardware. "Simplistically, the scale of users attracts application developers, which in turn bolsters the number of users," Daryanani said of iOS. "We believe this cycle results in a captive consumer base that transitions more data and usage via iOS on Apple devices."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) could see its market valuation top US$1trn within the next 12 to 18 months, boosted by the launch of the iPhone 8 later this year. RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani made the prediction as he raised the stock’s target price to US$168 from US$157 and reiterated an ‘outperform' rating. Revenue and margins have potential to grow.. Daryanani said revenue and margins have the potential to grow as the launch of the premium-priced iPhone 8 later this year will boost average selling prices. The pricier iPhones, including a 128 gigabyte model for at US$999 and a 256 gigabyte model for US$1,099, are expected to be released in September. Daryanani also said Apple’s plans for US$35bn worth of share buybacks per year through fiscal year 2019 could reduce the share count by 400 million to 500 million shares, lifting earnings per share by US$1.30 to US$1.35. Apple’s share count reduction could accelerate if it goes ahead with plans to repatriate profits held overseas, Daryanani added. The company holds more than US$200bn offshore and plans to bring home much of the pile this year. The decision comes after US President Donald Trump vowed to offer US firms a one-off tax holiday if they return offshore cash to American soil. Not the first on market cap rise.. Daryanani is not the first to say that Apple’s market capitalisation could reach US$1trn. Drexel Hamilton was the first to suggest the milestone was achievable when it raised target price to US$202 a share from US$185. Apple became the first company to see its market capitalisation surpass US$800bn on 8 May after Drexel’s remarks. Apple's market capitalisation is at US$806bn today. Goldman Sachs also lifted its target price to US$170 from US$164bn and reiterated a ‘buy’ rating on the stock earlier this month, saying it expects Apple’s premium iPhones will lift average selling prices.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) could see its market valuation top US$1trn within the next 12 to 18 months, boosted by the launch of the iPhone 8 later this year. RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani made the prediction as he raised the stock’s target price to US$168 from US$157 and reiterated an ‘outperform' rating. Revenue and margins have potential to grow.. Daryanani said revenue and margins have the potential to grow as the launch of the premium-priced iPhone 8 later this year will boost average selling prices. The pricier iPhones, including a 128 gigabyte model for at US$999 and a 256 gigabyte model for US$1,099, are expected to be released in September. Daryanani also said Apple’s plans for US$35bn worth of share buybacks per year through fiscal year 2019 could reduce the share count by 400 million to 500 million shares, lifting earnings per share by US$1.30 to US$1.35. Apple’s share count reduction could accelerate if it goes ahead with plans to repatriate profits held overseas, Daryanani added. The company holds more than US$200bn offshore and plans to bring home much of the pile this year. The decision comes after US President Donald Trump vowed to offer US firms a one-off tax holiday if they return offshore cash to American soil. Not the first on market cap rise.. Daryanani is not the first to say that Apple’s market capitalisation could reach US$1trn. Drexel Hamilton was the first to suggest the milestone was achievable when it raised target price to US$202 a share from US$185. Apple became the first company to see its market capitalisation surpass US$800bn on 8 May after Drexel’s remarks. Apple's market capitalisation is at US$806bn today. Goldman Sachs also lifted its target price to US$170 from US$164bn and reiterated a ‘buy’ rating on the stock earlier this month, saying it expects Apple’s premium iPhones will lift average selling prices.

But it seems the tech company wants to finally punish apps that demonstrate poor stability and power efficiency. Announced at the recently concluded Google I/O, Google is introducing Android Vitals for its developers. This initiative aims to analyze various metrics and scores of an app in relation to speed, security, and stability. Google will be looking at things like “App not responding (ANR) rates,” “Crash rate,” “Slow rendering,” Frozen frames,” “Stuck wake locks,” and “Excessive wake-ups.” Using these metrics Google will see which apps are ranked at the bottom 25 percent. The penalty for these apps is they might no longer be visible on the Play Store. If this helps improve the quality of apps that show up on the Play Store, then we’re all for it.

By Michael Simon Staff Writer, Macworld | May 22, 2017 7:43 AM PT Credit: Apple More like this Apple Music’s potential is bigger than even Taylor Swift can see Apple Music FAQ: The ins and outs of Apple's new streaming music service A year after iTunes Plus, Apple faces stepped-up competition Video Can the iPhone make better AR than Facebook and Snapchat? | The iPhone Show Even if you hate the design and navigation, one thing has been clear since Apple released its Music streaming service to the world at WWDC 2015: it has the best introductory offer in the business. But like all good things, it looks like that might be coming to an end. Several outlets have spotted that Apple’s website in Australia, Spain, and Switzerland is now showing that new Apple Music subscriptions will cost a buck rather than nothing. New customers still get the same three months of music, but now their iTunes accounts will be charged 99 cents, euros, and francs, respectively. It’s unclear why Apple has begun charging a fee for its trial run—or whether it will reach other territories like the United States—but it’s not uncommon for music services to attach small amounts for long-term testing period. For example, Spotify also charges 99 cents for a three-month trial. When Apple Music landed back in June 2015, its free offer was a source of some controversy. On the eve of the launch, pop superstar Taylor Swift announced that she would be withholding her latest mega hit, 1989, since Apple wasn’t planning on paying royalties during the three-month trial period. She called the move “shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company,” and urged Apple to “change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this.” The decision was quickly reversed and Swift has been a large presence on Apple Music, contributing an exclusive concert video and appearing in one of the early ads for the service. Even without a permanent free tier, however, Apple Music has been steadily gaining on market-leader Spotify’s sizable lead. After announcing it had crossed the 20 million milestone in December, Apple's senior vice president of Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue recently revealed that the service was now “well past” that number, still out of reach of Spotify’s 50-million-strong ranks but showing impressive growth. Apple Music is available on iOS and Android on mobile devices and through iTunes on the Mac. Why this matters: Ninety-nine cents might not seem like much, but Apple’s lengthy free trial was a notable advantage over its main competitor, Spotify. By charging customers a fee, no matter how nominal, the sign-up process might not be as much of an impulse decision for people, and with Spotify costing the same amount for the same time, would-be Apple Music subscribers might be choosing between the two. The psychology behind free is pretty strong, and it's surely one of the major reasons behind Apple Music’s tremendous growth.

clock menu more-arrow How Anker is beating Apple and Samsung at their own accessory game by Nick Statt@nickstatt May 22, 2017, 10:19am EDT Illustrations by William Joel Photography by James Bareham share tweet Linkedin Steven Yang quit his job at Google in the summer of 2011 to build the products he felt the world needed: a line of reasonably priced accessories that would be better than the ones you could buy from Apple and other big-name brands. These accessories — batteries, cables, chargers — would solve our most persistent gadget problem by letting us stay powered on at all times. There were just a few problems: Yang knew nothing about starting a company, building consumer electronics, or selling products. “I was a software engineer all my life at Google. I didn’t know anyone in the electronics manufacturing world,” Yang tells me over Skype from his office in Shenzhen, China. But he started the company regardless, thanks in no small part to his previous experience with Amazon’s sellers marketplace, a platform for third-party companies and tiny one- or two-person teams interested in selling directly to consumers. He named the company Anker, after the German word for ship anchor. The steady rise of the company’s profile... is proof that it’s possible to meet one very specific consumer need and ride that wave Anker has since become the most popular brand of portable battery packs on Amazon. Portable chargers had a bit of a standout moment last summer, when players of the wildly-popular and battery-hogging Pokémon Go could be seen roaming the streets, their phones constantly plugged in. But these accessories have existed for years as a remedy for our battery woes since the standard smartphone tends to last no more than a day on a single charge. So in airports, the back of cabs, and on city streets we’re plugging into lithium-ion slabs in our pockets and bags to stay connected. The market for portable battery packs generated $360 million in the 12 months ending in March, 2017 in the US alone. The brands behind these packs are largely anonymous — Kmashi, Jackery, and iMuto — and they often stay that way. Except Anker. The steady rise of the company’s profile is proof that it’s possible to meet one very specific consumer need and ride that wave as it continues to ripple out to other markets. A majority of Anker’s sales come from cables and wall chargers, and it’s now moving into the smart home and auto market — anywhere a plug and a cable can solve a problem. Yang and his team started a company with the sole purpose of selling a better third-party accessory. But they stumbled onto a more lucrative reality: mobile phones, once niche luxury items, are now ubiquitous centerpieces of our digital lives. Each of these phones, and all the products that connect to them, need their own cable and plug. And each and every day these devices die before we want them to. PowerCore 10000 If there’s anything you should know about smartphone development over the last ten years, it’s this: batteries are not lasting longer. Phones may be thinner and faster, with larger screens and better cameras, but they don’t stay powered for longer than a day, perhaps 36 hours at best. The culprit is the fundamental science of lithium-ion batteries, which are tremendous at storing energy but only within limited size and capacity constraints. The lithium-ion batteries we have today operate at about a fifth of their potential storage capacity, says Lynden Archer, a professor of chemical engineering at Cornell University. And yet that’s still at about 90 percent of the maximum potential today’s battery science allows. “A breakthrough would require a new paradigm,” he says. “A huge part of Anker’s success is the fact that our batteries don’t last long enough.” That stagnation has allowed Anker to flourish. “A huge part of Anker’s success is the fact that our batteries don’t last long enough,” says Joanna Stern, a technology columnist and gadget reviewer for The Wall Street Journal. “They saw that accessories needed to be made to address customers’ pain points. They’re making the chargers, the cases, the cords — and they’re making it for affordable prices so you can have one of these in every place you are.” Mobile battery packs weren’t the company’s initial goal. In the late 2000s, Yang identified a consumer need not being met: well-built, reliable laptop battery replacements. “You have a Dell or HP laptop — let’s assume you got it in 2009 — and in 2011 the battery is dying and you want to get a new one,” he says. Back then you had two choices: buy directly from Dell or HP, with a high price tag, or buy a white-label battery that’s cheap but poorly made. “Which one do I want to buy?” asks Yang. “The answer is neither of them.” Yang saw a desire for a better type of accessory — one that wouldn’t cost as much as a replacement straight from the original manufacturer, but that would be of a high enough quality to earn consumers’ trust. Before he could sell that product, he needed to figure out how to make it. It was a long and painful process. After he quit his job at Google in July of 2011, Anker took 12 months just to prototype its first laptop battery. That was even after Yang and the core team moved to Shenzhen to find reliable manufacturing partners. “I knew that if I stayed in California and had people FedEx me prototypes in a week, it was just not going to work,” he says. Many hardware companies, especially crowdfunded ones in the US, learn that lesson the hard way, by missing deadlines and hitting snags that lead to months-long delays. A solid supply chain is so crucial to a hardware company’s survival that there’s an entire consulting industry around helping startups find suppliers and set expectations. Critical to avoiding these pitfalls was Dongpong Zhao, Google’s then-head of sales in China. Zhao joined Anker in early 2012, and helped Yang build out the company’s supply chain. Anker was made up of around ten people at the time. “Think of it as a small family business instead of like an actual company,” Yang says. The company tirelessly built out a supply chain in its first year and began testing its first products — the laptop chargers and batteries it would begin selling direct to consumers on Amazon. “We were able to make cell phone battery cells that actually had slightly better capacity,” Yang says. “That got us quite the reputation.” From there, Anker ventured into smartphone batteries with a replacement unit for the HTC Sensation. “We were able to make cellphone battery cells that actually had slightly better capacity,” Yang says. “That got us quite the reputation.” Early on, Anker developed close relationships with suppliers in Asia, including Panasonic and anode supplier BTR, to help test and quickly develop new batteries. Yang says he and Anker’s small team “definitely saw the explosion of smart devices” as its biggest and most obvious opportunity, and Anker started aggressively expanding into portable battery packs, wall chargers, and cables. By the end of 2012, after shifting more resources toward portable chargers, Yang says Anker went from selling 100 to 1,000 products per day. “The challenge wasn’t selling products,” Yang says. “It was making products and making sure they were high-quality as well. That’s why we spent a majority of our effort on R&D and product development.” The company does a majority of its sales directly to consumers over Amazon Marketplace, where a combination of strong reviews, low prices, and prominent placement in search rankings can turn a single product into a lucrative line. For the accessories market, which tends to piggyback off trends in mainstream consumer electronics, a true breakthrough is rare. But Anker found one in charging, based on the realization that while batteries may not be improving, charging time certainly was. According a study conducted last year by PhoneArena, it took more than two hours on average to charge a device to 100 percent in 2013. Today, it can be done in almost half the time. So Anker set out to make the fastest chargers available. Take the PowerPort 5, a matte black rectangle no larger than a deck of playing cards, with five USB ports. When it was first introduced in 2015, it was the only accessory on the market capable of charging five devices simultaneously at optimal speed. Or the company’s standard PowerCore portable charger, roughly the size of a credit card and just under one inch thick — a white block encasing 10,000mAh of lithium-ion battery cells. It has four pinholes that light up in LED blue when you press an elliptical button on the top to check its remaining charge. It can refill a depleted iPhone 7 in just over 60 minutes nearly four times over before it needs to be recharged. Most Anker charging products have one signature: the PowerIQ logo. Launched in 2013, the company’s proprietary charging standard is now present on nearly all of its batteries and wall plugs. The technology, carried by a small chip inside each charger, identifies whatever device is being plugged in, be it an iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, or an iPad Pro 9.7-inch, in order to detect and deliver the maximum current the product allows. Anker says the technology can shave hours off the amount of time it takes to reach a full charge. A next-generation version of the chip, a sequel to PowerIQ, is slated to start shipping in new Anker charging products later this year, allowing for smaller and lighter accessories. On top of its products’ technical advantages, Anker banks on looks to make its chargers stand out. Brand manager Elisa Lu says every device’s packaging is carefully thought out from the moment customers receive the product, to when they open it and use it. Devices come in a white and light-blue box with the name Anker printed in all caps across the front. Inside is a meticulously packaged arrangement of lightweight cardboard. Anker products carry that new-gadget smell — a blend of peculiar odors from the evaporation of chemical compounds in the plastics and the epoxy coatings of the device. Beside its red cables, which Anker offers in both standard and braided nylon versions, and a single one-off red battery pack, the company sells products in only two color options: black and white. All this has a strategic business purpose. “When our consumers receive our products, we want to make sure they know they are getting it from a reliable and trustworthy company,” Lu says. Brand trust is a pivotal consideration when purchasing what may seem like random electronics off Amazon. Inside the the box with Anker’s larger products, you’ll also find a small square piece of paper with two questions: are you happy, or are you unhappy? If you’re unhappy, a block of text instructs you to contact Anker customer support via phone, email, or on its website. If you’re satisfied, it asks you to tell your friends or family. Better yet, leave an Amazon review. PowerCore Slim 5000 In many ways, Anker’s success is born from the failures of premier manufacturers like Apple and Samsung. Where those companies introduce points of friction — like ever-thinner devices with short battery lives — Anker offers a remedy. “My feeling is that Anker is a success because Apple offers such subpar and expensive accessories,” says Stern, who’s often recommended Anker products in her WSJ column. It may be surprising that Apple sat idly as the accessory market ballooned around it; it took the company years to develop its own battery case for the iPhone to compete with Mophie. But Apple has always favored high margins on premium products, even the cables and earbuds it sells in the Apple Store. This has given ample room to companies like Anker, with the low overhead of an e-commerce business, to sell similar products of near-identical quality for $10 to $20 cheaper. And where Apple and others failed to develop products of their own like multi-port wall plugs and portable chargers, Anker saw the opportunity and capitalized on it. The company is quick to fill gaps created by smartphone manufacturers. When Apple removed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, for instance, Anker saw a giant opportunity to begin producing new dongles and other cable adapters to help consumers adjust. But mastering Amazon was the real key to securing Anker’s future. Search for a generic accessory like “cell phone wall charger” or “Lightning cable” and you’ll find the Anker brand high up in the search results If you head over to Amazon.com right now and peruse the retailer’s most popular smartphone accessories and you’ll find Anker products at the top. Search for a generic accessory like “cell phone wall charger” or “Lightning cable” and you’ll find the Anker brand high up in the search results, typically with a 4.5 or 5-star rating. In fact, Anker products take up the first five slots on Amazon’s list of best-selling portable batteries. And alongside the ratings, you’ll find thousands of customer reviews — reviews that the company scans meticulously for ideas on how to improve their development process. Two years before he left Google, Yang became intimately familiar with Amazon’s Marketplace when he built an automated system for a friend who was selling third-party products on Amazon as a side business. It essentially took care of aspects of the business like inventory, logistics and fulfillment, and sales tracking. “It took me two months, evenings and weekends, to develop this system,” Yang explained in a video produced by Amazon last year to promote entrepreneurship on its platform. “Within a month, she was fulfilling 300 orders a day.” Building this system gave Yang invaluable insight into how third-party selling on Amazon functioned. He discovered what worked and what didn’t, and how entire brands could crop up overnight and fade into obscurity the next day. Anker thrived by borrowing infrastructure from Amazon and relying on engineering and support in China. “Amazon provides loads of services — financial services, fulfillment. It actually makes selling a low-barrier thing,” Yang says. Although the company attempted to handle its own fulfillment in its early days, it eventually discovered it could not compete with what Amazon offered. Now, about 95-percent of Anker’s products are listed as “Fulfilled by Amazon.” You can build an online retail business off Amazon, but making sure your products get exposure is the hard part. “The biggest challenge for Anker is not sales. It’s customer perception,” Yang says. “People think they need [Apple’s] cube charger and stock cable.” Teaching people that there is a superior product out there, and then convincing them to keep buying, is Anker’s core challenge. “Amazon reviews were really enormously helpful,” Yang says. “The Amazon reviews just come and come automatically.” PowerLine+ USB-C to USB 3.0 Silicon Valley is full of breathless mission statements designed to inspire and justify the power and influence of technology, like Apple’s famous “think different” slogan, and Google’ ominous and now defunct “don’t be evil” mantra. Facebook, back in 2012, celebrated its billion-user milestone with an ad comparing the social network to chairs, bridges, and even nations. Anker has never aspired to such grand ambitions. “At Anker, we can't exactly help you unwind,” the company admits on its Amazon sellers page. Instead, Anker takes a more straightforward approach by solving the inevitable problems technology creates. “Say goodbye to first-world tech woes like oppressive low batteries and limited ports,” the page says. “Say hello to an easier, smarter life.” Yang is trying to extend this simple philosophy to categories like headphones, speakers, phone cases, and now smart home appliances under a new brand called Eufy. Launched last September, Eufy is Anker’s avenue for selling things like Roomba clones, desk lamps, and bathroom scales. Expanding into more product categories is a logical evolution for Anker, but it’s also a response to a looming existential threat: Yang says he foresees a future where portable chargers won’t be necessary due to advancements in both fast charging and wireless charging. “I think we all agree that the portable charger isn’t forever,” Yang says. But consumers will always need wall plugs and cables, and Anker sees its goal now as keeping pace with changing standards, like the introduction of USB-C. PowerCore 5000 In the meantime, Yang says it’s diversifying with a future expansion into audio, smart home, and automotive product lines. Anker already produces Bluetooth headphones and speakers, but it has aspirations to compete with the likes of Harman Kardon and Bose. Key to the success of those products is moving to brick-and-mortar retailers. Terrence Wang, the company’s chief marketing officer hired from Procter & Gamble in 2015, says having a presence in Best Buy and Walmart, a process that began last year, is the next stage of Anker’s evolution. “Expanding from online to offline is critical actually,“ Wang says. “We are trying to get as many people to know that they have a simple, convenient, portable, fast solution rather than just have to bring their own charger wherever they go. That’s the original brand vision.” The company’s focus on storefront retail is a response to a second very real threat — dependence on a direct-to-consumer online-only model. The company has found it difficult these days to launch new products on Amazon. Older products have thousands of reviews, while newer ones need to earn placement in the search rankings and collect testimonials before more cautious buyers pull the trigger. “We’re seeing a bit of a dilemma on that one,” Yang says. “To a lot of people, the original charger and the original cable are the only means to charge their devices.” The company is also struggling with its complex product line, with a dizzying number of choices that may alienate consumers who are looking for a simple choice. “We’re converging to this generation approach,” Yang says. “So we’ll try to release a generation of products every 18 to 24 months.” Choosing which products to promote at Best Buy, which to discontinue, and where to put resources for the future are all part of Anker’s growing pains. The company’s success hinges on convincing — or “educating” — their consumers about the value of what they’re offering. Yang likes to tell a story about a moment he sees play out on repeat every single time he’s at an airport, anywhere on the planet. He sees people, smartphones in hand, rushing from outlet to outlet, looking for space with “the little Apple cube in their hands” and running out of options. “To a lot of people, the original charger and the original cable are the only means to charge their devices, in their mind,” he says. “I look at those people and I always want to go up to them and talk to them.” Instead, Yang and the Anker team started conducting an annual consumer survey. It has only one question: how often does your smartphone run out of battery? Once every day? Once a week? Once a month? Or perhaps never? “Forty percent of people say their battery ran out at least once last week, another 40 percent say at least once last month,” Yang says. “As long as these numbers don’t go down, I think we have a lot of work to do.” Policy & Law PayPal burns Pandora to the ground in lawsuit over logo similarities Circuit Breaker The Finger Spinner iOS game is about free-to-play monetization, not fidget spinning Circuit Breaker Amazon Video can now stream in 4K on Xbox One S View all stories in Tech Loading comments...

Apple would also step in to defend net neutrality, its chief executive said, if the principle protecting even-handed management of internet traffic is threatened by the new head of the Federal Communications Commission, the US telecom regulator. “We love this country,” Mr Cook said at the company’s annual meeting in Cupertino. “We will continue to look for ways to expand and help in any way that we can.” Apple already spends around $50bn a year with US-based suppliers, Mr Cook revealed in response to a question from a shareholder about American job creation. The world’s most valuable public company supports “several hundred thousand jobs” across its vendor base, he said, in addition to more than 1m software developers who make their living through its App Store. “We also do a fair amount of manufacturing in the US,” Mr Cook said. Semiconductors, adhesives and glass screens for the iPhone are all made in America, he said, even though the device’s final assembly is largely done in China. “A lot of the fixation in manufacturing is in the final thing, because that’s what people see,” Mr Cook said, “but that sort of discounts the reality” of Apple’s American supply chain. Two-thirds of Apple’s employees are in the US, he said, despite only a third of its revenues coming from its home country. “Having said that,” he continued, “we are always looking for more ways that we can help our country. We know that Apple could only exist in the US.” Asked by another shareholder if Apple would lobby in favour of net neutrality — an Obama administration policy that incoming FCC chairman Ajit Pai has called “a mistake” — Mr Cook replied: “If net neutrality became a top thing, yes we would definitely engage in it… We think people’s content should be treated the same. There shouldn’t be an unfair advantage for one group over the other.” Despite taking a forceful position on issues ranging from encryption to human rights, Mr Cook insisted: “We are not the big lobbying company.” Pacing up and down the stage of its Town Hall at its Infinite Loop headquarters with his hands in his the pockets of his, jeans, he said: “We don’t like politics. We are sort of averse… We do know that playing a role in policy discussion sis good and very important for us to play. We stay out of politics but into policy.” Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.

As reported in the Apple blogosphere, the music streaming service has begun flexing its "prices vary" prerogative by charging 99 cents for a three-month trial in Australia, Spain and Switzerland. Elsewhere, including the United States, Japan and Germany, the 90-day toe-dip is exactly zero cents. The move by Apple Music, which at last disclosure had "well past" 20 million paid subscribers, could be a trial balloon before instituting a 99 cent price tag to the trials in other markets. Or, as some have speculated, it may be an attempt to recoup some revenue to pay lost royalties during earlier free trials. Either way, it's 33 cent per month. Not bad. In a statement issued to The Verge, Apple simply stated that, "Pricing and promotions for Apple Music vary from country to country." Other on-demand services offering free trials include Amazon Music Unlimited (30 days), Google Play Music (30 days), Tidal (30 days), SoundCloud Go (30 days) and Pandora Premium (60 days).

Casey Staff Writer Tech Media Network (Tom's Guide) May 22, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share The iPhone 7 featured one of my least favorite trends in smartphones (killing the headphone jack), so I've wondered how Apple would irk me next. It appears that ripping the fingerprint reader off the home scree could be the company's next questionable decision.  This image suggests the iPhone 8's fingerprint scanner will be found under the Apple log on its back. Credit: SlashleaksMore This image suggests the iPhone 8's fingerprint scanner will be found under the Apple log on its back. Credit: Slashleaks A recent post on rumor aggregation site Slashleaks shows a schematic of the forthcoming iPhone 8 with its fingerprint sensor below the Apple logo on the phone's back. It's the second post to that site suggesting such a location, and it follows a report from Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri who claimed the sensor would live in the backside. Why would the move be such a bad idea? Personally, I'm not looking forward to my index finger blindly stumbling around the back of a smartphone, trying to find the magic sensor. Arcuri's note claimed that the sensor is moving because Apple is running into trouble with executing the rumored under-the-screen fingerprint reader in time. Such a technology would allow for the whole screen, or possibly a specific region thereof, to fill the role of the handset's existing biometric scanner. MORE: iPhone 8 Rumors: What to Expect from the 10th Anniversary iPhone The sensor is expected to be removed from the front of the phone because the TouchID home button may go the way of the Dodo, much like the Galaxy S8's physical home button did. So while most expect the redesigned handset to eliminate the circular button at its bottom, there is no consensus about where Apple would fill the void of its functionality. What else do we expect from the handset that marks 10-year anniversary of the original iPhone? The vertical oval cut-out for camera sensors seen in this schematic has been seen in most, if not all leaks. The phone could have glass panels on both sides, and is expected to run on a powerful new A11 processor with potential augmented reality support. Further, the high-end models of the handset may start as expensive as $999, and include AirPods.
