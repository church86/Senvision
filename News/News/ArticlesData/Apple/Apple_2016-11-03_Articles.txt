A press release touting Bell Fibe TV as the first Canadian TV service available on Apple TV as an app made us think, for a moment, Bell was untethering its subscription TV service from its network, making the TV service available nationwide to anyone with an Apple TV box. That’s not the case however. While Fibe TV is now available on Apple TV, it’s only for existing or new Bell customers who are also Apple fans, so that they can have their music, photos, games, favourite apps – and TV – all together in one place. Customers who want to use the Fibe TV app still must have the Fibe TV set top box/DVR as their primary gateway to Fibe and then they can use their Apple TV box or boxes as a secondary device with the app, said Nicolas Poitras, vice-president of Bell Residential Service, in an interview. “You need a Fibe TV subscription and right now that requires a Bell Fibe Internet service (with unlimited Internet) and a Bell Fibe TV service, so once you’ve got those two things, you can use Apple TV to access our services,” he explained. “Apple TV will be a great secondary device.” Customers can watch live TV and access on-demand titles through the Fibe app and fourth-generation Apple TV box on any of their Apple smart phones or tablets, too. Before the end of the year, Bell will allow customers to watch shows recorded on the main DVR – with full pause, rewind and fast-forward capabilities. Customers can also use the app to see trending shows, set recordings and some limited Siri functionality (“Siri, find me Big Bang Theory”) is coming, too. However, Bell’s re-start feature, where viewers can join a show already in progress and start over at the beginning, is not yet ready to be used via the app and won’t be until some time in 2017. When asked whether or not Bell considered making a Fibe TV subscription a completely stand alone app in the Apple world available to all Canadians regardless of their broadband provider, which could perhaps pull in more paying customers who are cord-cutters or cord-nevers who watch YouTube, Netflix and other content through their Apple TV and broadband connection only, Poitras said it’s not something customers are asking for, nor is the company ready for. (Ed note: There would be some significant technical, copyright and regulatory hurdles in the way of that, too.) “Apple TV will be a great secondary device.” – Nicolas Poitras, Bell Canada “At this point in time, we feel as though consumers do want a full fledged service,” he added, noting that as long as Fibe TV is being run by Bell on the Bell network, the company can guarantee quality of signal – something it can’t do if the video were just riding over the open internet. Poitras would not comment on how many of its Fibe TV customers they believe have an Apple TV device or if the company is working on an app for other environments such as Roku or PlayStation. “The Apple TV as a box is definitely the most widespread in Canada,” he said. “Its CPU power really allows us to bring the Fibe TV presence to a whole new level. “We think there is a lot we can do with Apple and they’re the partner we are focused on now,” he added. “We think anyone who has an Apple TV will seriously consider Fibe simply because they are avid users of Apple products and use them a lot and if they can expand the amount of content that’s accessible on their box, we think there’s a large number of people who will be interested in that… Apple fans are quite loyal to the brand.” The Fibe app on Apple TV is also only available to Bell customers in Ontario and Quebec and will come to Bell's Atlantic region next eyar.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Shirley Siluk. Updated October 5, 2016 9:47AM SHARE ALSO SEE Yahoo Cybersecurity Privacy Customer Data Government Spying NSA FBI Data Breach Google Facebook Microsoft Apple Top Tech News The revelation that Yahoo might have spied on all of its users' emails on behalf of U.S. intelligence agencies underscores the need for by-default end-to-end encryption for electronic communications, according to privacy advocates. Meanwhile, other tech giants, including Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Apple, have denied receiving such surveillance requests or said they would not comply with such requests. According to yesterday's exclusive report by Reuters, Yahoo developed custom software so it could scan "hundreds of millions" of incoming email messages for specific types of information specified by the National Security Agency (NSA) or the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). It appears to be the first time an Internet service provider has searched such a large number of emails in real time for an intelligence agency, Reuters added, citing "some surveillance experts." Yahoo's initial response to the Reuters report stated only, "Yahoo is a law abiding company, and complies with the laws of the United States." However, in a statement emailed to some news outlets this morning, a spokesperson quoted Yahoo as saying, "The article is misleading. We narrowly interpret every government request for user data to minimize disclosure. The mail scanning described in the article does not exist on our systems." Yahoo Response 'Not Terribly Comforting' Yahoo's "meticulously worded" follow-up statement was "not terribly comforting," Julian Sanchez, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute who closely follows "the intersection of privacy, technology and politics" noted in a tweet today. He added in a separate tweet, "What Yahoo could have easily said but didn't: 'We have not conducted such scanning. We produce content only about specific accounts.'" Former NSA contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden, who first revealed the widespread government surveillance of personal email and telephone conversations in a 2013 document leak to the press, also commented on the news on Twitter yesterday. "Heads up: Any major email service not clearly, categorically denying this tomorrow -- without careful phrasing -- is as guilty as Yahoo." In the wake of yesterday's report, other technology companies have sought to distance themselves from Yahoo's alleged compliance with the intelligence surveillance request. "We've never received such a request, but if we did, our response would be simple: 'no way,'" a Google spokesperson told us today. A spokesperson for Facebook told us, "Facebook has never received a request like the one described in these news reports from any government, and if we did we would fight it." Other companies did not immediately respond to our requests for comment. However, BuzzFeed yesterday quoted statements from Apple, Microsoft and Twitter that suggested those companies have not taken actions similar to Yahoo's. "We have never engaged in the secret scanning of email traffic like what has been reported today about Yahoo," a Microsoft spokesperson stated. Twitter's statement said, "We've never received a request like this, and were we to receive it we'd challenge it in a court." "We have never received a request of this type," Apple said via a spokesperson. "If we were to receive one, we would oppose it in court." Apple earlier this year did just that after being ordered by the FBI to write special software to enable the agency to break the security of an iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who with his wife, carried out a shooting in San Bernardino in late 2015 that left 14 people dead. While Apple was fighting that order in court, the FBI eventually found a third party to break into the iPhone and dropped its case against Apple. On the Heels of Massive 2012 Hack If true, yesterday's report about Yahoo would mean yet another major hurdle for the company, which is currently in the process of being acquired by Verizon for $4.83 billion. The first obstacle to that deal emerged in August, when Motherboard reported that a massive data breach in 2012 could have affected hundreds of millions of Yahoo users. Last month, Bob Lord, Yahoo's chief information security officer (CISO), confirmed in a post on the company's Tumblr account that a suspected "state-sponsored actor" in late 2014 might have hacked information connected with at least 500 million user accounts. Noting that the company is working with law enforcement authorities, Lord urged Yahoo users to "promptly" change their passwords and security questions. Lord replaced former Yahoo CISO Alex Stamos, who resigned in June 2015 after Yahoo's own security team discovered the company's secret email scanning software and initially believed it to be connected to a hacking attempt, according to yesterday's Reuters report. Shortly afterward, Stamos joined Facebook as CISO. "When Stamos found out that [Yahoo CEO Marissa] Mayer had authorized the program, he resigned as chief information security officer and told his subordinates that he had been left out of a decision that hurt users' security," Reuters reported, citing comments from three unnamed former employees and a fourth source familiar with the events. "Due to a programming flaw, he told them hackers could have accessed the stored emails." In a commentary in the Guardian yesterday, columnist Trevor Timm, who is also executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, wrote, "The Yahoo story, if borne out, would be the quintessential example of how government-mandated backdoors are dangerous for everyone's security, and why end-to-end encryption needs to be standard on all our communications platforms." "The sweeping warrantless surveillance of millions of Yahoo users' communications described in the Reuters story flies in the face of the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches," Electronic Frontier Foundation attorneys Andrew Crocker and Mark Rumold wrote in a blog post yesterday. They added that Yahoo's secret software "may have, itself, opened up new security vulnerabilities for Yahoo and its users." Late-Breaking Update: Citing a "government official familiar with the matter," the New York Times this afternoon reported that Yahoo had been ordered in 2015 to "search incoming emails for the digital 'signature' of a communications method used by a state-sponsored, foreign terrorist organization." The order was issued to the U.S. Justice Department by a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge, the Times reported.

In the process, it ignored those customers who preferred the smaller iPhone form factor. Then, earlier this year, it fixed that mistake by launching an iPhone SE smartphone that’s as big as the iPhone 5s, but sports iPhone 6s-like hardware. It’s likely that the 4-inch iPhone will not go away as long as there’s a market for it, and Apple may have to release upgraded versions in the coming years. One of the best things Apple could do with the handset is to increase the size of the display without modifying its dimensions. DON’T MISS: The best MacBook Pro alternatives now that Apple ruined everything How would that be possible? Well, Apple’s iPhone 8 series is rumored to ditch the home button, which will be relocated under the display, complete with Touch ID functionality and every other feature associated with it. By removing the physical home button, Apple can go for an all-screen design on its iPhones, and significantly increase display real estate. Bezels would either disappear completely, or they’d be greatly reduced, just like on the Xiaomi Mi Mix to make room for more screen space. Considering Apple’s endeavor to go for a design uniformity across products, it would make sense to see an updated iPhone SE version ship with a slightly larger screen in the same body. On the other hand, the iPhone SE does ship without 3D Touch support, so it’s not a faithful miniaturized version of the iPhone 6s. Costs concerns are likely to blame, as Apple is also looking to make money on the smallest and cheapest iPhone in its lineup. Meanwhile, DBS Designing imagined an iPhone SE concept that features an all-screen design. Sure, the handset they envision comes with absurd specs that will never be part of any iPhone SE upgrade coming in the near future. But what is exciting is the idea of having an all-screen iPhone SE successor in the future. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7Cp2f6-fSxa8oxgBCxcIAA Tags: Apple, iPhone 7, iPhone 8, iPhone SE Via: Concept Phones Source: YouTube Older StoryPrevious Newer StoryNext Trending Best Buy just released a brand new Black Friday ad: Here’s what changed 11 paid iPhone apps on sale for free today The 5 best new features coming to your iPhone in iOS 10.2 Download the new iPhone wallpapers before Apple officially releases them Related Articles Apple believes a touchscreen iMac would make for a horrible user experience How Donald Trump's tax plan might save Apple billions of dollars 11 paid iPhone apps on sale for free today BGR Store Certified Ethical Hacker Bootcamp The Black Friday Mac Bundle 2.0 Pay What You Want: White Hat Hacker 2017 Bundle TrapTap Speed Trap Indicator View Comments Hubs Apple Apple believes a touchscreen iMac would make for a horrible user experience How Donald Trump's tax plan might save Apple billions of dollars Android Leaks suggest next year's OnePlus 4 will be the Android phone to beat 51 brand new emoji may hit your iPhone next year Mobile Leaks suggest next year's OnePlus 4 will be the Android phone to beat It looks like the Galaxy S8 will add one of Apple's core iPhone 7 features Retail Samsung shares Black Friday deals early: TVs, phones, smartwatches and more Best Buy just released a brand new Black Friday ad: Here's what changed FOLLOW BGR Like BGR on Facebook Follow @BGR on Twitter BGR on Google Plus Follow BGR on LinkedIn BGR ON TWITTER Jonathan S.

Apple learned early on that controlling all entire hardware and software was the way to go, but Google seemed content to just work on the software end. Sure, there were a few forgettable Google-branded Nexus phones, but they were far from the best Android handsets. Now Google has decided to dive in head-first and design its own phones, the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. HTC is building the phones, but the design is all Google's. Let's get one thing out of the way first -- Google's Pixel looks like an iPhone. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Apple has sold millions of iPhones, and the design and look are proven hits. But even though it looks like an iPhone and costs the same as the iPhone (starting at $650), there are hardware differences that are worth mentioning. Hardware and specs I've been using the non-XL Pixel for the last few weeks, so my hands-on thoughts will focus on the smaller version. The Pixel is built around a 5-inch AMOLED screen made from Corning Gorilla Glass 4 with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels (441 pixels per inch). It runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor with four gigabytes of RAM and ships with 32gb or 128gb of storage. The sleep/wake button is high on the right edge, but the volume rocker button is also on the right. This put all the buttons comfortably under your thumb (if you're right-handed). The big difference in the Pixel's design is the placement of the fingerprint sensor on the phone's back, which happens to be exactly where my index finger rests when I'm holding the phone. Putting the fingerprint reader on the back isn't really better or worse than the iPhone's front placement -- it's a matter of taste. Because the Pixel chose the back, I have to pick up the phone to unlock it with my finger. I do find I keep my iPhone lying on my desk, so I am able to just touch my finger to the reader without picking up the phone to check a message or text. The body is made of aluminum, but the top third of the phone's backside is also glass. The main camera has a 12-megapixel sensor and an f/2.0 lens. The front camera has an 8-megapixel sensor with an f/2.4 lens. The camera is top-notch. The Pixel is on par with Apple's iPhone 7 or Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge. I can't say enough nice things about the camera on the Pixel. I also love invoking the camera app by a quick double flip of the phone or double tapping the sleep/wake button. Google also includes unlimited cloud storage for all photos and videos taken with the Pixel. The charger is USB-C, which seems to be where the world is headed (except for iPhones). The Pixel's USB-C port uses the faster USB 3.0, which means much faster transfers. According to Google, 15 minutes of USB-C charging from the included 18-watt power supply will provide seven hours of power. The Pixel's physical dimensions are 5.6 inches x 2.7 inches x 0.2 inches, and it weighs 5.04 ounces. It's about a quarter of an inch longer than my iPhone 6s. The 2,770 mAh battery easily lasted a day for my use. You'll find the usual radios -- 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 along with NFC. There are a few features you won't find on the Pixel, including water resistance and stereo speakers (there's just one). There is no slot for adding storage, and the Pixel does not have wireless charging. Android in all its glory You may have used Android phones before, but you really haven't used Android as Google intended. Different wireless carriers and phone manufacturers put their own software on top of Android, often cluttering up the landscape. The Pixel runs pure, unadulterated Android 7.1, and it's the only phone to feature Google's new Assistant. Simply say "OK, Google," and you'll invoke the Google Assistant, which will answer questions, manage tasks, find photos, entertain you and help you stay on schedule. I think Google's Assistant is much better than Apple's Siri. You can have an actual conversation with Assistant. I asked the Assistant how to get to Klyde Warren Park in Dallas, and the directions from my location were displayed on a Google map. Then I asked, "When was it built?" and the Assistant brought up an article about the park and when it was built. Very cool. There are some other Android tweaks you'll notice. I had to look up the way you call up the app list on the Pixel. With other Android phones, you'll have an icon to bring up all the apps. On the Pixel, you swipe up from the bottom of the screen to bring up the apps. The apps are also pretty uniform in their appearance. All the included app icons are round. Third-party apps still can be shaped differently, but I like the round look. Overall the phone was very snappy and responsive. Conclusions I'm really happy Google has decided to get into the phone game. The company has the most popular operating system, and it's about time it designed its own hardware to take advantage of it. I'm a longtime iPhone user, so I'm a sucker for the design. I'm still on the fence about the fingerprint sensor placement. There is a lot to like about the Pixel and Pixel XL. I realize this isn't an in-depth review, but there are plenty of places online to find those. The Pixel is a hit with me, and it joins the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy 7 phones in the top tier of handsets. I can't wait to see what Google does with the next version of the Pixel The Pixel costs $649 and the XL costs $769 for the 32gb model. Add $100 to each to increase the storage to 128gb. They are available from Google, Verizon stores or Best Buy. You might see commercials or websites that say the Pixel is a Verizon exclusive, but that's just for sales. If you buy the Pixel through Google, it's unlocked for use on any carrier. Thanks to Verizon for the review phone. Google Pixel Pros: Looks like an iPhone, solid build, pure Android experience, great camera. Cons: Not water-resistant, no external storage. Bottom line: Great handsets that really allow Android to shine.

Cue cashed in 335,000 Apple shares at an average price of $111.86, netting himself $37,473,100. Cue's windfall follows the September vesting of 525,000 restricted stock units, which were worth approximately $59.6 million at the time. The shares represented the final 75 percent of the 100,000 restricted stock units Cue was awarded in November of 2011, which became 700,000 RSU's after Apple's 7-for-1 split in 2014. The first 25 percent of Cue's RSUs vested two years ago, on September 21, 2014. Cue put his full September award of 268,695 shares after taxes into a family trust, which is also what he has done with the 335,000 shares that were cashed in this week. Following the transaction, Eddy Cue continues to hold 1,464 shares of Apple stock. Apple SVP of hardware engineering Dan Riccio has also cashed in 33,323 shares worth between $110.09 and $110.90, netting 3,677,115.

Ronald James Powell, Ph.D, was both appointed and sworn in during Friday’s meeting, his role as a provisional board member beginning immediately. Powell has taken the place of Lawrence, who resigned late September, saying she would be moving out of Apple Valley to be closer to family. Last month, the Board of Trustees announced that, in lieu of holding a special election, it would make an appointment to fill a vacant position on the board, in accordance to state education code. Powell, a retired educator, has 41 years of experience in public education, AVUSD officials said. He was selected out of nine qualified candidates who each completed an application packet and were interviewed during public session at the special meeting Friday. AVUSD officials said Powell's provisional appointment shall become an effective appointment unless a petition calling for a special election with a sufficient number of signatures is filed in the office of the San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools within 30 days. Powell will hold office until the next regularly scheduled election for district board members in 2018.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 4, 2016 at 5:45PM When Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced its latest 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro computers, there were some potential buyers who were completely put off by the prices. The base model of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar runs $1,799, and the base 15-inch MacBook Pro runs a cool $2,399. Apple's new MacBook Pro computers. Image source: Apple.  These are clearly high-priced, premium systems. However, there's a difference between an overpriced product and an expensive one. The former is a product that doesn't deliver the value that its price tag suggests, while the latter is simply a product with a high price. And the latest MacBook Pro computers, although expensive, are not really overpriced.  Head-to-head: Spectre x360 vs. 13-inch MacBook Pro To give you a sense of the value offered by the 13-inch MacBook Pro (with Touch Bar), I'll compare it with HP's (NYSE:HPQ) premium Windows-based Spectre x360 laptop. (A similar comparison should be possible for the 15-inch MacBook Pro and a suitable Windows-based alternative.) The latter has gotten very good reviews, with Laptop Magazine calling it "the convertible laptop to beat." In the table below, I've put the specifications of a "maxed-out" Spectre x360 side by side with a similarly configured 13-inch MacBook Pro, pulled from HP's and Apple's respective websites -- and for some of the MacBook Pro details, AnandTech:   Spectre x360  13-inch MacBook Pro w/Touch Bar  Processor Core i7-7500U Core i7-6567U Graphics Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel Iris Graphics 550 Display 1920 x 1080 IPS, touch-enabled 2560 x 1600 IPS, non-touch Memory 16GB LPDDR3-1600 16GB LPDDR3-2133 Storage 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD 512GB PCIe-based SSD Expansion ports 2x USB Type-C, 1 USB 3.1 Gen 1, 1 headphone/microphone combo 4x Thunderbolt 3 ports Wireless connectivity 802.11ac (2x2) and Bluetooth 4.0 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2 Trackpad HP Imagepad Force Touch trackpad Battery capacity 57.8 Wh 49.2 Wh Weight 2.85 lbs 3.02 lbs Price (as configured) $1,299 $2,499 Source: HP, Apple, AnandTech. There's no beating around the bush -- the HP system is about half as expensive as the MacBook Pro system. However, if we walk through each of these specifications and closely compare the two systems, it becomes clear that, at the very least, the premium that Apple charges is directly related to component costs. Let's do just that. The tricky processor comparison First, let's look at the processor and graphics technologies in each system. Although the Apple system uses an older sixth-generation Core processor while the HP uses a newer seventh-generation Core processor, the chip inside of the MacBook is faster. The processor architectures of the i7-7500U and i7-6567U are identical, meaning that, at a given frequency, these two chips will perform the same. The main advantage of the seventh-generation Core processors is that they are built on a newer version of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) 14-nanometer process, which should allow the seventh-generation Core processors to run at higher speeds than the sixth-generation Core processors, all else being equal. The 6567U has two processor cores that run at 3.3GHz base and can turbo to 3.6GHz. The 7500U has two processor cores that run at 2.7GHz, but can turbo to 3.5GHz. It's likely, then, that in CPU tasks, it's a wash between these two. In terms of graphics architecture, once again, the sixth-generation Core and seventh-generation Core processors are virtually the same. However, the chip inside of the MacBook Pro uses Intel's higher-performance Iris graphics -- more graphics cores, dedicated eDRAM memory built into the chip package -- so I would expect that in graphics tasks, the MacBook Pro chip will have a clear edge in graphics tasks over the chip inside of the Spectre x360. The trade-off that Apple is likely making by using a chip with Iris graphics is that it's certainly more expensive to manufacture than a similar chip without Iris graphics. The size of the main processor is larger, and the Iris parts include a fairly large on-package memory manufactured in Intel's 22-nanometer logic process.  Intel almost certainly charges more for chips that cost more to make, adding to Apple's bill-of-materials costs relative to HP's.  The display comparison Moving beyond the processor, the HP system has a 1920-by-1080 resolution IPS display, while the MacBook Pro has a higher resolution 2560-by-1600 resolution IPS display. The display on the MacBook should be sharper. The comparison doesn't end there, though. The display on the MacBook Pro supports the much wider DCI-P3 color gamut, while tests performed by NotebookCheck show that the display on the HP fails to fully cover even the narrower sRGB color gamut. Finally, per NotebookCheck, the average brightness of the display found on the Spectre x360 is 318.6 nits. The site found the average brightness on the new 13-inch MacBook Pro display to be 563.6 nits. Apple's machine has a sharper, brighter, and more colorful display. HP's, on the other hand, supports touch input while Apple's doesn't.  Comparing everything else As far as memory and storage go, both have 16GB of LPDDR3 memory and 512GB of storage. However, it's worth pointing out that the MacBook Pro, as configured, uses faster 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory while the Spectre uses slower 1600MHz LPDDR3. 9to5Mac also points out, citing Computer World, that the new MacBook Pro systems are around "two years ahead of most of its competition" in terms of solid-state drive speeds. The MacBook Pro is slightly heavier, but they're both in roughly the same weight class. The Apple system uses a Force Touch trackpad, while HP's system uses what it dubs an HP Imagepad. And finally, the MacBook includes an OLED touch bar with Touch ID support, while HP's system doesn't. Distinguishing price from value Apple's new MacBook is clearly an expensive system, but across the board, it appears to offer more features and better performance than the newest Spectre x360 -- a top Windows notebook. This isn't an attempt to disparage HP's Spectre x360 -- it has received extremely positive reviews from many reputable outlets, and is frankly a very attractive Windows-based machine. The point of this comparison is to show that Apple crams in a lot of things here and there that might not individually mean much to potential customers, but ultimately serve to enhance the user experience. Engineering often consists of making smart trade-offs that balance cool features against cost structure. Apple's new MacBook computers traded off price in order to build extremely feature-rich products. HP, on the other hand, did what it could within a system that it could sell for $1,300, which, frankly, is quite high for a consumer Windows-based notebook.  We'll get a better idea of how receptive customers are to Apple's choices vis-a-vis the new MacBook Pro computers when the company reports its financial results in January.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

There are those who have tried to explain and rationalize the gaping holes in Apple’s presentation. Part of Apple’s structuring of the event may have been driven by Intel’s CPU/GPU roadmap. Part of it may have been that Apple executives have been sidetracked by the Apple Car, Campus 2 construction and EU/Ireland affairs. Part of it may have been that they were taken by surprise by both the Microsoft’s Surface Studio design and the warm reaction to it. This might be constructed as some of the case for the defense. The prosecution claims that Apple took too long update all of its Mac lineup. There should have been more periodic updates along the way for each kind of Mac. Leading up to the event, the often cited MacRumors Mac Buying Guide showed that all of the Macs, except the MacBook, have been painfully neglected. The addition of a Touch Pad to the Skylake-based 2016 MacBook Pros wasn’t enough of a broad corporate affirmation to both the mobile and desktop lines. The tagline, “hello again” suggested that Apple would reignite the Mac. It didn’t happen. Neglect and indifference to consumers as well as to technical and creative professionals were cited. Below, I have a list of notable articles for each side of the argument. Then my verdict. Apple’s MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Apple’s Defense 1. Jason Snell presented: “Why 2016 is such a terrible year for the Mac.” He lays out the best defense for Apple by explaining Apple’s situation and the elements of the huge pushback. He’s critical of Apple in parts, but also explains some of Apple’s plight. With respect to Intel’s roadmap: In this case, Apple’s timing appears to have been bad. There’s no way to know for sure, but it seems like Apple decided to dance to its own rhythm, skip an Intel chip generation, and then wait for the good stuff, only to get bitten by slippage in Intel’s schedule. If that’s what happened, it’s hard to blame it on Intel. After all, it was Apple’s gamble. 2. Horace Dediu, in his quintessential analytical style, lays out the business and market forces related to desktop and mobile computing. “Wherefore Art Thou Macintosh.” If the market, the tendencies, the future and all the money are on mobile, it’s going to be hard for Apple not to place all of its attention there. This is a great article. An excerpt: The Mac is thus not treated disparagingly. It deserves and gets respect. It is preserved but with limited responsibilities…. It’s [the Mac] not obsolete but it is a decreasing share of engagement. Alternate ways of doing the jobs it does well with direct input are emerging on the third pivot but they are not yet good enough. The children are still adolescent and making lots of stupid mistakes. There’s still life in the parents…. The Mac is what it is because it’s not alone. It’s part of a family. It is a parent. It strives to be better but will not take the future from its child. 3. Finally, belatedly, the defendant takes the stand. The Independent was later given an interview by Apple SVP Phil Schiller. “Apple’s Philip Schiller talks computers, touchscreens and voice on the new MacBook Pro.” SVP Schiller responds to all the negative outcry about Apple’s deafening silence regarding other Macs. I hope everyone gets a chance to try it for themselves and see how great the MacBook Pro is. It is a really big step forward and an example of how much we continue to invest in the Mac. We love the Mac and are as committed to it, in both desktops and notebooks, as we ever have been. Not everyone will see that mea culpa.  That one sentence in the event itself would have saved the day.  Now, on to Apple’s prosecution on page 2.

I should have left reading this until Monday. I looked at that Surface Studio machine ad. That is a pretty slick looking piece of equipment. I am also starting to hear good things about Win10 (but it is still WINDOWS ) I then went to the Apple site and priced out a loaded 2016 MBP. (Warning, I live in Canada). Damn near had a heart attack! Almost $6000.00. That does not even include a monitor and the necessary converters to attach all my external drives and other devices. It is extremely unlikely that there is one of these in my future. I will make my existing 15″ rMBP last as long as possible. If Apple is determined to exit the PC business (in spite of their protestations to the contrary), then the least they could do is license macOS. That is the main reason I use Apple PCs in the first place. I can wait for a while, but when I am ready for a new machine, I will be evaluating very carefully if it is worthwhile to remain in the Apple ecosystem. November 4, 2016 at 5:48 EST PM Albatrossflyer November 4, 2016 Until people stop buying iPhones because Apple won’t provide the MacBook Pros, iMacs, & Mac Pros they want, Apple won’t give a damn what you think about their computer lineup. November 4, 2016 at 7:03 EST PM TT November 4, 2016 Maybe Siri will get smart enough to tell Apple engineers how to…fix their Mac lineup. November 4, 2016 at 10:14 EST PM MarcusNewton November 5, 2016 With my 20/20 hindsight, I think Apple should have released a spec-bumped MacBook Pro back in July with Skylake processors, and waited until June 2017 to release the touch-bar MacBook Pro with Kaby Lake processors. This would have allowed Apple to shift the blame squarely on Intel for a delayed redesign, instead of releasing a compromised MacBook Pro this month. One article I read this week said that this new MacBook Pro is not a continuation of that Pro line we are use to (the 2012 line), but it is instead the “full” version of the 12″ MacBook. Based on everything I have read this week I have to sadly agree. I have also seen people now referring to it as MacBook Amateur. I remember when I bought the original iMac, everything necessary was already in the box; including a phone cable so I could connect the modem to the wall outlet. I love the Ad that Jeff Goldblum did for the iMac where he was explaining the 3 steps to get an iMac on the Internet and there was no step 3. One of the main reasons I have so strongly advocated Apple products to friends and family is that I knew that just about everything they would need would be mostly likely included and well thought out with whatever they bought with Apple. With the new MacBook Pro I feel like Apple has set its users adrift into a sea of adapters, cables, dongles, and hubs with little regard as to how that affects the overall Mac experience. Especially, after Amazon revealed how many counterfeit and bogus cables where being sold on its site. Playing Russian roulette with 3rd-party cables and adapters is hardly a positive and consistent user experience. With that said, I am happy about Thunderbolt 3 finally emerging. I love the idea of being able to run two 5K monitors from a single cable while also charging a laptop. However, that is the only thing I need Thunderbolt 3 for. All of my current devices: the audio interfaces, external hard drives, graphics tablets, scanner, and printer, all max out at USB 3 speeds. I am not going to update my $300 Yamaha audio interface just so I can use a USB-C cable; there is literally no improvement. Finally, Apple not supporting 4K on the Apple TV is making me move away from it. I saved up my money and bought a 65″ Samsung 4K SUHD TV with HDR (the KS8000). It is amazing. The TV has Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Now apps built right in. Streaming 4K shows off of Netflix like Daredevil, Narcos, and Marco Polo is breathtakingly good. The only reason I have even turned on my Apple TV in the last three weeks was to watch the “hello, again” keynote. I can shoot 4K video on my iPhone, edit the 4K footage in both iMovie and Final Cut Pro on either my iPad Pro or MacBook Pro, but I cannot play it at 4K on my Apple TV. November 5, 2016 at 12:24 EST AM shameermulji November 5, 2016 “Observers have noted that Tim Cook’s presentation seemed strained, not as well rehearsed, and invoked what seems to be filler material at the outset. The team seems to have been up late, re-thinking the agenda in light of what Microsoft announced. All the earmarks of failure to execute are there.” In light of no evidence, that’s nothing more than idle speculation. I think Schiller did a stand up job. November 5, 2016 at 3:17 EST AM geoduck November 5, 2016 It has to be said. Tim Cook must go. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. I tried to tell myself that his style was different from Steve Jobs style. Not better or worse just different. That his Apple would be different from the old Apple but the core of what made Apple my favourite company would still be there. But there’s a difference between following a different course and being rudderless. Today’s Apple reminds me a lot of the mid 2000s Microsoft under Balmer. Lots of little pet projects that come and go, but the core systems have stagnated. Apple now worries more about share price, and profit centres more than making great products. That is a philosophical change that starts from the top. The philosophy of Jobs Apple was to make delightful products and profit would follow. The philosophy of Cooks Apple is to chase profit and assume the products will sell. Apple needs another dreamer, someone who knows that these aren’t toasters. Someone that worries more about making the product perfect, than how many pennies he can shave off the cost to get it made. There are people like that out there. The new head of Microsoft is exhibit number 1. Bill Gates choice of Steve Balmer as his replacement showed that the founder of the company is not necessarily the best person to make that choice. It’s time to admit that Steve Jobs choice of Tim Cook was just as misguided. Tim, you had five years, but it isn’t working. You’ve shown that, as talented as you are, you are not the right person for the job. It’s time for Tim to go. November 5, 2016 at 10:12 EST AM Lee Dronick November 5, 2016 Maybe Siri will get smart enough to tell Apple engineers how to…fix their Mac lineup. And fix that horrid iOS Music app November 5, 2016 at 11:38 EST AM JoelS November 5, 2016 Totally agree John, but it is worse than that. It is not just the Mac, there is lame all over at Apple. It is time for Tim Cook to go. It is deja vu all over again and they are playing the part of Microsoft 1999. November 5, 2016 at 11:45 EST AM Lee Dronick November 5, 2016 So who replaces Tim Cook? Certainly Jonny Ive. Elon Musk perhaps. November 5, 2016 at 2:21 EST PM bjeast November 5, 2016 It’s been a long time since there’s been this much criticism about Apple from all quarters. I tried to give Tim cook the benefit of the doubt, but at this point he’s getting perilously close to Ballmer’s reign of error. Yes, the company is still making money. But the Mac is still suffering from neglect. Under his watch, there has been incredibly poor rollouts of the new Maps and Apple Music. Schiller is, amazingly, getting worse at presenting. In fact, this was the worst presentation ever. From the awkward, awkward demos of the touch bar, to the amazingly lame comparison of the new MacBook Pro to an early Apple portable (utterly pointless), the presentation just dragged. It was easily a half an hour or more longer than it needed to be. And yes, I completely agree with everyone who says that the slogan “Hello, Again” was a significant misstep. How anyone could have thought that was a good idea and wouldn’t raise expectations is beyond belief. November 5, 2016 at 4:01 EST PM jeffsz November 5, 2016 There is such a thing as “too much elegance and not enough practicality/value.” I think Apple has crossed over this line with the current crop of MacBooks (I will not call them Pro machines). Thin in a consumer device is nice but really is out of place in a Pro machine. Too thin? Yes. While some are claiming Tim Cook should go, I think his only failing is not having enough balls to stand up to Jone Ive and say, “No! Stop obsessing about thinness!” How about a screen with NO bezel… well, it needs to be thicker. How about some useful legacy ports… well, it needs to be thicker. November 5, 2016 at 5:28 EST PM Jamie November 5, 2016 I hate to admit it, but I agree with the other posters. Tim’s Apple seems to have lost its way. I have no idea who is ultimately responsible, I doubt very much it’s one individual, but I haven’t had thoughts like these about the company since the System 7 days. Something has gotta change. November 5, 2016 at 11:26 EST PM geoduck November 6, 2016 For those that argue that it’s OK because Apple is still making money, I’d like to point out that no matter how Balmer’s Microsoft blundered, it was also profitable. No matter how utterly clueless, leaderless, or feckless Microsoft became, it still made money. November 6, 2016 at 8:29 EST AM archimedes November 6, 2016 I’m not going to join the chorus calling for the head of Messrs. Cook/Schiller/Ive, but I’m puzzled as to why there has been no follow-through on the 2013 Mac Pro, and I agree that “Hello, Again” raised expectations to iMac ’98 level but delivered less of a step forward than Apple’s 2012 Retina MacBook Pro (or the neglected 2013 Mac Pro.) On the other hand, unlike many commenters here, I am a huge fan of the iPad Pro. I rarely use the Microsoft-style smart keyboard, but I use the iPad all the time and find the 12″ form factor to be a definite sweet spot for many uses (sketchbook, music apps, sheet music, reading, video, etc..) Apple doesn’t usually respond directly to competitors, but I would be interested in hearing more from Cupertino about why they think the adjustable drafting table format (e.g. Surface Studio) is a losing idea, and what they think is better for artists, designers and musicians. Personally I find the idea of a large format iOS device to be somewhat appealing.

November 6, 2016 at 8:23 EST PM Scott B in DC November 6, 2016 Before I make my comment: “heads” – sadly there seems to be no editing for TMO comments! May I recommend Grammarly. Even if you just sign up for the free version and add the Safari Extension, it might be enough to help you get past those typing nits! Since it is getting to be all about the apps, the software we use, what is the difference if that software runs on a Mac or a PC. I can get along without Safari since I use Firefox as an alternative. Other than Photos, what other Mac-only software will keep my tied to my Mac? Don’t get me wrong, I was hoping for an excuse to replace by late-2009 27-inch iMac. But I can see keeping this machine as my bridge for iOS (no, I do not use iCloud) and Photos while I get a Surface Studio for everything else. I’ve already ditched a laptop for an iPad Air, why not ditch the Mac if working in a browser, Word, Evernote, and the other programs work closer to how they do on my iPad than on my Mac? November 6, 2016 at 11:53 EST PM brilor November 7, 2016 Developer Marco Ament wrote a well-reasoned piece. See it here: November 7, 2016 at 10:31 EST AM brilor November 7, 2016 Here is the link. November 7, 2016 at 10:32 EST AM wab95 November 7, 2016 John: For a topic like this, it’s hard to know where to begin, so let me begin with a quote from HL Mencken, “For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong”. To illustrate, as a young intern, I had a complicated post-op patient who had had surgery for aesophageal strictures (look it up if you’re curious). During his recovery, he became febrile. We gave him acetaminophen (Tylenol), and did a workup to rule out infection. There was none. Still, he complained of fever. Clearly, in order to break his fever, I’d have to use something stronger than Tylenol, so I gave him a true non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID), ibuprofen. What could be simpler? As expected, his fever broke. And then he began to cough up blood. And bleed. I took no consolation that he was finally afebrile as he was wheeled off to the ICU. It turns out that what the patient had was ‘atelectasis’ or isolated areas of lung collapse that can happen post surgery and can cause fever. The cure for his fever was to make him take deep breaths, and not NSAIDs, which can lead to bleeding, and in this case, made things worse. Who’d have known, right? A more knowledgeable and experienced physician, that’s whom. As an inexperienced intern, I was focussed on the fever and not the whole patient.(I also learnt that New Yorkers have a rich repertoire of words for ‘stupid’, some of them in Yiddish, but I digress). It was a valuable lesson. As an avid Mac user, I realise that the Mac is important, but it’s no longer the core of Apple’s existence, and may not be a vital organ of Apple’s future. Still, it’s tempting to look at Apple, focus on their computer line in isolation and say, ‘Let’s make Apple great again’, on the grounds that the Mac made Apple great in the first place. What could be simpler? The problem with that narrative is that it’s false. Post SJ2, as great as they were, Macs never made Apple great. Rather, that was mobile. The so-called halo effect meant that expanded Mac market share was lofted on the wings of the iPhone, and not by the Mac’s own bootstraps. What about fixing Apple by replacing Tim Cook as Apple’s CEO? Okay, with whom? The point above was that, in a complex situation, clear and simple solutions are seldom correct, and may be harmful. What do we know about CEO replacements at Apple? Empirical data on bringing in CEOs from outside Apple indicate a poor outcome, and that was during a simpler time for the industry and for Apple’s product line up, and pre-dated their global expansion. Leadership today requires an experienced and knowledgeable CEO, proficient both in that system and in leveraging those assets into a prosperous future. That can best be achieved through an apprenticed CEO from within. If anyone doubts this, then point to that company that is currently outcompeting Apple across the entire spectrum of products and services, and is beating Apple at being Apple. Apprenticeship takes time, and is doubtless already underway, but would likely be premature today. The industrial context in which Apple compete is characterised by uncertainty. I suggest that that uncertainty is driven by two things: 1) a plateauing of mature technologies, like CPUs and GPUs, in which real world gains are marginal, and; 2) an abundance of potentially new directions driven by emerging technologies, like AI, virtual reality, robotics, and smart devices like wearables and transportation, to name a few. The choice of direction should be driven by one question; what is the company’s goal? Apple have stated that their goal is to unleash human creativity and make the world a better place. However Apple achieve that, they cannot do so but from a position of strength in finances, footprint, growth and mindshare. I posit that the path to that goal is not a retreat to a comfortable past rooted in mature technologies, particularly one based on a false narrative around one product line nestled in simpler time that no longer exists. Apple, like all living things with a hope of a future, have to adapt and evolve. Finally, regarding the criticism that Apple have squandered precious time on abortive research and development, like the Apple Car, progress from R&D is not, nor has ever been, linear. Furthermore, R&D among integrated technologies has carry-over benefits into related areas even if a specific project is aborted. NASA tech is rife with examples. One can imagine Apple’s car R&D leading to benefits in software, secure systems, robotics, AI, and a host of smart devices, to name just a few. However, such progress is inapparent until Apple invest this in new products, which too are likely under development. The point is that, in an environment of evolving complexity, such as the tech industry, adaptation is essential, but the direction of that adaptation will come at a cost, and if poorly selected, can lead to extinction. The clearest, simplest solution is seldom the right one. A knowledgable and experienced CEO can best shepherd that process, and his/her prescription may, and likely will, run contrary to lay expectations. Further, there is always a lag between environmental change and effective adaptation. While it may not be clear in what direction Apple will or should go, a panicked jettison of their leadership, internal cohesion, or simplistic management of the complex interplay between today’s Apple and their increasingly complex environment will not get them there, neither will an over-emphasis on legacy technology that was never responsible for their rise to prominence.

Single sign-on isn’t available to the public yet, but the fact that developers have it means the official release isn’t too far off. Single sign-on shows up in tvOS 10.1 and 10.2 developer betas Single sign-on is a feature that lets Apple TV users enter their cable TV subscription credentials once so they auto-populate in content viewing apps. Apple showed off the feature as part of tvOS 10 earlier this year, but said we’d have to wait for it to show up. As tvOS software updates started rolling out, single sign-on was still missing in action. We finally got a better idea of when it would show up when Apple announced its new TV app a couple weeks ago and said we’d see the new app and single sign-on at the same time before the end of the year. Apple no doubt wants developers to test the feature before hoisting it onto regular users, hence it’s appearance now in the tvOS 10.1 and 10.2 developer betas. Once single sign-on officially available for everyone you can set it up by going to Settings > Accounts > TV Provider on your Apple TV. [Thanks to Mac Rumors for the heads up] Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: Apple TV, beta, single sign-on, tvOS One Comment Add a comment MarcusNewton November 4, 2016 I am really hoping single sign-on works as well as Apple was demonstrated. Trying to activate and manage all the different log-ins for the different apps is cumbersome. I especially have problems with AMC’s app when trying to watch Halt and Catch Fire or The Walking Dead. For me, about 1 out of 3 uses of the AMC app says I haven’t activated my cable subscription and won’t let me watch episodes until I reactivate all over again. So I am definitely looking forward to single sign-on. November 4, 2016 at 9:46 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Apple Cuts Dongle Prices After Users Complain About New MacBook’s Port Shortage Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple Cuts Dongle Prices After Users Complain About New MacBook’s Port Shortage November 4, 2016 5:41 pm EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup dongles for everyone dongles macbook macbook pro apple Apple wants to bring its MacBook Pro users into the future, and has done so by eliminating every port on the latest version of the computer except for two USB-C ports. The problem? Most of the peripherals on the market aren’t USB-C, so that means users will have to travel with a fistful of hubs and dongles. Responding to their complaints, Apple has lowered the price of the dongles that customers will need to plug in all of their other stuff. As users of some smaller Chromebooks and last year’s non-pro MacBooks can tell you, having only one USB-C port to work with is inconvenient, since it’s used both for charging and for plugging things in to the computer. The new MacBook Pro at leasts adds a second port, but that still leaves customers shopping for dongles to plug in things like displays, external hard drives, and even iPhones. Nope, even iPhones don’t come with USB-C cables, and users may mistrust third-party vendors after problems in the market for this type of cable earlier this year. Apparently listening to criticism, Apple has cut prices on some of the adapters that MacBook users will need: CNN reports (warning: auto-play video at that link) that a simple standard USB to USB-C adapter will be sold at less than half price (marked down to $9 from $19) for the rest of the year, and a dongle that converts from USB-C to the previous Thunderbolt standard for external displays went from $49 to $29.

Analyst Tim Long, quoted in the Investor's Business Daily, said Apple's staggering 103.6 percent profit share in Q3 2016 came largely as a result of significant losses posted by rival vendors including LG and HTC, and despite Apple continuing to shift fewer handsets year on year. Based on units alone, Samsung accounted for 21.7 percent of all smartphones sold, with Apple coming in second with a 13.2 percent share. In terms of profits however, Samsung came a distant second to Apple, capturing only a 0.9 percent share.Samsung ceded market share in smartphone shipments to Apple and Chinese vendors in the third quarter because of its Galaxy Note 7 troubles, Long said. He expects further share loss by Samsung in the current quarter. Apple captured over 100% of smartphone industry profits for the first time, thanks in part to Samsung's weaker results, Long said. If accurate, the estimates represent the first time Apple has achieved smartphone industry profits of over 100 percent - an impressive number for a company owning only around 12 percent of the market. According to the same report, Apple managed 90 percent profit share in the same quarter a year ago. However, this year Apple's iPhone 7 numbers were undoubtedly helped by Samsung's hugely damaging Galaxy Note 7 recall and discontinuation, which effectively took the South Korean company out of this year's flagship smartphone race, indicating Apple's profit share is unlikely to be sustained in the long term. Despite the impressive numbers, Apple's recent third quarter financial results reported its first full-year revenue decline for Apple since 2001, although Apple expects to return to revenue growth in the holiday season on the back of sales of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.Related Roundup: iPhone 7 Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit Business - 3 weeks ago< > Embed Galaxy Note 7 Disaster Knocks Billions Off Samsung's Profits 00:54 The Galaxy Note 7 smartphone debacle wiped out more than a third of Samsung Electronics Co.'s quarterly profits, the electronics giant announced Thursday morning in South Korea.

Follow TechnoBuffalo It looks like Apple is listening to its users after all. Just over a week after announcing its new MacBook Pro, Apple has succumbed to the backlash from users and cut prices of its USB-C dongles and even its new 5K and 4K LG monitors. Apple has never been known for throwing users a bone, instead opting to push forward an industry standard that is in its infancy. Yes, USB-C is the future, but cutting every port out, including the still important SD Card slot, is a pretty drastic change. Luckily, the dongle life will be a little less expensive through the end of the year. The price cuts are coming to all USB-C dongles. Its new 5K and 4K displays that use Thunderbolt 3 via USB-C are also getting a price cut. It should be noted that the discount won’t be coming to USB-C charging cables, only dongles. We’ll take any sort of savings from Apple anyway we can get them. Down below are the new prices: USB-C to USB-A: $19 down to $9 Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2: $49 down to $29 USB-C to Lightning (1 meter): $25 down to $15 USB-C to Lightning (2 meters): $35 down to $29 Hub with HDMI, USB and USB-C: $69 down to $49 Hub with VGA, USB, USB-C: $69 down to $49 LG 5K Display: $1,299.95 down to $949.99 LG 4K Display: $699.95 down to $524 Those are some pretty sweet savings. Apple is even discounting the price of third-party USB-C accessories it sells, such as the SanDisk USB-C SD card reader. This move is primarily aimed at satisfying pro user’s complaining about the lack of ports. Apple has no problem pushing forward a new technology before the industry is ready to fully adopt it, but it seems it may have pushed the envelope a little too far this time. It’s nice to Apple admit its error and help out its users for a change.

Fiji Time: 12:42 PM on Tuesday 15 November Home Politics Local Sport World Letters Editorial Nai Lalakai Business Features Classifieds Weather Gallery Archives / Front page / Business Huawei sets target, launches new premium phone Reuters Saturday, November 05, 2016 CHINA'S Huawei Technologies wants to be the world's second-largest maker of smartphones in two years, Richard Yu, chief executive of Huawei's consumer business group, told Reuters on Thursday. Having made its name as a builder of telecommunications networks, Huawei has been active in the consumer devices market for only a few years and is now the third-biggest smartphone maker after Apple Inc and the world leader in the $US400 billion ($F821.8b) market, Samsung Electronics. "When we announced four years ago that we wanted to sell phones, people told us we were crazy. When we said we wanted to sell 100 million phones, they told us we were crazy," Mr Yu said at a launch event in Munich. Huawei on Thursday launched a new premium phone, which will sell for 699 euros apiece. A version developed with Porsche Design will cost 1395 euros ($F2866) The phone has a new artificial intelligence feature: It can learn about its user's habits and automatically put the most frequently used apps in easy reach. Huawei was the world's third-largest smartphone maker in the third quarter with 33.6 million shipped devices, giving it a 9 per cent market share, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. Apple was still well ahead with 45.5 million devices, or a 12 per cent market share. Samsung was the world leader with 75.3 million shipped devices and a market share of 20.1 percent. "We are going to take them (Apple) step-by-step, innovation-by-innovation," Mr Yu said, adding that he expected to improve Huawei's position along with technology shifts. "There will be more opportunities. Artificial intelligence, virtual reality, augmented reality," he said. "It is like driving a car. At every curve or turn, there is an opportunity to overtake the competition." With the new phone, dubbed Mate 9, Mr Yu expects to make a break in European markets such as Germany, France and Great Britain. "In Finland, we are already number one," he said.

ALSO READ Not a great leap forward Commerce ministry bats for local sourcing waiver for Apple Apple's India pie needs local flavour New FDI norms: Apple eligible for 8-year sourcing waiver Local sourcing norms in single-brand retail are being reviewed all over again. The government may cut the mandatory requirement of 30 per cent local sourcing, which any single-brand retailer with more than 51 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) has to comply with, by half. If executed, this would attract multinationals such as Apple, which have stayed away from India due to stringent local sourcing rules. Recently, top government officials deliberated on a proposal to cap sourcing from Indian entities at 15 per cent for single-brand retailers with FDI exceeding 51 per cent. A proposal is also on the table to offset the sourcing norms for domestic use against that for global operations. Among others, the government’s think tank NITI Aayog has backed these proposals. Earlier this year, Apple’s application for setting up stores in India got stuck over the sourcing conditions, and the Cupertino-headquartered firm was told to re-apply. Apple CEO Tim Cook met Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his India visit in May and discussed easing of rules to set up shop in India as well as starting manufacturing in the country. India is a fast-growing consumer market for Apple but the company sought complete exemption from local sourcing for setting up fully-owned stores. This is not the first time when sourcing norms have been tweaked. Soon after allowing 100 per cent FDI in single-brand retail in 2012, the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government had revised the sourcing norms as Swedish furnishing major IKEA had said it would not be able to adhere with the stringent guidelines. After that, the government changed the norms from “mandatory sourcing from local small and medium enterprises” to “mandatory sourcing from India, preferably from MSMEs’’. That helped Ikea go ahead with its investment of Euro 1.5 billion, the largest in the segment so far. Besides Ikea, top brands such as H&M have opted for fully-owned stores in the country. Currently, 100 per cent foreign investment is allowed in single-brand retailing. Up to 49 per cent foreign investment is under the automatic route and the approval from the foreign investment promotion board (FIPB) is required beyond that. The local sourcing norm kicks in when FDI goes beyond 51 per cent. After companies such as Apple, keen to set up shops for iPhones, expressed reservations against these norms, the Modi government allowed companies bringing “state of the art” and “cutting edge” technology to set up stores without local sourcing norms for a period of three years of the opening of the first store. But officials in the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) under the Commerce Ministry are yet to define what is “cutting edge”. While a DIPP-led panel had earlier classified Apple under the cutting edge category, which encouraged the company to apply for India stores, Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) refused to entertain such a classification. It was then that Apple was told to apply again under the new rules. Recently, the US asked India to relax its stringent local sourcing norms in the single-brand retail that has prevented Apple from opening its stores in the country. “The US encouraged India to consider relaxing local sourcing requirements in single brand retail trade. India mentioned recent FDI reforms providing relaxation in local sourcing norms in specific cases,” a joint statement issued by the US and India after the bilateral trade policy forum meeting in New Delhi had said.  Read More On Foreign Direct Investment | Fdi | Apple | Tim Cook | Narendra Modi | Niti Aayog | Msmes | Commerce Ministry | Dipp | Us | Fipb | Single-brand Retail | Economy & Policy | News PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Advertisements New to the stock market?

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple also offering 25% discount on new 4K and 5K LG displays By Cody Lee, Nov 4, 2016 Tweet 2 Comments In addition to discounting USB-C adapters and peripherals, it appears Apple is also offering 25% off the new 4K and 5K LG displays for a limited time. On the company’s website, you can see that both models have seen significant reductions in price with a “special pricing” note. Apple may be done building external displays, but these LG UltraFine monitors are essentially the next best thing. Phil Schiller introduced them on stage during last week’s Mac event, saying Apple teamed up with LG to create these displays specifically for the new MacBook Pro. It seems pretty clear the company is feeling the blowback from the user community, who has criticized the new MacBook Pro for its performance limitations and lack of legacy ports. Earlier today it announced it would be offering discounts on select accessories to help users transition. All of Apple’s discounts are good through the end of the year.

The special promotion, which amounts to a $349 price cut for the $1,299.95 monitor, brings the product’s price under $1,000. The company is also reducing the price on the 4K version from $699.95 to $524. Both products, designed in partnership between Apple and LG, are available on Apple’s online store, with the 4K model available now and the 5K model going on sale next month. Apple’s 5K monitor is now less than $1,000 In addition to these display promotions, Apple is temporarily reducing the cost of its many USB-C adapters now that the new MacBook Pro only contains Thunderbolt 3 ports. In a statement, the company said it recognized that many professionals rely on legacy ports and older devices, and that the price cuts would stay in effect until the end of the year. “We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem,” Apple said. “Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple's USB-C adapters and cables.” - Via: MacRumors - Source: Apple.com More From The Verge A Tribe Called Quest’s new album is tear-jerking, essential protest music Watch Dogs 2 is exactly what the original game should have been MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review: a touch of the future Microsoft is bringing Visual Studio to the Mac Google Play Music gets a total overhaul Mossberg: New MacBook Pro is a fast, slim tweener Now Trending MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review: a touch of the future This NES Classic Edition teardown shows off a simple gaming system Over 300 million AdultFriendFinder accounts have been exposed in a massive breach This Article has a component height of 7.

Share Adjust Comment Print You could use other varieties of apples but I’d stick with tart, firm ones. A scoop of vanilla ice cream would complete this old favourite. The from Bobette and Belle cookbook by Allyson Bobbitt and Sarah Bell. — Mia Stainsby Apple filling: 14 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, sliced 1/4-inch thick 1 tbsp (15 mL) lemon juice 1 1/2 cups (375 mL) granulated sugar 1/2 cup (125 mL) flour 1 3/4 tsps (9 mL) cinnamon 3/4 tsp (4 mL) salt 1/2 cup (125 mL) butter Crumble: 2 1/2 cups (625 mL) all-purpose flour 2 1/3 cups (580 mL) pecans, coarsely chopped 1 cup + 2 tbsps (250 mL + 30 mL) loosely packed brown sugar 1 1/2 tsps (7.5 mL) cinnamon 1/4 tsp (1 mL) salt 2 cups large-flake rolled oats 1 1/2 cups (375 mL) cold, unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch cues Preheat oven to 350 F.

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (26) Post your comment Apple makes USB Type-C adapters cheaper until the end of the year 04 November 2016 Apple caused some controversy last week when it finally unveiled the new MacBook Pro models. None of the three laptops have any other ports aside from Thunderbolt 3 infused USB Type-C connectors and the 3.5mm headset jack. No SD card slot, no HDMI out, nothing like that. While USB Type-C may take over the world in the future, at this point in time you probably need a dongle or two, or three, to actually get some work done on your brand-spankin-new MacBook Pro. Sure, there are many of those around the internet, but what if you want to buy direct from Apple and not have any quality concerns? Well, good news then. The company is responding to the port-related backlash for its new MacBook Pros by cutting the prices of the USB Type-C adapters it sells before the end of the year. Here's the full statement from the company on the matter: We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple's USB-C adapters and cables. If you're wondering how big those price cuts actually are, here are some examples. The USB Type-C to USB Type-A adapter is down to $9 from $19, the Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter is $29 (was $49), the 1m USB Type-C to Lightning cable is $19 (from $25), the same cable but with 2m length now goes for $29 (from $35), and the multiport adapters are selling for $49 instead of $69. Apple is also discounting the third-party USB Type-C peripherals it sells. Take the SanDisk USB Type-C SD card reader - this is now priced at $29, down from $49. All of these things will be available for the new prices both online and in physical Apple stores.

November 4 AAPL: 108.84 -0.99 Apple also offers limited time discounts on new LG UltraFine 5K and 4K displays for MacBook Pro users Jordan Kahn - 1 week ago @JordanKahn Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Following an announcement from Apple today that it would decrease prices of USB-C accessories to help ease the transition to the all USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pro models, it’s also offering discounted pricing on the new LG UltraFine 5K and 4K displays that it introduced to go alongside the new Thunderbolt 3-equipped Macs. The deals get you around 25% off the newly announced displays made for the new MacBook and MacBook Pro models.  The new LG UltraFine 5K display is currently listed on Apple’s website for $974, down from an original listing price of $1299 when Apple first unveiled it at the MacBook Pro unveiling event late last month. The display isn’t yet available to order and is expected to become available sometime in December. A 4K version of the display has been discounted to $524 down from an original $699 list price and is available to order now with a shipping estimate of 5-6 weeks. The 5K display is compatible with and made specifically for Apple’s new MacBook Pros that come equipped with USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports, while the 4K version will work with the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro via USB-C and likely older Thunderbolt 2-equipped Macs with an adapter. The new 13-inch MacBook Pro model is capable of driving one 5K display with a 5120-by-2880 resolution at 60Hz, or two 4K displays with 4096-by-2304 resolution at 60Hz, while the 15-inch model can handle up to two 5K displays and four 4K displays. Earlier today Apple announced it would offer discounted pricing on a number of its own USB-C accessories as well as those it offers from third-parties through both its online and retail stores. Apple said the limited time pricing will last through the end of the year. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « India Plans to become a Global Hub for Cracking Encrypted Smartphones like Apple's iPhone | Main | Samsung's Laughable Quality Extends to Exploding Washing Machines as the U.S. Steps in forcing another Recall » November 04, 2016 Steve Ballmer is Still Haunted by Apple's Fast Lane Change into Smartphones that Devastated Microsoft Back in 2014 Patently Apple posted a report titled "Steve Ballmer Laughs no more at Apple's iPhone Revolution," that really struck a nerve as we looked back to 2007 when conceited Ballmer laughed and belittled Apple for entering the smartphone market. Ballmer stated that there was no chance that the iPhone was going to get any significant market share. No chance. It's a $500 subsidized item. They may make a lot of money. But if you actually take a look at the 1.3 billion phones that get sold, I'd prefer to have our software in 60% or 70% or 80% of them, than I would to have 2% or 3%, which is what Apple might get." I don't think that there's a moment in time that so defines a CEO being out of touch with the heartbeat of the market than that. Just yesterday we learned that Apple sucked the air out of the room when it came to smartphone industry profits in Q3, even though volume-wise they only held 12% of the smartphone market; So much for Ballmer's brilliance even years after his departure from Microsoft.   In 2014, speaking at a Business School in Oxford, U.K., Steve Ballmer admitted that he would re-do the last ten years if he could. We would have a stronger position in the phone market today if I could re-do the last 10 years," he said. The answer, he said, is to pick up and try to catch the next wave."   To this very day, Apple's fast lane change in 2007 still haunts Steve Ballmer who told Bloomberg that his missteps with the smartphone revolution strained his relationship with Bill Gates.   Steve Ballmer told Bloomberg today that his decision to push Microsoft Corp. into the hardware business contributed to the breakdown of his relationship with long-time friend and company co-founder Bill Gates. Ballmer's only regret: not doing it sooner.   "There was a fundamental disagreement about how important it was to be in the hardware business," Ballmer said. "I had pushed Surface. The board had been a little reluctant in supporting it. And then things came to a climax around what to do about the phone business."   Ballmer said the mistake was getting into handsets and tablets too late.   "I would have moved into the hardware business faster and recognized that what we had in the PC, where there was a separation of chips, systems and software, wasn't largely gonna reproduce itself in the mobile world," he said. For more on this read the full Bloomberg report here.   At the end of the day, Ballmer contradicts himself and tries to rewrite history. In the 2007 interview that we quoted at the top of the report, he was clearly boasting about how smart Microsoft was having 60, 70, 80% of the software for phones compared to Apple's lowly 2 or 3% of smartphone hardware.   Now we're to magically believe that he saw the light about getting into hardware at that time. No, no, no you didn't, Mr. Ballmer. You simply forgot what we remember exactly what you said back then, and your revision of history shows us the depth of how this still haunts you to this day; how Steve Jobs and Apple out-smarted you and left your company in the dust.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple has slashed the price of dongles for the MacBook Pro Chris Mills BGR NewsNovember 4, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Facing significant backlash from consumers who faced a $250 dongle bill in order to upgrade to the courageous new MacBook Pro, Apple has cut the price of USB-C adapters across the board. The most necessary adapter, the USB-C to regular USB, has gone from $19 to $9. Even though it's only a drop in the bucket when you're spending upwards of $1,800 on a laptop, the price cut is at least an admission that the future is hard, and courage is expensive. DON'T MISS: Don’t buy the crap T-Mobile (or anyone else) is selling In a statement to the Wall Street Journal, an Apple spokesperson said that "We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem." That's a nice way of saying "Wow, people are mad about this dongle thing." The price cuts are only temporary, and will last until the end of the year. They're applicable on all online orders and those in stores. It's still a surprise that Apple doesn't include any adapters in the box, especially after it threw a Lightning-to-3.5mm jack in with the iPhone 7. That move managed to minimize backlash against the decision to remove the 3.5mm jack, which is arguably a more controversial omission than regular USB ports from the new MacBook Pros. Cutting prices of dongles is probably not going to change many people's decisions about buying a new laptop. MacBook Pro shoppers probably aren't deterred by the extra $20 for an adapter, since they're already paying over the odds for the laptop to begin with. But it's a little bit of a concession to Apple's loyal customers, and gives you the feeling you're being screwed just a little bit less.

November 4 AAPL: 108.84 -0.99 Opinion: From the enthusiast to the general consumer, Apple’s recipe for success has become boring Edoardo Maggio - 1 week ago @northead Opinion Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit [First of all, I would like to say that this is but my very own take, which is not necessarily shared by my colleagues here at 9to5Mac and therefore not an editorial, staff-wise opinion piece. It represents my view and my view only, so try to keep that in mind.] Up until not too long ago, I used to ask myself a simple question: if I were to pick one company — and one company alone — to rely on for all of my “tech needs”, which one would I choose? The answer would come rather swiftly: Apple. As a critic (by nature more than profession) I have always seen the vast majority of products skeptically, but that didn’t take from the fact that the Cupertino giant made what I considered to be the best smartphone, the best tablet, the best computers and even two of the most valid operating systems around, accounting for a sweet, unified and well-connected package that would make me feel like I didn’t have to look outside of it. It was Apple’s dream of ecosystem lock-in, essentially. However, as my view of this universe has got more and more panoramic — especially in the last year of collaboration with the sister site 9to5Google, which has helped me a lot to gain even more direct experience with Apple’s competition — I started to have a feeling that this bubble was somewhat bursting. And this feeling is something I simply haven’t been able to shake, and one that has brought me, like apparently many others, to think that the well-oiled profit machine Apple Inc. may have lost some of its touch, for what concerns the present and, more importantly, the future… Apple has long been one of the giants that, thanks to its focus on hardware, managed to surprise and delight me; before I actually got into tech, I fell in love with iPods, which slowly got me into the magical world of Apple products. I remember vividly the day I unboxed my iPhone 5, and just how much ahead of the rest of the tech world that product was bringing me. From its famous introduction to my own unboxing and the first weeks of use, I just couldn’t believe how much I was loving that little thing. Less than a year later I finally caved in and bought a Retina MacBook Pro, the same machine I’m still typing this very piece on, and again couldn’t help but repeatedly fall in love with my gear — and indeed, if you’re reading this piece right now, Apple’s efforts have played a big part in pushing me towards the lucky place I am in at this point in time. One thing I’m sure of, in fact, is that Apple is still incredibly competent and absolutely fantastic at what it does — say what you say about its products or controversial moves, but there likely is no other company on Earth that has the influence of Apple, and I am actually thankful for their choice of taking the reins and doing things such as eliminating old technologies and springing us towards the future, no matter how inconvenient that transition may be. I do understand the users’ complaints — more on that later — but I also try to fit into Apple’s shoes, and there is a case to be made for doing what they’ve done. I do not take issue with that. Again, looking at their lineup, it still strikes me how a relatively focussed — albeit expanding — portfolio of products still makes it possible to produce such incredible pieces of hardware: the iPhone 7 could still easily be considered the best smartphone around, the iPad Pros are great machines, the new MacBooks have a lot going for them, the 5K iMac’s display still makes my mouth water every time I go to a store and look at it, and hell, I absolutely love my little 6th gen. iPod touch. Apple Store in London’s Covent Garden I see more Apple products around than any other brand’s — living in central London surely helps with this, but there’s no denying that the company’s reach is enviable, to say the least — and I am fairly sure that a good chunk of its customers are extremely happy with their Apple-logoed machines. And yet, after all this sweet talking, I feel like I have to address the main issue highlighted in the title. And that is: Apple is boring. And let me get this straight: Apple isn’t just boring by its own standards, but it’s being trumped by other companies too, big time — and often by names you most certainly wouldn’t expect. A few years ago — two and a half, to be exact — at their annual I/O developer conference, Google announced its new, company-wide design system to rethink not just how the design issue should be tackled within tech, but also how we should actually think of it. Material Design was (and still is) an incredibly ambitious, ongoing project, which for the first time put the search giant into that increasingly important conversation. While watching the keynote, I was simply stunned. I was very hyped when, just twelve months prior to that, Apple was to reinvent its software design with iOS 7, and while Ive’s introduction video became what I deem to be his masterpiece (because yes, of course Ive’s voiceovers are a thing) it was quickly turned into nothingness, kneeling before the scale of Google’s ambition. Indeed, Apple had long been a tech design keystone in both hardware (predominantly) and software (more or less), but seeing what Google was aiming at made Apple’s new software approach seem childish to my eyes. And, beware: I say ‘childish’ not because of its execution — an entirely different matter — but rather in its scope. From that moment on I started reading about this upcoming post-mobile “cross war” between the two behemoths: is Google going to become good at design before Apple nails services? Almost 30 months later, I honestly feel like the answer to that question is yes. Material Design is not perfect, and as Google itself reminds us, it is “never done”, but seeing where the company — and all of its products, starting with Android — was just two years ago and where it is now is, in my opinion, nothing short of incredible. Consistency needs to be addressed, but in this short amount of time the Mountain View firm was capable of doing what many would have thought of as impossible, which is linking the words “Google Design” with “gorgeous”. No, seriously, go take a look. On the other hand, Apple’s services have done wonders for the company, but none of them has had a truly identifiable “wow” moment in my mind. Their biggest investment, Apple Music, has proved to be little more than just another music subscription service, and both iOS 8, 9 and 10 as well as the last three iterations of OS X/macOS have done very little to genuinely impress and enchant me. If anything, the one thing I was excited about — 3D Touch — is the one I have experienced less, as my go-to iOS device does not support it. All in all, each version of the two OSs has mostly looked like a game of very small and incremental catch-ups to me, which I’ve come to realize increasingly more as I noticed that my usage of iOS and macOS was not being drastically altered. Which brings me straight to Apple’s stronghold: products. Remember the question I would ask myself all the time? That question’s changed. Now it’s more like: when was the last time that I was actually thrilled by an Apple product? And, much to my own dismay, the answer is “I don’t know”. It could perhaps be the 2015 12” MacBook, which indeed, for all its shortcomings, had something special to it, but even that would be a choice driven by exclusion rather than absolute, buzz-led certainty. Have you noticed that I haven’t mentioned the Watch even once so far? Such is its ‘forgettability’, in my view. It’s a product that hasn’t caught my attention at launch and that I still don’t see much agitation around for, not even from Apple itself. It doesn’t really make the case for a compelling device, much less an essential one; something that Apple had always strived for. Perhaps at fault, but when the original iPad came out I did think “Yes, I need this” — or at least “I want this”. It was bold, and ambitious, and beautiful, and new. It was so very Apple. But that doesn’t seem to be the case anymore. It particularly struck me when the iPhone 6s came out: somehow, even weeks after the announcement, my Twitter feed was filled with comments regarding that stupid pink color way more than the decidedly more interesting 3D Touch technology. Did Apple fail to communicate its importance? Or had we all rather become so numb not to actually expect anything from Apple given that it was an “s” model? Honestly, I don’t know. What I do know is that whatever magic used to be there has long been absent outside of Cupertino. You know who’s actually making great products? Microsoft. Yes — the same Microsoft we’ve all laughed at because of Internet Explorer or the buggy, crappy versions of Windows running on that fat, plasticky — and now dusty — black laptop somewhere in the corner of your room. Or, well, not exactly the same company, to be fair. Much like Google, 2014 saw a watershed moment for the Redmond mammoth, with the arrival of Satya Nadella and his more or less complete overhaul of the tore-apart, losing and clueless firm Steve Ballmer had left behind him. And oh boy, how much have they changed. But just for the sake of tying it in with Apple, I will simply recall the moment that has caught my attention the most: the iPad Pro introduction, and Apple’s essential bequest of the “Pro” part to Microsoft. “These guys know productivity,” admitted Schiller last year. And it’s sad to say, but it was one of the most memorable moments of Apple’s keynotes in recent years. After all, which product inspired its very creation? Microsoft has also gotten much more aggressive at Apple’s own hardware game, in fact: look at Surface. They may have not cracked it with the first iterations — or, arguably, yet — but the Pro 3 and Pro 4 are fantastic devices. Bold, ambitious, beautiful and new, dare I say. Rings a bell? And they almost certainly didn’t stop there. Look at the Surface Book: it may, again, not be the “ultimate laptop” Microsoft claims, but it certainly is a far more exciting one than Apple’s latest MacBooks. And yes, you guessed it — the Surface Studio is again a more far-reaching and inspiring product than the iMac. Microsoft, it appears, is making a way better Apple-impression than Apple is. It’s now gotten to the point where Microsoft is seemingly addressing those customers that have long prayed at Apple’s altar, and that the company is now neglecting. The MacBook Pro is actually not a “pro” machine, I hear them say. I read that just about over 100 times in 100 slightly different ways — which is striking, to say the least. And bear in mind that all those complaints come from people who have actually used and loved Apple products likely much more than I have, and whose criticisms therefore have much more weight. But yes, even as a “simpler” Apple customer and lover, this saddens me. And as a more seasoned observer, I struggle to see cohesion: Tim Cook said that the iPad Pro eliminated the need for a PC. “No, really, why would you buy one?” he said. But then Apple has come out with three new Pro laptops, the simpler of which is remarkably closer to the 12” MacBook than to its more powerful peers. And then the Air has been all but forgotten. Then again, you also have the iPad Pro (two, in fact), with too many overlapping features and price points and not enough uniqueness to make me understand what exactly they want to be. Jobs put the iPad clearly in between the iPhone and the Mac; now everything seems blurry, confused. And this is only one practical example. Ironically, Microsoft’s ideas of a ‘tablet that can also be a laptop’ and a ‘laptop that can also be a tablet’ make much more sense, because at least they run the same (great) operating system, and most of all know what they want to be. I’m not saying that they are necessarily better devices — that still largely depends on your preferences and needs — but trying to look at it just from an external perspective, I see the Surface lineup as the clear pinnacle of the current hardware game. Apple may still be a leader, but they sure aren’t the most forward-pushing innovator they were before. There is no doubt that Apple is still a company in great shape and with a lot of good going on for it. I am still faithful that something around the corner may at least bring some of that excitement back. There are so many uncharted territories for them, like VR, AR, AI-trailed products like Amazon’s Echo or Google Home — and then god only knows what else, even leaving the rumored car out of the picture. But as things are right now, I feel like Apple has, at least partially, lost its way. I don’t understand whether the dissonance between its virtually endless (and growing!) customer base and their business decisions has made it so that enthusiasts simply couldn’t be their main target anymore, but recent products — be it because of their price, compromises or just better alternatives from other OEMs — make me question whether even your average Joe is the ideal one. Next year’s major iPhone redesign could indeed bring some much-needed fresh air to the game, and I very much look forward to that — and I still hope that much more is to come. Innovation and competition are the best thing this industry has to offer, and Apple can’t afford to battle only at the box office. So please, Apple: stay hungry, stay foolish.

Nov 2016, 01:43 MEZ - Deutsche Märkte öffnen in 7 Stunden 17 Minuten Apple is slashing prices on USB-C accessories amid complaints about the new MacBook ProVon Steve Kovach | Business Insider – Fr., 4. Nov 2016 20:15 MEZ Freigeben 0 Twittern 0 Share0 Drucken Firmen: Apple Inc. AKTUELLER KURS Symbol Kurs Veränderung AAPL 105,71 -2,72 (The new MacBook Pro.AP) Apple is slashing prices on accessories that use the new USB-C standard in an effort to ease the transition to the new type of plug it added to the redesigned MacBooks. The price cut is temporary. It starts now and will last through the end of 2016. Many items are heavily discounted, and many third-party accessories will be about 25% cheaper. (See the full list below.) Apple has also cut the prices of the new displays made by LG, which were designed to work with the MacBook Pro. The move comes as Apple faced harsh criticism from the professional community since the company introduced the new MacBook Pro a little over a week ago. Some are frustrated that Apple eliminated ports in the new MacBook Pro like standard USB and the SD card reader that many professionals found useful. The MacBook Pro only has Thunderbolt 3 ports, which are based on the new USB-C standard and used for everything from video output to charging the computer. “We are extremely excited about the new MacBook Pro, which is the best pro notebook we’ve ever made. It has the fastest CPU, graphics, memory, storage and I/O, best display, the innovative Touch Bar and more. MacBook Pro uses the most advanced industry-standard connector, USB-C with Thunderbolt 3, to provide maximum performance, expandability and compatibility," an Apple spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement.  "We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition," the spokesperson added. "We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple's USB-C adapters and cables.” (The new Thunderbolt 3 ports on the MacBook Pro.Steve Kovach/Business Insider) While just about everyone agrees USB-C is the future, we're stuck in a transition period, which means you'll have to use new cables, adapters, or dongles to use your older accessories with the new MacBook Pro. The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern even devoted a whole column to the fact that dongles will be part of our reality as we transition to USB-C on computers and wireless audio on mobile devices. The price cuts for first-party accessories made by Apple will be available at the Apple Store, Apple's online store, and some third-party retailers. You're limited to five first-party accessories at a discount. Third-party accessories will be available at the Apple Store and Apple's online store. You'll be limited to three third-party accessories at a discount. Here's a list of the price cuts: First-party accessories USB-C to USB adapter: from $19 to $9 Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter: from $49 to $29 USB-C to Lightning cable, 1 meter: from $25 to $19 USB-C to Lightning cable, 2 meters: from $35 to $29 USB-C digital AV multiport adapter: from $69 to $49 USB-C VGA multiport adapter: from $69 to $49 Third-party accessories SanDisk Extreme Pro SD UHS-II Card USB-C reader: from $49 to $29 Other third-party USB-C peripherals: about 25% off LG displays LG UltraFine 5K display: from $1,299.95 to $974 LG UltraFine 4K display: from $699.95 to $524 NOW WATCH: Here’s your first look at the ‘Touch Bar’ — the biggest change coming to the MacBook Pro More From Business Insider 5 cheaper and better alternatives to Apple's expensive new MacBook Pros Here's why Apple kept the headphone jack in the new MacBook, but not the new iPhone Apple is testing a different screen technology that would make future MacBook Pros look even better TRADING PLATFORM Jetzt handeln Leistungsstarke Handelsplattform von einem Marktführer.

Depending on the model, the MacBook Pro features to two to four Thunderbolt 3 enabled USB-C ports and a single 3.5mm headphone jack. While USB-C presents several advantages over the old USB-A standard, most people do not own peripherals that connect to a computer via USB-C. As result, for all but the most tech savvy consumer, buying a new MacBook Pro means also buying a number of adapters to make their old peripherals and accessories play nice with Apple’s new top-of-the-line laptop. Given the cost of Apple’s first-party accessories, the cost of an already expensive computer can quickly escalate when one factors in the cost of several dongles. In a surprise turn of events, Apple announced today that, effective immediately, it’s reducing the price USB-C adapters it sells through its online U.S. store and retail locations. “We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple’s USB-C adapters and cables.” We’ve reached out to the company if the offer extends to Canadian consumers. We’ll update this article once we hear back from the company. Stay tuned. Update 07/11/16: Apple has started automatically crediting customers who purchased the products prior to the price reduction announcement. 9to5Mac published a screenshot from a reader stating that the company would refund them the difference between the price they paid for a USB-C to Lightning Cable and the new, lower price. MobileSyrup has reached out to Apple for confirmation that the company will be doing the same for buyers in Canada. Given the fact that the deal is already live north of the border, it seems likely. Update 04/11/16: Special pricing for USB-C accessories has launched in Canada. Examples include a Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter for $35 CAD, USB-C to USB adapter $10 and the USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter got $59. Update 04/11/16: Apple just got back to us. The company will reduce the price of the USB-C adapters it sells in Canada. Pricing hasn’t been finalized just yet, but we’ll update this article as soon as the new prices are live on the Apple Store website.

Brad Fortin They’ve already announced that the new MacBook Pro is outselling any previous MacBook Pro, so you’re wrong on that one. Captain Henry Morgan I think people waited out for this model to come out. I am just disappointed that they don’t have card slot. At least give us a microSD slot. thomas nguyen Obviously SD card is old and obsolete, hence why it’s no longer available. If you need to use legacy technology, buy their accessories. beyond How is it old and obsolete if people are still using it today, and it’s widespread in the camera industry. Brad Fortin VGA is also old and obsolete but people are still using it today. Cars that run on leaded fuel are also old and obsolete but people still use them today. Just because something’s obsolete doesn’t mean everyone’s stopped using it. beyond Nice try, SD cards aren’t exactly obsolete. They are still in general use by photographers and nothing has really replaced them yet as the standard storage medium for DSLR images. Brad Fortin CompactFlash is also a contender for photographers, so why should a laptop that includes one not include the other? Also, why do cameras still rely so heavily on external storage? Why can’t cameras have large amount of internal storage like a phone, with a fast wired connection like USB-C and/or a fast wireless connection like 802.11ac? Some would argue that it’s because removable storage allows photographers to quickly unload one set of images to start taking another set but a fast wireless connection could offload those pictures *as they’re being taken* with the internal storage simply being used as a buffer. Continuing to rely on SD cards is just a lazy way for camera manufacturers to not have to invest in better file transfer methods. beyond I don’t know why CompactFlash were not included, maybe because they are too big compared to SD, maybe because they are not as popular, or the fact CF cards have bendable pins making the easy to damage etc etc. The real reason may be that consumer level cameras only include SD card slots, whereas more expensive pro level cameras include both CF and SD card slots. Consumer market always has the greater number of users so that could very well be enough to justify using an SD slot over CF. They are simply more ubiquitous compared to CF. Regardless we have a removable storage medium that serves the same function as film did. Cameras could have internal storage, but how do you know what capacity to include that will satisfy all users? Without a way to increase that storage on the fly, you risk some users running out of space. I suppose you could just make a camera with the largest possible size SSD available and hope its good enough for all users, but then how much is this storage going to increase the product cost? It will cost too much for some users, but then the solution is to create each camera model with different internal storage sizes like Apple does with their phones. But users who can only afford the smaller capacity camera will be restricted by the number of photos they can take before they need to transfer them off the device. And say there was some new wireless technology we could use to transfer images off the camera quickly and easily. Where is the user going to upload them to if they have no receiving device nearby? What if the user is on a backpacking trip? Where do you expect them to offload the images? Or are you just going to tell them tough luck, no more photos for the remainder of your trip. Sure you might say SD cards are also fixed in size and if the user didn’t bring enough with them on a trip they would also run out of space. This is true, but the user removable storage is always the better option because the user can decide for himself what is good enough for their scenario. Starting with an equal amount of storage, one fixed, one removable, the removable one wins because you can increase it by replacing it with something bigger, or add to it (using two or more in tandem). With fixed you can’t do either of those things. And manufacturers aren’t being lazy they are being realistic by using whatever cost effective technology we have that works best today. Brad Fortin “I suppose you could just make a camera with the largest possible size SSD available and hope its good enough for all users, but then how much is this storage going to increase the product cost?” People who complained about Apple “only” including 8 GB or 16 GB would regularly go on about how cheap storage is compared to the rest of the device and that the cost increase would be negligible, so surely that same logic applies to camera companies? “It will cost too much for some users, but then the solution is to create each camera model with different internal storage sizes like Apple does with their phones. But users who can only afford the smaller capacity camera will be restricted by the number of photos they can take before they need to transfer them off the device.” Then do what many Android OEMs are doing: Include enough internal storage for most people to get by and include the option for expandable storage for people who need more. “And say there was some new wireless technology we could use to transfer images off the camera quickly and easily. Where is the user going to upload them to if they have no receiving device nearby? What if the user is on a backpacking trip? Where do you expect them to offload the images? Or are you just going to tell them tough luck, no more photos for the remainder of your trip.” If a good wireless option existed then a market for portable wireless storage would follow. 2 TB laptop drive in a tough enclosure in the backpack, in the spot where you would normally keep all the extra SD cards. “Starting with an equal amount of storage, one fixed, one removable, the removable one wins because you can increase it by replacing it with something bigger, or add to it (using two or more in tandem). With fixed you can’t do either of those things.” Again, external storage is a viable solution. “And manufacturers aren’t being lazy they are being realistic by using whatever cost effective technology we have that works best today.” It is being lazy because better solutions have existed for years. Imagine if Apple or an Android OEM was shipping flagship phones today with only 8 GB of storage and told users “we think keeping all your stuff on an SD card is the best solution, and it’s cost-effective for us”? Heads would roll. beyond What better solutions? You haven’t named one better solution that ‘actually makes sense’ from a user point of view. Your full of assumptions, oh this is going to work if only they included this technology, and that is going to work if they include that technology. Piece of cake right? Wrong. There’s more to a product than just throwing a bunch of technologies together. And you’re totally ignoring that. But keep dreaming, maybe you can fund one of your ideas on KickStarter. And by the way your wireless external hard drive solution is terrible for so many reasons. You can figure them out yourself since you seem to have an answer for everything. Peace, and I’m out. Omar But obsolete literally means something isn’t being used anymore. Selling a laptop for $1000+ with only two or four (of the same) ports – and then selling adapters for other ports – is nothing but a money grab. There’s no way to justify it. Brad Fortin There’s a very simple way to justify it: Having a variety of ports that aren’t used by customers is an incredible waste of internal (and logic board) space, which is at a premium in portable devices. Having a small number of incredibly versatile ports is a much more efficient use of internal space. Omar Nah, a versatile port is one that doesn’t need five different adapters (each sold separately) to do basic functions. And you’re reasoning doesn’t make sense when you consider how Apple decided to use an overly large touchpad. So much for saving space. Brad Fortin What you’re describing is a single-use port, which has no versatility. A versatile port is one that can serve multiple functions, such as charging, data transfer, video output, etc, exactly like Thunderbolt 3 can, and with its 40 Gb/s it can do more things than any other port available, making it the most versatile of any port. My reasoning makes perfect sense: With a smaller trackpad the palm rest area is wasted by not having a function. With a larger trackpad, like on the new MacBooks Pro, more of the surface area can be functional, thus making more efficient use of the space. You don’t seem to understand that the interior and exterior of the device will be optimized in different ways, betraying a certain level of ignorance on your part. thomas nguyen well read the rest of the comment trail, as you can tell, this is a sarcastic response to the one I replied with. Brad Fortin They looked at the usage stats of the SD card and not enough people used it for them to consider keeping it around worthwhile. mwahahahaha No. They looked at the profit they would make by excluding user expandable memory and based their decision on that. Brad Fortin You clearly have no idea how Apple operates. beyond Hahahaha good one! Apple operates for one sole purpose – profit. Brad Fortin You’re really showing your ignorance. beyond Personal attack aside, care to enlighten us? Brad Fortin Time for a brief history lesson: Apple used to operate solely for profit, those were the Sculley, Spindler, and Amelio years. Once Jobs returned as CEO he realized that operating solely for profit was a terrible idea and would always result in the kind of mess Apple found itself in in the mid-90’s. So instead he decided to focus on great products that people actually wanted, and soon after realized that people were much more willing to pay for great products with decent margin than terrible products with huge margins or decent products with terrible margins. In many interviews over the years he stated it pretty simply: Build great products people are willing to buy and the profits will follow, without any need to focus on profits. For nearly 20 years they’ve kept the same 30-40% gross margin and 15-20% net margin (a few points more margin in recent years now that they have enormous economies of scale working in their favour), not focusing on the profits but instead on the products. One of the best ways to focus on the product is to study how they’re used and how they’re expected to perform. To figure out how they’re used most companies would send out surveys or have study groups, but Apple focuses more on usage statistics (that dialog box that pops up during any Apple device setup that asks if you want to send diagnostic info to Apple). In the case of SD card slot, not many people were using it and they could make better use of the space on the logic board so they took it out. If you need any more evidence of just how stringently they study the usage stats, take the fourth-gen AppleTV as an example: As they approached the release date the engineers realized they weren’t going to be able to ship all features in time for launch and had to decide which features to postpone. So, as Apple is wont to do, they looked at the usage stats and they found that only a small number of customers used Bluetooth keyboards. However, they noticed that the number of Bluetooth keyboard users dropped down to almost 0 during WWDC, which meant that the vast majority of Bluetooth keyboard users were developers and leaving that feature out of the launch would have a minimal effect on customers. Now apply that same approach to any other feature that Apple’s ever removed and you’ll see they knew exactly what they were doing and exactly how many people would be affected. Or did you think they just did things at random without any insight? MatroXX It’s still a gimped laptop, and I’m not talking about MacOS. They’re using year old Skylake SOC, should be the 7th gen Kaby Lake intel processors for a “Pro” computer. And memory maxes out at 16GB!? Common. Pro is dead at apple. Brad Fortin The only Kaby Lake chips available are the low-power and ultra-low-power 4.5 W and and 15 W chips, which are only available in dual-core configs. Hardly fitting for a “Pro” computer, don’t you think? Memory maxes out at 16 GB because that’s the maximum amount of LPDDR3 RAM supported by Skylake, LPDDR4 RAM isn’t supported by Skylake, and Kaby Lake also maxes out at 16 GB of LPDDR4 RAM. The only way to get 32 GB of RAM is to use desktop RAM, but then you go from 10 hours of battery life to 2 hours of battery life, and if you’re going to be tethered to a wall due to poor battery life you might as well get a portable desktop. Have you seriously done no research on this? BetelgeuseOrion have you done any research? the MBP13 comes with a pitiful i5 6360U dual core cpu, running at 2.0GHz for $1900, hardly fitting for a “Pro” computer Go to CPU website ark (dot) intel (dot) com you will see the i5-6360U supports 32GB of ram, it can use either DDR4 OR DDR3L but not DDR3. the 1.5v of DDR3 is not supported. it will support 2 memory ch for a max bandwidth of 34.1GB/s Both the 6360u and the i7-7500u is designed for a 15W TDP Envelope so there is no reason why they could use a kabby lake proc in the mbp13 if they used an Intel i7-7500U and DDR4 ram it would use less power and have a longer battery life, less heat, as well as better performance all around. Brad Fortin The i5-6360U supports 32 GB of RAM, but don’t forget to read Intel’s own note: “Dependent on memory type”. As in, not all memory types will be supported up to 32 GB, and in this case the memory type that goes up to 32 GB is desktop-class DDR4, not mobile-class LPDDR3. I guess you forgot to read that part. If they used an i7-7500U and DDR4 RAM they’d be in the same boat as if they used the i5-6360U with DDR4 RAM: It’s desktop RAM, not laptop RAM. Battery life would suffer significantly, and there would be even more outrage that the MacBook Pro went from 10 hours of battery life to 2-3 hours of battery life. “But just make the battery bigger” you might say, but the maximum allowed size for a lithium-ion battery on flights is 100 Wh, which would only increase the battery life to 4-5 hours, which is still less than half that of the previous generation. Not to mention that desktop RAM in a laptop would increase the thermal envelope, requiring bigger and noisier fans, bigger and noisier than the previous generation, which would cause even more outrage. I don’t think you’ve totally thought this through. BetelgeuseOrion lol what are you talking about, desktop ddr4? look at any gaming laptop with DDR4, look at any T series lenovo laptop with a 7th gen cpu and ddr4 ram, the laptop im on right now the MSi GS43VR, they are all using 260pin ddr4 SODIMM laptop ram desktop ddr4 is 288pin and is a hellva lot longer, it wont even fit in ultra books. notebookcheck (dot) net/MSI-GS43VR-6RE-Phantom-Pro-Notebook-Review.172721.0.html look at the first picture with the cover off, notice its laptop ram DDR4 2400MHz, that notebook has the exact same GPU as the top end 15MBP. have you been using macs so long you dont even know what ram looks like anymore? Graham Fluet But why does it need to be a <15W cpu? This is a "Pro" computer, not a netbook wannabe. Brad Fortin The entry-level 13″ Pro is meant to be more of an Air replacement, but it’s still a very capable CPU, the SSD is still blazing fast, the screen is still incredible, and all the rest of the Pro specs are there. Netbooks use the 4.5 W processors, like what’s in the MacBook. Graham Fluet But why do we need an Air replacement? We want a real Pro computer! Brad Fortin That’s what the models with the touch bar are for. The 13″ with Touch Bar goes up to the 28 W i5/i7, and the 15″ with Touch Bar goes up to 45 W i7. BetelgeuseOrion ill need to see actual sales figures for that, just trusting apple in what they say is probably the worst thing you can do, they have been caught lying straight out and lawsuits have resulted. Brad Fortin Alright, wait for the quarterly results. It’s only 3 months away. Also, which “lying straight out” have they been caught in that lawsuits have resulted from? References? FlamesFan89 Order within the next 15 minutes, and we’ll throw in a second adapter (which yer gonna need sucka) for no extra charge! Just pay separate shipping and handling! Operators are standing by to take your order! Laer My thoughts exactly. Brad Fortin Except they’ve already announced that the new MacBook Pro is outselling any previous MacBook Pro, so that assumption is wrong. Bob Loblaw They’re lying to keep their stupid sheeple happy. Brad Fortin The truth hurts so badly that you’re calling them liars? That’s rich. beefmoretti Is there anyone in charge of proofreading at MobilSyrup? Raj Singh Try proofreading your own work whilst criticizing others. beefmoretti There’s a difference between a typo and plain bad grammar. Laer Both reduce readability, so no, there isn’t. Just your wounded ego on the line. Can’t Fix Stupid They don’t own the new Apple typo to USB-C adapters now for $59. beyond Yes we the readers are in charge! Raj Singh They “recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done.” That’s mirthful. Captain Henry Morgan but they don’t give a S because people buying their accessories will only increase their revenues. Raj Singh They want to help you during this time of transition. It’s all about making life easier for you whilst at the same time accelerating growth of this new ecosystem. Captain Henry Morgan I’ll be using a MBP with 15 different adapters. Maybe in few years, I need to check in another luggage just for my MBP accessories that i can use for my business trip. Can’t Fix Stupid That’s called courage. Brad Fortin It’s called putting your money where your mouth is. Mr_Smoosh Too bad they didn’t realize it while they were designing the machine. Guess they have no pros there. Can’t Fix Stupid While Tim Cooks arrogance knows no bounds…this is a rare almost acknowledgement they FD up. But again “help you in your transition of what we decided is best for you” The Apple sheep analogy has been solidified and cemented by this debacle. Scott Blakula that’s courage Bob Loblaw They’ll still be overpriced to sh!t in Canada. Brad Fortin That’s the exchange rate for you. FTR_Part_deux And they got rid of the TOSLINK connection too! I used it for my audio devices, but switched to USB. I’m going back to TOSLINK just because they said no many people use them. tdotpawel The updated prices have been live on Apple’s Canada website for the last few hours already. For example USB-C to USB adapter was $25 before and is now $10 (I also did price match on this in best buy to get it down to $8.50+tax). These prices are good until December 31st, 2016 base on the footer note on apple’s website. Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter – $35.00 (was $59.00) Apple USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter – $59.00 (was $99.00) Apple USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter – $59.00 (was $99.00) Apple USB-C to Lightning Cable, 1m – $25.00 (was $35.00) Apple USB-C to Lightning Cable, 2m – $35.00 (was $49.00) Apple USB-C to USB Adapter – $10.00 (was $25.00) Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Cable, 0.5m – $29.00 (was $39.95) Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Cable, 2m – $59.00 (was $79.95) Belkin USB-A to USB-C Cable (USB 3.1) – $26.00 (was $34.95) Belkin USB-C to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter – $29.00 (was $39.95) Belkin USB-C to USB-C Cable (USB 3.1) – $26.00 (was $34.95) Belkin USB-C to Micro-B Cable (USB 3.1) – $26.00 (was $34.95) Belkin USB-C to VGA Adapter – $33.00 (was $44.95) Belkin USB-C to Mini-B Charge Cable (USB 2.0) – $18.00 (was $24.95) SanDisk Extreme Pro SD UHS-II Card USB-C Reader – $52.00 (was $69.95) LG UltraFine 4K Display – $659.00+tax (was $879.95+tax) LG UltraFine 5K Display – $1274+tax (was $1699.95+tax) samsvoc These prices just goes to show, Apple has been ripping people off. A Digital AV adapter was selling for $99 and lowered to $59. Apple’s still making money with the lower prices. What a Joke. BetelgeuseOrion Look up thunderbolt cable prices on apple’s website, one of the cables was $1200 Brad Fortin You mean the 200-foot Corning optical Thunderbolt cable? Other websites are charging $1500-$1700 for the same cable. Even the cheapest price on Amazon is $1300. It’s not Apple charging an arbitrary amount for the cable, the cable is just that expensive. Maybe do some homework before trying “foul”? The Iceman Cometh Yeah but in fairness they exist to make money. Not offer up garage sale prices because you may think it’s too expensive. You can never really fault a company looking for a healthy profit margin NoWayHosEH Remember this comment when you complain about the big 3 pricing….. a healthy profit is one thing and people understand but gouging is rediculous especially when big corps pay so little in tax on those gouging profits. Brad Fortin Apple’s been making 20% margin on their hardware for years. That they’re dropping the price by up to 40% means they’re willing to sell the adapters with next-to-no-or-negative margin. They’re serious about Thunderbolt 3/USB-C being the future, and they’re putting their money where their mouth is. Brad Fortin Well, there go all the arguments that Apple was doing this as a cash-grab. Of course, people will still obnoxiously complain anyway, even though we’ve been here before with the original iMac going USB-only, ditching optical drives, moving from VGA to DVI to HDMI, moving from FireWire to Thunderbolt, etc. Captain Henry Morgan LOL I love when Brad comes to defend his Apple. Have a good weekend, Brad. Keep it coming!!! Brad Fortin Looks like the whiners have arrived! BetelgeuseOrion a cash grab is just that, you have to pay more for standard functionality. Brad Fortin VGA and SCSI used to be considered “standard functionality” at one point, too. Does that mean all machines that don’t still include those ports are a cash grab? Absolutely not, that’s absurd. BetelgeuseOrion im talking today, current standards, HDMI, Mini Display Port, SDXC, Gigabit Ethernet, USB-A 3.1 all of those are standard in 2016 and all the way to 2020 at the very least, 2020 is probably when the MBP will be updated again. The TRS jack on the MBP (all models) is still there, a design from 1878, want to explain that one? and before you say wireless can supplement gigabit Ethernet, please direct me to at least 1 WAP and 1 WLAN Card that can support 115MB/s throughput stable because that is how much bandwidth i get each and every time i have to copy my rendered videos to my NAS. Brad Fortin Phil Schiller was actually asked about the headphone jack in an interview, the reason they kept it around is (wait for it) they looked at the usage statistics and noticed that a significant number of professionals still use the headphone jack for their work (although only a negligible number of people used the TOSLINK connection previously built into the jack, so they dropped that part). It’s almost as if they take a look at customers’ usage habits and design their products around those usage habits. Would’ve thought? (Smart people, that’s who, as in neither you nor any of the i****s voting on your comments.) Why would I say wireless can supplement gigabit ethernet when they have four Thunderbolt 3 connections, each with 40 times the throughput of gigabit ethernet? That’s a total of 160 times the bandwidth of gigabit ethernet. Clearly Thunderbolt 3 does a better job of replacing gigabit ethernet than wireless. Also, I’m not sure if you’ve noticed, but MacBooks Pro haven’t had gigabit ethernet since 2012. You’re about 4 years late to the “don’t take away my ethernet” bandwagon. The Iceman Cometh Are on you Cooks payroll by any chance? Seems like you can’t brook any opposition to this company and no, the company isn’t fully listening to customers because if they did the SD card port would still be in that Macbook today. Wake up will ya pal! Brad Fortin Wake up, sheeple! thomas nguyen By excluding usb 3.0? Brad Fortin That port’s been around since the original iMac pioneered it back in the 90’s. It’s time to move on. Although I’m sure, for years to come, you’ll still be able to find plenty of Windows machines that still have not only USB 3.0, but also USB 2.0 because OEMs are that incredibly cheap. Probably VGA, too. thomas nguyen Sure, so they remove all the ports that are “legacy” yet here they are sticking to it with the headphone jack that has been around since the mid 1990’s. Why keep anything legacy? The argument is that it is widely used now, so you should not remove it under the guise that it’s “legacy” or “old”. Cameron Davidson Still a cash grab. Just less of one. David Rawlins It’s not the same thing though: If everyone (TV’s, Hard Drives, Mice, Keyboards, Projectors, Printers, Scanners, All the other peripherals that are too numerous for me to bother listing) switched to USB-C today, this instant, you’d still have legacy hardware that many people use and would like to/need to interface with for the next 5-10 years as those pieces of hardware got phased out. 1,2 and 3 year estimates for everyone to be using USB-C are just ridiculous. PC manufactures are already putting USB-C on many of their upper end laptops, which means it will likely make its way to the lower end in the next couple of years. But the BIG difference is that many PC’s will integrate 1 or maybe 2 USB-C ports onto their devices while still retaining ALL the other ports that are most popular today. If Apple had put 2 USB-C ports and left 1 USB-A, LAN, SD Card, and HDMI port on their machine this would have been a non-issue. Designing your laptop so that it will be convenient to use in 5-10 years is just goofy. Brad Fortin But if all OEMs continue to include legacy ports alongside new ports then peripheral manufacturers have little-to-no incentive to move to the new ports. VGA is a perfect example of this: The majority of PC OEMs continued to include VGA support for more than a decade after better alternatives, DVI/HDMI/DisplayPort, became available and as a result many display and projector manufacturers continue to support it to this day despite the existence of much better alternatives. So while companies like Apple are moving on to Thunderbolt 3/USB-C other companies are still supporting a standard that’s approaching 30 years old and has no logical reason for still being around. David Rawlins No… older technology just naturally gets phased out. That’s how it works. USB-C will become a firm standard (eventually) because it’s a better tech. 1 cable can handle Video, Audio, Data and Power (within limits). That’s awesome. It’s a major selling point and certain peripherals will move to it right away. (External hard drives with the data transfer capabilities) Monitors will start adopting it soon I would think as a dual option soon. Much as it was VGA + DVI + HDMI. You’ll likely start seeing USB-C + HDMI. As it becomes more of a standard due to those other two you’ll see peripherals that don’t utilize any of the new benefits eventually move over. But because there’s no major selling point it will take longer. Again, if Apple included a couple of USB-C ports and then kept the rest of the useful ports people would have been much happier. As I said, even if everyone switched over today, you’d still have a ton of legacy hardware that will hang around for 5-10 years that people need to be able to connect to. Dongle dongle dongle. I personally love my MSI Ghost Pro Windows PC. But I’ve seen many many Mac users (including my wife) so disgusted with this move that they’re going to move back over to Windows laptops. That’s a strong indication that that was the wrong move. The above price reduction on all the Apple dongles shows that Apple is aware of it and is trying to mitigate this issue. I personally think it’s too late for that. Too many people are ticked off. I mean people can’t even connect their iPhone 7 to their 2016 MacBook “Pro” without an adapter. lol Brad Fortin A lot of people are upset and threatening to switch to Windows PCs, but Phil Schiller also said in an interview that they’ve received more orders for the new MacBook Pro than for any previous MBP, so there’s people going both ways on this. People can’t connect their iPhone 7 to their MacBook Pro but Apple doesn’t really care because they’ve had iTunes WiFi sync and iCloud syncing for years, and I’m sure they’re well aware of just how few people still connect their phone to their computer. Jo Oh this is getting even funnier by the day Shoey5 It’s a dongle good time! fruvous So much for Apple’s courage to stand up to those cheap consumers. Shoey5 Hey it took Courage to drop the price! The Iceman Cometh If Jobs were around today heads would be rolling off the guillotine because of this ckusterfvck. This has become Apples version of the Samsung Note 7 debacle Brad Fortin This exact thing happened under Steve Jobs, multiple times: When the iMac ditched all legacy ports and went all-in on USB-A, and when the iPod switched from FireWire to 30-pin, and again when they dropped FireWire for Thunderbolt, and again when they dropped the optical drive. How quick people are to forget the past when they want to rage on the internet. The Iceman Cometh The difference was their hardware worked consistently across all platforms be it Mac or iPod. The disjointed nature of the offerings now speaks to a crisis in the company at least within their design teams who seemingly are communicating with each other very well. FlamesFan89 Wait, are you saying that switching from one proprietary port to another is the same as ditching essentially all standard ports? Also, there is a big difference between switching the connector for a single portable device which only has a single connection point, and switching all the ports on a device which is the main hub that you are connecting all other things too. You are essentially trying to say that changing the end of an AC adapter that plugs into random device X, is the equivalent of changing the standard wall socket. Brad Fortin Which of those ports, other than 30-pin, is proprietary? USB is a standard, IEEE 1394 (FireWire) is a standard, and Thunderbolt is a standard. Or are you just complaining about my comparison to the iPod switching from FireWire to 30-pin? FlamesFan89 To be honest, I’ll concede that I was thinking FireWire and Thunderbolt were proprietary, basically because I’ve never really paid much attention to them, and really only ever heard about them except in reference to Apple stuff. I just figured that they were Apple things. I stand corrected. Cameron Davidson So they cut the headphone jack out of your phone, using the BS excuse that it will improve sound quality, and then use the headphone jack for the computer that musicians actually make their music on. Apple logic! Brad Fortin They cut the headphone jack out of the phone to make it easier to waterproof, put in a bigger battery, put in a better haptic engine, put in a better camera, and put in stereo speakers. They never even mentioned audio quality, so why are you making stuff up? They kept the headphone jack on the laptop because of how many professionals still use it for their work (but removed the TOSLINK portion because of how few people used it). Cameron Davidson Except that every other device manages to do this as well as have a headphone jack, so you’re argument is useless. “We are removing the audio jack because we have developed a better way to deliver audio” – Phil Schiller Brad Fortin Every other device? No other device has a haptic engine comparable to the Taptic Engine. All other devices that have a headphone jack could have a larger battery without the jack. Not all devices have stereo speakers. Not all devices have waterproofing. Not all devices have OIS. Competing devices have some of those features, but none of them have all of those features. It’s all about picking which features you’re willing to compromise on. But, again, why are you making up the part about audio quality? Manveer Really, you do realize Sony was the first to make a waterproof phone without covering up the headphone jack? Well apparently, Sony Xperia’s had IP68 three years ago, stereospeakers, the Z2 has a 3200mAh battery with the headphone jack, not to mention high res audio with clear + audio, PS4 remote play, 23 MP G-lens camera, an ultra stamina mode with 1 week usage on standby, and lastly 5 axis stabilization. The Z5P even has 4K screen, with the most premium glass+metal body. So it’s clear who has the most features and who’s copying! Brad Fortin Sony’s first waterproof phone also had flaps covering all the ports, and if any of those flaps broke off (as many of them did) the phone was no longer waterproof. The stereo speakers were always welcome. The Z2 had a 20 MP camera, but the lens was plastic and easy to scratch. Ultra Stamina Mode disabled features that many people would consider essential, like data and WiFi, apps, widgets, etc, and basically reduces functionality to that of a flip phone. And Sony only recently started including OIS in its camera. Simply having a list of features doesn’t make a phone great. This isn’t a list measuring contest. Jason I always find it funny how a company can cut the price of something almost as soon as it comes out, it really shows how much they are making on those Brad Fortin Their typical margin on hardware is 20%, so dropping their prices by that much or more shows they care more about moving to Thunderbolt 3/USB-C as a standard than they do about making a profit from dongles. They’re putting their money where their mouth is. Paul T. On hardware yes. On cables and adapters? Typical markup is 100% if not more. thereasoner Several hundred percent in the case of the most expensive ones I’m thinking. FlamesFan89 So you are of the belief that it costs Apple approximately $30 to make a 1 m USB-C to Lightning cable? Well ok then. The VVolf Why wouldn’t Apple put 2 USB-C and 2 USB 3 ports on it? I have yet to see a single USB-C device around. Also, they removed the SD card, right? So much for catering to photographers. Tim Cooks Apple is a complete and utter joke. He should focus more on making better products and keep out of politics/social issues. Lemmy If you can afford a new MacBook Pro, you can afford to buy peripherals that use USB-C. Me Ted But what if you can’t? I guess that makes your comment a little ridiculous doesn’t it. jay USB C good move. why change no changes on the iphone than? just all in and everyone can plan. make sense? bye bye lightning port and usb a. just one fits all and everyone is happy ok we need to make one change but everything is future proof. headphone jack is a thing i honestly never missed it anymore. but i am not a heavy user dukiebc I remember in the late 90’s when Apple released the first iMac computer. It came with this new port named USB. All my printers were parallel port, and I had nothing that would hook up to it. That soon changed when the mainstream PC’s added USB ports, and the market exploded with USB compatible devices, printers, mice, hubs, disk drives, hard drives, etc. Once again, Apple is on the leading edge of the curve with USB-C. Since this is not a proprietary standard, I am sure the same thing will happen. David Pollock I would love to know what Apple is doing in places where a Mag-Safe power cord is mandatory due to regulations and law. I believe Europe is one such place. Also – no LAN port? I am sorry, but I would be annoyed to the extreme to always have to carry around all of these dongles and adapters. It makes something that is supposed to be portable not so portable any longer. OMFCody Adaptors should have been included in the box, especially considering their brand new iPhone now needs another purchase to become compatible with the brand new Pro.. Until USB C became more common, they very well could have kept a couple spare ports (And the SD slot) around a little longer. If people don’t get by now Apple only cares about your money (soldering on RAM…etc) then you will never learn.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Apple Watch Gets 8MP, 2MP Cameras Posted: Nov 4 2016, 1:04pm CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Apple     This Apple Watch Band Adds 8MP, 2MP Cameras To The Apple Watch Many of us love the Apple Watch but find it a bit weird that Apple has not included any camera. Well for such people, the new Glide CMRA band is something to look out for. Don't Miss: Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals Glide has made an attempt once again to bring another innovative Apple Watch band for us. Its latest addition is a ground-breaking watch band which has two cameras installed in it. There includes a 2MP front facing camera and an 8 MP outward-facing proposition. The most attractive feature of this watch band is that even after the inclusion of two cameras it is has not increased in bulk and size. The watch band also includes a built in button in accessory for activating the cameras. The button is an amazing feature. It carries out its job of snapping pictures perfectly. The integrated button also has a double tap function which allows the user to switch between cameras smoothly. The inclusion of the camera feature calls for a Photos app. This is why the band is integrated with iOS photos. Your captured images are stored immediately and can be viewed without any further hassle. Now taking photographs and the storage system does sound very impressive but the real power lies somewhere else. CMRA shows its supremacy when its ability to record video and host conference style video calls is observed. CMRA can be used by users to talk in real time while they are on the move and even send photos back and forth. The charging of this band is very simple. A custom dual-charging dock will be available to charge the Apple Watch battery and the CMRA band battery simultaneously. Spring 2017 is expected to be the date for hardware shipping. Glide however is accepting pre-orders for this accessory just to get orders way before launch and also to assess the consumer demand for the CMRA.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Phil Schiller Explains Why Apple Dropped The SD Card Reader From The New MacBook Pro 2016 Posted: Nov 4 2016, 1:20pm CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Nov 5 2016, 9:46am CDT, in News | Apple     Here’s Why 2016 MacBook Pro Has No SD Card Slot. Do you ever wonder why Apple chose to drop the SD slot in the new MacBook Pro but retained the 3.5mm headphone jack the company gave up in the iPhone 7. Well here is an answer for your lawful query. Don't Miss: Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals We are very sure that the new MacBook Pro will be successful. The machine is innovative and the inclusion of the revolutionary Touch bar is enough to attract customers. Nevertheless there are some factors such as the removal of the SD slot which cause apprehension. Apple’s Senior Vice President Phill Schiller gave an interview recently and discussed some important details Apple has taken regarding the MacBook Pro 2016. He pointed out the reason behind the removal of the much loved SD card Slot. He also admits that the new MacBook Pro 2016 has caused some controversy not only for the features it has included but for functionality it has missed out on too. According to Phill, there are many fast USB card readers and you can use Compactflash as well as SD. Even though more cameras have SD, Apple chose to let go of it as a part of a trade off. It believes cameras are now moving towards wireless technology so Apple thought to move a step ahead. You can use a physical adapter or go for the wireless option instead. One important question raised by customers is that why has Apple kept the 3.5mm headphone jack which it has passionately removed in the iPhone 7? Phill replied to this that the MacBook is a ‘pro’ machine. Which means in this notebook the 3.55 headphone jack is not just used for connecting headphones. Pro audio gear such as amps and much more is used to connect with it. These answers seem to be satisfying. The MacBook Pro 2016 is certainly a spectacular machine and is doing well so far.

The new MacBook Pro only has USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 ports, so the vast majority of the peripherals people use today will need adapters to work. Someday, all those devices will likely use USB-C, but that day is not today and the Pro users interested in Apple’s new computers have been vocal about the problem. Apple released a statement explaining the price cut: "We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple's USB-C adapters and cables.” It’s a sign that Apple recognizes these dongles are a hassle, and it seems to hope that reducing the prices on them will lessen the pain of this transition. Starting immediately, all of Apple’s USB-C adapters and some of its USB-C cables will have their prices cut by $6 to $20: USB-C to traditional USB adapter from $19 to $9 Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter from $49 to $29 USB-C to Lightning cable (1 meter) from $25 to $19 USB-C to Lightning cable (2 meters) from $35 to $29 Multiport adapter with HDMI, USB, and USB-C from $69 to $49 Multiport adapter with VGA, USB, and USB-C from $69 to $49 Only USB-C charging cables aren’t being discounted. Apple is also cutting prices by around 25 percent on all third-party USB-C peripherals that it sells. SanDisk’s USB-C SD card reader is getting a slightly steeper discount, from $49 to $29. The discounted adapters will be available at Apple’s physical and online stores through the end of the year. It still has no plans to ship adapters in the box with the new MacBook Pro. “We want to help [pros] move to the latest technology.” While it’s never been hard to find cheap USB-C adapters — they’ve always been plentiful on Amazon — these price cuts will still be a big help for early buyers of the MacBook Pro. Apple’s cables, unlike those you might order from a random seller online, are going to be well-made and reliable. With their prices cut lower, it now makes sense to buy from Apple instead of a seller you don’t have experience with. The 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar is already on sale, and reviews have been coming out — including our own — critical of Apple’s decision to use USB-C ports exclusively, effectively mandating that buyers use adapters to get anything connected. Cutting adapter prices doesn’t solve the problem, but it does ease the transition, something that Apple ought to be doing since it’s the one pushing people headfirst into this change in the first place. Perhaps more important to Apple than any individual MacBook Pro review has been the mass of complaints on Twitter and various blogs from the very professionals who are supposed to buy these computers, with people saying that Apple isn’t meeting their needs. On one hand, Apple says that preorders for its new Pros are higher than for any prior MacBook. But on the other, it’s hard to imagine that inconveniences like this — however minor — won’t start to add up.

Photo by James Martin/CNET Those MacBook Pro dongles are now a lot cheaper. Apple on Friday cut the pricing for connectors for its MacBook Pro. The offer will run through the end of the year. Apple also lowered the price of the new LG displays announced last week by 25 percent. The LG UltraFine 5K display, will cost $974 when it becomes available in December, while the LG UltraFine 4K display will cost $524 through the end of the year. The new MacBook Pros, unveiled last week, removed the traditional USB and other ports in favor of USB-C. The move angered many power users and meant that people had to buy dongles to use their old equipment -- or even to plug their iPhone 7s into the new MacBooks. The MacBook Pro update, which also adds a Touch Bar instead of a touchscreen, was the first major design change made by Apple in over four years. Many creative professionals have long favored Macs for work, but Apple's changes to make its devices thinner and lighter by ditching traditional connectors could cause it to lose some customers.

That item previously retailed for $19 but now costs $9. Its priciest connectors, the USB-C VGA multiport adapter and the USB-C digital AV multiport adapter, were cut to $49 from $69. Apple said it will not include USB-C power adapters or the USB-C charge cable in the offer. "We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition," Apple said in a statement.

(Apple) Share Written by Mike Murphy November 04, 2016 Just two weeks after unveiling a new slew of MacBook Pro laptops that only contain USB-C ports, Apple seems to be acknowledging that it may have tried to force its users into the future a little too soon. Today, Apple cut the price of the myriad adapters that it sells, according to Business Insider. Apple’s new computers have been criticized as being user-unfriendly for many of the professionals that use its computers. The old Pro models had an HDMI port, an SD card reader, four (regular) USB ports, a Thunderbolt port, and a MagSafe magnetic charging cable. Now, to hook up a TV screen, download photos from a camera, or connect just about any peripheral device made in the last decade, to the new MacBook Pro, you’ll have to use an adapter that has a USB-C connecter on one end. Apple is cutting the price of some of its adapters by as much as 40%: Apple hasn’t explicitly admitted that it’s lowering adapter prices as a concession to the fact that its $1,500-and-up machines require an inordinate number of accessories to connect to devices that its old laptops connected to without problems. However, it does seem that the company is trying to make the transition to a USB-C (and wireless) life a little easier. Although some disagree: Right now Apple’s full set of MacBook adapters costs $266. This will drop to $184 for the next two months. Not much of an admission. — Mark Gurman (@markgurman) November 4, 2016 And others wonder why some of these cables weren’t just included with the very expensive laptops. There’s recent precedent, too: When Apple released its iPhone 7 smartphones in September without a headphone jack, the company included a tiny adapter in the box so that its customers could still use their regular headphones, even though the new phone didn’t have a 3.5 mm jack built-in. WHY NOT JUST INCLUDE DONGLES IN THE BOX?! I'm over Apple charging $1,600 for a laptop and then nickle and diming us for the cables we need. https://t.co/CeDBdAfJVJ — Geoffrey A. Fowler (@geoffreyfowler) November 4, 2016 Apple wasn’t immediately available to comment on the sudden price drop to Quartz, but told Business Insider in a statement: We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple’s USB-C adapters and cables.

However, that doesn't necessarily hurt Apple. By Conner Forrest | November 4, 2016, 11:20 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/Pinkypills When it comes to the smartphone OS of choice around the world, Google's Android is the clear winner. According to new data from Strategy Analytics, Android commanded an 87.5% market share in Q3 2016, compared to Apple's 12.1% in the same time frame. In a press release announcing the findings, Linda Sui, a director at Strategy Analytics, said that overall smartphone shipments had grown to 375.4 million in Q3 2016. Sui also said in the release that this marked "the smartphone industry's fastest growth rate for a year." Of those total shipments, Android represented 328.6 million units, iOS represented 45.5 million units, and other companies accounted for 1.3 million units. For Android, this counts as 10.3% year-over-year growth, and -5.2% year-over-year growth for Apple. SEE: The state of mobile device security: Android vs. iOS (ZDNet) To explain what the overall market looks like now, Strategy Analytics executive director Neil Mawston said the following in the press release: "Android's gain came at the expense of every major rival platform. Apple iOS lost ground to Android and dipped to 12 percent share worldwide in Q3 2016, due to a lackluster performance in China and Africa. BlackBerry and Microsoft Windows Phone have all but disappeared due to strategic shifts, while Tizen and other emerging platforms softened as a result of limited product portfolios and modest developer support." The drop in Apple's iPhone sales is well-documented. In October 2016, Apple posted its first annual sales decline since 2001, driven in part by three consecutive quarters of falling iPhone sales and revenue.

An App Annie report from July 2016 claimed that, despite having half the number of app downloads as the Google Play Store, Apple's App Store generated twice the revenue. Gartner analyst Tuong Nguyen said that Apple simply has a different strategy than Android when it comes to mobile. Android has a broader approach, while Apple's iOS primarily targets the high-end market, which limits its reach, Nguyen said. "I also don't expect them to move down market in any significant way," Nguyen said. "Looking across their history and portfolio of offerings, they've always differentiated by focusing on the high-end." Focusing on that high-end allows Apple to make more money in the margins, especially when it comes to storage upgrades, Nguyen said. But, that means they need to focus on selling customers on why their product is worth the extra money. Additionally, the Android ecosystem is dealing with its own problems. Woody Oh, a director at Strategy Analytics, said in the press release that Android's lead in the market looks "unassailable," and the software is still attractive, but a host of challenges remain. "The Android platform is getting overcrowded with hundreds of manufacturers, few Android device vendors make profits, and Google's new Pixel range is attacking its own hardware partners that made Android popular in the first place," Oh said in the press release. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Android market share grew to nearly 88% in Q3 2016, according to data from Strategy Analytics. Apple's market share fell down to 12.1% in the same time, leading to the company's first drop in sales since 2001. Still, Apple's App Store makes more money than the Google Play store, despite having half as many downloads. Stay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Mobile Enterprise newsletter.

The MacBook Pro is meant to be a professional notebook, and as most accessories have not yet moved to USB-C, dongles are needed. Apple suggests today that they’ve seen the need for this, and are therefore cutting costs to USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals throughout the Apple Store. “We are extremely excited about the new MacBook Pro, which is the best pro notebook we’ve ever made,” said the statement from Apple. SEE TOO: 5 reasons you should care about Thunderbolt 3 “MacBook Pro uses the most advanced industry-standard connector, USB-C with Thunderbolt 3, to provide maximum performance, expandability, and compatibility.” Apple’s statement comes within days of the first announcement of the MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro features 4x USB-C ports, able to accept power from a power plug, send video out, and transfer data, amongst other things. The problem with 4x USB-C ports is the lack of other sorts of legacy ports. It’s not a problem for everyone, but certainly for those power users that still have devices with older connectors. “We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition,” said Apple. “We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem.” As such, Apple will be “reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals [sold by the company], as well as the prices on Apple’s USB-C adapters and cables.” The date range for this discount in Apple Stores is October 27th, 2016 through December 31st, 2016. After that day, prices return to their normal place. SEE THIS: Pixel cords go “Pro” while MacBook wavers USB-C to USB Adapter ($19) -$10 Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter ($49) -$20 USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter ($69) -$20 USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter ($69)-$20 USB-C to Lightning (1 m) ($25) -$6 USB-C to Lightning (2 m) ($35) -$6 Each other 3rd-party peripheral will have a slight discount depending on the device and the brand. Above you’ll see the price changes as taking place over the next few days. Some users will already see the changes made in the Apple Store online.

November 4 AAPL: 108.84 -0.99 Apple drops USB-C adapter prices after pushback from introducing MacBook Pros without USB-A ports, but not for long Zac Hall - 1 week ago @apollozac MacBook Pro USB-C View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit The Apple community has had a hard time being content with the Mac lately. First it was the feeling that the Mac line including MacBook Pros weren’t being updated as often as, say, iPhones. A redesigned MacBook Pro helps resolve that with at least one member of the Mac family. But the new MacBook Pro goes all in on USB-C and drops legacy ports like standard USB-A, and many Mac users believe this move is too aggressive considering the cost attached to this transition. The good news is that Apple is listening and lowering the price of its USB-C adapters in an effort to ease the USB-A to USB-C transition, but you have to act fast… Apple’s lineup of USB-C accessories is changing in price starting now through December 31 with a few exceptions: USB-C to USB Adapter ($19 → $9) Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter ($49 → $29) USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter ($69 → $49) USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter ($69 → $49) USB-C to Lightning (1 m) ($25 → $19) USB-C Charge Cable (2 m) ($19) USB-C to Lightning (2 m) ($35 → $29) 29W USB-C Power Adapter ($49) 61W USB-C Power Adapter ($69) 87W USB-C Power Adapter ($79) While charging accessories are not dropping in price, Apple is discounting third-party USB-C accessories sold through its retail channels, including SanDisk’s $49 USB-C SD card reader which drops to $29. It’s unclear how this will affect sales for adapters that have been made recently, but I would advise following up with customer service if you’ve made a purchase in the last week or two. [Update: Customers who made recent purchases appear to be receiving emails alerting them to credits.] Apple tells us that this is the reasoning for the change: “We are extremely excited about the new MacBook Pro, which is the best pro notebook we’ve ever made. It has the fastest CPU, graphics, memory, storage and I/O, best display, the innovative Touch Bar and more. MacBook Pro uses the most advanced industry-standard connector, USB-C with Thunderbolt 3, to provide maximum performance, expandability and compatibility. “We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple’s USB-C adapters and cables.” Third-party companies like Anker, Belkin, and others offer USB-C accessories at competitive prices if you’re looking for cheaper alternatives.

 Apple is slashing prices on USB-C accessories amid complaints about the new MacBook Pro Steve Kovach Nov. 4, 2016, 3:15 PM 19,791 facebook linkedin twitter email print The new MacBook Pro.AP Apple is slashing prices on accessories that use the new USB-C standard in an effort to ease the transition to the new type of plug it added to the redesigned MacBooks. The price cut is temporary. It starts now and will last through the end of 2016. Many items are heavily discounted, and many third-party accessories will be about 25% cheaper. (See the full list below.) Apple has also cut the prices of the new displays made by LG, which were designed to work with the MacBook Pro. The move comes as Apple faced harsh criticism from the professional community since the company introduced the new MacBook Pro a little over a week ago. Some are frustrated that Apple eliminated ports in the new MacBook Pro like standard USB and the SD card reader that many professionals found useful. The MacBook Pro only has Thunderbolt 3 ports, which are based on the new USB-C standard and used for everything from video output to charging the computer. “We are extremely excited about the new MacBook Pro, which is the best pro notebook we’ve ever made. It has the fastest CPU, graphics, memory, storage and I/O, best display, the innovative Touch Bar and more. MacBook Pro uses the most advanced industry-standard connector, USB-C with Thunderbolt 3, to provide maximum performance, expandability and compatibility," an Apple spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement.  "We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition," the spokesperson added. "We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple's USB-C adapters and cables.” The new Thunderbolt 3 ports on the MacBook Pro.Steve Kovach/Business Insider While just about everyone agrees USB-C is the future, we're stuck in a transition period, which means you'll have to use new cables, adapters, or dongles to use your older accessories with the new MacBook Pro. The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern even devoted a whole column to the fact that dongles will be part of our reality as we transition to USB-C on computers and wireless audio on mobile devices. The price cuts for first-party accessories made by Apple will be available at the Apple Store, Apple's online store, and some third-party retailers. You're limited to five first-party accessories at a discount. Third-party accessories will be available at the Apple Store and Apple's online store. You'll be limited to three third-party accessories at a discount. Here's a list of the price cuts: First-party accessories USB-C to USB adapter: from $19 to $9 Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter: from $49 to $29 USB-C to Lightning cable, 1 meter: from $25 to $19 USB-C to Lightning cable, 2 meters: from $35 to $29 USB-C digital AV multiport adapter: from $69 to $49 USB-C VGA multiport adapter: from $69 to $49 Third-party accessories SanDisk Extreme Pro SD UHS-II Card USB-C reader: from $49 to $29 Other third-party USB-C peripherals: about 25% off LG displays LG UltraFine 5K display: from $1,299.95 to $974 LG UltraFine 4K display: from $699.95 to $524 SEE ALSO: First impressions of the new MacBook Pro NOW WATCH: Here’s your first look at the ‘Touch Bar’ — the biggest change coming to the MacBook Pro Loading video...

The new MacBook Pro only has USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 ports, so the vast majority of the peripherals people use today will need adapters to work. Someday, all those devices will likely use USB-C, but that day is not today and the Pro users interested in Apple’s new computers have been vocal about the problem. Apple released a statement explaining the price cut: "We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple's USB-C adapters and cables.” It’s a sign that Apple recognizes these dongles are a hassle, and it seems to hope that reducing the prices on them will lessen the pain of this transition. Starting immediately, all of Apple’s USB-C adapters and some of its USB-C cables will have their prices cut by $6 to $20: USB-C to traditional USB adapter from $19 to $9 Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter from $49 to $29 USB-C to Lightning cable (1 meter) from $25 to $19 USB-C to Lightning cable (2 meters) from $35 to $29 Multiport adapter with HDMI, USB, and USB-C from $69 to $49 Multiport adapter with VGA, USB, and USB-C from $69 to $49 Only USB-C charging cables aren’t being discounted. Apple is also cutting prices by around 25 percent on all third-party USB-C peripherals that it sells. SanDisk’s USB-C SD card reader is getting a slightly steeper discount, from $49 to $29. The discounted adapters will be available at Apple’s physical and online stores through the end of the year. It still has no plans to ship adapters in the box with the new MacBook Pro. “We want to help [pros] move to the latest technology.” While it’s never been hard to find cheap USB-C adapters — they’ve always been plentiful on Amazon — these price cuts will still be a big help for early buyers of the MacBook Pro. Apple’s cables, unlike those you might order from a random seller online, are going to be well-made and reliable. With their prices cut lower, it now makes sense to buy from Apple instead of a seller you don’t have experience with. The 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar is already on sale, and reviews have been coming out — including our own — critical of Apple’s decision to use USB-C ports exclusively, effectively mandating that buyers use adapters to get anything connected. Cutting adapter prices doesn’t solve the problem, but it does ease the transition, something that Apple ought to be doing since it’s the one pushing people headfirst into this change in the first place. Perhaps more important to Apple than any individual MacBook Pro review has been the mass of complaints on Twitter and various blogs from the very professionals who are supposed to buy these computers, with people saying that Apple isn’t meeting their needs. On one hand, Apple says that preorders for its new Pros are higher than for any prior MacBook. But on the other, it’s hard to imagine that inconveniences like this — however minor — won’t start to add up.

PT Written by Jim Dalrymple Apple on Friday cut the price on its USB-C adapters in the online store. The company also said that third-party USB-C peripherals in the store would be reduced in price. “We are extremely excited about the new MacBook Pro, which is the best pro notebook we’ve ever made,” Apple said in a statement provided to The Loop. “It has the fastest CPU, graphics, memory, storage and I/O, best display, the innovative Touch Bar and more. MacBook Pro uses the most advanced industry-standard connector, USB-C with Thunderbolt 3, to provide maximum performance, expandability and compatibility. “We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition.

Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple’s USB-C adapters and cables.” It’s obvious that pros looking to move to the new MacBook Pro will have to buy adapters to continue using the same gear. I’m in this position myself if I want to use my pro music gear, so having steep discounts on adapters will save me quite a bit of money. In looking at Apple’s decision to reduce the price of the adapters, I immediately thought of Phil Schiller’s comment in an interview earlier this week. “We care about what they love and what they are worried about. And it’s our job to help people through these changes. We know we made good decisions about what to build into the new MacBook Pro and that the result is the best notebook ever made, but it might not be right for everyone on day one. That’s okay, some people felt that way about the first iMac and that turned out pretty good.” Schiller, and Apple, are taking the transition responsibility seriously. They know there are costs associated with moving to the new MacBook Pro and they are trying to ease that transition. It’s also important to note that new MacBook Pro sales are not suffering, as Schiller pointed out in that interview. “And we are proud to tell you that so far our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before,” said Schiller. “So there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it.” Adapters included in the price reduction include: USB-C to USB Adapter (from $19 to $9); Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter (from $49 to $29); USB-C to Lightning Cable (1m) (from $25 to $19); USB-C to Lightning Cable (2m) (from $35 to $29); USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter (from $69 to $49); USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter (from $69 to $49). The cost of the SanDisk Extreme Pro SD UHS-II Card USB-C Reader will be reduced from $49 to $29, and all other third party USB-C peripherals will also be discounted. Great move on Apple’s part to ease the transition. I’ve been using the 13-inch MacBook Pro for just over a week and love it.

The AirPod is Apple’s premium headphone solution touted as the replacement to its corded predecessor. With a second delay, Apple now finds itself without a native solution to its flagship device; you know, the one it ‘courageously’ dropped the headphone jack on. It’s a conundrum, and it’s especially perplexing coming out of Cupertino. Apple is known for planning and perfecting the ecosystem accompanying its devices yet for the iPhone 7/7 Plus we’re left with third-party solutions and adapters. Do business with 5,000 people TNW NYC is our New York technology event for anyone interested in helping their company grow. Find out more If you’re bummed about the delay, it’s worth noting the headphones are drawing mixed reviews from those lucky enough to cop a pair. So, maybe a third-party solution isn’t such a bad thing. Update: Citing sources familiar with the company’s plans, Apple Insider thinks Apple will hit its end of year target. According to one source, there is “no way these are getting pushed to January.” Inventec expected to achieve 7% on-year revenue growth in 2017 thanks to AirPods orders, says paper on DigiTimes Read next: Roli Blocks modular synthesizer could make anyone a musician AppleTech Share on Facebook (52) Share on Twitter (279) Bryan Clark is a reporter from San Diego, CA.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Remember how Steve Jobs used to say Apple products “just work?” That’s not true anymore. Take, for example, the latest MacBook Pro. What was once a standard feature, sometimes still required by professional users, the SD card slot, is now gone. This, of course, follows Apple’s decision to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7. This isn’t new, of course, Apple has abandoned old technology in the past — floppy drives and disc drives were also abandoned from Apple computers before competitors — but now it’s ditching technology before we’re ready to give it up, and features we still love. It’s not hard to see where Apple is coming from with some of the hardware omissions it has made in the past, but that doesn’t mean we have to agree with it. The world is slowly shifting towards USB-C, for example, and I know Apple is just taking steps to ensure their products are on the cutting edge by removing the SD slot. What is hard to understand, however, is the shift towards these new technologies in such a clumsy way. It’s been a week since Apple’s last event and I thought it was time to pour one out and vent over all the limitations present on Apple’s products. Again, let me repeat that I understand some of its decisions, but others make me scratch my head because they make absolutely no sense. In the end, Apple will be Apple and it will sell millions of units, but it’ll also get ridiculed for some for some of its decisions. Here are the latest features Apple is ditching: MagSafe Apple’s wondrous solution to the crappy computer chargers was MagSafe—an elegant magnetic charger that easily detached from your computer. After two generations, Apple decided to ditch MagSafe and use Thunderbolt 3 via USB-C making it much more plausible to destroying your MacBook by accidentally tripping over your cable. USB-C is neither as simple nor as fun as MagSafe although it offers more functionality. SD Card A videographer or photographer’s primary means of transferring their gigabytes of information (terabytes, even) from their camera to computer is the SD Card. This is the industry standard and everybody uses it. But Apple doesn’t think you use it enough so it decided to eliminate it from the new MacBook Pros. It thinks you’ll use wireless technologies instead. All of those professionals are left out in the cold now and need to figure out a way of integration Apple’s into their new workflow, if they don’t opt for a Windows laptop all together or buy a dongle that just makes matters unnecessarily clunky. 3.5mm Headphone Jack The iPhone 7 did away with the headphone jack. It was frustrating, but less so thanks to the included adapter. It looked like any future products by Apple would also bail on the headphone jack, but that was not the case. For some reason, despite Apple’s move to kill the jack, it’s still present on the new MacBook Pro. Talk about confusing. This decision was quickly embraced by users but it just further cemented Apple’s fragmented of connectors. Your Lightning EarPods won’t work with your MacBooks, and there isn’t a Lightning connector to headphone jack, so this pretty much makes those headphones just a one-trick pony. It begs the question, why did Apple get rid of the headphone jack on the iPhone? Lightning/USB-C There is a great divide between Apple’s products with the different charging methods. Prior to this year, the MagSafe connector justified the boundary – iPhone’s are too thin to support this method, after all. Now, the MacBook Pro charging method has turned to USB-C. Right now, nearly every new product out there – MacBook, Android phones and Windows computers – use that standard. If Apple knew this was coming in the MacBook Pro, why didn’t it just use USB-C on the iPhone? Gee, that would have made too much sense. Instead, you can’t connect your iPhone 7 to your MacBook Pro… unless there’s a Lightning to USB-C cable out there, which you’ll have to buy. Will this ever change? Who knows, but I doubt it. I do know Apple loves its proprietary cables. With the MagSafe gone, the Lightning cable is the lone remaining proprietary cable. We’ll see how long that lasts. Topics #Apple #Apple #iPhone #MacBook Danny Zepeda Danny’s interest in writing began with tech, which influenced his career path in college.

At that time it was reported that India's relationship with the global tech industry had become increasingly fraught. This year alone, the government has banned Facebook's free web service and declined to exempt Apple from local sourcing rules and open its own stores. Now India could force companies to use technology cooked up in a government-funded lab. India's new biometric system is called "Aadhaar' and is being rammed down the throats of all tech companies. If they don't comply, they won't have access to the Indian market. Today India's law enforcement is moving quickly ahead of 'Aadhaar" going into effect and announcing that they'll be purchasing technology from Israeli security firm Cellebrite that will assist them in cracking difficult smartphone security measures and encryption.   The Economic Times of India reports today that "The Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), the country's premier forensic institute located in Gandhinagar, will be buying the technology from Cellebrite" that the FBI used to unlock a terrorist's iPhone in San Bernadino California.   The report quoted a senior FSL official stating that "We are likely to have the technology within a month or so. India will become a global hub for cases where law enforcement is unable to break into phones." The official went on to say that the technology from Cellebrite is the only technology that crack iPhones beyond iOS 8.   India has worked with Cellebrite on several key cases with success and because of that they decided to acquire the tools for their own forensic's lab. With gained experience, they're planning to offer their new capabilities of cracking smartphones to other law enforcement agencies from around the world for a fee.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek Learn the Geeky Details of Any Apple Product, Old and New If you’re a fan of Apple products, but your hardware is limited to what you can afford, then you can still have fun taking a trip through Apple’s product history with Mactracker. RELATED ARTICLE Know Exactly What’s in Your Mac with the System Information Utility Apple Mac hardware is generally a straightforward experience. You may not even know exactly what processor or graphics card is in your system, but you can easily discover this information yourself by using the System Report. On the other hand, maybe you’re fascinated by every spec and detail of your system, and all the others in the Apple ecosystem. Mactracker is a fun, yet detailed application available for macOS and iOS, which tells you everything you need to know about Apple hardware—not just Macs, but iPhones, iPads, iPods, Newtons, and anything else Apple has ever produced. Let’s check out an example and show you what we mean. Ever feel nostalgic and want to see how far you’ve come since that old 13-inch Macbook from 2009? Open up Mactracker and learn all about it. To start, here’s the application’s main screen, showing Apple’s product line sorted by desktops, notebooks, and so on. Like we said, Mactracker covers the gamut from the company’s latest product offerings to the very first Apple computer created. Here’s that MacBook 13-inch model, produced mid-2009. The General tab will give you an overview of the machine’s processor, storage and media options, and keyboard and trackpad information, as well as the current asking price. Software is an important consideration when looking at older model Macs. It’s good to know if it will run the latest version of macOS (this model will not), in case you felt the need to buy one on eBay. Mactracker can also be useful. Wonder how how much RAM the a base model of a specific Mac had, and whether it can be upgraded? Mactracker gives you all that information and even links to RAM upgrade instructions. It also details the machine’s display capabilities, which on this machine means a native resolution of 1280×800 pixels. Not bad, but certainly not Retina-quality. Connections are also important. Newer Macs are eschewing older legacy ports in favor of the newer USB-C standard, but as you can see, this particular MacBook model is brimming with all kinds of ports: Ethernet, FireWire, USB, and more. There’s also a History tab that will give you a basic lowdown on that model. Here, you get an idea of where it fits in the evolution of the MacBook line, and that this configuration was pretty high-end at the time. Finally, the Notes tab lets you jot down any comments you have and provides product links so you can check out any relevant support information. Best of all, if you click the image of the Mac you’re reviewing, it will play that model’s startup sound. That gives you a good idea of the wealth of information Mactracker contains, but it covers far more than just Macs. It’s veritable treasure trove of Apple hardware history. If you’re an Apple collector or enthusiast, then it’s an excellent source of information. Not only does it cover your run-of-the-mill Macs, but all Apple devices and even operating systems. For example, if you’ve ever wanted learn all there is to know about Apple’s early attempts at a PDA, then Mactracker has all there is to know about the Newton MessagePads. Mactracker also has a timeline feature, so you can view Apple’s products by year. Or, you can view all of Apple’s current offerings. What about if you want to see which of Apple’s peripherals have or have had USB ports? That’s easy, just set up a Smart Category and you can define whatever criteria you want. Finally, you can keep your own Apple inventory using the My Models feature. Simply input all the information pertinent to you equipment and you can be your own Mactracker. Once you start exploring and playing around, you’re liable to spend hours checking out all the stuff. Best of all, Mactracker is free and constantly updated. So, whether you have an interest for Mac notebooks, want to learn all there is about every iMac made, or you’re keen to know about Apple’s brief history making dot matrix printers, you will find it all in Mactracker.

Apple’s single sign-on acts as a universal login across a variety of apps, and single-sign on allows a pay TV provider to automatically verify, grant access to, and stream content that is part of a user’s subscription.

This was possible because the majority of other smartphone makers lost money in the period, meaning the industry's profits as a whole were lower than Apple's. This is despite Apple suffering from a slowdown in sales and reported its first fall in annual profits for the first time in 15 years at the end of October.  The analysis from BMO Capital Markets shows that despite its declining fortunes, Apple has seized an extra 13pc share of the profits compared with the same period last year.  (If you're after a deal on its products, find out when Black Friday 2016 is.) One reason for the dramatic shift is Samsung's significant losses following the Galaxy Note 7 debacle, said Tim Long, the analyst with BMO Capital Markets who conducted the research.  At a glance | Smartphones compared Samsung still held second position in terms of smartphone operating profit share with 0.9pc.  The Korean electronics company fared better than Apple in terms of smartphone units sold, with 21.7pc of the market. By comparison, Apple had a 13.3pc and HTC followed with 9.7pc.  According to research from Strategy Analytics, Android devices accounted for 87.5pc of handsets sold during the period, against Apple's 12.1pc. Fears that the smartphone market is drying up will have been somewhat allayed by the fact that global sales of the devices increased by 2.1pc compared with last year, with over 346m shipped.  The news comes as internet usage on smartphones overtook that on desktop and laptop computers for the first time this week.  Is Android better than iOS?   Follow Telegraph Science & Tech READ MORE ABOUT: Mobile phones Samsung iPhone Apple Show more Technology latest 15 Nov 2016, 12:01am Bad battery life?

Last month, Apple said its new SSO capability would be extended to DirecTV and Dish Network subscribers in December.   RELATED: Adobe, Synacor Back Apple’s Single Sign-On Effort   Apple hasn’t announced other MVPDs that will support the SSO feature, but more are expected to come on board in the weeks to come following its commercial rollout.   Apple is launching the function as it gets ready to deploy a new “TV” app that will launch later this year and aims to unify access to TV shows and movies from individual apps. But, like the early iteration SSO feature, it’s falling short of true unification as it won’t initially support video apps from major streaming players like Netflix and Amazon.   TAGS: Apple TV TV Everywhere authentication OTT Share This Post View the discussion thread.

The earphones haven't shipped yet. It's still unclear whether buyers will want to invest US $159 in AirPods, which are being forced on iPhone 7 buyers, according to critics. Many wireless earphones are already available, but according to one analyst, AirPods are the most advanced. They have unique technologies not found in other earphones, all of which combine to deliver a continuous stream of high-quality audio from the iPhone 7. [Related: Apple iPhone 7 Plus review: including Portrait Mode] AirPods may support multiple wireless protocols to ensure there is no degradation in audio quality, Mike Demler, an analyst at Linley Group, said in a research note this week. The glue in the AirPods' operation is its W1 wireless chip, which includes the radios to transfer music from the iPhone to the AirPods. The chip can process AirPods’ audio codecs, provide stereo synchronization, and handle user controls. "By actively controlling the synchronized operation of the left/right earphones, the W1 delivers more accurate stereo reproduction, and it reduces power consumption relative to commodity multichip solutions," Demler wrote. Apple has shared only a few tidbits on the W1's inner workings. The chip has optical sensors and accelerometers to determine when the wireless headset is in the ears, automatically triggering music playback and pausing when the earbuds are out. The AirPods can also detect when a person speaks, which helps with phone calls. The W1 is Apple's first wireless chip. It is most likely based on technology Apple got from Passif Semiconductor, a small wireless chip maker it acquired in 2013. Apple likely has implemented technology so audio can be streamed from the iPhone via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or a proprietary protocol, Demler said. Passif registered a patent called "un-tethered wireless stereo speaker system" for transfer of audio wirelessly over multiple channels, and it's "consistent with the AirPods specifications," he said. Another Passif patent addresses limitations in the Bluetooth-Special Interest Group’s A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) specification. The patent resolved issues Apple faced when it was developing the AirPods, Demler said. It describes technology for better surround sound by carrying audio reliably over wireless for the left and right ears. It also provides ways to improve battery life. Apple has also filed patents to transfer data reliably using Bluetooth Low Energy and a earphone design that looks much like AirPods.

MORE >> Gail Simmons has a bounty of kitchen tips to feed you before the holiday season begins. Simmons, the Director of Special Projects at Food & Wine magazine and a permanent judge on Top Chef, dropped by the Celebuzz office to share her tips and hacks that she’s picked up throughout her extraordinary career in the food industry, but first, she made us a delicious mocktail. Using Pure Leaf Sweet Tea, the author of Talking with My Mouth Full, concocted Iced Apple Brown Bettys by combining 1 cup of Pure Leaf Sweet Tea and 1 cup of apple juice or cider with one 1 teaspoon of freshly squeezed lemon juice and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. Fill a shaker with ice. Add tea, apple juice or cider, lemon juice and cinnamon. Shake vigorously until chilled. Pour into rocks glasses over ice and garnish each with one apple slice each. This recipe makes two servings to be served immediately. Simmons suggests adding 2 ounces of bourbon along with the tea and apple juice or cider before shaking to transform it into an adult beverage and freezing Pure Leaf Iced Tea ahead of time to make impressive ice cubes. “Freeze the apple cider and make your ice cubes out of apple cider or even iced tea,” she explained. “I actually often will make ice cubes with Pure Leaf iced tea and, before they freeze, you drop a mint leaf in every ice cube in the tray so when they freeze, they have this beautiful ice cube in their ice tea … so that when you have your ice tea drink and you’re drinking it and the ice starts to melt, it doesn’t water down your drink. It just makes more iced tea.” Chrissy Teigen and John Legend Attend 'Cravings' Launch 7 Photos » In addition to sharing the genius ways that she incorporates Pure Leaf into her cooking, Simmons advocated for the use of seasonal produce, highlighted important brain foods that you should be eating, and, most importantly, explained how to achieve the most delicious scrambled eggs. She said that cooking them slowly and at a low temperature is key. “People want to turn the heat on to high and throw your eggs in the pan really fast, but because eggs are actually so delicate, they’ll burn really easily,” said Simmons. “You want to put a little butter in the pan, scramble and season your eggs first in a bowl, and put the heat on a medium-low. Then, when I put my eggs in the pan, I shake them very slowly and deliberately and sometimes I’ll put a dollop of cream or something luxurious to make them a little more fluffy. But if you cook them and move them around the pan slowly and let that heat slowly cook them, you’re gonna get a much better egg.” Get more recipe ideas from Pure Leaf on their website, order Simmons’ book on Amazon, and don’t forget to take advantage of our free 30-day trial of Audible by clicking here.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Tom Jackman November 4 Follow @TomJackmanWP The ‘Vigilante’ phone app shows where crime is being reported, so users can either avoid the area or go there with cameras. Apple has removed it from its App Store. (Jack Crosbie/Inverse) Information is power, they say. So the makers of a new phone app, “Vigilante,” believe that letting people know when any nearby crime in progress is being reported to the police, thereby enabling users to either avoid or approach the area, is empowering. Safety enhancing. Revolutionary. #CrimeNoMore The cops in New York City, where Vigilante was unveiled last week, don’t see it that way. And neither did Apple, which removed the Vigilante app from its store shortly after its launch last week. But entrepreneur Andrew Frame, who created Vigilante, sees the app as a way to use transparency both to fight crime and improve police-community relations. He is working to restore the app on Apple phones, to release it soon on Android phones, and to expand it beyond New York, where it debuted after a closed test with 1,000 users in Brooklyn. This is a promotional video for the "Vigilante" smartphone app, which was taken down from the Apple app store shortly after launching in New York City. The app allows users to know when any nearby crime in progress is being reported to the police. Users can also report an incident or live stream an event. (Vigilante) The app not only maps where new crime is being reported, but allows users to live stream an event if they so choose or report an incident. Vigilante cautions people not to get involved, to stay safe and allow the police to handle the situation. But even in the small test in Brooklyn, Frame wrote on Facebook last week, “people have been saved by this app under somewhat extraordinary circumstances.” In a public manifesto released on Medium, Frame wrote, “Transparency is the single most powerful tool in the fight against crime and injustice, and we believe it will rebuild cooperation towards a shared vision.” In addition to crime, users presumably could record police actions at a scene, as civilians did with the South Carolina police shooting of Walter Scott and the fatal New York police arrest of Eric Garner. “Crimes in progress should be handled by the NYPD and not a vigilante with a cell phone,” the New York police said in a terse e-mail. The police would not answer any questions about whether they were involved in getting the app removed by Apple, whether they would seek to keep it from being revived, and how exactly Vigilante is getting their information about 911 calls in the first place. It would appear that Vigilante is mainly listening to police scanner traffic, then creating short summaries of the event as dispatched and pinpointing the location on a map. Frame told the New York Post that “we are not hearing the victims’ 911 calls. There are police scanners involved and we have a network of antennas across the boroughs.” New York police and fire dispatch frequencies are not encrypted and can be heard by anyone with a scanner, though every reporter who’s ever spent much time listening to a scanner knows that erroneous information often leaks into the chatter between dispatchers and officers or firefighters, and it’s not intended for public consumption. But the initial dispatch usually has the location and nature of the call mostly right. Vigilante’s video explaining how it works, below, indicates that concerned citizens can respond and scare off the bad guy, maybe getting some video as well. It’s the kind of aggressive involvement that police departments tend to discourage, but watch for yourself: “Police can’t be everywhere at once,” Frame’s manifesto noted, particularly in a city of eight million, “and by the time an officer arrives on the scene, the situation is often over. With Vigilante, vital information is unlocked and everyone can do their part.” That “part” has long been defined as witness or bystander. “If people intervene and police officers arrive at the scene,” said Jim Pasco, executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police, “then they can mistake well-meaning vigilantes for perpetrators, and a horrible tragedy can ensue. If vigilantes and posses were answers to the law enforcement problem in the U.S., we wouldn’t have discarded them in the 19th century.” Frame founded a New York-based startup, Sp0n, to create Vigilante, both the software and the staff to digest the information and post it or send push notifications. He said in a press release he was backed by technology venture investors and celebrities such as Deepak Chopra and Russell Simmons have issued endorsements. The app comes with ample liability waivers should one of its users become injured while responding to a Vigilante-reported incident. Some have noted that allowing people to track police movement on an app might enable criminals to commit crime in unprotected areas, and the ability to report an incident could be abused for sinister purposes. “We believe the 911 system information should be open,” Frame told Gizmodo. “If a person needs help and hundreds of people are nearby, why shouldn’t they know?” On Facebook, he wrote, “we are exploring the relationship between transparency and justice. Can we use transparency to reduce crime?…What behavioral changes might this create? Are they good for the world? Can we use transparency to repair the relationships between community and police? We are hoping a long-term behavioral change will deter criminal behavior.” Frame declined an interview with The Post. One question I had was, why the name? “Vigilante” seems to imply more than transparency, more like a call to action. Sudden, untrained citizen action, with the chaos and tangential damage that can ensue. Nancy La Vigne, director of the Justice Policy Center at the Urban Institute, said, “That branding is really counterproductive. It suggests citizen intervention, and you’re thinking about Trayvon Martin. It’s pretty disturbing.” But “the functionality of the app,” La Vigne said, “encouraging the public they could and should think about having a role in transparency, could be beneficial.” She noted that when people decide to turn on their cameras, and where they are located when they film, all play into the consideration of a citizen video’s credibility in the context of an entire incident, such as a police shooting. But for episodes such as the North Charleston, S.C., police killing of Scott, “would we have even heard of it?” without citizen video, La Vigne asked. John DeCarlo, a former police chief in Connecticut and now a professor at the University of New Haven, said having large numbers of citizens rush to a crime scene is “problematic. I think the intent of the people is to record police officers potentially hitting someone, when they’re actually heading into what could be a dangerous situation.” But DeCarlo endorsed the idea of greater transparency as a way to reduce crime, saying that both surveillance and body-worn cameras have increased the civility of those being filmed on either side of a police encounter. In addition, making crime information available more rapidly to citizens, which DeCarlo did in Branford, Conn., a suburb of New Haven, “brought crime way down. People knew what was going on, where it was going on. We actually started getting more calls, when people were more aware. It’s very important that you don’t leave people in fear.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Find Company: 23abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz NITI Aayog pitches for easing single-brand retail sourcing norms S Ronendra Singh   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet The proposal could, if implemented, make it more attractive for companies such as Apple and Ikea to do business in India Proposes 15% domestic sourcing, down from 30% New Delhi, November 4:   NITI Aayog Chief Executive Officer Amitabh Kant has proposed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the mandatory domestic sourcing norms for single-brand retail entities with foreign direct investment (FDI) beyond 51 per cent be eased. The proposal, which favours lowering the threshold of domestic sourcing from 30 per cent of purchase value of products sold for five years to 15 per cent, could, if implemented, make it more attractive for companies such as Apple and Ikea to do business in India. Kant has also proposed that domestic sourcing for global operations by foreign investors be allowed to be set off against domestic sourcing requirements. “There was a meeting at the PMO last week and a lot of proposals were discussed, including diluting souring norms for single-brand retail,” a government official told BusinessLine. Under the existing policy, for the first five years of their operation, the entities do not have to meet their 30 per cent domestic sourcing obligations annually, but as an average of five years. To attract big foreign companies such as Apple, the government had done away with domestic sourcing norms for those producing “cutting-edge products”, but in June this year, the exemption period was restricted to three years. Apple had applied for exemption under the “cutting-edge product” category earlier this year when a blanket exemption on local sourcing was allowed. However, after its application was rejected by the Finance Ministry, Apple did not bother to re-apply under the new rules. Four others, including Acer, Lenovo (India), Le Ecosystem Technology (LeEco), and OPPO Mobiles, had applied for relaxation of local sourcing norms. The proposed relaxation will, if approved, apply to all single-brand retailers, irrespective of whether or not they qualify as ‘cutting-edge’ or not. According to RC Bhargava, Chairman of Maruti Suzuki India, companies like Apple would invest in India only if there is a path to profitability. “Ultimately, whoever invests in anything – electronics or manufacturing – will come only if manufacturing in India is competitive and profitable,” he said. “It doesn’t help to give a concession for the sake of giving one. It makes sense if that is the only way to profitability,” Bhargava said.

Emergency phone systems were clogged throughout Phoenix and much of the central part of the state, with problems even extending into California and Texas. But this wasn't a virus or hack by a terrorist. It all began with a teenager, a link on Twitter, and thousands of dollars in desired prize money from Apple. Meetkumar Desai, 18, told police he created a 'non-harmful' bug meant to be a funny prank that would also put some more cash in his own bank. Desai, who describes himself as a visual designer and front-end developer, was searching for glitches in Apple's iOS system as part of its bug bounty program. The program, launched in September, offers cash rewards that range from $25,000 to $200,000 to those who find vulnerabilities in the company's software, such as being able to access iCloud account data, and then privately report them to Apple. Desai told investigators an online friend have given him a bug they thought he might be able to tweak. The teenager manipulated the bug, adding 'pop-ups, commands that would open email and activate the telephone dialing feature on iOS cell phones', according to Ars Technica.  He then decided to have the dialing feature call emergency services, creating a java script code that would automatically dial 911 when people clicked on a link. Desai claimed he had made two versions of the link, saying he had no plans to push out the 911 link because he knew it was illegal and would cause people to 'freak out'. Desai manipulated the bug so that it would activate the dialing feature on iOS cell phones and begin calling 911 on a loop - he posted this grab that seems to indicate a link with the bug was clicked more than 151,000 times after he posted it on Twitter  But that was the exact link, seemingly disguised as a connection to his personal website, that Desai posted to his Twitter account on Tuesday night. The next day he posted an image that seemed to indicate the webpage had received more than 151,000 views. Desai tagged a YouTube channel page called TheHackSpot and wrote: 'Still going strong'. TheHackSpot also encouraged people to click on the link, which police said was opened nearly 1,900 times from the YouTube channel.  Surprise Police Department, which is in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area, received more than 100 calls within minutes after Desai's link was posted.  The nearby Peoria Police Department and Maricopa County Sheriff's Office were also suddenly flooded with calls.  What made the link even more harmful was that Desai had allegedly set it up so that the program would call 911 on a loop, repeatedly dialing the number after someone hung up. In the majority of cases the cycle was only broken when the user powered off their phone, according to Network World.  But making matters even worse was the fact that it was designed so that users wouldn't even realize they were calling 911. Desai claimed he had made two versions of the link, and accidentally pushed out the 911 link - which connected to his personal website (pictured since it has been shut down)  A cached version of Desai's site shows this personal information he had included  Authorities said the link had the potential to shut down emergency 911 service across Maricopa County and put officers in 'immediate danger of losing service to their switches'.  Desai was taken in for questioning on Wednesday and booked on suspicion of three felony counts of computer tampering, according to the Arizona Republic.  Police also seized a number of items from Desai's home that will be forensically examined.  Although the entire thing may have been an accident, it seems to have opened up more trouble. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Russia falls victim to massive hack which reveals it WAS... Clinton campaign attacks Trump's friendliness towards Russia... Share this article Share Copycat websites have since popped up to exploit the same vulnerabilities of the 911 network that Desai's link exposed.  And although Desai's 'prank' mainly only affected Phoenix - where most of his Twitter followers are based - his code could have international implications. If someone in Europe had clicked on the link, the phone would have been able to recognize that 911 was an emergency number and would have dialed Europe's emergency number (112) instead. 'The biggest wake-up call to nearly everyone was that all indications pointed to this as an accident,' wrote Mark Fletcher, a chief architect for public safety solutions at a California technology company.   'However, this know-how could now be easily used by anyone with nefarious intent,' he added.  'And a large-scale coordinated attack would be a matter of time.'    Read more: iPhone hack that threatened emergency 911 system lands teen in jail | Ars Technica The day the 911 network stood still | Network World MCSO: 18-year-old arrested in cyberattack on 911 system Share or comment on this article e-mail 14 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Moment of impact as earthquake rattles home in Wellington Got any oink-tment?: Excited piglets take a warm bath SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Obama and Trump sit down to discuss the transfer of power James Corden sings for the 2016 Sainsbury's Christmas advert Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes?

STMicro, Sony, and Intel could all benefit from buying the motion sensor maker. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 4, 2016 at 1:00PM Chipmaker InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) is reportedly interested in selling itself, according to multiple reports citing unnamed sources. InvenSense supplies motion sensors to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung, and other mobile-device makers, but it's had a rough year because of rising competition and sluggish smartphone sales. Image source: InvenSense. Analysts expect the chipmaker's revenue to fall 24% this year, compared with 47% growth in 2015. Those bleak expectations sent the stock tumbling almost 40% over the past 12 months. With an enterprise value of just over $600 million, InvenSense now has an enterprise value-to-sales ratio of 1.6, making it a fairly cheap purchase for companies interested in its "best-in-breed" motion sensors -- accelerometers and gyroscopes. Let's take a closer look at the three most likely suitors for the struggling chipmaker. STMicroelectronics Chipmaker STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM), which competes directly against InvenSense in the motion-sensor market, could buy InvenSense to become the undisputed market leader in gyroscopes and accelerometers. With $1.68 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of last quarter, STMicro could theoretically acquire InvenSense in an all-cash transaction. STMicro previously supplied Apple with motion sensors for its iPhones, but InvenSense won that spot from the iPhone 6 onward. STMicro struck back at InvenSense by supplying the motion sensor for the Apple Watch, but Apple still apparently uses InvenSense sensors in the iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. By gobbling up InvenSense, STMicro would become Apple's primary supplier of gyroscopes and accelerometers, regardless of which brand the iPhone maker picks. But there's also a risk that Apple -- not wanting to let a single supplier gain too much clout -- could start buying its motion sensors from STMicro and Invensense's rival Bosch instead. Sony InvenSense would also be a good fit for Sony (NYSE:SNE), which could use its motion sensors to complement its camera, image sensor, and Internet of Things (IoT) businesses. It would be a fairly cheap purchase for Sony, which finished last quarter with $5.2 billion in cash and equivalents. InvenSense is mainly known for its smartphone motion sensors, but it also supplies optical image stabilization sensors for cameras. Sony produces its own optical image stabilization sensors, but that unit could benefit from merged technologies and the inclusion of InvenSense's customer list. InvenSense also has a rapidly growing IoT business, which provides motion sensors for wearables, drones, and other devices. That unit would directly complement Sony's acquisition of IoT 4G chipmaker Altair earlier this year and enable it to grow its content share across various connected devices. Integrating InvenSense's motion sensors could also help Sony tighten up the supply chain and reduce operating costs at its mobile unit -- the same reason Apple and Samsung use first-party silicon in many of their own devices. Intel Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the world's top manufacturer of PC and data center chips, has been stuck in a rut because of weak growth in both markets. Its inability to penetrate the mobile market also forced it to seek growth in other markets, such as IoT modules, programmable chips, non-volatile memory, and depth-sensing cameras. One of Intel's key strategies to expand beyond PCs and data centers is to create all-in-one "reference designs" that enable OEMs to quickly create devices such as drones and VR headsets. These designs bundle together Intel's chips, RealSense depth-sensing cameras, and other first-party components to widen its moat against larger rivals. Intel's Project Alloy. Image source: Intel. Intel's VR/AR headset reference design, a standalone device dubbed "Project Alloy," is powered by Intel's sixth-generation Core processor and RealSense camera. It's unclear who supplied the gyroscopes and accelerometers, but Intel could certainly beef up that bundle with InvenSense's sensors. The same could also be said about Intel's reference designs for drones or other IoT gadgets. With $17.8 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of last quarter, InvenSense would be a bite-sized purchase for Intel. But will InvenSense actually be acquired? It makes strategic sense for STMicro, Sony, or Intel to buy InvenSense, but it's also logical to simply wait for InvenSense to become cheaper. With sales slipping and the company struggling to defend its moat against bigger rivals, it seems InvenSense could become even cheaper over the next few quarters. Therefore, investors shouldn't buy InvenSense with the expectation that it could be acquired in the near future. Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Insights on Mac's upcoming future Listen | Print By Claudio Buttice     Nov 4, 2016 in Technology 2016 was quite a bad year for Mac users, and many keep asking if Apple still cares about the underwhelming future of what now seems to be a second-rate product. The entire 2016 has been quite devoid of major Mac announcements and updates about the new products, making everyone anxious about what's the real future that Apple devised for this line of goods. Even the new MacBook Pro is long overdue, clearly showing how Apple is neglecting its high-end PCs instead of using these products as a spearhead to drive off competition. While iMac, Mac Pro, or Mac mini weren't so fortunate and never saw any update, even the MacBook Pro seems to be quite limited with its just 16GB of RAM and Intel’s Core i5 and i7 chip, compared to the forthcoming Microsoft Surface Studio and its innovative touchscreen technology. Apple did not even care about waiting a few more months for the next-generation quad-core Kaby Lake processor to become available before releasing the current model, worrying Mac users with what seemed to be a "we couldn't care less" attitude. One of the most widely advertised features of Macs is their alleged superior security that led many users into thinking that their computers were completely free from all kind of vulnerabilities. Expert users could prevent unauthorized access without any third-party program with a powerful built-in feature to encrypt the various Mac folders, and many new tools like Little Flocker and BlockBlock added further layers of security to an environment that is universally thought of as one the safest around. However, Mac OS X is all but invulnerable to outside attacks, as showed by the recent Russian "Fancy Bear" hacker group hit. Their "Komplex" Trojan did not exploit a software vulnerability: instead, the cyber espionage group simply used a phishing email to unload their payload in the form of an executable code disguised as a PDF. Today's users need to use their own Mac OS X VPNs to protect their browsing much like PC users, losing more and more ground against the simpler and more appealing Windows operating systems. Apple keeps putting Mac products in a declining category of run-of-the-mill classic "keyboard and mouse" devices that, although far from being obsolete yet, is not cutting-edge or avant-garde either. The new MacBook Pro seems to be more optimized for lightness and thinness rather than power and high-end computing features, a strategy that, although viable, yet again sounds much more like 2014 than 2016. Mac users always have been more interested in computer specs rather than design, and even this choice seemed to be at least questionable. If Apple will not renew its entire line of Mac products within a few months, including the largely overlooked iMac and Mac Pro, there's a distinct possibility that the whole line will fail to get through 2017.

The assumption the smartphone industry is quickly tanking is not only an observation on the morning commute, but also one which is backed up by numerous analysts and research agencies. Volume does not make the claim correct, but it makes it more likely. Swimming so strongly against the tide make the statement by Canalys a bit more remarkable; the team really has puts itself out there and is backing Apple strongly. “While the new models are selling well, there are still unsold first-generation Apple Watches in the channel,’ said Canalys Analyst Daniel Matte. “Q4 performance will be key to better assessing the long-term prospects of the improved Watch models. Apple needs to make a strong marketing push during the holiday shopping season, especially to highlight new and compelling apps for its platform. “Meanwhile, its renewed focus on fitness functionality puts it in more direct competition with Fitbit. The inclusion of GPS by Apple and many other vendors now poses a big threat to traditional GPS watches and fitness trackers.” Canalys believe Apple shipped 2.8 million Watches in Q3, which is a considerably different number from IDC’s research which we covered last month. IDC estimate Apple sold only 1.1 million smartwatches over the quarter, and the segment on the whole shrunk from 5.6 million to 2.7 million. The two figures are so wildly apart you would be forgiven if you came to conclusion that someone is just making it up. Apple does not give the figures of how well certain product lines perform, and the smartwatches are one of those products. The financial results have a segment called ‘Other Products’ which includes sales of Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, iPod and Apple-branded and third-party accessories, but no break downs. Year-on-year this segment was down 22% for the last quarter to $2.3 billion. Canalys is pretty adamant Apple and the smartwatch segment on the whole are growing quickly, 60% year-on-year, though if Apple’s financials are anything to go by, the might be a bit off the mark. Telecoms.com is not going to take sides, but IDC is pretty accurate most of the time.

He appears to have called a truce. 254 Shares Share 249 Tweet 0 Share 5 Share Email Print Share The war is over. Photo: Steve Jennings/WireImage/Getty Images In the great war that is Neil Young versus music streaming, a ceasefire appears to have been declared. CNET reports that Young's entire catalog has mysteriously returned to both Spotify and Apple Music with no warning. Last year, Young yanked his work from both streaming services, like a true audiophile, because neither service met his sound-quality standards. However, he did note in that same announcement that "when the quality is back, I'll give it another look. Never say never." True to his word, he did give Tidal — which offers a pricier tier for higher-quality audio — exclusive streaming rights for over a year. (It should be noted that he has his own fancy digital-music player Pono.) He even claimed earlier this year that his live album EARTH wouldn't fit on iTunes and "breaks all their rules." But it now appears that either Spotify and Apple Music have miraculously gotten more high-res or Young has simply lowered his expectations because he's back on both and somehow managed to squeeze EARTH on iTunes, too. He's even dropped a new song, "Peace Trail," to seemingly celebrate. Keep on rockin' as you were.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     iOS 10.1 jailbreak on iPhone 7 demoed in video By Anthony Bouchard, Nov 4, 2016 Tweet 57 Comments There’s really been a lack of news about an iOS 10 jailbreak recently, but despite any updates, we’ve been able to count on iOS hacker Luca Todesco to show off his personal jailbreaks running on iOS 10. Now, another iOS hacker that goes by the handle @ijapija00 is demoing his jailbreak, only this time, the spotlight is on an iPhone 7 Plus running iOS 10.1. He claims it works on iOS 10.1.1 as well. iOS 10.1.1 is currently the latest of Apple’s public iOS releases, so this is a pretty big deal in terms of breaking through Apple’s latest security updates. Apple has been battling hard against jailbreaking via rapid software updates, which contain a constant flow of bug fixes and new features. This jailbreak demo is reportedly based off of a single exploit and is considered “stable,” which is a brilliant achievement considering iOS 10 implements Apple’s KPP (kernel patch protection) security. This security has been known to cause instability in improperly implemented jailbreaks. Just like with Luca Todesco’s Cydia Substrate demonstration on iOS 10, @ijapija00 is using a specialized alternative library to Cydia Substrate to run tweaks on the latest firmware. While there is some confusion about whether or not Cydia Substrate works on iOS 10-10.1, Saurik seems confident it should work just fine, which according to a comment he shared on Reddit, questions the legitimacy of the video: So he should tell me what he feels needs to be “patched” :/. FWIW, Substrate is known to work on iOS 10.0, and I have good reason to believe it works fine on iOS 10.1. BTW: I’ll say that one way to gain a lot of immediate legitimacy is to actually provide such details… rather than saying “waiting on saurik”, you say “on iOS 10 they changed X, and so we had to do Y, which is something saurik now needs to update”; it doesn’t affect your jailbreak (as this is something in userland which is totally unrelated to the exploit), and it makes it extremely clear “ok, this is actually real”, as the only way you’d be able to say something credible about that is from having tested it with a real jailbreak (and otherwise, as it stands, I still don’t see anything in this video which is really making me think “ok, this is a jailbreak”). One thing that’s worth noting is he uses a set of third-party system query apps to show off the iOS version and the type of iPhone he’s using rather than going to Settings → General → About, which may cast some doubt because it’s not the standard way to showing off the software version in these kinds of demo videos. You should take this video with a grain of salt, just like the others. Just like the iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak from Pangu, this jailbreak appears in the video to be semi-untethered, which means it relies on a specialized jailbreak app on the device’s Home screen to boot into a jailbroken state after every reboot. This is different from a tethered jailbreak because you don’t need to connect your device to a computer to perform the process. On the other hand, just like other demos in the past, this jailbreak likely won’t ever see the light of day. It was built for the developer himself, who says releasing and maintaining a public jailbreak is a lot of work for just one person and carries a lot of burden of risk and responsibility for himself. His full commentary on why the jailbreak won’t be released is mentioned in the YouTube video description: The major reasons for this not being published are: 1. Cydia Substrate is patched by replacing a library that loads the tweaks into the system. If we would have a un-patched Substrate for 10.x then I maybe would consider twice about this. But as long as it’s patched and I don’t own it, there’ll be not releases! 2. As a single developer, I don’t want to be responsible for other people’s devices, if they break or lose something. I neither don’t have the time to help people having problems with the jailbreak process itself. 3. Also, this jailbreak is stable sometimes and sometimes not. That means that it’s mostly used for testing tweaks or for private use and is NOT ready to be released at all! So eye candy aside, the jailbreak demonstrated in this video shows that jailbreaking is indeed still possible despite all the security measures Apple keeps taking to try and thwart the community. A public jailbreak is most likely to be released by a larger hacking team like Pangu or TaiG, both of which have remained silent these last several months. Pangu, on the other hand, did express their interest in creating an iOS 10 jailbreak when it was still in its beta stages over the Summer, so a light may still exist at the end of the tunnel.

PhoneTechJay You could always lend a hand to speed up the process a bit, otherwise sit and wait and don’t complain how long it takes. CryptoCoin420 Geez, how did you get that he was “complaining” from his statement. Lighten up a little. PhoneTechJay That wasn’t even harsh. They definitely have an issue on how long it takes why defend them, complaining or not? Those folks have their own lives and hardly get paid for what they do for all of us. Some people are so selfish now-a-days.. jgr627 In the words of my boy Jeff…..meh 10.2 is around the corner and will patch this plus we getting new emojis Mark S meh to emoji those are for 8 year old girls #StockSucksOS jgr627 And jailbraking is for what? 10 year olds The King If Apple keeps patching jailbreaks in rapid pace – faster than I’ve ever seen before to be honest – then it’s clear that jailbreaking is getting THEIR (Apple) attention regardless if jailbreak news is in the spot light of the media or behind Apple’s closed doors. The joke when jailbreaking was seriously in the news was that Steve Jobs had an iPhone and he had a jailbroken iPhone. I feel that Cook has two as well, and is why they keep adding all the features they see from Cydia. Damian Jailbreak does not get coverage because people of my moms age don’t even know how to do basic stuff on iPhone Blip dude You’re basing an “excitement” of emojis based on media attention?? There are people out there (I actually know a few people) who don’t even know about the updates to messages app in iOS 10, so I think it’s safe to say that emojis and Jailbreaking are as appealing as a wet carrot. Josh Venegas Lol. Are you serious? Jailbreak > emojis any day. mersc Lol seriously? Emojis? As far as stock vs JB… There is no comparison. The iphone is what it is today largely because of jailbreak developers. Nearly all of the features after ios 4 WERE jailbreak tweaks. I will remain on ios 9 jailbroken until a new jailbreak. If it never happens I’ll easily go to android. Jailbroken iphone > android > stock ios. No question for me, because I’m electronically proficient. Stock ios is fine for a lot of people that aren’t proficient, don’t care or are old. But for me, I want freedom to change my device how I want, not to be subject to what Apple says I can or can’t have. jgr627 You would leave the best eco system pound for pound for android if you can’t jailbrake no more? For freedom? You say your electronically proficient? Where! Are you nuts! What freedom is it that you speak of? The ability to remove your carrier name? F*** dan Actually, when the iOS 4 PDF exploit was around, there was a jailbreak tweak patching the vulnerability before Apple could push an update. mersc This is the exact narrow mindedness Apple wants you to have. I have already stated that some people are ok with accepting things as stock, some aren’t. You refuse to accept that fact. You go as far to say “we have everything we need now stock”. You tout this subjective opinion as a universal truth, a base logical fallacy that most are aware of. Google subjectivist fallacy. This is the reason “know-it-alls” are highly alienating. Hopefully for your sake, personally and professionally, this display is uncommon in your life. Your opinion has been opposed by several and can therefore not be construed as truth. For example, there are dozens of important tweaks to me and others that are still not available in stock iOS. Maybe you are aware of some of them, maybe you aren’t. It’s your choice to find and/or use them, or remain stock. No one else cares about personal choices. 🙂 If you don’t want freedom to customize and control your device that is totally fine, but yelling at others while confined in the box is neither productive nor attractive. As far as security with jailbreaking goes, I haven’t been exploited once in seven years of jailbreaking. Installing a package with security issues is a novice mistake. Your tolerance for another person to have a differing opinion is low, going as far as throwing insults. It’s not hard to accept and even celebrate others’ differences. Try it; I sincerely promise you and other people will feel better about you. Blip dude Actually, yeah it is relevant because Apple still continues to do so, but no one obviously expects you to recognize that. And so what if a person wants customization on a walled garden?? I’m wondering how the f*** this affects you in any way. Sure, iOS has definitely advanced since iOS 3 and I can go back to stock iOS at any time (I did it for most of iOS 8 & 9), but if people are STILL Jailbreaking at this point then that only proves that not even iOS itself is perfect. Go ahead and bash Android, but both OS can still be shit and boring sometimes. Favna you crazy? i just got a brand new iphone 7+. I would die for a jailbreak on there. Vista Now we just have to wait : ) Pedro Sá I always wait for the next jailbreak. The only exception is when I get a new device with a newer iOS version (but living in Brazil it means it will take a looong time to become true). Troy If lets say this jailbreak drops (i know unlikely) and 10.2 is released will we able to get the new emojis with the jailbreak? Vista i remember on the 9.3.3 jb there was a tweak to get iOS 10 emojis. so maybe? Bugs Bunnay Good luck for those waiting on ios 10 jailbreak! ravinigga Still rocking iOS 10.0.2 And updates my watch and Its weird from 7.30 to 5.16pm still 90% battery. What kinda magic put Apple in the watch? Rigs101 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f5404617a907b49e8d1d544bdcae7ab9aaab97eaeb598b8d9dcddac29c0af7be.jpg RobDigital413 Ha….ha…..what? (Adam West voice) RobDigital413 Ha….ha…..what? (Adam West voice) nova voter he’s saying the battery life on the new watch is WAAAAAY better than the last one. I’ve noticed the same thing on my Nike+ model. I went from the first gen watch to this one. The battery life is so good it’s almost like it’s displaying wrong on the watch face. Scott Curry “…who says releasing and maintaining a public jailbreak is a lot of work for just one person and carries a lot of burden of risk and responsibility for himself.” So you collaborate with other jailbreak-creators, and let a bigger group release it. Keeping it for himself and bragging about it is ONLY for notoriety and no other reason. That being said, I ditched JBing with the iOS 10 public beta and truth be told, I don’t miss it at all, except my wallpaper switcher. Fingers crossed Apple implements that feature in a future update. Anthony Bouchard It may be easier said than done. A lot of people cannot be trusted with your valuable exploits, which btw are worth a lot of money and could be easily stolen and cashed in. Scott Curry I’ll admit, I don’t understand the value behind the exploits or how that could be cashed in. It’s always been heralded that JB-creators always performed for the general community and not for personal gain. Anthony Bouchard Well to be fair, I’m not pointing any fingers at JB creators. My point is who would this developer go to? Pangu and TaiG aren’t exactly easy to reach, and that means @ijapija00 would have to trust other “average Joes” that claim they can help make a JB tool. Those might be the people you’d have to be wary of. njdan30 Apple pays very good for finding exploits and vulnerabilities that’s how.

Jailbreakers are in it for the money rewards these days and nothing else. Im just fine with stock. Granted I want more features but its not life or death. Ernie Marin Yeah both guys are just hoping Apple contacts them with a job offer, nothing more. JH_Radio Yes, and I will not update until an untethered jailbreak is released. so I’m on 9.0.2. Cones1r I’m down if one gets released but iOS 10 is pretty nice. I do miss Sprintomize and Activator though iltas I’m n latest 10.1.1 should I downgrade to jb iOS 10.1 when it released is it True Mecatrônicos Salê Waiting for 32 Bit JB on iOS 9.3.5 yet :/ Impreza Jailbreak or die. Ivan Is it just me, or there’s 77% chared after the boot up, and on the top of the phone is still 100% ? It seems fishy. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d0f052f789c99d9741b427e65a18a859cf066a1199c702cefec6f1159de7ec36.png Henry LOL..Taig and Pangu are really surrender to Apple now.. Mark S “On the other hand, just like other demos in the past, this jailbreak likely won’t ever see the public light.” the light of day released to the public pick one where do you people learn to write? urrl Still jailbroken at iOS 8.3 and loving it. If jailbreaking dies then when my iPhone 6Plus goes its Samsung S8 for me. Scott Curry That’s for a remote jailbreak. GLWT. This is in no way a reason for seeing LESS public jailbreaks.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple seizes a whopping 104% of smartphone industry profits in Q3 By Sébastien Page, Nov 4, 2016 Tweet 9 Comments Apple captured 103.6% of smartphone industry profits in the third quarter of 2016, making it by far the most profitable company in the business, according to BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long. This represents a notable increase from the year-ago quarter where Apple had grabbed 90% of smartphones profits. This share of the profits is even more amazing considering iOS share of global smartphone shipments clocked at 12.1% for Q3, compared to 13.6% in the year-ago quarter. How can Apple get over 100% of the profits, you may ask? It’s simply that many smartphone makers actually lose money in the business. Any net loss from other vendors results in Apple being able to grab more profits than the global industry netted overall. Samsung comes at number 2 with a 0.9% share of smartphone profits despite having a market share almost twice that of Apple’s. Of course, Samsung profits took a hit following the Note 7 debacle, and this is expected to have more negative impact going forward. Apple historically never fought for market shares, instead focusing on profits. This was true for its personal computer business 15 years ago, and it is still true today with its smartphone business. Apple shows once again that market shares don’t mean much and the real bottom line is how much money you bring home at the end of the day.

This “Apple is doomed” because they aren’t selling smartphones rhetoric is garbage. This article is really all you need to know. They’re bringing home the bacon. Over 100% of it!!! callicles How did they take more than all the profit? Also, “Apple historically never thought for market shares instead focusing on profits.” “Thought for market shares” is odd phrasing. Perhaps you meant “fought for market shares?” HaabHimself Maybe reading the article properly will give you your answer, the article says fought…. callicles The article was edited after my post to change from thought to fought as noted above by the author. callicles Also, once the changes were made, I attempted to edit my original comment to reflect that, but edits don’t seem to be saved. Sebastien Not sure what your original question was, but the only edit that was made after the post was initially published was to change “thought” to “fought” in the last paragraph. Rowan09 But Apple is doomed. Can the “experts” stop the nonsense now? 919263 Yup today, Apple is at what…??? 104% of the profits… Fail to understand how you could have more than the entire thing…BUT this is about something else… IT is the Ecosystem… 9 out of 10 Smartphones are running some form of Android. DO you understand what is going on here… Let me give you a History Lesson… Once upon a time.. 9 out of 10 computers were IBM based…Remember what happened to the 10th computer which was apple…? Same is going to eventually happen again… Windows (IBM Based) PC’s More than DOMINATE the world of PC today. The Mac could not win was due to the CLOSE Environment of APPLE… Well, same is going to happen soon… I love the iPhone… BUT hate the company… and that will eventually make me move from Apple to Anything else… all it would take is a device that meets my requirements… (And does NOT Explode)… So all this Trump’ish Hoopla about Apple is all just that.. Hoopla… It’s all about Market capture… and other than US… Android is winning BIG time… By the Billions… JohnS They got a positive percentage because others this quarter lost money. When you average negative numbers into the mix it sort of messes with the totals. As far as the main point you have here I don’t think it’s accurate. If Apple is taking home literally all the profit in the whole industry they can sit at one percent a lot longer than the rest of the world can afford to sit at 99%. Apple isn’t in danger at this point of going anywhere. If all things were equal then yes Apple would be in serious trouble but that’s just not the case. But what’s the point in winning by billions if the small guy on the corner is walking away at the end of the day with all the money and you have nothing to show for your numbers? The second issue is that iOS is actually open source as well as several other technologies such as their programming language (Swift), their browser (webkit) and health kit. When it comes to the closed parts Apple has expensive APIs for their developers and has opened up more and more of their OS and apps for extensions and integration with every passing year. Contrast that to what Google is doing and it’s an interesting story… Google is shutting down Open source projects every single year and replacing them with closed offerings, penalizing people who want to use their own tools and literally attempting to force people out of the industry who want to modify android source like the folks at Amazon. Google is open in lip service only and they are very aggressive when it comes to controlling their systems. I’m not saying Apple and Google are trading places or anything but I’m just pointing out the stereotype is actually completely wrong.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Reviewers weigh in on the new MacBook Pro… Nonprofits in U.S. now able to accept donations using Apple Pay Apple seeds third beta of iOS 10.2, macOS Sierra 10.12.2, and tvOS 10.1 to developers KGI (again) predicts iPhone demand has peaked for the year due to lackluster improvements Apple spent years testing if touchscreens made sense on the Mac   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to PasswordRecovery stores passwords and recovers them when you forget them NCTextColor lets you add vibrancy to Notification Center iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

Today we’re aiming to provide a review helpful to both former Galaxy Note users and potential users curious about the ins and outs of this high-end smartphone. The LG V20 is a power user device, now we’ll see if it’s a device we can live with. In the LG V20 is part of a line of smartphones LG has created to go above and beyond the average call of duty for a high-end phone. This device has everything the LG G5 has, but here LG ramps key elements up to 11. LG does not seem to be releasing this smartphone to compete with everyone-aimed phones from Apple or Samsung. Instead, the LG V20 is a smartphone for people who love smartphones: those who proudly call themselves Power Users. The LG V20 is a phone for people who don’t want the best device within a set cost barrier. This smartphone was made for people who want the most premium and unique smartphone on the market, full stop. 1. Hardware Quality The LG V20’s industrial design feels to me to give attention to functionality first, then form and comfort in use. It’s almost as if LG was aware that the vast majority of smartphone users immediately pick up a case to protect their device, and therefore didn’t fret too much about the looks. I feel the same way about Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL: function comes before form. In the hardware it’s clear LG intended this device is for smartphone-loving power users. Once the back cover is off, an array of philips-head screws can be accessed. Repairs to this phone will likely be more realistic than in rival devices. Likewise the SIM card slot and microSD card slot are right up top above the battery and easy to access. The battery is replaceable, too – and LG retains its street-cred for keeping it power-user-real. Once we see the battery we’re reminded that LG wants us to look under the hood – they know their users appreciate good graphic design, too. 2. Primary Display This smartphone has two displays, one just above the other. The smaller is just as much a touchscreen as the larger, more traditional display, and both function separately. Both displays work with the same gear aside from touch sensitivity, which is handled differently on each unit. The main screen is a 5.7-inch IPS LCD display with 1440 x 2560 pixels. This means that we have a 513 pixels per inch density, all covered with Corning Gorilla Glass 4. It’s exceedingly bright – almost too bright at times, in fact. The display suffers from the opposite problem most phone screens have. That is that it doesn’t seem to be able to get as dim as we’d like at night. Over the past week we’ve spoken to several other LG V20 users that’ve confirmed this – not that it’s a big deal, but it’s not just an isolated situation. Most phones can’t get bright enough for direct sunlight – this LG V20 does not have that problem. 3. Secondary Display The secondary display on the LG V20 is not meant for the same standards as the primary display. Think of the secondary display as more of shape-shifting tool, able to summon and control multiple functions. The primary reason I’ve used this display – and the display on the LG V10 – is to flip switches in the dark. When I don’t want to blast the brightness of the primary display when I’m in a dark room, I use the secondary display. I’ll use it to turn my sound off, or check the time, or control music on the phone through my headphones. This secondary display does the same thing as Samsung’s always-on display, but here it’s even less obtrusive. Inside some of LG’s apps, this secondary display acts as an extended control panel. In the camera app, for example, the secondary display contains Auto, Manual Photo, and Manual Video Camera buttons. Apple may be making headlines with its Touch Pad on the new MacBook Pro, but LG’s secondary display introduced the feature first on last year’s V10. As with Apple, though, LG really requires the support of third-party app developers for it to be truly useful throughout the system. 4. Hi-Fi Audio DAC The LG V20 has a fairly standard speaker system blasting out its bottom. Unlike some high-profile masqueraders that’ve released phones this year, the LG V20 isn’t a visual trickster. This speaker system doesn’t appear to pretend to have more speakers than it actually does, appearing here with only one speaker grille. This single speaker is loud enough to listen to your occasional album whilst doing the dishes. It’s not meant to be your go-to system for powering a college dorm-room full of kids. LG has included a Hi-Fi Audio DAC for that. A DAC (Digital-Analog Converter) is a piece of hardware inside the phone that keeps the quality of audio as high as possible. It takes digital audio files and converts them to analog sounds through the LG V20’s headphone port with high quality output for high-end speaker devices. For the LG V20 out-of-box experience, this means the Bang & Olufsen earbuds included with the smartphone. Listening to the same audio file on this device and several others with as few external factors changed as possible, LG wins. It’s difficult to say whether Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 would have sounded better because we no longer have one to test – and neither should you. Generally it’s a matchup between the latest hero HTC device and hero Samsung Galaxy device for headphone output quality. Right now LG is out ahead of the pack with the newest in DAC technologies from EES Tech (in the ES9218 Quad DAC). Audio quality doesn’t get the same level of attention that display and camera technology do on smartphones, so we’re pleased to see some competition around what’s most pleasing to the ears. 5. Back-facing Camera As it was with the V10, so it is with the V20 with a truly unique camera setup. Having two cameras – one standard-angle, the other wide-angle – makes all the difference when we’re out hunting oddities to photograph. To show the quality of this camera setup, I’ve gone out to take photos of some offbeat locations and items. Important to note is the fact that I took a trip to take these photos with a non-professional colleague who will remain nameless. Some of these photos may or may not have been captured on semi-abandoned private property. As such, especially if you’re a member of law enforcement, all credit for the capture of these photos goes entirely to my anonymous colleague. Above you’ll see an example of a photo captured with the default non-wide-angle lens. Below you’ll see an example of a photo in nearly the same spot captured with the wide-angle lens. Having the ability to capture scenes with such a wide angle comes in mighty handy in tight situations. Quality in the wide-angle shots is a bit lower than those in the standard-angle – in most cases. Both setups capture photos that are extremely fine and easily compete with the nicest smartphone cameras in the field today. The only less-than-great element we’ve experienced is the fish-eye effect that doesn’t always get corrected perfectly. But it’s better than it was with the V10, and no other smartphone has a wide-angled lens as wide as this. Several phones have been released recently with more than one lens attached to their backside. The iPhone 7 Plus has two lenses, one 12MP camera with an f/1.8 wide-angle lens, the other also 12MP with a 56mm f/2.8 lens. The LG V20 has one 16MP camera with an f/1.8 lens and OIS and one 8MP camera with an f/2.4 wide-angle lens. Apple’s setup aims for zooming without a lost of picture quality, helping you capture things that are far away. LG’s setup instead allows you to see more of the environment you’re in, extending the view of the camera in all directions. If I had to choose between these options, I’d go for LG’s. I can always get closer to my subject, I can’t always get further away. Some concern has been expressed by several users about the fragility of the back-facing camera’s outer glass cover. We have seen photos of this glass with cracks, but have not yet found the glass to be easily damaged on our review unit. We will continue to investigate and update if necessary. 6. Battery Life We’ve gotten some mixed results with battery life thus far, and not only with time on stand-by. Stand-by with LTE active and the same apps installed and active has the Google Pixel XL lasting at least twice as long as the LG V20. In everyday use there’s no truly fair way to compare the two, but we’ve not gone more than a full day with the V20 under most circumstances. The LG V20 does have a replaceable battery, so buying another might be a good idea for people taking long airplane trips overseas. Otherwise charging the device every night while you sleep shouldn’t be an issue for all-day use. Those who make particular use of streaming video – either on-demand services like Netflix and YouTube, or broadcasting with Facebook Live or Periscope – might struggle, however. Wrap-up The LG V20 is a smartphone made for people who love smartphones and for whom price takes a backseat to flexibility. No, it’s not the most expensive smartphone on the market, but for the cash, you really need to know what you’re getting – and what you’re not. If you never use your smartphone’s camera or listen to audio on headphones, the LG V20 probably isn’t for you. If you do, it very well could be. If, though, you already live in fear of being out of reach of an outlet, the V20’s higher-than-typical power consumption could be a real problem. You sacrifice water-resistance in return for microSD and a removable battery, so you need to be sure they’re truly priorities. Most importantly, you need to be willing to put in the effort playing with manual camera controls, setting up the secondary touch bar, and generally tweaking the V20 for it to deliver its best. LG won’t make the biggest splash in smartphones this year, but it has produced one of the best options for power users. With the demise of the Note 7, that’s a segment currently feeling fairly under-served, and though the V20 may not tick every box, it’s a powerful and flexible example of Android delivered in a different way to Google’s vision with the Pixel XL. The LG V20 is available from Verizon for $28 a month for 24 months or $672 full retail price. It’s also available from T-Mobile for $769.99 USD, from AT&T for $829.99, or unlocked from NewEgg for $800 USD.

While not confirmed in any official capacity, Foxconn, an Apple manufacturing partner, is said to be testing wireless charging modules designed for the planned 2017 release of the smartphone. Although several phones have been capable of wireless charging in the past, that’s typically only possible with an external case designed with it in mind. However, if Foxconn’s wireless charging module does end up in the next-gen iPhone, no special case will be necessary — it will be capable of it right out of the box. While Nikkei reports that Foxconn is definitely testing the iPhone-intended module, what isn’t known at this time is whether it will be a stock feature of all iPhones, or something included in only high-end, or special versions of the handset. Related: iPhone 7S and iPhone 8 rumors Part of that decision may be down to the kinds of yields Foxconn is able to produce. If it can output a large number of the modules, Apple may include it in the base iPhone, but if smaller quantities are created, it may be restricted to specific versions of the handset. Apple hasn’t made any official statement about wireless charging, but it is expected to pull out the stops with its next version. 2016’s iPhone 7 release saw the first noticeable decline in its sales since the original iPhone, so kickstarting interest in the brand again with new features is an important step to take. 2017 will also mark the the 10th anniversary of the iPhone’s debut, so it holds some significance for Apple fans. Other speculative features that Apple may include with its next-generation handset include a new glass back built into a metal frame for the phone’s body; a new, curved, OLED display for the flagship 5.5 inch model; an underscreen light sensor with reduced bezel size, and no home button. With the iPhone 7 not really impressing the fans, what would you like to see Apple include in its next-generation device?

How is this possible? Because the Android vendors were busy losing money. By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | November 4, 2016 -- 15:16 GMT (08:16 PDT) | Topic: Smartphones What's a guaranteed way to become a millionaire? Start off as a billionaire and make a whole bunch of bad decisions. See also: Apple has been outsmarted by Microsoft This appears to be the current state of play for the Android market, according to BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long, who estimates that for Q3 Apple captured 103.6 percent of the smartphone industry's profits. How is it possible that Apple could capture over 100 percent of the profits? Because Android vendors are busy losing money. So, if Apple got 104 percent of the profits, where does the best Android maker rank in the scheme of things? Well, in second place is Android powerhouse Samsung, with a profit share of only 0.9 percent. This is despite Samsung having 21.7 percent of the smartphone market based on units sold in Q3, followed by Apple, which had 13.2 percent. Now, the third quarter was a particularly bad one for Samsung, especially given its Galaxy Note 7 problems, so its poor performance can be excused (to a point). But companies such as LG and HTC didn't suffer similar issues, and yet both these companies lost money. Now the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is dead, here...

RELATED LINKS Race result  Viewed by many as the jewel among the 60 Gigginstown Stud horses removed from the yard of Willie Mullins, Apple's Jade had been a general 8-1 chance for the Champion Hurdle but has now more than doubled in price. She can be backed at 20-1 with Betfair to win the Champion Hurdle following this surprise defeat. Sent off as the 1-2 favourite having been as short as 1-3 earlier in the day, Apple's Jade held every chance after cutting out the running, but she could not match the race-fit Rashaan's turn of foot and appeared to have no excuses as she was beaten by one and a half lengths. Elliott said: "That was disappointing. I may as well be honest. I know she is not fully wound up yet but I thought she would still win. "I am still getting to know her, though, and we have not had her long. She will obviously come on a lot for the run. Ruby [Walsh, rider] said she was flat out from a fair way out." Top-class juvenile Expectations for Apple's Jade had been so high following a juvenile campaign in which she landed two Grade 1 prizes and finished runner-up in the Triumph Hurdle. She may have lost out at Cheltenham but her extraordinary, wide-margin win at Aintree proved in no uncertain terms that she was the best of her generation and a genuine contender for honours in open company. The Colin Kidd-trained Rashaan, who was ridden by Sean Flanagan, displayed promise as a juvenile too but he was rated some 22lb inferior to the runner-up, who also received 2lb once penalties and sex allowances were taken into account. Kidd said: "Last year the heavy ground during the winter just did not suit him. We're here after being blessed with the weather over the last couple of months and we will keep him going as long as the ground stays this way. "He is thriving on racing. I think that is four runs in the last month and he is just loving it. The good ground is the key to him. He is just not as effective on heavy ground. He does not jump well out of it." Also on Friday EBF Lough Construction Ltd Mares Novice Hurdle (Grade 3) 2m, 4yo+ Earlier on the card, the Willie Mullins-trained Airlie Beach stretched her unbeaten run to six - with five of them coming over hurdles - in the Grade 3 EBF Lough Construction Ltd Mares Novice Hurdle.  She is unchanged at 8-1 with Paddy Power for the Trull House Stud Mares' Novice Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival. Winning rider Ruby Walsh said: "Dropping back from 2m4f to 2m exposed her for speed a little bit and it was her stamina that won it for her. "She probably might appreciate a fraction slower ground given how well she stays. If she did go on slower ground it would be a huge attribute to her. She is very tough."

Right now, Huawei is the number three smartphone maker on the planet, sitting behind only Samsung and Apple. Huawei currently covers about 9% of the smartphone market (33 million devices), while Apple and Samsung take 12% (45 million) and 20% (75 million) respectively. While it would take nothing short of a miracle for Huawei to surpass Samsung, it could potentially pass Apple. In fact, the company aims to do just that within the next two years. Richard Yu, chief executive of Huawei’s consumer business group spoke to Reuters where he had the following to say: When we announced four years ago that we wanted to sell phones, people told us we were crazy. When we said we wanted to sell 100 million phones, they told us we were crazy. We are going to take them (Apple) step-by-step, innovation-by-innovation. There will be more opportunities. Artificial intelligence, virtual reality, augmented reality. It is like driving a car. At every curve or turn, there is an opportunity to overtake the competition. Step-by-step we are winning the trust and loyalty of the customers. It is about trust and loyalty. If the current growth continues, I wouldn’t be shocked if Huawei does overtake Apple in the next two years, especially as its software improves. At the very least, it’ll get pretty close… Guides Android Breaking news for Android. Get the latest on apps, carriers, devices, and more!

Apple grabs 100% share of smartphone profits in Q3 With no little help from exploding Samsung phones, some analysts claim Apple actually took in 104% of the profits IBTimes Staff Reporter November 4, 2016 20:18 IST 1 Shares 1 Shares REUTERS/Mike Segar Thanks a lot Samsung, we'll have those profits: Seems to be what Apple executives are saying after data released on Friday showed that Apple took virtually all of the smartphone industry's profits in Q3. With no little help from exploding Samsung phones, some analysts claim the Cupertino-based tech giant actually took in 104% of the profits (that's because LG and HTC made losses) Why advertise with us? Related Apple AirPods won't ship before January 2017: Rumours Samsung Galaxy Note 7 users opted for Apple's iPhone 7? BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long, said Samsung eked out just 0.9% of the total profit, despite commanding the largest 21.7% market share of all phone makers. Apple is second with 13.2%, while Huawei is the third-largest manufacturer now with 9.7% out of the 346 million smartphones shipped in Q3. Last year, Apple netted  90% of the total profits in the third quarter. "Few Android vendors make profits," Strategy Analytics Director Woody Oh told Forbes. And while Android clearly dominates the market in numbers, it faces other challenges, including  "overcrowding" by a range of new, low-cost manufacturers. Plus, he says, "Google's new Pixel range is attacking its own hardware partners that made Android popular in the first place." According to Forbes, globally, smartphone shipments grew by 6% annually, to 345 million units in the third quarter. That was its fastest growth rate for a year. But most of that growth is coming from emerging markets in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, and in particular, India and South Africa. Earlier this month, LG revealed that its smartphone division had lost $390 million in the quarter between July and September 2016; the sixth straight quarter of declining profits at the unit. HTC also recently revealed a $63 million loss for the third quarter. The achievement comes at the same as Apple is criticised by investors for struggling to grow; iPhone sales growth is slowing dramatically and the company broke its 13 year streak of record quarterly earnings earlier this year. Apple expects to return to revenue growth in the holiday quarter — largely driven by sales of the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Also read Will Apple go Samsung way with iPhone 8?

But the accessory is on track to ship before the year's end.  ( Stephen Lam | Getty Images ) Advertisement The svelte-looking AirPods, unveiled at the Apple keynote in September, got most people talking for all sorts of reasons. Now, these overly hyped earbuds have been delayed, although they will ship within this year. AirPods, the wireless earphones from Apple, quickly made it to the wishlist of iDevice lovers, especially those who were looking to buy the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. However, the accessory is yet to make its way to consumers. Despite the hiccups, whatever they might be, Apple fans will be pleased to learn that the AirPods — which Tim Cook claims do not fall off even when dancing — will reach device owners this year and not by January 2017. The news is courtesy of insiders, cited by AppleInsider, who affirm that Apple is on course to launch the much-awaited wireless earphones within 2016. "Sources familiar with the company's plans indicated that internally, there is no official delay until January for shipment of the wireless earbuds," shared the publication. "One person briefed on the matter said plainly that there was 'no way that these are getting pushed to January.'" At the time of launch, Apple did not give an exact date when the AirPods would be made available, merely stating that the accessory would hit the shelves sometime in late October. However, the product release was delayed as confirmed by the company: "we don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers." A rumor courtesy of supply chain sources in China purports that the AirPods would not make its way to retail shelves before January 2017, which hinted at Apple encountering problems with the peripherals. But the latest tip off from industry insiders would be welcomed by consumers as they might soon be able to lay their hands on the $159 AirPods, which can reportedly last 5 hours on a single charge. The fact that retail sources have affirmed that they have a few demo pairs for customers and are "ready to go any time," simply awaiting the green light from Apple, is a positive sign. This suggests that the launch of the AirPods might be sooner than we estimate. An educated guess is that Apple might launch the wireless AirPods ahead of the holiday shopping season for people looking to buy the earbuds as a gift. However, we need to wait and watch when the AirPods, featuring the W1 chip, will finally be made available. TAG Apple, AirPods, Earbuds © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

And the company is doubling down on that with a Nike edition unveiled last Friday, while Nike is bringing features from its phone app directly to all models of Apple Watch. I've found devices without GPS typically awful at measuring how fast and how far I'm running. And those with GPS typically do little more than measure how fast and how far I'm running. The basics are great for casual runners, but anyone who becomes a serious runner needs much more. I've logged more than 400 miles over the past six weeks with the GPS edition of Apple Watch, known as Series 2. I've also run 34 miles with the Nike Plus version over the past few days; it's essentially a Series 2 watch with a custom wristband and watch face. With both, Apple addressed many of the shortcomings in the original watch, GPS being just one of them. I'm not ready to ditch my Garmin running watch yet, but the Apple Watch comes close to meeting all my needs. THE IMPORTANCE OF GPS The original watch does a fine job of latching onto your phone's GPS if you're running with the phone, but with built-in GPS, you can leave the phone behind. Accuracy is on par with other good GPS watches, which is to say, measurements are sometimes off, especially when tall buildings block GPS signals. The watch automatically calibrates to my running style, so it's better than non-GPS devices even when there's no GPS. Though GPS drains the battery more quickly, the watch still had about an hour of non-GPS use left after a marathon run of about four hours, 40 minutes. For normal use, Apple says you should get up to 90 minutes a day of GPS workouts; I've often gone longer without the watch dying before bedtime. It helps that I've disabled the heart-rate sensor during workouts. While Series 2 is meant for stand-alone running, many people carry phones anyway. With it, I get slightly better accuracy and battery life. IMPROVEMENTS FOR ALL Series 2 watches start at $369, though it's $30 more for a larger screen -- the optimal size for larger wrists. Non-GPS models, now called Series 1, are $100 less. All models get software updates that address two gripes with the original: * Apple's Workout app now records your route, something other GPS fitness devices and apps have long done. The Apple app didn't use to, even with access to the phone's GPS. * You can double tap the screen to record splits, or manual snapshots of how long it takes to run a stretch. Before, that was limited to mile or kilometer intervals, which didn't help when you were running laps or loops that weren't precisely that length. NIKE EXTRAS Nike's app offers a lot to like, including big yellow numerals for easy reading during runs and voice updates every mile and halfway toward your goal. Nike keeps things simple for beginners by displaying just distance and time; turn on advanced mode for current pace and heart rate. My gripes: no manual splits, and average pace appears only when pausing or through the voice updates. Nike excels in trying to motivate you even when you're not running. It will keep asking "Are we running today?" by reminding you the weather is nice or that a friend (with a watch or just the phone app) is just ahead of you for the month's total. A scheduling feature shows you weather forecasts in half-hour increments. After making a selection, you get a notification when it's time to run. Though the app is available for all models, the Nike watch also has a colorful wristband sporting holes to help sweat dry. It offers custom watch faces with one-touch access to the app, plus a reminder of your next scheduled run. Most people will be fine with just the free app, but running enthusiasts can get the Nike version for the same price. BEYOND RUNNING Cyclists get similar speed and distance information, though the watch doesn't measure how fast you're pedaling, something hard-core cyclists might want. You can swim with Series 2, even with chlorinated or salt water, something most water-resistant gadgets don't allow. The watch measures distance indoors by counting laps, though you need a pool large enough for at least five strokes per lap. WHAT'S STILL MISSING Recording splits during runs is great, but I also want to know my average pace and time since the last split, rather than the beginning of the run. I find it useful when I want to go faster in the middle of a run before a gentle cooldown. And while Apple Watch syncs workout data with the phone's Activity app, many long-time runners already have their favorite online repository, whether that's Nike, Strava or Garmin. The ability to move data around is limited. While Nike offers an Apple Watch app, it'll take time for others to catch up. Strava's still requires running with a phone, while Garmin doesn't have one at all. For these reasons, I'm sticking with my Garmin Forerunner 220. And while it's a minor annoyance, both Apple's and Nike's app do a three-second countdown before workouts. I just want to run when I hit "start." (At least with Nike's, you can disable the countdown deep in the phone settings.) DO YOU NEED APPLE WATCH? Because this review is focused on runners' needs, I haven't gotten into all the other features, such as maps, weather and shopping. Running watches and general-purpose fitness trackers such as Fitbit don't offer as much. The ability to reply to messages by voice came in handy when coordinating with friends waiting at the finish line, for instance. But if you don't need the "smarts," a decent GPS fitness device is more than $100 cheaper.       Comments made about this article - 0 Total Comment on this article Title: Comments: Your Name: (optional - shown on website) Advertisement Subscribe to The Recorder   E-Edition 11/14/2016 Click here to see and download more print issues The Recorder Sports Schedule Most Popular Area high school sports calendar Thursday, November 10, 2016 Party chairs hope for good turnout at Montgomery polls Tuesday, November 08, 2016 Election results in Montgomery County update 3 Tuesday, November 08, 2016 Wheeler, Pepe and Stark vie for District 7 legislature seat Tuesday, November 08, 2016 Republicans take Legislature Wednesday, November 09, 2016 State news in brief Friday, November 11, 2016 Mary Lou Abele Starace Tuesday, November 08, 2016 WWII vet shares memories Friday, November 11, 2016 GASD students choose Clinton Tuesday, November 08, 2016 Mary Lou Abele Starace Wednesday, November 09, 2016 Mattice case adjourned for pre-plea investigation (2) Isabel faces Nelson for county legislature District 8 seat (1) Mead selected to replace Clayburn as county DPW head (1) Food Network stuffs lineup with Turkey Day shows (0) Side dishes for a perfect Thanksgiving dinner (0) Trump told folks they mattered (0) Rocker Leon Russell dies in Nashville (0) Moviegoers rush to 'Doctor Strange,' 'Arrival' post-election (0) Supermoon to light up the sky (0) New Zealand plans rescue of tourists stranded by earthquake (0) Facts and figures for the opening of deer hunting season (4) B-P considers joining forces to reduce its solar farm fee(4) DEC officers have been hard at work during deer season (2) LaPortes celebrate 60th anniversary (2) Taking part in an unforgettable deer hunt was an honor (2) Schools consider options for taxing solar farm projects(2) Amsterdam's Fedullo signs with Saint Rose(1) Joyce A.

 Android has captured a record-high share of the smartphone market BI Intelligence Nov. 4, 2016, 10:17 AM 1,433 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. The Android platform captured a record 88% of the 375 million new smartphones shipped worldwide in Q3 2016, according to a new report from Strategy Analytics. Android’s growth in new smartphones was largely driven by greater smartphone adoption in India, Africa, and the Middle East, where Apple’s competing iOS platform has little market penetration. Android’s market share growth will continue in the near term thanks to the device manufacturers that produce low-cost Android phones for these markets, Strategy Analytics predicted. Apple has yet to manufacture an iPhone at a price point that can draw mass appeal in these markets, and emerging platforms like Tizen don’t have enough support from device manufacturers and app developers to put a dent in Android’s share, the report explained. However, the report noted that very few of the hundreds of smartphone manufacturers that leverage Android make any money, and Google’s new Pixel smartphone is set to compete with Android devices from other high-end manufacturers. In the long term, these factors could drive device manufacturers to give more serious consideration to some of the emerging platforms. As consumers in emerging markets gain more disposable income though, it could create more opportunities for low-cost manufacturers to sell more profitable Android devices in these markets, which would help cement Android’s dominance in these markets. The global smartphone market is expected to slow considerably over the next few years. Despite a record-setting holiday quarter, 2015 was likely the last year of double-digit growth for smartphone shipments. Mature markets were at the heart of this year’s deceleration. Adoption has reached new highs in key markets in the United States, Europe, and China. The pool of first-time buyers in these countries is shrinking rapidly, and sales are now primarily coming from phone upgrades. Meanwhile, emerging markets will continue to see robust shipment growth. India and Indonesia, in particular, will help fuel a large share of the shipments growth within the global smartphone market over the next few years. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on smartphones by country that forecasts the market through 2021 to reflect slower, stabilizing growth in the long term. Here are some key points from the report: The global smartphone market is still growing at a steady pace due to more widespread adoption in emerging markets. We estimate the global market will hit about 2.1 billion units shipped in 2021. Shipments growth over the past few years has been driven by the falling price of smartphones, which has made handsets more accessible in emerging markets. The average selling price of a smartphone in India nearly halved between 2010 and 2015. With relatively low smartphone penetration, we forecast Indian smartphone shipments to grow rapidly over the next five years. Nevertheless, India has a long way to go before it surpasses China as the world’s leading market for smart handsets. India is estimated to account for roughly 10% of the global smartphone market in 2016, considerably less than China’s 30% share. The global platform wars are over, even as smartphone adoption continues to rise across various markets worldwide. Android and iOS are estimated to account for 97.3% of global platform market share in 2015, compared to 96.3% last year. Apple closed the year with another strong quarter on the back of its iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus launches. Still, the vendor saw a slight decline in YoY growth of its share of the market in the face of stiff competition from Samsung and Chinese vendors such as Huawei.

 People don't think Apple's iPhone is a good value for the money Kif Leswing Nov. 4, 2016, 10:22 AM 7,104 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Images/Feng Li Here's one issue with Apple's brand: People don't think it offers good value for the money, according to a survey conducted by UBS. Only 20% of 6,500 people surveyed by UBS in the US, the UK, China, Germany, and Japan say that Apple's iPhone "offers value for money." That's far behind rivals like Samsung, LG, and Nokia. It's even behind lesser-known brands such as Meizu and ZTE.  "It’s a little off-putting that Apple is way at the bottom for 'offers value for the money,'" UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said during a conference call to discuss the survey.  "Relative to previous surveys, Apple’s ranking pretty much declined across the board, suggesting that the competition may be catching up and the differentiation of the iPhone is beginning to wane," he continued.  Still, 48% of surveyed consumers say Apple produces high-quality products, and 33% of people say Apple's products are unique.  UBS China problems Apple's meteoric rise to become the most valuable company in the world was fueled by its status as a luxury brand. People, especially in China, aspired to own an iPhone.  It seems like that tide is turning in China, according to the company and new survey data released by UBS. Apple sold 15% fewer iPhones in China during its 2016 fiscal year than it did in 2015, and there are some signs that the trend could continue.  "Our Evidence Lab Global Smartphone Survey finds strong US demand with a shift toward the Plus but weaker China interest than the prior two product cycles," Milunovich wrote in a note distributed to investors on Friday.  UBS's telecom analyst in Asia, Jinjin Wang, believes demand for the iPhone 7 is not as strong as it was for the 6S, although it's difficult to fully quantify because of supply constraints. Apple's retention rate is down in China, as well, according to the UBS survey: UBS However, Milunovich warns there are mitigating factors. Simply put, there are a lot of consumers in China who say they don't know what their next phone will be, and that suggests "Apple could have quite a good cycle in China" if its next iPhone is a winner.  Strong overall Apple Still, UBS says Apple is a buy and gives it a price target of $127. It sees strong iPhone 7 demand in the United States, and says that if Apple's next big product — AR, healthcare, or driverless cars — could be identified, then it could be "very bullish." "For now we’re focused more on the iPhone cycle. But soon we’re going to have to think about what comes beyond the iPhone cycle. If 2018 is strong, 2019 could be a down iPhone year. At that point we’re going to want to see some new products," Milunovitch said.  EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

It makes perfect sense but may never happen Apple has missed the boat with video and may need to splash the cash in order to get back in the game. By David Gilbert November 4, 2016 14:46 GMT If Apple decided to buy Netflix it could be key to its future, but CEO Reed Hastings is unlikely to sell up easily.Reuters "We want Apple TV to be the one place to access all of your television. A unified TV experience. That's one place to access all of your TV shows and movies. One place to discover great new content to watch. So today we're announcing a new app and we simply call it TV." This is how Apple CEO Tim Cook last week introduced the company's new app for its Apple TV set-top box. The app is designed to collect content from all your disparate TV services in one central hub. The problem with this statement is, that for tens of millions of people, it is simply untrue. Anyone who has a Netflix subscription (and there are more than 86 million of you spread across almost every country in the world), or for that matter an Amazon Prime Video subscription, won't have access to that content through Apple's TV app — and that's a big problem. Apple just can't seem to get it together with video in the same way it came to dominate music with iTunes and software with the App Store. Thankfully we seem to be over the days when everyone was waiting for an Apple television set to be made, but for Apple there remains a major gap in its services when it comes to TV and film. Apple is looking to plug this gap itself to some extent by financing its own original content (about apps of course) but this is a short-term solution. Trying to build a business comparable to Netflix or HBO or Amazon is now futile. Apple has missed the boat. There is another option – but it won't be cheap Apple could buy Netflix. However, for that to happen Apple would likely have to pay a premium of around 20% according to analyst Ben Thompson. Given that Netflix is currently valued at $51.35n (£41.2bn) Apple is looking at a layout of close to $65bn. Now that's a lot of money, but for a company of Apple's size the cost would not be a deciding factor in whether or not it buys the company. The only thing Apple needs to decide is: Would Netflix be a good fit for the company and help replace falling iPhone revenue? "Apple needs a growth engine to replace the iPhone, if not in reality then at least in potential," Thompson said in a blog post advocating for Apple buying Netflix. Netflix is hugely popular and generates a lot of revenue, but it is also burning through a huge amount of cash in order to remain ahead of competitors like Amazon and HBO. Last month the company announced that it would be spending $6bn on content in 2017, a figure only beaten by ESPN's planned $7.3bn spending. For Cook and Apple, adding that huge debt to your business every year (and the amount is only going to increase in the future) would not be an attractive proposition, but put simply if Apple wants a stake in the video game, that is the price it has to pay. To buy or not to buy? The benefits for Apple however could outweigh the negatives significantly. In a world where hardware differentiation is becoming less and less of a factor, keeping customers loyal to your brand will be all about providing services to augment your offering. Amazon is doing just that with Amazon Prime, constantly adding extra benefits for subscribers as part of the yearly subscription, including its video streaming service. By offering Netflix free to all customers, Apple would be adding a huge benefit which would keep those customers loyal to the brand and ensure that the next phone they buy would be an iPhone. This is something which analysts at Bernstein outlined last month. "Apple has a business model problem. Over time, smartphone penetration will invariably reach saturation, Apple will no longer be able to gain share, and the iPhone business will essentially become a replacement market." The solution? "We believe that Apple should look to sell its hardware offerings as a subscription service rather than as transactional product sales, by offering a compelling and attractively priced services bundle (think "Apple Prime") along with any hardware that is purchased on a subscription plan," the analysts said. According to calculations by analysts at ValuePenguin, if Netflix were to become completely free to Apple users, Apple will be increasing economic value per customer by almost 10%. The analysts also suggest the boost for Apple could see the deal pay for itself in no time at all by boosting its smartphone market share. "Even if Apple were to tilt the market to its favour by 3–5%, it could be increasing its revenue from iPhones by about 40%, which could pay for the acquisition in a matter of a few years, even if Apple were to pay a meaningful premium." Straying from the playbook One problem is that Apple simply doesn't make acquisition like this. Steve Jobs never wanted to simply buy in a solution, he wanted to make Apple's own version. The problem with this view is that Apple has seriously missed the boat with video and Cook may need to stray from the Jobs playbook in order to get Apple back in the game. A bigger problem may be the simple fact that Netflix may not want to sell. With a valuation of $51bn, Netflix is a huge company in its own right. It may be burning through a lot of money but it is continuing to beat expectations in terms of subscriber growth. Apple has the wherewithal to at least get Netflix interested with a huge offer, but will likely need to offer more than just bundles of cash to convince Reed Hastings to sell the company he has built from scratch.

RELATED LINKS Race result  Viewed by many as the jewel among the 60 Gigginstown Stud horses removed from the yard of Willie Mullins, Apple's Jade had been a general 8-1 chance for the Champion Hurdle but has now more than doubled in price. She can be backed at 20-1 with Betfair to win the Champion Hurdle following this surprise defeat. Sent off as the 1-2 favourite having been as short as 1-3 earlier in the day, Apple's Jade held every chance after cutting out the running, but she could not match the race-fit Rashaan's turn of foot and appeared to have no excuses as she was beaten by one and a half lengths. Elliott said: "That was disappointing. I may as well be honest. I know she is not fully wound up yet but I thought she would still win. "I am still getting to know her, though, and we have not had her long. She will obviously come on a lot for the run. Ruby [Walsh, rider] said she was flat out from a fair way out." Top-class juvenile Expectations for Apple's Jade had been so high following a juvenile campaign in which she landed two Grade 1 prizes and finished runner-up in the Triumph Hurdle. She may have lost out at Cheltenham but her extraordinary, wide-margin win at Aintree proved in no uncertain terms that she was the best of her generation and a genuine contender for honours in open company. The Colin Kidd-trained Rashaan, who was ridden by Sean Flanagan, displayed promise as a juvenile too but he was rated some 22lb inferior to the runner-up, who also received 2lb once penalties and sex allowances were taken into account. Kidd said: "Last year the heavy ground during the winter just did not suit him. We're here after being blessed with the weather over the last couple of months and we will keep him going as long as the ground stays this way. "He is thriving on racing. I think that is four runs in the last month and he is just loving it. The good ground is the key to him. He is just not as effective on heavy ground. He does not jump well out of it." Also on Friday EBF Lough Construction Ltd Mares Novice Hurdle (Grade 3) 2m, 4yo+ Earlier on the card, the Willie Mullins-trained Airlie Beach stretched her unbeaten run to six - with five of them coming over hurdles - in the Grade 3 EBF Lough Construction Ltd Mares Novice Hurdle.  She is unchanged at 8-1 with Paddy Power for the Trull House Stud Mares' Novice Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival. Winning rider Ruby Walsh said: "Dropping back from 2m4f to 2m exposed her for speed a little bit and it was her stamina that won it for her. "She probably might appreciate a fraction slower ground given how well she stays. If she did go on slower ground it would be a huge attribute to her. She is very tough."

The hidden costs of car 'infotainment' systems Kim Kommando, Special to USA Today 10:24 a.m. EDT November 4, 2016 Vehicle infotainment systems can have hidden costs. (Photo: Provided) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE These days, a new car is basically a computer with wheels. Trunks open automatically. Rear cameras help you reverse out of parking spaces. Sealed your keys inside? Doors can be unlocked by satellite. The flashiest new gadget: a touch-screen in the middle of your dashboard. There’s a lot to love about these “infotainment” systems. Depending on the brand, you can organize your music, program the GPS, and dictate text messages. Console screens are as wide as small tablets and easy to read, even when you’re behind the wheel. But there’s a cost: Many of these services require a subscription, such as in-vehicle Wi-Fi hotspots, Sirius XM satellite radio and live traffic data. You may start with a free trial, grow accustomed to these conveniences and then find yourself paying fees later on. These minor price tags can add up over time, and the final tally might surprise you, especially when you set up automatic payment. You may not realize how much you’re shelling out for car-based infotainment until you look over your credit card statement. How do you avoid getting caught unaware? Here are some preventative measures. GRILL THE AUTO DEALER Buying a car is a stressful ordeal. Even when we pick our dream-car, we tend to drive away from the dealership exhausted. The last thing you want to think about is whether the console uses Apple Maps or Google Maps. But this is a critical time, because the dealer may want you to subscribe to as many services as possible.  Don’t let salespeople confuse you. There’s no reason to sign up for anything on the first day. All enrollments are voluntary, and these apps will be available whenever you want them. Infotainment systems are still new, and every car company has its own technology and services. Each system has distinct benefits and drawbacks: Volvo’s Sensus Connect has a touch screen you can use while wearing gloves. Ford’s Sync 3 uses a Blackberry-based system, and it’s a vast improvement on earlier versions. Android Auto will appeal to Google and Microsoft users, while Apple CarPlay is designed for Apple fans. Your preference for Apple or Android devices will likely influence your next car’s make and model. On my site, I have information about both car systems. Most importantly, click here to see which system is preloaded into different car makes and models. A responsible auto rep will tell you all about these consoles and infotainment services. Ask how long the free trial lasts, and how much the subscription will eventually cost. Grill them about cancellation policies, especially for features that you’re not entirely sold on. If any of these explanations sound fishy, just decline. Better to learn about your new car and drive it for a few hundred miles before adding features you may never even use. REMEMBER YOUR SMARTPHONE When it comes to vehicle infotainment, I don’t use any paid subscriptions. Instead, I use my phone. The truth is, most upmarket cars come with USB or audio ports that let you plug your smart phone directly into your vehicle’s system. For years, tech-savvy drivers have fed music directly through their car radios, or held hands-free conversations through their car’s speakers. An infotainment system is just a more sophisticated version of these radios and speakers. You can usually connect your phone directly to your infotainment console, which accesses all the music, podcasts, GPS, and streaming services you already have, and you don’t have to pay a penny extra. There is one downside: Using your phone for navigation and streaming services while driving may devour your data plan. The same goes for “tethering” a device to your phone, a technique some passengers use to access the internet during commutes. To avoid a future data famine, you can download podcasts or audiobooks ahead of time, especially during long trips. It’s also a good idea to track your data use so you won’t go over the limit. For an app that serves this purpose, click here. Looking for a podcast to listen to while you drive?

For an earlier morning read on exponentially more races — and for a more comprehensive aggregation of the day's most important campaign news — sign up for Campaign Pro today. (http://www.politicopro.com/proinfo) Story Continued Below LATE BREAKER — “Johnson surges for fight to the finish in Wisconsin,” by Campaign Pro’s Kevin Robillard: “The Wisconsin Senate race is quickly turning into Democrat Russ Feingold’s worst nightmares: GOP Sen. Ron Johnson is rapidly gaining on him, and big money — which Feingold spent his decades in the Senate fighting against — is pouring into the race late. Weekly spending on the Feingold-Johnson rematch has spiked by more than $10 million in the past two weeks as Johnson, who occasionally trailed by double-digits in public polling over the summer, has crept up on the Democrat he ousted in 2010. While Feingold has led in virtually every poll of the race, the latest iteration of the Marquette University Law School polls had him and Johnson locked up, 46 percent to 45 percent. Democrats insist their private polling has Feingold looking safer, but a Johnson win — which looked like an impossibility even mere weeks ago, when the NRSC pulled TV money out of the state — is suddenly a very real potential outcome, one that would seriously complicate Democrats’ effort to take back the Senate.” Full story. IN ANTI-TRUMP COUNTRY — “Comstock fights to hold seat in changing D.C. suburbs,” by Campaign Pro’s Maggie Severns in Sterling, Va.: “GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock’s staff followed her recent town hall at a Muslim community center by handing out fliers saying more about Comstock’s reelection bid then she ever could. ‘CONGRESSWOMAN BARBARA COMSTOCK’S STATEMENT CALLING ON DONALD TRUMP TO STEP DOWN’ is printed in giant black letters above Comstock’s Oct. 7 statement disavowing Trump on one half of the page. ...Comstock spent her earlier political career battling Hillary Clinton as a Capitol Hill aide in the 1990s — but she has also spent 2016 fighting the effects of Trump, who could squander the years of work Comstock has put into building relationships with large minority communities in the Northern Virginia suburbs. ... As a member of Congress, Comstock has been a workhorse, sprinting around her district attending to often uneventful, repetitive constituent work: She’s a fixture at ceremonies and events held by the Muslim, Hindu and African American communities in the D.C. suburbs since her time as a state delegate, and she’s a regular face in other parts of the district, too.” Full story. BIG MONEY — "Soros spends $2 million to defeat Arpaio," by Campaign Pro's Scott Bland: "The [George] Soros-funded PAC, Maricopa Strong, will file campaign finance documents Friday showing Soros’ multi-million dollar investment against [Maricopa County Sheriff Joe] Arpaio, along with $500,000 from Texas energy billionaires Laura and John Arnold and $250,000 from Laurene Powell Jobs (the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs). The group had previously reported a $300,000 donation from Soros, one of the Democratic Party’s biggest donors. Soros has spent millions in 2015 and 2016 funding campaigns to defeat local prosecutors around the country and elect new ones who back criminal justice reform measures. Soros-backed groups are currently spending big in three big-city district attorney races: Houston’s Harris County, where Soros has contributed over $1 million, according to local campaign finance filings; Gilpin and Jefferson counties outside Denver, where Soros has given about $1.5 million to unseat an incumbent; and Phoenix’s Maricopa County, where a Soros-funded PAC has also spent over $1 million against the Republican district attorney, Bill Montgomery. ... [S]everal polls this fall have shown [Democrat Paul] Penzone leading Arpaio in his second attempt to unseat the sheriff." Full story. Days until the 2016 election: 4. Elena Schneider’s birthday: 3.

EARLY BIRDS — “Tracking early voting in three key Senate states,” by Campaign Pro’s Elena Schneider: “More than 34 million Americans have already cast their ballots three days before Election Day, and a handful of turnout trends are already emerging in the heated battles for control of the Senate and House. African-Americans are not showing up in the early vote the way they did in 2008 or 2012, but Latinos and other minority groups are out-performing in key battleground states. That leaves Democrats hoping Latinos, a group repeatedly denigrated by Donald Trump, will make up the hole left behind by President Barack Obama’s absence. ... Meanwhile, Republicans in down-ballot races are heartened that Democrats’ turnout in several competitive states has been a few percentage points off the party’s 2012 trajectory.” Full story. NEW THIS MORNING — AFP hits Koster on Clinton donation: Americans for Prosperity’s Missouri arm is spending $60,000 to air an ad in Missouri attacking Democratic gubernatorial candidate Chris Koster over the half a million dollars Hillary Clinton is spending in the state, the latest in a string of hits. “Hillary Clinton is spending half a million dollars to get Chris Koster elected,” a narrator says in the ad. “Like Clinton, Koster has his own ethics problems, engaging in what the Wall Street Journal called ‘one of the dirtier practices in modern politics.’” Watch the ad here. POLLING DATA — INDEPENDENT HOUSE POLLS — NY-01 Siena poll finds Zeldin 57, Throne-Holst 36: “GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York is leading his Democratic challenger by more than 20 points, according to a new Newsday/Siena College poll. Zeldin leads Democrat Anna Throne-Holst 57 percent to 36 percent among likely voters in his Long Island swing district. Significantly, Zeldin has the support of 22 percent of Democrats and 54 percent of independents.” Full story. — NY-22 Siena polls finds Tenney 38, Myers 34, Babinec 16: Republican Claudia Tenney has a slim lead over Democrat Kim Myers in the race for an open House seat in upstate New York, according to a new Time Warner Cable News/Siena College poll. Tenney leads Myers 38 percent to 34 percent among likely voters, with the independent candidate Martin Babinec far behind at 16 percent. All three candidates have net-negative favorability ratings, but Babinec's are the worst, after sustained attacks from both sides on the airwaves. In the presidential race, Donald Trump leads Hillary Clinton 46 percent to 32 percent. The poll was conducted Nov. 1-2 and surveyed 643 likely voters. Full results here. — SENATE — Two new New Hampshire polls split narrowly but agree Senate race is tight: Suffolk and the Boston Globe have GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte with a narrow 2-point lead; UMass Lowell and 7News have Democrat Maggie Hassan with an even slimmer 1-point edge. New Hampshire's Senate race is going to the wire. Both polls show the presidential race tied — at 44 percent according to to the UMass Lowell poll and at 42 percent according to Suffolk. Hassan takes 47 percent to Ayotte's 46 percent in the first; Ayotte takes 44 percent to Hassan's 42 percent in the second. See the Suffolk/Globe poll here. See the UMass Lowell/7News poll here. — Quinnipiac polls show Rubio, Ross leads: “Democrat Deborah Ross' ... 49 percent to 45 percent lead over GOP Sen. Richard Burr is an improvement from an early October poll where there two candidates were essentially tied. ... In the state's gubernatorial contest, Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper has 49 percent of the vote and incumbent Republican Pat McCrory has 47 percent. ...GOP Sen. Pat Toomey and Democrat Katie McGinty are neck-and-neck in Pennsylvania, with McGinty earning 48 percent of the vote to Toomey's 47 percent. ... In Florida, [Marco] Rubio continues to hold Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy at bay without fully putting him away. The incumbent leads 50 percent to 45 percent. ... And in Ohio, Portman continues to have a healthy lead over Democratic former Gov. Ted Strickland, 56 percent to 38 percent.” Full story. SETTLING UP — “Bayh used taxpayer cash for Indianapolis hotel stays,” by Burgess Everett and John Bresnahan: “Former Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh used taxpayer money to stay at hotels in Indianapolis for 14 nights in 2009 despite owning a condominium there, charging more than $2,000 in travel and lodging expenses to his official account, according to his internal schedule and Senate disbursement records. Following questions from POLITICO, Bayh's campaign conceded that reimbursements he received for five of those nights were not allowed by Senate rules and that he would personally repay $737. The Democrat's campaign disputed that the other nine hotel stays in his home state violated Senate rules. The total charges for official expenses on the 14 days he stayed in Indianapolis hotels at taxpayer expense were $2,058.” Full story. SPENDING FIREWALL — GOP super PAC pouring $37 million into battle for Senate,” by POLITICO’s Burgess Everett: “A key Republican super PAC aimed at keeping the Senate in GOP hands is spending $37 million over the last two weeks of the election, including a last minute $12 million infusion in six battleground state, an official said today. Building on a $25 million investment announced last week, Senate Leadership Fund is pouring millions more into competitive states in an ad buy that began on Oct. 28. The new money includes: $3.2 million in Florida, $2.2 million in Wisconsin, $1.9 million in Missouri, $1.7 million in North Carolina, $1.4 million in Indiana and $1.3 million in Pennsylvania. Those investments include TV ads, radio spots, digital advertisements and get out the vote operations.” Full story. HOUSE MICROCOSM — “Ryan stumps on Minnesota's miniature House battlefield,” by Campaign Pro’s Maggie Severns: “There was no more fitting place for House Speaker Paul Ryan to be than Minnesota six days before the 2016 election, where three House races have turned on their heads in ways that are good, bad and just plain strange for Republicans defending their House majority. Minnesota is the 2016 House landscape in miniature, where Trump has pulled new GOP districts onto the battleground map but Democrats are still fighting to close the deal with voters — and are also playing defense in ancestrally Democratic, blue-collar seats where Trump has energized the Republican Party.” Full story. MORE ADS — Strickland back on air in Toledo: Democrat Ted Strickland, who earlier this fall had to trim his ad buys in Ohio due to poor fundraising, is adding $50,000 in TV airtime in Toledo for the next five days. Strickland will air a previously released ad featuring Barack Obama. — FIRST IN SCORE — Sen. Chuck Grassley’s final ad: The Iowa Republican promotes his state’s “significant growth in population” and high-tech jobs in his last pitch to voters. But concludes, “we’re not done yet,” with the tagline “to be continued…” Watch the ad here. — Defending Main Street hits the air in PA-08: Defending Main Street is making a final push to elect Republican Brian Fitzpatrick in an open seat in the Philadelphia suburbs. The super PAC, which is aligned with moderate House Republicans, is airing two new TV ads The first goes after Democrat Steve Santarsiero for "attacking Brian's service to our nation" in the FBI. The second attacks Santarsiero for supporting Obamacare. The super PAC is spending $450,000 to run the ads on broadcast and cable as well as online. The money will also pay for a voter turnout push. Watch the first ad here. Watch the second ad here. — Fitzpatrick's campaign is airing a new TV ad, too, which hails Fitzpatrick as an independent voice with experience "putting corrupt Democrats and Republicans" during his time in the FBI and mocks Fitzpatrick as "a puppet." Watch the ad here. — Rep. Joe Heck attacks Catherine Cortez Masto on Clinton’s private server: The Republican congressman is going after Cortez Masto for “refusing to answer” when asked if she would use a private server while in Washington. The ad also attacks Cortez Masto for “refusing to condemn [Clinton’s] illegal activity” now that the “FBI has reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton.” Watch the ad here. PRESIDENTIAL SPEED READ — “Trump enlists friends and family in last-ditch push,” by POLITICO’s Ben Schreckinger: “As Hillary Clinton’s all-star surrogate operation continued working to energize black voters, Donald Trump called in his own cavalry on Thursday, dispatching his wife, Melania, for her first campaign trail solo while his highest-profile surrogates fanned out across the battleground map. As Trump’s prospects have shown new signs of life in the past week, his surrogates are making an all-out push to get him across the finish line, though the effort is hampered by divisions in the Republican Party — whose luminaries like Paul Ryan, George W. Bush and Mitt Romney will not stump for their nominee — and the organizational wherewithal to smoothly project a unified message across the map. Trump continued to lean heavily on his family, with Donald Jr. campaigning in Colorado and Nevada, Ivanka in Michigan and New Hampshire, Eric in Wisconsin, and Eric’s wife, Lara, in Ohio.” Full story. — “Inside the Clintons' Moroccan money 'mess,’” by POLITICO’s Kenneth P. Vogel: “Hillary Clinton's top advisers downplayed her involvement in arranging a lavish Clinton Foundation conference in Marrakech last year, but behind the scenes they acknowledged her pivotal role and worked to minimize fallout from it. After media inquiries about the role of Clinton and the King of Morocco in setting the stage for the conference, Clinton confidants, including her husband Bill Clinton, scrambled to craft a new foreign contribution policy that looked tougher but still let them accept the Moroccan cash, according to hacked emails released by WikiLeaks.” Full story. — “What's the matter with the polls?” by POLITICO’s Steven Shepard: “In the final days of the presidential race, the public polling has settled into a mostly-consistent equilibrium: Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump both nationally and in most key states, but by a narrower margin than last month, and not by enough to be assured of victory next week. It's been a bumpy road to that consensus, however, one marked by wildly careening results in recent days. Campaign professionals say the run-up to the election is exposing key flaws in the public polling conducted by news organizations and academic institutions. The most obvious flaw is that the polls are overstating sudden fluctuations to the American people, say campaign pollsters whose own data is far more stable — even amid news events that rival the most creative political fiction.” Full story. CODA — QUOTE OF THE DAY: ““We don’t endorse or engage in any illegal activity whatsoever,” wrote The Right Stuff, a white nationalist outlet that “boasted of its plans to deploy hidden cameras at polling places and to suppress black turnout in Philadelphia,” POLITICO reported. « View Archives Authors: Elena Schneider eschneider@politico.com About The Author Elena Schneider is a campaign pro reporter for POLITICO, where she focuses on House and Senate races.

There's so much demand in Russia that Apple just signed its second carrier deal there, this time with MegaFon. And Etisalat in the United Arab Emirates announced on Thursday that carrier billing is available for "all your entertainment purchases." In August, Apple introduced carrier billing with phone companies in Switzerland, Taiwan, Japan and Saudi Arabia. Carrier billing allows customers to buy music, games, books and other apps and add the items to their phone bill, rather than paying by credit card. In countries with less bank account and credit card penetration than the U.S., carrier billing is a big boon to digital commerce. Google got a major head start in mobile payments and has signed up carriers in 45 countries to power billing through the Play Store. show chapters <p>Cramer: Apple&#039;s charts give shareholders a read on its trajectory</p> <p>Apple&#039;s charts, Jim Cramer says, gives investors a glimpse into how long and how bad the tech giant&#039;s decline could be.</p> Cramer: Apple's charts give shareholders a read on its trajectory    Tuesday, 1 Nov 2016 | 6:00 PM ET | 08:38 With the addition of MegaFon, Apple is now working with two of Russia's top three mobile phone companies. In December, the iPhone maker opened phone payments with VimpelCom's Beeline unit. That was only its second deal. The first was in Germany a month earlier with Telefonica O2. According to research firm Ovum, the market is poised to explode. Carrier billing generated just $3.2 billion in sales globally in 2015, but could multiply more than 40-fold by 2020 to $142 billion. The biggest impediment to date has been the high fees that phone companies impose to handle transactions, when compared to how much credit card companies charge. Those fees are coming down to a point where digital stores can make handsome profits. Asia Pacific accounts for the majority of total revenue and is expected to remain the dominant area for carrier billing throughout Ovum's forecast period.

Instead, it’s got a touch bar display. Weird, right? That one isn’t out yet, but the new MacBook (the one with all the buttons) has fallen into the clutches of the electronic murderers at iFixit. Even if we don’t get to see how that touch bar looks on the inside, there’s a lot of new stuff to see in the 2016 MacBook Pro as its torn asunder. Getting into MacBook’s is old hat by now — just remove a few of Apple’s traditional pentalobe screws, pry up the case, and you’re in. The power connector is secured with a large security screw, which is new this year. The trackpad is also easier to remove this time, whereas the last MacBook trapped its cabling under the battery. Speaking of the battery, it was glued in pretty well. The capacity is 27% lower than the previous MacBook Pro, but Apple says improvements in hardware mean the battery life is the same. Going after the core components, iFixit found the SSD was very easy to remove, but it uses a new shape and pin configuration. Next to the vibration-resistant fan are the speaker drivers. The new MacBook Pro has large speaker grilles on either side of the keyboard, but most of that is fake. There are only two small holes for the drivers on each side. Apple talked up its new thermal control system at the event, but it turns out all that means is putting a few screws in different places (sad trombone). On the logic board (that’s a motherboard in PC-speak) you’ll find the Intel CPU, LPDDR3 RAM, WiFi module, storage controller, and more. The display comes off fairly easily after removing the spring mechanism that holds the display cable flat. iFixit gave the 2016 MacBook a repairability score of just 2 out of 10 because of the glued in battery, pentalobe screws, soldered in RAM, and proprietary SSD. Hey, at least the trackpad is easy to take out.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases 2017 Honda Pilot Gets Apple CarPlay™ and Android Auto™ Honda was among the first automakers to incorporate Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, starting with the 2016 Accord and Civic. For 2017, Pilot EX and above trims will now feature Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality integrated into an improved 8-inch Display Audio touchscreen. These models will also see application of a new coating to reduce the appearance of fingerprints on the screen while retaining high glare resistance. Customer choice is also further enhanced for 2017 with extended availability of a black interior, now available on all trims optioned with the White Diamond Pearl exterior paint (previously available only on Elite). Since its introduction in the summer of 2015, the Honda Pilot has earned a host of awards and accolades, including being named one of the “Best Cars for the Money” by U.S. News & World Report; “Best SUV of 2016” by Hispanic Motor Press; “Best Family Cars of 2016” by KBB.com, Parents Magazine and Edmunds.com; and as a finalist for 2016 North American Truck/Utility of the Year. 2017 Pilot Pricing and EPA Fuel Economy Ratings  Trim Wheel Drive MSRP1 EPA MPG Rating2 (city/highway/combined) LX 2WD $30,595 19/27/22 LX AWD $32,395 18/26/21 EX 2WD $33,030 19/27/22 EX AWD $34,830 18/26/21 EX w/Honda Sensing 2WD $34,030 19/27/22 EX w/Honda Sensing AWD $35,830 18/26/21 EX-L 2WD $36,455 19/27/22 EX-L AWD $38,255 18/26/21 EX-L w/Honda Sensing 2WD $37,455 19/27/22 EX-L w/Honda Sensing AWD $39,255 18/26/21 EX-L w/Navi 2WD $37,455 19/27/22 EX-L w/Navi AWD $39,255 18/26/21 EX-L w/RES 2WD $38,055 19/27/22 EX-L w/RES AWD $39,855 18/26/21 Touring 2WD $41,670 20/27/23 Touring AWD $43,470 19/26/22 Elite AWD $47,070 19/26/22 Family-Friendly Utility The Pilot builds on its reputation for interior space, versatility and utility with comfortable seating for up to eight passengers and a cargo area that can hold an 82-quart cooler without compromising third-row seating capability. Third-row entry and exit is easy and intuitive courtesy of the available one-touch second-row seat on EX-L and above models, and large third-row entryway. The Pilot’s center console features a cavernous storage compartment capable of accommodating items as large as a full-size iPad or a purse. And with its seamless cover in the closed position, the console provides a convenient, non-slip surface for items that the driver or front passenger may need close at hand. Powertrain The 2017 Pilot delivers refined, powerful and fuel-efficient performance courtesy of its 3.5-liter, direct-injected i-VTEC® V-6 engine with Variable Cylinder Management™ (VCM™) cylinder deactivation technology producing peak output of 280 horsepower and 262 lb.-ft. of torque.3 The engine is matched to a choice of two advanced transmissions – a 6-speed automatic transmission or, on upper trims, a 9-speed automatic transmission – both delivering refined, responsive and fuel-efficient performance. These powertrains combine with a light yet rigid unit-body structure and aerodynamically efficient body and chassis designs that result in class-leading EPA fuel economy ratings topping out at 20/27/23 mpg (city/highway/combined) for two-wheel-drive models and 19/26/22 mpg for all-wheel-drive models.2 Intelligent Variable Torque Management (i-VTM4™) AWD System The Pilot’s available Intelligent VTM4 (i-VTM4) is the most sophisticated and technologically advanced all-wheel-drive system offered in a mainstream, three-row SUV. This entirely more capable system progressively distributes optimum torque between the front and rear axles and dynamically distributes engine torque between the left and right rear wheels. Benefits include superior all-weather handling and neutral, accurate steering under power that is more effective than front-drive, rear-drive or conventional all-wheel-drive systems. Intelligent Traction Management All Pilots feature a button-operated Intelligent Terrain Management System that offers different operating modes, for the AWD: Normal, Snow, Mud and Sand; and for the FWD: Normal and Snow. Developed, tuned and tested in challenging locations in the U.S. and around the world – including Imperial Dunes “Glamis”, California; Moscow, Russia; and Dubai, United Arab Emirates – the Intelligent Traction Management system allows the driver to select the operating mode that best suits the driving conditions by simply pushing a button on the vehicle’s center console. Based on the setting selected, the system adjusts the drive-by-wire map, transmission shift map, Vehicle Stability Assist™ and i-VTM4 torque distribution for AWD-equipped models for optimal performance in a variety of road or surface conditions. Advanced Safety and Assistive Performance In keeping with Honda’s commitment to safety and driver convenience, the Pilot is available with Honda Sensing™, a suite of technologies designed to expand the driver’s situational awareness while sensing and responding to potential road hazards, including other vehicles, road obstacles and even pedestrians, even to the point of mitigating the possibility or severity of a collision. The Pilot includes a standard Multi-Angle Rearview Camera and an available suite of safety and driver assistive technologies that includes LaneWatch™ display, a blind spot information system, Collision Mitigation Braking System™ (CMBS™), Lane Departure Warning (LDW), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS), Adaptive Cruise Control, Road Departure Mitigation (RDM) system and Rear Cross Traffic Monitor. The 2017 Pilot earned top safety ratings from the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), including a 5-Star Overall Vehicle Score, and is expected to earn a Top Safety Pick rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), including a GOOD rating in all crash modes and a SUPERIOR rating for front crash prevention. The Pilot incorporates Honda’s next generation Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) body structure, designed to efficiently absorb and disperse the energy from a frontal collision, along with ultra-high-strength door rings designed to help better protect occupants. Standard safety and driver-assistive features include four-channel anti-lock brakes (ABS) with Brake Assist and Hill Start Assist; Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA®) with Traction Control; dual-stage, multiple-threshold front airbags, driver and front passenger side airbags and side-curtain airbags for all outboard seating positions; and a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) with real-time display of individual tire pressures. Pilot Manufacturing The Honda Pilot was designed and developed by Honda R&D Americas, Inc., in Los Angeles and Ohio, and is manufactured exclusively by Honda Manufacturing of Alabama, LLC in Lincoln, Alabama using domestic and globally sourced parts. About Honda  Honda offers a full line of reliable, fuel-efficient and fun-to-drive vehicles with advanced safety technologies sold through over 1,000 independent U.S. Honda dealers.

They only started selling phones four years ago. In that short time, they have risen to the 3rd biggest smartphone maker in the world. Only Apple and Samsung are bigger. Huawei has their eye on passing the folks from Cupertino next Huawei is still a healthy margin behind Apple. Apple sold 45.5 million devices in Q3, while Huawei sold 33.6 million. Apple’s market share is 12%, Huawei is at 9%. CEO Richard Yu had this to say about catching Apple: “We are going to take them (Apple) step-by-step, innovation-by-innovation. There will be more opportunities. Artificial intelligence, virtual reality, augmented reality. It is like driving a car. At every curve or turn, there is an opportunity to overtake the competition.” The growth over the last 4 years has been pretty insane, we wouldn’t be surprised if Huawei passed Apple in 2 years.

We present some up-to-date drone footage, along with some questions worth pondering. By David Gewirtz for DIY-IT | November 4, 2016 -- 12:33 GMT (05:33 PDT) | Topic: Apple Apple may have been a bit stingy with its Mac upgrades earlier this week, but the company has been going gangbusters in the construction of what's become known as the Apple spaceship campus. You may recall that Steve Jobs himself pitched the campus to the Cupertino City Council a few months before he passed away almost exactly five years ago. Well, time has passed, and the new Apple Campus 2 (as it's more officially known) has been progressing quite well. We shared some early drone footage in September 2014 showing where ground had been broken, and some of the earthworks in progress. But it's been two years since then, and intrepid drone pilot Matthew Roberts has been surveilling the campus on a regular basis with his DJI Phantom 3 Professional drone. In the video (which is presented in 4K for those of you who can't get enough of Apple), Roberts shows how construction has progressed considerably. In the main circular structure, he shows how the canopy containing a vast array of solar cells is making good progress. About half of the cells are already installed. If you look carefully at about minute 0:51 in the video, you can see a line of construction vehicles inside the building's vast inner courtyard. What doesn't fully come across until you compare the size of those vehicles, which are massive in their own right, is just how large the spaceship structure is by comparison. This thing is huge. As the drone flies, you'll see the Apple employee fitness center. At about 100,000 square feet, it is roughly the size -- all by itself -- of a Home Depot store. At the risk of repeating myself, that's a big building. Also shown is the main R&D facility, which is not part of the circular space station structure itself. Although not visible, there's a hump in the ground where a tunnel is being built, leading to a garage that is supposed to be able to house 11,000 vehicles. There are two main garages shown in the video. Roberts makes a point to mention that there will be 300 car charging stations. It seems to me that, for a company focused on energy efficiency and expecting to park 11,000 vehicles a day, having only about 3 percent of the spaces able to accommodate electric vehicles seems positively anti-Muskian. At minute 1:39 in the video, there's a fly-over of a structure that looks surprisingly like an old Apple TV remote. If you know what it's intended for, please let us know in the comments below. At minute 1:59, you'll see a small circular building. I've heard that's the entrance to the new product launch auditorium, which is apparently underground. For those concerned about how Apple will be preventing leaks about future products, I'd like to bring to your attention the security "kiosk" (at minute 2:12 on the video), which looks to be about 90 feet long. From carefully looking at the surrounding objects, I'm estimating that "kiosk" itself to be roughly the size of a McMansion, at close to 4,000 square feet.

But I have to wonder if the new Apple spaceship is a building being built for a time long past. Back when Col. Leslie Groves headed up construction of the Pentagon in 1941, architect George Bergstrom designed it with the specific intention of creating a vast communications hub, a building where a tremendous number of people could work together. It was, essentially, collaboration software in building form. The Apple spaceship, too, was designed for better collaboration. However, by setting the R&D facility off to the side, there are some physical barriers being set up between the new products teams and the rest of the company. Ironically, we've reached a time in business management where we no longer need to colocate all of our people in one colossal 2.8 million square foot space. We now have tools like Slack, and even shared Notes and iMessage. Does Apple really expect most of its staff to spend days hiking around the building from department to department, or is the company also planning on installing horizontal turbolifts? After all, if they can emulate the saucer section from a Federation starship, they can probably emulate some of the internal conveniences that made life on the Enterprise possible.

Just a few crumbs left for Android smartphone vendors By Guy Daniels @guydaniels Smartphones 2016-11-04T12:04:00 Join the discussion © Flickr/cc-licence/Jason Crane BMO says Apple now accounts for 104 per cent of smartphone profits Only Samsung makes an overall operating profit, at just 0.9 per cent Strategy Analytics reports Apple iOS fell to 12.1 per cent Adds that Android shipped 329m devices in Q3, with Apple 46m According to research from BMO Capital Markets, Apple may be seeing its global market share of smartphones decline slightly, but it’s certainly doing rather well in terms of profitability. And by “rather well” we mean “totally dominant”. BMO analyst Tim Long believes that Apple accounted for 100 per cent of smartphone industry operating profits in the third quarter – in other words, all of it. In fact, he beds the laws of mathematics to claim that Apple actually accounted for 103.6 per cent of profits (impossible, my fellow scientists shout) as its rival vendors collectively made an operating loss – in other words, Apple secured more smartphone profit than the industry netted overall. That is, at least according to the Investor’s Business Daily, which appears to be the only site to have a direct lead on the report, although it decided it was obviously best not to provide a link to it, which makes verifying the report rather tricky. BMO Capital Markets is the investment banking subsidiary of Canadian Bank of Montreal. We will continue to source the original analysis but suspect it’s a rather expensive subscription-only note. Still, let’s take the 103.6 per cent in good faith, as Tim Long is a respected analyst with a long track record. He says that last year, Apple accounted for 90 per cent of the overall market profits. To put this result in even starker contrast, Apple’s nearest competitor in the smartphone profit stakes was Samsung, which accounted for – wait for it – a blink and you’ll miss it 0.9 per cent. Less than one percentage point, for the second “most profitable” vendor; staggering. In other words, Apple iPhones make profit, but practically every single Android smartphone OEM vendor made a loss (or in Samsung’s case, barely broke even). We all knew that Android OEMs continue to create viable businesses around their ties to Google’s operating system, but Long’s analysis is a wake-up call to the industry. This increase in profit share comes at the expense of market share – but as Apple is probably thinking, “who cares?”. No need to chase the low-cost end of the market, with its razor thin margins, stay at the expensive top end. The “smartphone” is the key central device in the evolving connected life ecosystem of devices (and by devices, they can be as small as a watch or remote door look, or in the future as large as a car – yes, as we’ve long said, the mass-market car will be relegated to the role of smartphone accessory, it’s not as daft as it sounds). So focus on the smartphone, that will remain the most critical element in this chain for some time to come, and don’t be afraid to charge accordingly. Android climbs to 88 per cent market share Earlier this week, Strategy Analytics released its latest market findings that showed global smartphone shipments reached 375 million units in the third quarter of 2016. The Android operating system captured a record 87.5 per cent global market share, at the expense of Apple iOS (12.1 per cent) and the last remaining others (who have tanked to just 0.3 per cent collectively). “Android’s gain came at the expense of every major rival platform,” said Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics. “Apple iOS lost ground to Android and dipped to 12 per cent share worldwide in Q3, due to a lacklustre performance in China and Africa. BlackBerry and Microsoft Windows Phone have all but disappeared due to strategic shifts, while Tizen and other emerging platforms softened as a result of limited product portfolios and modest developer support.” In terms of number of devices, Android increased shipments of devices by 10.3 per cent year-on-year to 328.6 million, with Apple iOS devices falling 5.2 per cent to 45.5 million. Overall though, the market grew 6 per cent over the year. “This was the smartphone industry’s fastest growth rate for a year,” said Linda Sui, Director at Strategy Analytics. “Modest smartphone re-growth is being supported by emerging markets with relatively low smartphone penetration across Asia and Africa Middle East, particularly countries such as India and South Africa.” Returning to BMO, Long predicts that smartphone unit shipments will grow at a compound annual rate of 2.6 per cent from 2015 to 2019 and that "Emerging markets will dominate smartphone growth, at 4 per cent, while developed markets will decline less than 1 per cent." However, as the profit analysis shows, just because Android is gaining numbers and market share, doesn’t mean it is without problems. “Several challenges remain for Google,” said Woody Oh, Director at Strategy Analytics. “The Android platform is getting overcrowded with hundreds of manufacturers, few Android device vendors make profits, and Google’s new Pixel range is attacking its own hardware partners that made Android popular in the first place.” What Android has done is taken Apple’s revolutionary reimagining of the “smartphone” as devised by Ericsson and Nokia, and propelled it to mass global adoption. It won’t be that long before all personal mobile devices are “smart”. But now that practically everybody who wants a smartphone has one, what next? How can the industry become financially sustainable? Is Apple’s model the only one that will work (and Google is certainly taking a good, close look at it with Pixel)? Will smartphones be merely loss-leaders for profitable subscription services tied to them? So many questions, so few answers. In the meantime, if your name’s not Apple, and you don’t have billions of dollars of marketing budget and are prepared to just break even, then you could well be better off focusing on the component and supply chain business. Until Apple and Samsung get round to doing it all themselves, of course. This really isn’t a business for the risk-adverse.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 4, 2016 at 8:30AM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the world's largest companies in terms of revenue and profit generation. Perhaps the most impressive part of the company's financial success is that it delivers those impressive results with a tight, highly-focused portfolio of products. This focus pays off for the consumer-electronics giant, as its products are arguably best in class. That's why it's sometimes a bit difficult to pick a "best" product among those that the company launches each year. Nevertheless, this year, it's quite clear that Apple's iPhone 7 Plus stole the show.  Apple nails it with the jumbo iPhone In 2014, Apple began a trend of releasing not just one but two new flagship iPhone models each year -- one with a 4.7-inch display and one with a 5.5-inch display. The iPhone 7 Plus in jet black is one great device. Image source: Apple.  The smaller and larger models were, during the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s generations, differentiated by screen size, screen resolution, pixel density, and minor camera features. With the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple delivered a greater degree of differentiation relative to its smaller counterpart than it had in prior iPhone cycles. The iPhone 7 Plus incorporates a dual-lens camera that enables some interesting and useful features, such as 2X optical zoom and a nifty depth-of-field effect, which you can see in this picture that I took: Image source: author. The result is that Apple's more expensive, jumbo-sized iPhone is selling better than what Apple had expected going into the device launch -- something that could have positive implications on iPhone average selling prices and ultimately revenue, should Apple be able to catch up with demand in a timely fashion. The iPhone 7 Plus truly represents the best of Apple: a well-crafted product with unique features that entice customers to pay more because they're genuinely getting more. Should Apple be able to continue to deliver differentiated, meaningful features with future, premium-priced iPhones in coming generations, Apple's iPhone business could benefit greatly. Runner-up? The new MacBook Pro computers Although the internet seems to be divided on Apple's newly announced MacBook Pro updates, I view these systems as quite innovative and unquestionably worthy of "runner-up" status here.  Image source: Apple.  The new MacBook Pro computers include numerous internal upgrades -- par for the course in the world of personal computers -- along with a significantly enhanced display, a reworked Force Touch trackpad, a new keyboard design, and a nifty-looking Touch Bar. Apple seems to have made a genuine effort to deliver something unique to what's arguably a boring product category, and for that the company should be applauded. But it's too soon to tell how well these new MacBook Pro systems will do in the marketplace. Apple has been losing market share in personal computers, and these new systems are the company's best chance of regaining that share. Early indications look good: The shipping times for the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and new 15-inch MacBook Pro are now in the four- to five-week range -- up from the two- to three-week range they started at. These long shipping times may simply be indicative of poor supply, but I'm not willing to buy that explanation yet.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The residents have filed complaints with Galway County Council, local planning body An Bord Pleanála, and most recently have taken it to High Court (via Business Insider). Apple is now trying to get the High Court to fast track the case brought upon by the three individuals in Athenry, mainly by putting the dispute on a "commercial list," a dedicated section of the court which deals with cases that have more than €1 million at stake. For the data center in Ireland alone (one of similar scale is going up in Denmark), Apple plans to spend €850 million. Not all of the locals are against Apple's attempts to build in the area, however, and are planning a march in support this weekend "to show Apple, and the whole world, that the vast majority of Athenry people support wholeheartedly Apple's desire to open a data centre near our town." In the Apple for Athenry March Facebook event, the supportive residents of the town mention a fear that if negative opinions continue to mount against Apple's appearance in the area, the opportunity for community growth could "slip through our fingers." "We want to show Apple, and the whole world, that the vast majority of Athenry people support wholeheartedly Apple's desire to open a data centre near our town PLEASE ATTEND THIS EVENT, AND MAKE EVERYONE YOU KNOW AWARE OF IT. This is a marvellous opportunity for Athenry, and the West Of Ireland. Please do not let this opportunity slip through our fingers. PLEASE DO NOT UPSET THE APPLECART" The next step for Apple will be on November 7 -- the day after the organized support march this Sunday -- where the High Court will consider Apple's motion and either agree to the fast track plan and see the issue settled within the next few months, or prolongate the company's attempted construction even more. Original objections to the site referenced wildlife issues, local golf course flooding, and the center's proximity to nearby nuclear power plants. Once it would start building the data center, Apple has laid out a 10-15 year construction plan for continued expansion and growth of the location, which is intended to power services like the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud.

How many acres are we talking about here as far as the size of the forest vs the size of the Data Centre is concerned? Let the Irish people decide for themselves, and may common sense prevail. And even then - I'm a nature lover but that looks like a planted forest of pine. A man-made fast-growing monoculture that is typically devoid of much in the way of animal life. When you come across one of these on a walk it's like walking into a desert as far as birds go. My guess is that an Apple industrial park might well be more nature friendly.

Apple can get off the wallet and build these things in northern Scandinavia (in a remote area where very few people live),- passive filtered cooling can be done, which would make it very energy efficient. The ONLY reason they are building this is in Ireland is their continued use of Irish tax law, which the EU ruled as ILLEGAL. Apple greed knows no bounds. To HELL with Tim Cook - I will celebrate the day this miscreant steps down, and stops ruining a once great company.

For the data center in Ireland alone (one of similar scale is going up in Denmark ('//www.macrumors.com/2016/10/03/apples-data-center-denmark/')), Apple plans to spend EUR850 million. Not all of the locals are against Apple's attempts to build in the area, however, and are planning a march in support this weekend "to show Apple, and the whole world, that the vast majority of Athenry people support wholeheartedly Apple's desire to open a data centre near our town." In the Apple for Athenry March Facebook event ('https://www.facebook.com/events/1178762102215689/'), the supportive residents of the town mention a fear that if negative opinions continue to mount against Apple's appearance in the area, the opportunity for community growth could "slip through our fingers." The next step for Apple will be on November 7 -- the day after the organized support march this Sunday -- where the High Court will consider Apple's motion and either agree to the fast track plan and see the issue settled within the next few months, or prolongate the company's attempted construction even more. Original objections to the site referenced wildlife issues ('//www.macrumors.com/2016/05/27/apple-defends-irish-data-center/'), local golf course flooding, and the center's proximity to nearby nuclear power plants ('//www.macrumors.com/2016/06/01/apples-irish-data-center-nuclear/'). Once it would start building the data center, Apple has laid out a 10-15 year construction plan for continued expansion and growth of the location, which is intended to power services like the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud.

That should actually help with their HVAC costs and keep the land above reasonably intact.

While Lenovo scrapped its touch keys after feedback due to the poor implementation, Microsoft has been investigating the use of adaptive keyboards for more than 15 years. A concept for adaptive hardware began back in 1999, with an idea that PCs could display action keys and hide other parts of the keyboard based on context. Steven Bathiche, director of research in Microsoft's applied sciences group, spent years investigating keyboards that changed their function keys and actions based on applications on the screen. While most of the work was primitive compared to today's touchscreen interfaces, a lot of the concepts behind Apple's MacBook Touch Bar were investigated by Microsoft's research teams. Microsoft's Adaptive Keyboard had a large touchscreen area After a number of prototypes involving projectors, touchscreens, and basic keyboard buttons, Microsoft finalized its research in 2009 with what it describes as an "Adaptive Keyboard." Microsoft's Adaptive Keyboard includes a tactile keyboard with a display underneath it, and programmable display key tops, with a large touch display area above the keys. It's obviously a step further on from Apple's own Touch Bar, but Microsoft experimented with apps and user experiences that extended most of the interactions to the keyboard where hands typically rest. The idea was to see whether touch and dynamic context-based controls on a keyboard could increase productivity and highlight more advanced controls to a regular keyboard user who doesn't rely on 100s of shortcuts. Microsoft even admits part of the research was to "perhaps delight a little bit." All of the examples in Microsoft's research were purely concept, and a 10-minute video demonstrates a number of ideas around the interaction and inputs. One example extends the operating system to the keyboard touch area, allowing you to browse through and select documents or recent apps. Another shows how the entire keyboard could adapt for when you don't require QWERTY input on certain actions in apps. Microsoft even investigated enabling notifications to display on the touchscreen area, allowing users to take Skype calls through "quick reach actions" without having to interact with them using a mouse. Microsoft went with touchscreens instead of touch keyboards Ultimately, Microsoft decided not to progress with its research into a product. That's not unusual for the software maker, but I asked Bathiche why Microsoft never turned this idea into reality. "We did not build computers back then," explained Bathiche, who co-created the Microsoft Surface, in a Twitter reply. "When we did start, we made computers with touch screens." That obvious and honest answer highlights the real difference between Microsoft and Apple's attitudes to touch on desktop PCs. The new Mac vs. PC war is all about touch, and we might have to wait for years to find out which approach is the winner.

And goliath is no hyperbole when describing the company. Headquartered out of Shenzhen, China, Huawei employs over 170,000 people, is employee-owned - 99 per cent of the private company is in the hands of the workers - and has revenue of over $60bn last year, of which around 40 per cent emanates from the Consumer Business Group (CBG) in charge of smartphones and tablets. Huawei's main smartphone strength rests with dominating the Chinese market, with over 20 per cent market share. Total global smartphone shipments hit 108m last year and are projected to surpass 140m this year, and the company sees significant growth opportunity in the premium handset space and non-Chinese market. This strategy makes sense if it is to become closer to Samsung (321m) and Apple (231m) in the overall annual smartphone shipping stakes. A key thrust for gaining high-end market- and mind-share is in releasing premium smartphones that rival what's available from the two bigger players. Until yesterday, Huawei's flagship phone was the P9 Plus - a big-screen, dual-camera offering. This, arguably, is changing today with the announcement and full reveal of the Huawei Mate 9 at a press conference in Munich, Germany. We managed to get some hands-on time at a pre-event briefing in London last week. In common with the industry, there's very little to differentiate the incumbent Mate 8 and the new head honcho. The Mate 9, available in five colours, carries the familiar look and feel of its predecessor and is about the same size, coming in at 156.9mm tall, 78.9mm wide, 7.9mm thick, and 190g in weight. This puts it in the same league as the iPhone 7 Plus and just a bit bigger than the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Build quality is excellent on this phablet. The full-metal unibody construction is suitably premium, and while the back has no obvious texture to aid grippiness, it feels good, albeit naturally big, in your hand. That size is put to good use with a near-edge-to-edge display that measures 5.9in and packs in a full-HD display that uses IPS technology rather than AMOLED. The sample model's screen was bright and easy to read. Did we wish for a higher-resolution panel? Yes, though it would likely push the price up from the estimated off-contract £429 or so - Huawei has yet to reveal the cost. In fact, you wouldn't know this was the all-new Mate 9 on first glance and that may not be a bad thing as keeping brand identity seems to be taking on more importance. Huawei keeps the familiar 'drain' on the bottom, sitting on either side of the USB Type-C charging inlet, and it's a necessary evil in order to keep the handset cool under peak load. Moving around, the dual-SIM-supporting Mate 9 continues to have a regular headphone jack and an 8MP front snapper, albeit slightly improved over its predecessor. Inside, Huawei uses the same 4,000mAh battery as the Mate 8 and that should mean class-leading longevity when running everyday applications. On the back, the Mate 9 houses a Leica 20MP monochrome and 12MP RGB camera, 4x optical zoom, though it is not clear whether Huawei is using telephoto to achieve this. There's additional support for 4K video, as well. In concert with the new release, Huawei is incorporating a new iteration of its Emotion UI, now version 5.0, interface that sits on top of Android 7.0. And carrying on familial design, the fingerprint scanner is situated just underneath. Getting juice quickly back into the battery is now a selling feature; the Mate 8 charges by using a 9V/2A technology that provides full charge in 2.5 hours. Mate 9 adds to this by bundling a special voltage-sensing (5V/4.5A) charger capable of dynamically adjusting its voltage for, well, safety reasons - Galaxy Note 7 poke, anyone? The result of more watts into the phone? Huawei says users can enjoy a 'full day's' charge in 20 minutes while just 10 minutes provides enough juice for watching two HD movies. As standard, the Mate 9 shoehorns in 64GB of storage and is supported by 4GB of LP-DDR4 memory. A microSD slot remains a welcome addition for those that need on-device space. The biggest change, as you might imagine, comes under the hood. Last year's Kirin 950 system-on-chip (SoC), made by Huawei subsidiary HiSilicon, has been improved with the Kirin 960. A numerical increase doesn't sound like much of an enhancement, yet as a certain fruity company likes to say, the only thing that has changed is everything. Kirin 960 - the new brains The SoC is the one of the first to use a quad-core Cortex-A73 CPU from ARM. Designed specifically to offer better sustained performance than its predecessor whilst also adding a little more punch, the frugal nature of the most potent ARM CPU core to date should allow HiSilicon to repurpose precious TDP savings elsewhere. The Cortex-A73 is augmented by a quad-core Cortex-A53 in a big.LITTLE configuration. What's more, the Mate 9 adds a low-power companion chip, identified as i6 (based on ARM Cortex-M7) for low-power, always-on features such as GPS and, dare we say, Pokemon hunting. Another key driver of the Kirin 960's performance is with the very first implementation of ARM's all-new Mali-G71 graphics core. Using a brand-new, grounds-up architecture and offering 20 per cent higher efficiency and up to 40 per cent better performance density than the Mate 8's Mali-T880, the eight-core graphics chip, which fully supports the Vulkan API, appears to at least match the very best on offer elsewhere, though we will know more once we have a handset in-house. We asked Huawei executives why the reliance on ARM when HiSilicon owns an architectural license and can therefore design its own CPU cores for better performance. Apple, as you will know, has gone down the custom CPU route for years and now incorporates a modified GPU to its own specifications. Huawei was keen to point out that off-the-shelf ARM IP is good enough for the CPU and GPU, particularly with the latter using the innovative Bifrost architecture, so it made sense for the engineering team behind the Kirin 960 to focus more on the value-adds such as improved image signal processor (ISP) and super-fast storage by way of Universal Flash Storage (UFS 2.1), replacing long-used eMMC. Huawei said that the speed increase for UFS 2.1 will be most keenly felt when recording or moving 4K video around. Mobile phone SoCs destined for premium phones need high-quality modems as standard. Kirin 960 employs an in-house LTE modem boasting Cat 12 download and Cat 13 upload, meaning that, on paper at least, it is a good match for the best that Qualcomm and Samsung have to offer. The ISP contained within the Kirin 960 now has a built-in sensor to aggregate more depth information than ever before. The key advantage to this is that pictures can be refocused after they have been taken - a neat trick that comes by way of having more scene depth - and better low-light performance. Stressing the last point, Huawei had a demo where it favourably compared the low-light credentials of the Mate 9 to an iPhone 7 Plus camera. Speed, too, should be improved as all computation is done on the SoC itself. There's also improved audio from a Hi6403 chip as well as better security, ostensibly aimed at the Chinese market. And while ARM is the go-to partner for the CPU and GPU, Huawei uses a custom encoding/decoding engine for processing at up to 4K30. Overall specifications suggest that the Kirin 960 SoC houses a thoroughly modern collection of technologies that put it at least on a par with premium, available offerings from Qualcomm and Samsung. The goalposts may shift a mite with the release of their next-generation SoCs soon, yet we feel confident that Huawei has a solid proposition from both hardware and software with the Mate 9.         LATEST STORIES (4) Aerial Footage Shows Syrian Army Advances in Southwestern Damascus Syrian Army Missile Hits Militants' Gathering in Southern Aleppo Hashd Al-Shaabi Kicks Off 3rd Phase of Military Operations West of Mosul Anti-Trump Protests Continue across US Cities Spokesman: Iran's Missile Power Not Negotiable Tasting Justice: ISIL Being Driven Away in Iraq and Syria Iran, Russia Stress Boosting Mutual Cooperation Spokesman: AEOI Not Concerned About Trump Aides' Remarks Hashd Al-Shaabi Rescues 300 Sunni Families Battle for Mosul Day 28: Hashd Al-Sha'abi Kicks Off 3rd Phase of Mosul Operation Russia, Iran Plan $10bln Arms Deal Report: Russian Strategic Bombers Prepare to Strike Terrorists in Syria Samples Taken in Syria's Aleppo Prove Militants Used Chlorine Gas Syria: Jeish Al-Fatah Declares State of Emergency in Aleppo Iran Urges Unity Among Muslim Nations Aerial Footage Shows Syrian Army Advances in Southwestern Damascus TEHRAN (FNA)- The Syrian army troops continued to hit the terrorist groups' defense lines and gatherings and seized back new regions in Western Ghouta, tightening the siege of the militant-held town of Khan al-Sheih.

Apple has, despite selling good numbers of iPhones, experienced the third straight decline in revenue in 2016, while Samsung’s profit has taken a hit due to the Galaxy Note 7 scandal, which makes both the future phones’ success important for the companies. There are no confirmed reports about either device, but rumors have been around about both phones. Looking at the expected specs and features, here is a comparison between the two. iPhone 8 is expected to be Apple’s first iPhone without a home button. The company acquired a relevant patent Oct. 4. Samsung also might do the same with Galaxy S8. Apple already ditched the 3.5mm audio jack and combined the audio jack and charging port. This seems to have become common practice and according to rumors, Samsung might also do the same. Both company’s current flagships offer fingerprint sensors, but Samsung’s device is expected to the first major one in the world to offer an optical fingerprint sensor, according to SamMobile. The sensor would be placed under the display and will be an optical scanner armed with ultrasonic sensors which will make it faster than regular fingerprint sensors. Related Stories Is The Galaxy S8 Bezel-Less? Galaxy S8 Will Come With Enhanced Artificial intelligence A leaked spreadsheet on Weibo shows the Samsung Galaxy S8 Edge will have a 5.5-inch 4K display while Apple is expected to continue with its retina displays. The S8 is expected to come with a Snapdragon 830 processor, while no information about Apple’s A11 chip is available yet. In terms of storage, iPhone 8 is expected to come in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB versions, while the S8 is expected to come in a single 64GB version with 256GB expandable storage. While iPhone 8 is expected to come with 12- and 8- megapixel front and rear cams, Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to come with 16-megapixel rear cam and a 12-megapixel 4K-capable front cam, knowyourmobile reports. Other specs about both devices are yet to emerge and it remains to be seen which phone does well in the coming year.

As impressive as that may be, at the end of the day it really boils down to a matter of dollars and cents, in which this time Apple is the clear winner. According to analysts at BMO Capital Markets (via 9to5Mac), they have estimated that Apple for Q3 2016 had managed to capture a whopping 103.6% of the smartphone industry profit. Now you might be thinking how is that even possible? Apparently this is because other smartphone OEMs have actually lost money, which is to Apple’s benefit. As for Apple’s closest rival in the mobile space, Samsung, BMO has estimated that they have only managed to gain a measly 0.9% of the smartphone industry profit which we have to say does seem suspiciously low. However it seems that Samsung has sold more phones with 21.7% of smartphones sold, versus Apple’s 13.2%, which suggests that despite selling less in Q3, Apple profited more. That being said, we should note that despite pretty much taking all of the industry’s profits, Apple’s iPhone sales has actually been on the decline for the past three quarters now. Many expect this to change in 2017 with the new iPhone 8, but that remains to be seen. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about iPhone.

According to the previous report, the sales for smartwatch category has gone down by 50 percent with Apple leading the loss with 71.6 percent decline year-on-year. But according to a new report by Canalys, an analyst firm, Smartwatch sales have seen a 60 percent rise in the third quarter with Apple leading the way. The industry has seen a relative increase in sales volume from the third quarter in 2015, the first full quarter after the launch of Apple Watch in April 2015. According to the report, the industry saw an increase of about 60 percent in annual sales with shipments surpassing 6.1 million. Canalys Analyst, Daniel Matte added that Apple needs to make a strong marketing push for the holiday season. Image Credit: Canalys Apple Watch sales have been impacted by the slowing momentum of iPhone and the company needs to push the watch outside USA in countries like China. However, the report does point out that they need to watch the Q4 shipment volume to check the long term performance of Smartwatch industry. One thing to note is that both the reports put Apple as the top seller of Smartwatches with its Apple Watch regarding market share. IDC pointed that Smartwatches are not for everyone while Canalys, as mentioned above, needs to look at Q4 performance as reported by TechCrunch. One interesting fact that Canalys points out is that China saw a growth of about 42 percent from the previous year despite delays in both Android Wear 2.0 and Samsung Gear S3.

Comments Computerworld | Nov 4, 2016 3:58 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Apple Mac Internet of Things Artificial Intelligence Apple MacBook Pro Siri Artificial Intelligence (AI) Comments Imagine a Mac that told you when it was developing a problem. A Mac that could identify a rogue app demanding too much memory, or a component displaying symptoms that often come before it fails. Predictive maintenance This isn’t such a far-fetched reality, not only this, but it’s one that would be a finer and more focused expression of machine intelligence than asking your fridge to order you a liter of milk. This is already here in some industries, it even has a name, it’s called, “Predictive Maintenance”, and I think it should be woven inside of every Mac. Apple already has diagnostic and recovery tools built-inside Macs, and receives huge quantities of anonymized crash reports. This means Apple already has the data it needs to put through data analytics systems in order to identify failure trends, patterns, and symptoms. All it needs to do is connect this to the Macs (or iOS devices) you already use, and create some incredibly complex and hard to develop algorithms (the difficult bit). Anomaly alerts Engineers have relied on anomaly alerts for years. It's how they catch problems quickly. The evolution of connected devices offers new ways to deploy anomaly alerts, enabling a future in which machines, including Macs, can predict when they are likely to need maintenance. In case you think this is a far-fetched idea, let me reassure you that it isn’t. Even Coca-cola uses this kind of connected intelligence to keep its vending machines in good shape. These are capable of letting tech support know they have identified potential symptoms of a problem before a problem takes place. There are many other examples: ThyssenKrupp Elevator has developed a predictive monitoring system that gathers data from a range of sensors inside lifts in order to deliver things like maintenance alerts. This means engineers know when a lift is likely to fail and can schedule maintenance before it does, increasing up time. Ford has developed algorithms that monitor vehicle data in order to identify when the brakes need to be maintained, warning drivers with a text message when they do. Hadoop developer Hortonworks is collaborating with HARMAN Infotainment to create predictive software for vehicles. “Better predictive maintenance using IoT can reduce equipment downtime by up to 50 percent,” say McKinsey & Co. Machine intelligence and Macs We all want to maximize the amount of time our equipment works correctly, and this is very much the case when it comes to Macs. A predictive maintenance system for the platform would be great business for Apple, enabling the company to refine its tech support coverage and enabling customers to keep their Macs working effectively for longer. This could even be a business opportunity for the company. Imagine if such predictive maintenance were part of your Apple Car package? Not only would you be aware of a problem before it became a crisis, but your Mac could conceivably file a maintenance request with the company automatically, and tech support could then arrange a pick up, replacement and repair schedule with you. Apple has come under a lot of pressure from some in the media who seem to think the company hasn’t made a significant investment in artificial intelligence. A unique opportunity I’d argue that Apple has made such investments, and I’d point to things like the new Memories feature as evidence that its platforms already support the kind of intelligence that could in future support predictive maintenance systems for Apple products. Apple is perhaps unique in that it owns the whole widget, the hardware and the software, which means it has great insight into how its products run, and what kind of symptoms usually indicate a looming problem. This unique insight means Apple has a big advantage where it to choose to create its own machine intelligence for predictive product diagnostics. Introduction of such a service would be a massive benefit to Apple users, and a unique selling point other manufacturers would find it hard or impossible to easily match. Apple has a unique opportunity, and while meeting that opportunity is not at all trivial, the company has the R&D budget and the technical knowledge to meet the challenge – a company that can develop the world’s fastest mobile processor can certainly develop the smartest devices. I can’t wait until I can ask Siri for an up-to-date system diagnosis report. Google+?

Giants' rookies dress up for halloween The Voorhees, N.J., native didn't grow up an Eagles fan - he rooted for the Chargers and LaDainian Tomlinson - but he was surrounded by many who did. On Sunday, Apple and the Giants will face the Eagles in a pivotal NFC East showdown at MetLife Stadium. Giants beat writer James Kratch caught up with Apple earlier this week to talk about Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins, who like Apple is a Jersey/Ohio State guy, the NBA, Carson Wentz and more for this week's Giants 4 Down interview. 1ST DOWN: What is your relationship like with Malcolm Jenkins? EA: "We have a great relationship. That's someone I get with in the offseason. He's someone I've looked up to so much growing up, because I was a Buckeye fan and he was playing for the Buckeyes during the time I was really watching them. And even when I was at Ohio State, he would come around and talk to me a little bit, talk to the DBs, giving us some of his knowledge and what he's learned throughout the years. "He's very knowledgeable. He's a great DB. He's one of the best safeties, to me, in the league. He's someone I definitely look up to." 2ND DOWN: I know you won't go up against him directly, but what do you think it will be like to share a field with him Sunday? EA: "It's going to be great. It's competitive, of course. You want to beat them, and I'm sure he wants to beat us. It's just going to be about who wants it more between our teams. It's going to be fun seeing him. Especially after the game. Hopefully I get a jersey swap with him. But I'm focused on winning first." Apple responds to his mom 3RD DOWN: I know you say you weren't an Eagles fans growing up in South Jersey. But your friends likely were. Are they giving you hell this week? EA: "They're wishing me good luck. But of course they're saying they're still going to root for their team. I understand that, but it's going to be my job to kind of break their hearts a little bit." 4TH DOWN: You and Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz were on the same flight home to Philly after the NFL Draft. Did you guys talk on the plane? EA: "We talked a little bit. He's a great guy." JK: Did you tell him you planned on picking him off? EA: "I did. I was talking to him about that. It was all fun." EXTRA POINT: I saw you breaking down the Warriors the other day on Twitter. Are you a hoops junkie? EA: "I am a big NBA guy. Anytime I have a chance to watch any NBA team, or NBA game, I try to keep up with it. I like Steph Curry, so I try to follow him. I'm kind of liking the Trail Blazers a lot more. I play with them a lot on (NBA) 2K. I like to watch Damion Lillard, he's one of my favorites. And I'm trying to root for the Knicks, and make a couple of games this year. They're close, and they're supposed to be good this year." James Kratch may be reached at jkratch@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @JamesKratch.

Anyone who's lost a pricey iPhone or Apple Watch will tell you it's game-changing. Currently, Apple's "Find My iPhone" feature, which shows a device's location on a map, must be enabled before your device was lost or stolen to find it, according to Apple's website. That means owners must hope the battery doesn't run out before the device is tracked down. The new process might use emails or texts to transmit codes, pictures, voice input or patterns, according to the patent, which was released Thursday. No word from Apple on when the feature might become available, and what device might get it. But in the meantime, if you lose your device when it's off, you can still put it in "lost mode," lock it, or remotely erase it, according to Apple's website.

The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern weighs in on Too Embarrassed to Ask. by Eric Johnson@HeyHeyESJ Nov 4, 2016, 6:30am EDT tweet share Linkedin Photo by Stephen Lam/Getty Images Apple is getting ready to launch its long-awaited refresh of the MacBook Pro, and there are two big changes in store, other than (of course) thinner hardware. One of those changes is, on two out of the three new laptops, a touch-enabled strip above the keyboard called the Touch Bar. On the latest episode of Too Embarrassed to Ask, Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern debated how important the Touch Bar is with Recode’s Kara Swisher and The Verge’s Lauren Goode. “I wrote in my hands-on piece from the event that it did feel like a gimmick, that the only thing that was really splashy that Apple could talk about was this cool touch strip,” Stern said. “If it [the MacBook] didn’t have that, I’m not sure it would have really held an event.” The other big change to the MacBook Pros: Their prices. Specifically, they’re higher. “This is a lot of money to spend on a laptop,” Stern said of the new models, whose starting prices range from $1,500 to $2,400. “Sure, we don’t buy laptops as frequently as we used to, so maybe you say, ‘Okay, I’m going to make this investment in that.’ But there are plenty of good Windows laptops with better specs, frankly, and touchscreens, that cost half the price.” On the new podcast, the trio also talked about Microsoft’s new hardware, including the Surface Studio desktop computer and the new Surface Books. And a big topic of discussion was Apple’s removal of standard USB ports from its computers, which raises the need for dongles. “How many dongles will we need?” one listener wrote in. “All the dongles,” she said. “You can get what I call ‘super dongles.’ That is a word that I got in the Wall Street Journal, a very proud moment for me.” Have questions about Apple and Microsoft’s new hardware that we didn’t get to in this episode?

Home Auto Gadgets Hardware Internet IT Science Software Blogs Polls Submit News Gadgets Do You Know What Products Apple Made Decades Ago? Saimin (Blog) - November 4, 2016 5:30 AM Print Recipient E-mail Sender E-mail iPod Socks Leading innovator, Apple started to introducing a variety of products to the market decades ago after the Apple computer and during Steve Job’s exile from the company. As a new startup, today’s tech giant faced many product disappointments which failed to reach the market and where forgotten by the world. Here are a few which did not survive or fulfill the company’s expectations.       This was the world’s first digital camera (QuickTake 100) with Kodak cooperation, and went on sale for under $800.00, but did not do well in the market. This was one of the products that Apple didn’t design.     While, the original inventor was Kodak, it is not certain why Kodak wanted to bring Apple in. Maybe it was to save Kodak’s film industry that was doing well at the time. After three years of struggling sales, the QuickTake 100 was finally put to an end in 1997.   Then in 1979, while the Apple II was the greatest desktop computer that the company offered, (I still I own one), an irritating and inconvenient Drawing and sketching digitally board was developed.     Photo: Edible Apple   To solve this problem Apple made accessories for the Apple II Graphics Tablet.  The new device not only did not help with the defects but it diverted to another kind.     All the items went in the market and were not cheap. The tablet pictured above was priced somewhere around $650.00. This time the issue was interference with radio frequency again it was discontinued.   Here is one I never understood, from the tech giant!!! What is it? Winter is coming, so you must buy a coat for your electronics or Apple was desperate and hopeless?     Yes, as they say, iPods were cool so Apple made a fuzzy and warm outfit for MP3 player. So, this fuzzy and warm coat protect the iPods and made it scratch free, iPod winter outfit came in a pack of 6 for $29.00 and stayed in the market for eight years.     Years before the PlayStation was as big as it is now, and was followed by Microsoft with their first Xbox, Apple get interested and followed in Microsoft’s footsteps. Apple stepped into the gaming industry with their own first-and-only console the Apple Pippin. The Pippin was manufactured and flood the market with 100,000 unit.     This new gaming device ran on a simple version of Mac OS and sold for under $600.00. I believe that the Japanese videogame company “ Bandai” had part in this project and lunching it. But to what extent they were involved I am not sure.  However, the Pippin was another device of Apple that failed to heat up the market and only 42,000 units was sold.     Apple started thinking of entering in TV market and entered with the market with the Macintosh TV. This combined (hybrid) device was a cross between a desktop computer and a cable–ready television. The Macintosh TV had a promising market and it was introduced in 1993 with 3MB RAM, 160 MB hard drive, and a 14-inch display. It was priced at over $2000.00. This was once again  a failure for Apple as it entered the market and sold only 10,000 units. With poor performance, this product also discontinued after four months.   Another dream of the company was the “Apple Newton MessagePad”     John Sculley became CEO of Apple after Job Steve had been fired during those unsuccessful years Apple launched new products which all failed.  and Apple Newton MessagePad was one of them.   It is interesting to know that these products were new cheap and sold for a high price at the time even though they did not work the way they should.  I think Apple got lucky and got away from big lawsuits “Just an opinion”.   This time the new device supposedly was going to the first mobile touch-based consumer products handwriting recognition. As it shown in the picture, users could use a stylus to write, and the device would convert it to text.   This product sold for almost $700 and was another failure for Apple. It did not stay in the market for long. Apple sold 50,000 units in the first four months and discontinued it after five years.   Later, Apple started to revolutionized mobile computing with the iPhone, iPad and more. The outcome of this should be clear to everyone. Nothing comes easy. You must start somewhere and continue to work, learn, and take step toward to improvement and success. All dreamers should continue to dream. Good Luck.  "We’re Apple. We don’t wear suits. We don’t even own suits." -- Apple CEO Steve Jobs Latest Headlines Black Friday is Ahead.

By Sarmistha Acharya November 4, 2016 11:09 GMT Huawei wants to be world's second-largest smartphone maker Reuters Chinese tech major Huawei said it wants to become the world's second-largest smartphone manufacturer over the next two year, replacing iPhone maker Apple. Currently Huawei is the third-biggest smartphone vendor after Apple and world leader Samsung. Richard Yu, Huawei's chief executive for consumer business group revealed the company's latest goal at a launch event on 3 November in Munich. "When we announced four years ago that we wanted to sell phones, people told us we were crazy. When we said we wanted to sell 100 million phones, they told us we were crazy," said Yu. "We are going to take them [Apple] step-by-step, innovation-by-innovation," he noted and adding that the company expected to improve Huawei's position along with technology shifts. According to the latest research by Strategy Analytics, Huawei was at the third place in the list of global smartphone vendor shipments in the third quarter of 2016, selling 33.6 million smartphones. Woody Oh, director at Strategy Analytics said in a statement: "Huawei maintained third position with 9% global smartphone marketshare in Q3 2016, up from 8% a year ago. Huawei's smartphone growth rate has more than halved, to 26% annually in Q3 2016, compared with 62% annual growth in Q3 2015. Huawei is facing intense competition from OPPO, Vivo and other emerging Chinese rivals such as fast-growing LeEco." Samsung retained the top position and sold 75.3 million smartphones during the same period, followed by Apple, which sold 45.5 million units. "There will be more opportunities. Artificial intelligence, virtual reality, augmented reality. It is like driving a car. At every curve or turn, there is an opportunity to overtake the competition," Yu stressed. At its global launch event, the company unveiled two premium Mate series handsets – Huawei Mate 9 and its Porsche Design variant. Both use custom Kirin 960 mobile processors for fast computing performance, SuperCharge technology and a new UX. The Mate 9 costs €699 (£621), while the Porsche Design model at €1395. With the new Mate 9 handset, Yu hopes to break into European markets such as Germany, France and UK. "In Finland, we are already number one," he said, "Step-by-step we are winning the trust and loyalty of the customers. It is about trust and loyalty."

November 4 AAPL: 108.84 -0.99 Apple iPhone captures 103.6% of smartphone industry profits in Q3, according to analyst estimates Benjamin Mayo - 2 weeks ago @bzamayo iPhone 7 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple has recorded an insane mobile phone profit share in the third quarter, according to analysts at BMO Capital Markets. They estimate Apple captured 103.6% of total smartphone industry profits, with Samsung trailing far behind at just 0.9%. The reason Apple can take more than 100% of profits is because the majority of vendors lost money and recorded losses on their smartphone division, such as LG and HTC. On a units basis, Samsung led with 21.7% of smartphones sold with Apple placing second at 13.2% share. This is the first time Apple has recorded industry profits in excess of 100% thanks to Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 recall blunders and strong demand for iPhone 7. Apple and Samsung have been dominating smartphone industry profits for some time, with Apple sitting in the 90%-95% range for several years now due to the explosive growth of iPhone without lowering average selling price. The report said Apple achieved 90% profit share in the same quarter a year ago. A perfect storm of Samsung product mishaps and the launch of a new iPhone enabled Apple to top 100% profit share for the first time. It is unlikely that Apple will be able to sustain levels above >100% long-term. Nevertheless, it is symbolic of the company’s immense size and monopolistic power on consumer’s wallets. With just 13.2% of shipments, iPhone easily laps its competitors — combined — on a revenue and income basis. The achievement comes at the same as Apple is criticised by investors for struggling to grow; iPhone sales growth is slowing dramatically and the company broke its 13 year streak of record quarterly earnings earlier this year. Apple expects to return to revenue growth in the holiday quarter — largely driven by sales of the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.

A few car makers have probably also breathed a sigh of relief as they feared the financial power of these technology giants would turn them into simple hardware suppliers over the next decades or so. That won't be the case for now, it would appear, as recent reports suggested Apple has given up on its plan to build a vehicle while Google never expressed such an intention. However, since transportation is always going to be a profitable market, Apple isn't out of it for good. Following the latest developments, the consensus was that Apple was switching its focus on autonomous driving technology, because what else could a company with such a profile be working on, right? Right, but there might be more to it. Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst for KGI Securities that gathers intelligence from his contacts in Apple's Asian supply chain and assembles it into usable pieces of information, believes the Californian giant is working on an augmented reality system that will be integrated into its larger autonomous vehicle package. But what is augmented reality? In short, it's a technology that allows the overlaying of computer-generated images over the outside world, enriching the user's experience and providing them with additional information. That means it would be invaluable to have in a car, be it autonomous or not. "Assuming Apple successfully develops AR," Ming-Chi Kuo's report quoted by MacRumors read, "we predict the firm will enjoy the following competitive advantages: (1) redefining existing key products and leading competitors by three to five years. For instance, this could happen for iPhone, iPad and Mac; (2) eliminating obstacles of Apple Watch and Apple TV by offering an innovative user experience; and (3) entering new business fields, such as autonomous driving system." OK, so all you Android users out there can enjoy it while it lasts, because if Mr. Kuo is right and Apple is working on introducing AR technology inside the vehicles, it could make the company a trendsetter once again. And if owning an iPhone will make the difference between a plain windshield and one that shows tons of overlaid information, you will be buying one in a heartbeat. apple car Apple autonomous augmented reality technology   A Story about Expensive Car Warranties and Respect The Dos and Don’ts of Washing a Motorcycle, Part One Five Crazy Alternatives For The Design Of The U.S. Presidential Limo For 2017 What if Jaguar and Land Rover Weren't British Anymore?

Optical audio output is used to link Macs to home theater setups and A/V systems capable of multi-channel surround sound, by way of a mini TOSlink adapter connected to the 3.5mm jack. The removal of optical audio was first noted by AppleInsider, after it was discovered that Apple's technical specifications for the headphone jack no longer mentions support for "audio line out (digital/analog)". Removal of the standard was confirmed by comparing the System Profiler report on a new 13-inch MacBook Pro, which makes no mention of S/PDIF Optical Digital Audio Output, against reports on 2015 models, which do. Support for optical audio out, as it appears on a 2015 13-inch MacBook Pro When queried about the removal, Apple said the feature was dropped due to a lack of customers using the functionality, noting that "plenty of USB-C zero-latency professional peripherals are available now, or coming very soon" with optical audio out connectivity. The phasing out of the standard from the new MacBook Pro models follows a trend that began with the Apple TV. Apple ditched the optical audio port on the fourth generation Apple TV in favor of a USB-C port, preventing users from connecting headphones directly to the device. 385 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) Quu 2 weeks ago Of course they lack optical out.

Native core audio with simple digital audio output is one of the essential reasons that these laptops have always been the best for audio and music. NOW THEY'VE TAKEN IT AWAY SO THEY SAVE A PENNY! I hate you apple! (Never thought I'd every say that)" When you align this to what Phil Shiller said, you can't not shake your head in disbelief: "Is it inconsistent to keep the 3.5mm headphone jack as it’s no longer on the latest iPhone? Not at all. These are pro machines. If it was just about headphones then it doesn’t need to be there, we believe that wireless is a great solution for headphones. But many users have setups with studio monitors, amps, and other pro audio gear that do not have wireless solutions and need the 3.5mm jack." Whatever this machine is, it's certainly ain't pro. Rating: 47 Votes gpat 2 weeks ago ... so this invalidates Phil Schiller's answer about the audio jack? Rating: 37 Votes iKrivetko 2 weeks ago I bet most of the people moaning about it have never even used optical audio and have little clue about what it does. Rating: 34 Votes Morpheo 2 weeks ago I'm with Apple on this one. I wonder how many people used this feature on the previous gen. Just because it's there doesn't mean it's useful. If you call yourself a "pro" you're probably using something else for your digital I/O needs.

Rating: 28 Votes syndalis 2 weeks ago Be less mad at Apple and be mad at the industry that has more or less universally discarded the standard. TOSlink is hardly on anything being made any more. As an owner of 5.1 wireless headphones that rely on TOSlink to work, let me point you im the direction of a Tendak TOSlink breakout box for HDMI.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Apple iPad Air 3 Makes it to the Rumor Mills Anew Despite Reports that American Tech Giant is Looking to Release the iPad Pro 2, More Details Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: November 05, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» This month marks the first year of the Apple iPad Pro in the global retail markets so it is only natural that reports about the arrival of its impending successor, the iPad Pro 2, swirl around. For some reason, the speculations about the possible release of the iPad Pro 2 also comes with rumors about the Apple iPad Air 3, which seems to have vanished online after the release of the iPad Pro 9.7in in March this year. Tech enthusiasts believed that the iPad Pro 9.7in is, in fact, the renamed Apple iPad Air 3 so when the former device was launched by the American tech giant and made it into the retail markets in March this year, the rumors about the iPad Air 3 died down. The Apple iPad Air 2 officially came out of the market in October 2014 so it has already been more than two years without a refresh. That could have been the reason why the rumors on the Apple iPad Air 3 were suddenly resurrected. However, since Apple has yet to make a statement to confirm or deny the rumors about the iPad Air 3, everything about the device remains speculation at this point in time. The end of the line? With the release of the iPad Pro in November last year and the iPad Pro 9.7in in March this year, there were reports saying that Apple has already ended its popular iPad Air line. According to speculations, because of the success of the new iPad Pro lines, both the big and small one, Apple has decided to do away with the iPad Air tablet line and that it may no longer release an iPad Air 3, details Game & Guide. However, the rumors about the Apple iPad Air 3 might have died down but it continued silently to stay rife and now it started heating up again. In fact, the latest rumors are also saying that Apple could unveil both the iPad Pro 2 and the iPad Air 3 at the same time sometime soon and keep both tablet series alive. Based on the speculations, the Apple iPad Air 3 will come out sometime next year powered by Apple’s A9X processor with 4GB of RAM and will include an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera and a 2.1-megapixel front-facing snapper, details the International Business Times of Australia. Superb features and capabilities Based on previous speculations, the iPad Air 3 will come out with superb features and capabilities. It shall come out equipped with a 4K resolution panel, based on the revelation of sources in the Taiwan supply chain. Although the typical 4K resolutions do not quite fit the signature 4:3 aspect ratio of the iPad Air line, Apple has the capability to pack enough pixels into the display to make it comparable in terms of overall pixel count to what is commonly known as a 4K display. Another interesting rumor about the iPad Air 3 is that it would have a generous 4GB of RAM, which suggests that it may include different levels of main memory in different models, potentially based on storage tier. The reports are also consistent about the processor of the Apple iPad Air 3, which will be the A9X chipset, the same processor found on the iPad Pro. Just by imagining these basic features alone, users are already saying that the iPad Air 3 is really worth the wait, particularly those who did not jump on the bandwagon of the iPad Pro and ditch their 9.7-inch tablet in favor of a bigger and more professional-looking one.

 Angry Apple supporters in Ireland are planning a march through the streets of Athenry Sam Shead Nov. 4, 2016, 6:22 AM 2,424 facebook linkedin twitter email print A pub in Athenry.Business Insider/Sam Shead People in a small town in Ireland are planning a march this weekend to show that they support Apple's plans to build a data centre in their area. Apple is trying to build an €850 million (£756 million) server farm in a forest just outside Athenry, County Galway. However, a small handful of locals have been doing their best to derail the project in recent months, filing complaints with the Galway County Council, local planning body An Bord Pleanála, and now the High Court. In a bid to show that the wider Athenry community is in support of Apple's plans, local residents are planning a march through the town centre this Sunday. Many of them are deeply upset that Apple's data centre is facing ongoing delays and some of them are concerned that Apple will abandon its plans altogether if it's held up much longer.  The march will take place the day before Apple seeks High Court approval to fast-track a judicial review over planning approval for the data centre. A Facebook event created by a man named Dale Pinto indicates that the march will begin at 11:45am. The event description reads: "We want to show Apple, and the whole world, that the vast majority of Athenry people support wholeheartedly Apple's desire to open a data centre near our town PLEASE ATTEND THIS EVENT, AND MAKE EVERYONE YOU KNOW AWARE OF IT. This is a marvellous opportunity for Athenry, and the West Of Ireland. Please do not let this opportunity slip through our fingers. PLEASE DO NOT UPSET THE APPLECART" Apple's west Ireland data centre is facing an 18 month delay after three Irish residents — Allan Daly, Sinead Fitzpatrick, and Brian McDonagh — appealed against a local planning body giving the development the green light in August. A computer-generated image of Apple's data centre in Ireland.Apple Apple has asked the High Court to fast-track the legal challenge brought about by the three individuals. It specifically wants to put the dispute on a "commercial list," which is a dedicated court division designed to deal with legal disputes that have more than €1 million (£900,000) at stake. The High Court will consider the motion on November 7. If it agrees, then the dispute will likely be settled within six months. Apple wants to build eight data halls on a 500-acre site in Derrydonnell Forest, which is owned by state-sponsored forestry firm Coillte, and situated roughly three miles from Athenry. Apple first announced the data centre in February 2015, saying at the time that it will build a similar facility in Denmark, which is already well underway. Apple wants to use the data centres to store European user data and to help power online services, including the iTunes Store, the App Store, iMessage, Maps, and Siri for customers across Europe, according to a press release.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock returns MacBook Pro ports Apple removed JC Torres - Nov 4, 2016 3 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit The long-awaited MacBook Pro refresh turned out to also be the perhaps the most controversial. Apple giveth, and Apple taketh away. While it added the novelty of a Touch Bar, at least for the higher-end model, it practically stripped the MacBook of every other port other than Thunderbolt 3/USB-C. Even worse for the entry-level model that only has two such ports. For those with port anxiety, OWC is offering a fix in the form of its Thunderbolt 3 Dock that offers 13, yes read that, 13, ports just for the price of one port on your MacBook Pro. 2 Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports, 5 USB 3.1 ports, FireWire 800, Gigabit Ethernet, mini DisplayPort, SD Card reader, audio combo port, S/PDIF digital audio. That’s what you’re getting when you sink your teeth into this OWC accessory. While that might not seem that different from other docks, considering what you’re losing on the late 2016 MacBook Pro, it will probably blow your mind. And some of those ports have extra power as well. The Thunderbolt 3 ports, for example, can daisy chain up to 5 other Thunderbolt 3 devices. And two of the USB 3.1 ports can also be used to power or charge mobile devices. Although not mentioned explicitly, Apple’s removable of all other ports in favor of Thunderbolt 3 is a practically an advertisement of the connector’s power because, unlike your run of the mill USB ports, a single Thunderbolt can be used to connect, not to mention power, so much more. Of course, it comes at the price of having yet another accessory to put in your bag or potentially lose, but if you’re aiming for that Touch Bar, you have very little choice. The OWC Thunderbolt 3 Doc is now available for pre-order for a price of $279. Shipping begins February 2017 and includes a 0.5 m Thunderbolt 3 40 Gb/s USB-C cable for absolutely no extra charge.

Panic, perhaps The Guardian 11/4/2016 Suzanne McGee © HBO/2016 Home Box Office, Inc. All Want to watch Game of Thrones on your AT&T smartphone? You could be in luck if the proposed merger goes through. Editor’s note: The opinions in this article are the author’s, as published by our content partner, and do not necessarily represent the views of MSN or Microsoft. The dealmakers behind the proposed mega-merger of AT&T and Time Warner have accomplished the impossible: uniting Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders in their condemnation of the deal. Trump, needless to say, has been the most vituperative. The merger would “destroy democracy”, he said. But pretty much everyone in Washington has publicly come out against it. Sanders, Clinton’s opponent for the Democratic nomination and now campaigning on her behalf, is already preparing to battle a future Clinton administration to ensure that anti-trust regulators turn thumbs-down on the deal. Lining up beside him? Powerhouse senator Elizabeth Warren. Quotes in the article Time Warner Inc TWX = 86.80 0.00 0.00% AT&T Inc T ▼ 36.13 -0.38 -1.04% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 105.71 -2.72 -2.51% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▼ 58.12 -0.90 -1.52% The two companies and their bankers must feel that they have walked straight into a buzzsaw. The Senate will hold a hearing on it on 7 December, after the election. Will tempers have cooled by then? Maybe, maybe not. So, what on earth drove Time Warner and AT&T to sprint to the altar during an election season in which populist politicians are dominating the airwaves and the debate? Insanity? Desperation? A sense that there was an opportunity that was just too good to pass up? Or simply an urge to annoy the politicians? The word to bear in mind might simply be “panic”. It’s no shock to anyone who keeps an eye on these worlds that companies that distribute all the content that we consume, and the companies that produce it (translation: AT&T as the party of the first part, and Time Warner as the party of the second part) have a vested interest in forging alliances among themselves. The closer and more seamless those alliances are, the faster and more creatively they can work on developing and delivering more of that content for all our devices, especially those smartphones and tablets from which we are unable to wean ourselves. Those that get it right have captive audiences simply because they are delivering a growing proportion of that content. It’s an enticing prospect. Analysts have been expecting that we’d see yet another wave of convergence – a buzzword in this media/telecommunications universe for the better part of two decades now, having been behind the merger that formed Time Warner itself in 1995 – for several years. This time, it’s happening in different ways, not always via mergers. Apple and Time Warner’s HBO have linked their brands already, with Apple distributing the HBO Now service. Imagine what might happen if Apple – with its cash mountain – decided to snap up HBO’s parent company, Time Warner, and pursue the myriad potential synergies between its own platforms and Time Warner’s content? I suspect it’s safe to say that the folks at AT&T did just that – and panicked. Or else they considered what might happen if another giant rival with the potential to build a mammoth platform and plenty of cash – like Google, which has already pushed into live-TV streaming – pre-empted them. Or they allowed companies like Amazon or Netflix to get further ahead with their own plans. Facing that kind of strategic risk, a little bit of political risk may not look like anything terribly threatening. Sure, the politicians may indulge in a lot of saber rattling for the benefit of voters, especially since the deal was announced in the final days of the presidential election campaign. But it will be many months before regulators will rule on it – even if a deep-pocketed rival doesn’t muscle in and outbid AT&T for Time Warner. Will the public outrage endure? The dealmakers and the board members at both companies seem to be making a calculated decision that the answer is “no”. That seems optimistic. We already pay far more than citizens in most other parts of the world for basic broadband access, thanks to the fact that most communities offer very limited options to their citizens. Most telecommunications services are equally pricey, relative to those offered elsewhere, from mobile phones to cable television services. The number of cord-cutters continue to grow. Related: What will AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner mean for customers? The two companies have an idea of what they’ll do to keep their own customers loyal. “Premium content always wins,” said Randall Stephenson, CEO and chairman of AT&T, in the company’s press release announcing the transaction. “We’ll have the world’s best premium content with the networks to deliver it to every screen. A big customer pain point is paying for content once but not being able to access it on any device, anywhere. Our goal is to solve that.” At what price, though? Stephenson does refer to delivering “value” to customers, and certainly, you can expect to hear Time Warner and AT&T insist that because their proposed match is a “vertical” merger rather than a “horizontal” one, this should pose less of an antitrust threat. In other words, consumers won’t see prices soar as a result of reduced competition. In a horizontal transaction, two companies that compete to provide roughly the same kind of services or goods (think, Cox Communications and Comcast), merge and become one, meaning that there are fewer entities involved in setting prices for content as purchasers, or for services as providers. In a vertical transaction, such as the proposed merger, companies that are in different parts of the business (in this case, content and distribution) join forces. But in markets where competition is already restricted – such as, say, the internet – price increases could be a result of even vertical mergers. That’s the conclusion of studies by one economist, John Kwoka of Northeastern University, who found that of the 1,000 mergers of all kinds that he evaluated over the last two decades, at least a third generated price increases in excess of 10%. A remarkable 80% of them raised prices to consumers to some degree; the average increase was about 7%. Ponder that, antitrust regulators. There are plenty of ways in which this could happen. For instance, all of the programming that Time Warner produces could suddenly become unavailable to competitors to the newly merged entity’s rival distributors, except at a much higher price. You have an AT&T smartphone and want to watch the latest episode of Game of Thrones? Congrats – you can do so on any device you own for half the price you’d pay if you have a Verizon phone and want to watch on your iPad. It’s up to the politicians not just to be blowhards about the deal or threaten to axe it. Consumers may end up with great, efficiently delivered and fairly priced content as a result of mergers like the one that AT&T and Time Warner are proposing. The trick is to ensure how that potential is realized. Will the regulators do their job? That’s why what happens in the weeks following the election is going to be so crucial. Who will the new president choose to advise her (or him) on issues like commerce and telecommunications? Who will (s)he tap for membership on the Federal Trade Commission (which governs antitrust issues) and the Federal Communications Commission (which oversees telecommunications policy, and of which the next president must name a new chairman), two of the key regulators associated with this industry? Regulators have the ability to lay down the law and make the deal much more consumer-friendly in any number of ways, demanding (for instance) that the new company make HBO shows available more readily via apps or streaming, meaning that we wouldn’t be forced to sign up for costly packages. For once, all the heated political rhetoric might come in useful, if it ensures that the regulators keep their eye on the ball. I wish I was confident that the attention span of outraged politicians was as long as that of the strategic thinkers and panicky dealmakers – but I’m not.

Image: Apple Apple’s New Touch Bar May Present Usability Challenges For Blind Users Written by Yael Grauer Contributor November 4, 2016 // 05:00 AM EST Copy This URL When Apple recently announced that its new MacBook Pro will have a touch-enabled OLED strip of glass built into the top strip of the keyboard in lieu of physical function keys, users took note. One common concern is that the Escape key will not be available in all contexts, with users having to click the desktop to make it appear. Blind users had their own set of concerns. The keyboard command for toggling VoiceOver (the screen-reading technology integrated into macOS) is Command + F5, which would be difficult to find without being able to physically feel the F5 key. And while Apple has confirmed that the Touch Bar will work with VoiceOver—users can activate it by holding the Command key and pressing the Touch ID button three times or by double-tapping the Touch Bar with three fingers—it's not a given that the touch-sensitive OLED strip is any more effective than a traditional row of function keys. Léonie Watson, principal engineer at the accessibility agency The Paciello Group, suggested that the touch interfaces are slower for blind users like herself than for sighted keyboard users. “There’s a huge degradation in typing efficiency,” she said, noting that VoiceOver users would have to wait for the screen reader to identify the Touch Bar key before they’re able to type. (Watson did note, however, that this comparative typing inefficiency hasn’t prevented the iPhone and iPad from becoming popular among blind users.) And because the Touch Bar only has limited space, Watson believes blind users may eventually be able to learn the position of the “keys” it displays in its various configuration, and that muscle memory will help with locating the correct “key.” While the Touch Bar may present accessibility challenges, Noel Runyan, an access technology engineer who is blind, believes some of these challenges might be able to be addressed through software accommodations. “As with iPhones, tactile feedback in the form of vibration of the Touch Bar panel or of the whole keyboard case might be helpful for some users who are deaf-blind,” said Runyan. Haptic feedback in the Touch Bar “keys” that simulate a mouse click might reinforce those interactions—something that could be helpful for sighted users who are more comfortable with physical keys. Runyan also suggested that tactile guide strips, such as rubber dots affixed to the Touch Bar, could help users find “keys,” though this could become more difficult when key positions change within specific apps. "For some users who are blind," he added, "the functions of the Mac Touch Bar might have to be accomplished through special handling by their screen review software and external refreshable braille display.” For its part, Apple sells accessibility accessories in its shop, even though the accessories are made by third party vendors.

On the wall are photos of children in Haiti using their products. The couple donate a bar of soap to a child in need for every bar sold. by Lauren McCutcheon, For The Inquirer Close icon Lauren McCutcheon For The Inquirer It was 2011, and Bill Glaab, in financial sales at the time, was feeling uninspired in his job. Slideshow Philadelphia couple's soaps go to Haiti - and Target Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon So he and his photographer wife, Courtney Apple, spent their spare time talking about business opportunities they felt passionate about. They researched until Glaab's reading led to his aha! moment: Nearly 5 million children younger than 5 die every year from water-related illnesses that could be prevented with hand-washing and clean water. And so Hand in Hand was born. Like its charitable entrepreneurial predecessors Tom's Shoes and Warby Parker, for every product sold, Hand in Hand would give another to someone in need. Five years later, Hand in Hand is in 500 boutiques, and on Sunday, 61,000 of its soaps in holiday scents will hit 1,792 Target stores nationwide - a big development for a company that started in the couple's small apartment in Washington Square West. When the two started out, Apple insisted their wares be eco-friendly and stylish. "How could we make this simple bar of soap stand out?" she recalled asking. Still a photographer, she serves as the company's creative director. "We came up with a list of what's bad about soap - the don'ts," said Glaab, who now works full time as the company's CEO. Palm, for example, is "good for your skin, but not good for the environment," he said. "We realized our bar of soap is going to cost twice as much because it's palm-free." Other contents they leave out: petrochemicals and parabens. They sourced a third-party manufacturer in Vermont to create a proprietary formula. Their first bar soap was orange blossom. It remains their most popular scent. For packaging, they leaned on friend and former Philadelphian Joy Cho, a lifestyle blogger and graphic designer who has created products for Target and Land of Nod. They hired British illustrator Emma Block to create original art for their wrappers. They enlisted Glaab's father, a cabinetmaker, to build miniature orange crates to transport samples to 75 members of the media. It worked. Daily Candy introduced Hand in Hand to an audience of one million subscribers. InStyle featured the company. So did Cho's blog. Anthropologie called and became Hand in Hand's first major client. The couple also quickly found a market for their donations. Cholera had broken out in Haiti after the major earthquake near Port-au-Prince in 2010. Approximately 300,000 people perished in the quake. Hundreds of thousands more were displaced and thousands were coming down with a waterborne illness. Apple and Glaab connected with the Haiti relief group My Neighbor's Children in Orlando. The charity's appeal, they said, was its small size and targeted impact. The nonprofit arranged for the couple to visit the Bon Samaritan orphanage outside Port-au-Prince in 2012. Glaab described the facility as "175 kids, 40 beds, no food - and the kids had worms." "The second we got there, it was so eye-opening, seeing the destruction from the earthquake. It was a lot for us. We were able to go to orphanages, hand out soap," said Apple. "You could tell [the soap] meant more to the children than we would ever understand. Watching them pick up a bar and close their eyes and sniff it, we realized this is why we're doing what we're doing." They also realized they could help provide clean water. The next year, Hand in Hand funded a new well in Onaville, site of the country's largest displaced persons camp and where, Apple said, "people were walking seven, 10 miles a day for water." To date, Hand in Hand has built or repaired four wells in Haiti and given out 350,000 bars of soap. Bon Samaritan now has its own kitchen. The residence's children have school uniforms and books. A month ago, the company sent 50,000 additional bars of soap to Haiti after Hurricane Matthew. Next, the company plans to fund a fifth well with proceeds from its holiday soaps. Hand in Hand now has two more employees, who have also traveled to Haiti to distribute soap. This is the first year the founders plan to pay themselves salaries. It's about time: They're expecting their first child in early December, offering a new perspective on the company's mission. "With a baby on the way, we want to make sure we show how important it is to do something you love and how important is it to give back to others," Glaab said. Since 2011, the company's product line has expanded to include lip balm, sugar scrub, candles, liquid soap, lotion, bath salt, face tonic, and room spray. Starting this weekend, Target's beauty sections will carry three scents: juniper berry (red currant, juniper berry, vanilla, rose), frosted pine (pine, orange, clove, cinnamon, amber), and winter woods (tobacco and vanilla bourbon, anise, cedar, clove, nutmeg). Each 4.5-ounce bar will retail for $5.99, although soaps in smaller stores typically sell for $8 to $9 apiece. Glaab described the move into Target stores as a "pivot." And it's not just temporary. After seven weeks, the stores will stock Hand in Hand's regular line. Apple and Glaab aren't sure how their products' presence in a discount retailer will affect their boutique business. They anticipate selling Target 500,000 to 600,000 bars per year. "We're trying to become a brand for everyone, not necessarily people who can just afford it. We want our product to resonate with more people," Glaab said. Added Apple, "Why can't an everyday shopper make a difference?"

So, in November, you might expect to find holiday sales and deals — and you’re right. However, there are a few items that go on sale during November you probably wouldn’t expect. Best Things to Buy in November November is perfectly situated between some major holidays — so budget-conscious shoppers can benefit in several ways. Halloween is over, allowing candy lovers to grab what’s left at huge discounts. With Thanksgiving just around the corner, Black Friday is almost here — and so are the gift deals as we make our way into Christmas. Black Friday Electronics and TVs Yes, a lot of things go on sale in November because of Black Friday, but that doesn’t mean you’re always getting a deal. In fact, there are only a few key items you should actually purchase on Black Friday — mostly electronics. Off-brand electronics offer some of the best deals that day, but if you’re looking to buy a major brand name TV or laptop at a significant discount, wait until Cyber Monday, or even next month when retailers are clearing out stock to make room for newer 2017 models. You can also find Black Friday deals on Apple products — if you know where to look. “Everything from iPads to Apple Watches can be a great buy on Black Friday, with two big qualifiers: Buy one generation old, and don’t buy from the Apple Store,” said Benjamin Glaser, features editor with DealNews. “Brand new devices don’t see as significant discounts, and the Apple Store is always undercut by resellers like Best Buy and Micro Center.” Wedding Dresses Doesn’t it seem like all of your friends are getting engaged during the holiday season? Well, those in the wedding industry have noticed as well: Bridal shops start stocking up on dresses in November in preparation for Christmas and New Year’s Day engagements. Also, to make room for the new wedding dress designs that come out in November, bridal shops want to get rid of last year’s styles. Because of this, you can save up to 70 percent on everything from wedding dresses to bridesmaid dresses and more. So expect to find some of the best deals on wedding dresses and other bridal sales this month. Tools and Hardware Most people aren’t thinking about home improvement projects in the winter — after all, it’s time for holiday parties and entertaining guests. This means that in November you can find some great sales on tools and hardware from places like Home Depot and Sears during Black Friday. Many of these items — like toolboxes and drill sets — will also make great Christmas gifts come December, which means these deals have come at the perfect time. And who knows, maybe it’s also the perfect time for you to finally repaint your guest room before your in-laws come in December. Kitchen Appliances and Cookware “Whether you’re a casual cook or an everyday chef, November is the absolute best time to buy kitchen goods and appliances,” said Glaser. “Even high-end devices like KitchenAid mixers and Pyrex container sets will see extraordinary deals.” From Keurigs to juicers to Crock Pots, Black Friday appliance sales will be abundant. But you should also be looking for deals on even bigger appliances like refrigerators, washers and dryers from stores like Best Buy and Home Depot. If you really want to impress your holiday guests this December, November offers some great deals on cookware and bakeware, as well. Check out stores like Kohl’s and JCPenney. Worst Things to Buy in November Although there are many deals to be had this November, don’t let yourself get carried away with Black Friday sales — because not every sale is a bargain. New Video Game Consoles Even though it’s possible to find video game bundles on sale this November — especially for older consoles — newer gaming consoles won’t see deep discounts for Black Friday. “The PlayStation Pro is so new, it will not see significant discounts this Black Friday,” said Glaser. “Stick with [the] PS4 and Xbox One, bundled with games and controllers, for the best value.” So, your best bet is to buy your kids — or yourself — the older generation consoles as holiday gifts. You’ll find some good Black Friday deals on these and, although they’re not the newest, they’re still new enough to be great gifts — at a great price. Travel With everyone booking trips with family for the upcoming holidays, November is right in the middle of the busiest travel season of the year. If you haven’t already booked your flight home from the holidays, you might be out of luck as far as deals go. The best time to buy airline tickets is one month to four months out, but for holiday travel around this time it’s different. Sometimes it’s best to book even 11 months in advance, according to CheapAir. So, at this point, it’s best to hold off on your winter and spring travel plans until the new year. Gift Cards Gift cards are one of the most popular holiday gifts, but buying them early won’t necessarily get you the best deal. “Gift card discounts rain from the sky in December, when you can regularly expect to get $100 of iTunes credit for just $80 or even $70 dollars,” Glaser said. So, wait until next month to buy these popular stocking stuffers — or even wait until January to stock up. After the holidays, all of the unwanted gift cards people receive as gifts can show up on sites like Cardpool and Raise. These sites will offer gift cards for deep discounts — typically up to 35 percent off. Black Friday Impulse Buys Although it’s easy to get hyped up for all of the Black Friday deals, it’s best to stick to your shopping list and only buy what’s necessary — or what you plan to give as gifts. Don’t get so caught up in the Black Friday hype you spend needlessly. Just because there’s a sale, doesn’t mean you’re truly saving money — and it definitely doesn’t mean you need it.

By Prabhakar Mundkur , New Delhi | In Marketing | November 04, 2016 33SHARES Cyrus Mistry's removal from Tata Sons would have a minimal effect on the consumer of brands in the Tata Group. But the question is, whether a leader's status have an impact on the brand at all. The other day, someone argued that the effects of Cyrus Mistry being sacked by Tata Sons would have a minimal effect on the consumer of brands in the Tata Group. He doubted whether a person who was going to buy a Tata Car or go into a Tanishq store would be affected. I agree with him that the consumer wouldn't give a damn, or at least not for the moment. But unfortunately the reverse is also true. I doubt the consumer cared very much when Ratan Tata decided to give up his position as Chairman of Tata Sons four years ago. Frankly, the consumer wouldn't have missed a heartbeat. Another argument was that when the chairman of a company is an icon, it is more likely to affect the brand. That set me thinking on whether a leader's status had an impact on the brand at all. In the case of Tata's, their group company equities fell 1-5% on the day after Cyrus Mistry's ouster and even 8% for one particular Tata company three days later. Of course one could argue that stock market confidence might be insulated from consumer confidence or at least there might a lag between the two. But to take the stock argument further lets look at what happened to Apple post Oct 5, 2011 when Steve Jobs died. On that day, shares of Apple closed at a split adjusted price of $50.53 per share. On August 12,2016 Apple closed at $115.96 per share. Since Steve's death, shares of Apple are thus up 129.5% or lets says 130% in 3 years and 10 months rounded up. Although Apple may have lost 2-3% market share points to Android over the last year, there is nothing to show that Steve Jobs' death might have had any effect on iPhone sales over a 10 year period if one looked at it purely from a business cycle point of view. The same could be said of Mac sales which is their second largest revenue earner. Founder Mythology In spite of a Bollywood blockbuster, Mark Zuckerberg is not alone in our obsession with founder mythology. What comes to mind when we think about Apple? Steve Jobs, the creative visionary in black turtlenecks. Virgin? Richard Branson, the charismatic leader at the helm of many ventures. Tesla? The trailblazing entrepreneur Elon Musk who gave life to Iron Man. The Trump Organization? Bill Gates the software whiz kid turned philanthropist. The real estate mogul turned politician, Donald Trump. We think about Mr. Trump's own brand image before we think about that of his enterprises or if we were to imagine him as President of the United States. So there is hardly a doubt that the founder affects the impressions of their organisations. But brands particularly seem a little insulated perhaps from first the founder and the organisation brand. Or at least there is a lag between the things that affect the company and things that affect the brand. And most of all founders want their brands to outlive them and this is an important motivation. In the Nestle controversy last year the government confirmed that they had found MSG in Maggi Noodles on April 2015 ( It came to light much later that Nestle had nothing wrong and were acquitted in the case by the courts ). In spite of the terrible time the company had to go through in the following months including a change of CEO, the brand remained strong and resilient. Consumers wanted to get it back on the shelves once again. And once it was back on the shelves after a long running controversy, consumers embraced the brand like a long lost friend. Proving that a strong brand can weather itself through a major controversy without losing its consumers. Founders versus Professional CEOs Most founders think that professional managers hired to run a company will not have the same motivation that a founder does. If one looks at the world's largest companies, then Steve Ballmer, John Chambers, Tim Cook, are all employees who have or soon will become billionaires since they were hired to run their respective companies. The founders in these companies are already billionaires many times over, thus their motivation will always be everything else but money. Founders will feel a personal sense of responsibility to shareholders far more strongly than a hired professional manager will. At least most founders think that professional managers won't have the same level of empathy/responsibility to the group that a founder has or had. According to founders they carry a lot more weight and far more respect than a professional manager does. In rough times a founder will also be a lot more to bet his or her own money once again to turn things around. But it is difficult to conclude that a professional manager won't do as much as a founder if one looks at CEOs like Tim Cook. To that extent Cyrus Mistry of the Tata Sons was both Chairman and owned 18.3 % of the Tata stock. So in many ways he was the ideal CEO. Because every decision of his would affect his own family wealth as much as it would affect the Tata brand. Brands are Intangible Whether brands are run by founders or professional managers brand values are built and created in the long term over large time periods. And I personally think that brands are impervious to changes in the management as long as they are managed and nurtured well. Brands are intangible, however much brand equity experts may choose to valuate them. Brands are made in consumers minds. Unlike products that are made in factories. Or unlike companies that are made on the stock market or start ups that are made on unrealistic valuations. A product can be objectively defined, measured and assessed. A brand is intangible, ephemeral and abstract. As Scott Cook said, "A brand is no longer what we tell the consumer it is - it is what consumers tell each other it is." So long live the brand! 33SHARES Search Tags Tata Sons Tata Prabhakar Mundkur Cyrus Mistry Marketing Related Articles "The opportunity for marketers is purely hypothetical at the moment": Prabhakar Mundkur on Pokémon Go Digital Guest Article: Prabhakar Mundkur: Why Brand Ambassadors Get Dumped Marketing Percept promotes Prabhakar Mundkur as director, business strategy Advertising Guest Article: Prabhakar Mundkur: The EFF word - The creativity and effectiveness paradox Advertising Stay Updated with Us Top 10 Stories Last Week Last Month Last Year First casualty of Donald Trump's win? eBay sacks I...

 Sounds like Apple’s wireless AirPods won’t be available for Christmas Kif Leswing Nov. 1, 2016, 1:11 PM 3,671 facebook linkedin twitter email print Hollis Johnson/Business Insider AirPods, the wireless earbud headphones Apple launched alongside the headphone jack-less iPhone 7, won't go on sale in 2016. That's according to MacRumors, which cites the Chinese-language Economic Daily Times writing about Inventec, an Apple supplier.  "Apple originally planned to release the AirPods at the end of October, but has postponed release. Inventec is expected to begin shipping AirPods in January 2017, the paper noted." Apple Insider says its source says "no way that these are getting pushed to January." While it's a bummer for everyone who was hoping to find a pair of the cordless white earbuds underneath the Christmas tree, it's probably a good thing for the product in the long run. The review unit provided by Apple that Business Insider tried has some glitches. Sometimes the audio cuts out, for example.  Apple originally said that AirPods would go on sale in "late October." Last week, it provided a statement pushing the release date back for an undetermined time. Apple did not immediately return a request seeking clarification on when the AirPods will go on sale. When it initially announced the delay last week, Apple said: “The early response to AirPods has been incredible. We don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers."

Here is the list of Windows alternatives By mid-day online correspondent | Posted 04-Nov-2016 In case you are not interested in investing so much in the new MacBook Pro, we have some alternatives for you   After a long wait Apple finally announced its new line-up of MacBook Pro computers, those equipped with Touch Bar and strip of touch sensitive OLED panel above the keyboard. Though all these latest additions are really innovative for us, yet Apple did something typical to its nature. It dumped all standard ports that were there in the previous laptops in favour of four USB Type C Thunderbolt 3.0 ports. This change in Apple’s laptops has seriously impacted professionals like photographers. The base model is expected to start from Rs 1,55,900. But in case you are not interested in investing so much in the new MacBook Pro, we have some alternatives for you: Microsoft Surface Pro 4 The Surface Pro 4 along with the Surface Type cover and Surface Pen makes for an amazing alternative to the MacBook Pro. Though it might be a pretty old device, but it features a strong responsive keyboard along with all necessary ports. The system has a 12.3-inch IPS LCD PixelSense screen with a high resolution of 2736 x 1824 pixels with 3:2 aspect ratio. Surface Book is another alternative to Surface Pro 4, which is now revamped with a longer battery life. Lenovo Yoga 900 This is a current introduction in Lenovo’s consumer segment of laptops. The Yoga 900 ultrabook is around 15mm thick with lids closed and weighs as less as 1.27kg. It is powered by Intel Core i7 6500U, a dual-core hyper-threaded CPU and backed by 8GB RAM and 512GB of SSD storage. There is USB 3.0 port to the right hand top, 3.5mm audio jack and power port at the left top followed by another USB 3.0 port, apart from a SD card reader. Dell XPS 13 This is one of the best looking laptops till now. It is compact in size and comes with 13-inch display. There are two USB 3.0 ports, a SD card reader, a 3.5mm combo jack and a Kensington lock port. Interestingly, one USB port is always on, which means one can charge USB based devices like a smartphone. HP Spectre HP claims this to be the thinnest laptops with a thickness of 10mm. it is packed by Intel Core i7 6500U processor with 8GB RAM and 512GB SSD storage. There are two USB Type C Thunderbolt 3.0 ports and one USB Type C port for charging. The laptop also has USB, HDMI and Ethernet port built in it. Acer Aspire S13 It is one of the best Windows ultrabooks. Apart from 8GB LPDDR3 RAM and a 512GB SSD, the laptop has two inbuilt USB 3.0 ports, one on each side. There is a SD card reader too. It is light in weight and is known to be a high performance device. It can be ideal for daily use. Pic/YouTube Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon This is a great alternative for those who do need the Touch Bar. The Thinkpad has Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.0, NFC, 3x USB 3.0 port, 1x HDMI port, 1x miniDP, a microSIM card and more. It is backed by 8GB of RAM and makes a good alternative for the new MacBook Pro. Pic/YouTube So here is the list for you to consider. In case you want to keep yourself away from the new MacBook Pro, try out one of these. You will not repent later for your choice.

He claims that the slot is "cumbersome" and pointed to other technologies available to users.  ( Apple ) Advertisement The updated line of MacBook Pro models which Apple recently unveiled featured a lot of new additions and improvements, making the computers definite powerhouses. However, it has received criticism from power users such as creative professionals, largely on certain omissions made on the new laptops. In an interview with The Independent, Apple SVP for worldwide marketing Philip Schiller discussed some of the decisions made by the company regarding the new MacBook Pro. According to Schiller, the new MacBook Pro received a level of engineering that was not possible in the past to hurdle the technical challenges presented by its design. In addition, he noted the Touch Bar as the product of Apple's thoughts on what to do next with the notebook. In one of the more important parts of the interview, Schiller defended Apple's decision to remove the SD card slot for a camera memory card on the new MacBook Pro. He said that the card slot is "cumbersome," and it was a compromise because it forced owners of high-end cameras with XQD cards or CompactFlash to acquire an external reader. In addition, with many new camera models coming with built-in wireless transfer technology, this method of transferring files is presenting itself as an option. Photographers might not like Schiller's explanation, particularly because while SD cards are not at all recent technology, they still simply work well. Wireless transfers are not yet at the point of being called reliable or quick, and leading camera companies such as Nikon and Sony will likely not be making quick improvements to the technology just to appease owners of the new MacBook Pro. Perhaps further infuriating photographers who were looking forward to the new MacBook Pro is that Apple decided to keep the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack, which was famously removed from the iPhone 7, as it is important for professionals in the audio field. When Schiller was asked to describe the response of the public to the new MacBook Pro, he stated that he hopes everyone gets their chance to try the computer for themselves. "It is a really big step forward and an example of how much we continue to invest in the Mac. We love the Mac and are as committed to it, in both desktops and notebooks, as we ever have been," Schiller said. It has been said that perhaps the new MacBook Pro would be better received if it was instead named the new MacBook Air, as the computers are both thinner MacBook Pro and faster MacBook Air models.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Single Sign-On starts rolling out to iOS 10.2 and tvOS 10.1 beta users By Sébastien Page, Nov 3, 2016 Tweet 12 Comments Apple has started rolling out the anticipated Single Sign-On feature to iOS 10.2 and tvOS 10.1 beta users. Available for iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV, Single Sign-On is currently limited to a small amount of TV providers, including Dish, GVTC Communications, Hotwire, and Sling TV. The new feature can be found on iPhone and iPad by launching the Settings app and choosing the newly added TV Provider option. On the fourth-generation Apple TV, Single Sign-On can be accessed by going to Settings > Accounts > TV Provider. After selecting a TV provider, the user has to enter his login and password to gain access to TV shows and movies in apps that are supported as part of their TV subscription. So far, only a few TV providers are supported, but it’s fair to assume more will be in the near future. With Single Sign-On Apple aims to make accessing TV content on iOS or tvOS apps much simpler by allowing users to use their credentials once and be automatically logged in all supported apps installed on their devices. Coupled with the upcoming TV app that Apple recently announced, Single-Sign On will help provide a more uniform and streamlined experience. Initially announced at WWDC 2016, Single Sign-On was expected to be released with the tvOS 10 software update for Apple TV back in September, but the feature didn’t make it in the first release. While no official date has been announced, we believe Single Sign-On will be released along the new TV app in December.

The Mate 9 is aimed squarely at the top end of the $400 billion global smartphone market, where professional users are looking for fast phones with long battery life. It includes a feature that enables the device to learn about the habits of its user and automatically put the most frequently used apps in easy reach - unlike, for example, Apple's iPhone, where icons that may occupy many screens apart from the start screen have to be manually ordered. "It learns how you use your phone," said Arne Herkelmann, Huawei's European head of handset portfolio and planning. The launch comes just three weeks after Samsung scrapped its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, dealing a huge blow to its reputation and outlook.(Also see: Huawei Fit Activity Tracker With Heart Rate Monitor Launched) With smartphone sales growth expected to slow in the coming years, device manufacturers are focusing on new ways to standout from the crowd. "Just the device is no longer enough," said Roberta Cozza,an analyst at research firm Gartner. "AI and voice control will be main features on smartphones in the coming years." Alphabet's Google last month launched the Pixel smartphone which has Google Assistant, the company's voice-activated artificial intelligence (AI) system and its answer to Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. In another AI push, Samsung said last month it would buy Viv, which is run by the co-creator of Apple's Siri and said it wanted to integrate the platform in its Galaxy smartphones and expand its voice-assistant services to home appliances and wearable technology devices. The Mate 9, introduced in Munich, is a 5.9-inch (15 cm) large-screen handset that boasts cameras with autofocus, directional microphones with noise cancellation and an improved user interface. The algorithm puts the user's favourite apps first, which makes the phones easier to use and also more energy-efficient. The phone's battery lasts for almost two days of heavy usage and can fully recharge in 90 minutes, Huawei said. Gartner expects smartphone sales to grow 4.5 percent to 1.5 billion devices this year. © Thomson Reuters 2016 Huawei Mate 9 KEY SPECS NEWS Display5.90-inch Processor1.8GHz octa-core Front Camera8-megapixel Resolution1080x1920 pixels RAM4GB OSAndroid 7.0 Storage64GB Rear Camera20-megapixel Battery Capacity4000mAh Huawei Wants to Beat Apple in Smartphones in 2 Years Huawei Mate 9 Can Learn User Habits, Placing Frequently Used Apps in Easy Reach Huawei Mate 9 With Leica Dual-Lens Camera Launched: Price, Specifications, and More More Huawei mobilesHuawei mobiles price in India Tags: Huawei, Mate 9, Huawei Mate 9 Price, Huawei Mate 9 Launch, Android, Artificial Intelligence, AI GoPro Reports Steep Drop in Revenue as Production Issues Hurt Huawei Mate 9 Can Learn User Habits, Placing Frequently Used Apps in Easy Reach     Advertisement   In Mobiles and Tablets » Latest Huawei Mate 9 Pro HTC Bolt Hyve Pryme Panasonic P71 Zopo Color F2 Motorola Moto M Lyf F8 Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) General Mobile GM5 Xiaomi Redmi 4A Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime Xiaomi Redmi 4 Micromax Canvas Spark 4G Porsche Design Huawei Mate 9 Meizu Pro 6s Samsung W2017 Huawei Mate 9 ZTE CYMBAL-T Alcatel Idol 4S (Windows 10) Intex Aqua Power M Popular iPhone 7 Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Motorola Moto Z Moto Z Play Lenovo K5 Note Xiaomi Redmi 3s HTC 10 OnePlus 3 Moto G4 Xiaomi Mi5 Galaxy J7 2016 Redmi Note 3 iPhone SE Sony Xperia Z5 Micromax phones Samsung phones Android Phones Smartphones Google Phones From Gadgets 360 Shop » Micromax Canvas Juice 4G ...

Home Industry Tech Google captures smartphone market as 9 out of 10 devices use Android: Report Google captures smartphone market as 9 out of 10 devices use Android: Report With the decline of Apple's iOS, global tech giant Google with its Android OS is said to have a record market share in Quarter 3 this year. By: FE Online | Published: November 4, 2016 11:17 AM According to a research, the operating system has grabbed 87.5 % of the smartphone market all over the world, in the three months till September 2016. With the decline of Apple’s iOS, global tech giant Google with its Android OS is said to have a record market share in Quarter 3 this year. According to a research, the operating system has grabbed 87.5 % of the smartphone market all over the world, in the three months till September 2016. The analytical research was posted by Strategy Analytics. According to the research total number of Android smartphone shipments globally were more than 328 million devices out of a total smartphone shipment of 375 million units, in the third quarter of 2016. Meanwhile, Apple iOS managed only a little over 45 million units. Android grew by 10.3 percent since last year Q3, while iOS went down by 5.2 percent. This result for Apple was also evident in Apple’s latest earnings results, where it said that there was a continuous decline in iPhone sales for the third quarter. According to their results, Apple iOS market share was 12.1 percent in Q3, down from 13.6 percent in 2015. Meanwhile, other operating systems like Windows, Blackberry and Samsung’s Tizen have had negligible sales, as together they amounted to only 0.3 percent of the market, which is 1.3 million units shipments. This result is down by a huge 84 percent year-to-year. The reason for Android sales being higher every year is also because of low-cost smartphones being made in China. At the moment the lead is very big and Google can enjoy it for a moment, but according to the research, it will have tough challenges ahead. Woody Oh, director at Strategy Analytics said, “Android’s leadership of the global smartphone market looks unassailable at the moment. Its low-cost services and user-friendly software remain attractive to hardware makers, operators and consumers worldwide. Woody added, “However, several challenges remain for Google. The Android platform is getting overcrowded with hundreds of manufacturers, few Android device vendors make profits, and Google’s new Pixel range is attacking its own hardware partners that made Android popular in the first place.” Also read | Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7: Feature to feature, how the two flagships match up Google, in October, released its latest offerings, Google Pixel and Pixel XL, which made a lot of smartphone makers which run Android, angry. Since the report is until September, when Apple just released its new iPhone 7 and 7Plus, their records are to get better as well. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Define your site main menu Escaping The Walled Gardens In The Clouds After going through a bunch of OS X Mountain Lion reviews I have to say I can’t wait to get it onto my Mac. For the most part the devil’s in the details; all the little things that accrue to form what I expect to be a better user experience. Besides all of the little things, however, there is something that increasingly defines what OS X is about: the iCloud. As Tim Cook said, Apple doubled down on iCloud with Mountain Lion, and it shows. Using Mountain Lion it will be hard to avoid it. TextEdit’s save dialog, for instance, offers iCloud document storage by default, a practice to be followed by other Apple applications and encouraged for third party apps as well. Then there are the Reminders, Notes, and Game Center, and a significant portion of their value is the fact that they seamlessly sync with their equivalents on the iPhone and the iPad. When we look at the trend of iCloud integration with OSX and iOS we could almost, similarly to what John Siracusa remarked, consider OSX and iOS as just clients to the iCloud. It’s beginning to feel like it is all just one big iCloud OS for the entire Apple world. But that’s just the thing that’s bothering me a little. It is the Apple world; it’s an exclusive club. I have a MacBook Pro, and that’s the only Apple device I own. I own an Android smartphone and a Windows PC. In this configuration much of the benefit of the iCloud fades away from me. The Notes app becomes just another notes app, since it’s super-seamless syncing with its iOS equivalent means nothing to me. Why can’t it sync to a compatible Android equivalent? Well, of course, I might as well ask why won’t pigs fly wearing icy necklaces in hell! It’s slightly entertaining to read John Siracusa espouse the greatness of the iCloud and how it makes life easier for its users, and seem so oblivious to the possibility that some Apple users might only own a Mac. It is as if he just assumes that everyone reading owns at least a Mac and an iPhone. This is all the more interesting when you consider the fact that his audience are supposed to be nerds; people who are far more likely to own Android phones at the same time as a Mac. People, you know, a little bit like me. But this is all just an introduction. Apple represents the best example of this “ecosystem-ism”, a trend that seems especially enabled by cloud computing. Everything is absolutely awesome so long as you don’t step out of the ecosystem, and when you look at their marketing they act as if nothing else in the world exists but their ecosystem. Their ecosystem is their entire reality. Of course you’ll have an iPhone! Why, you might even have an iPad! Isn’t it all just so obvious? It’s iCloud magic baby! You have to be all-in! But I’m not. I have a Mac, and an Android phone. I’m not all in, and that makes me feel like a black sheep in this vision of theirs. It makes me feel as if I should either just exit the entire Apple world, or go all in, drop my Android and buy an iPhone, and then an iPad, and then an Apple TV (hey, AirPlay mirroring!), and so on. Apple may be the best example of this game at play, but they’re far from the only ones. The other two big players, Google and Microsoft, are guilty of it as well. Google has its own little island. Actually, it’s not little, and it’s not an island. It’s more like an omnipresent matrix of nodes that are becoming ever more tightly knotted with each other as they squeeze the entire planet out of its advertising dollars. But seriously, if you look at the video of a simple little Google service like Google Tasks you will keep hearing and seeing about Google this and Google that. It integrates with Gmail, and Google Calendar, and Google Docs. It’s so great! Unless, perhaps, you kinda want to use your own calendar application, and just perhaps prefer Yahoo Mail or something. Will Tasks integrate with those? Probably not. Yet again we are pressed into a situation where everything is just so awesome, smooth and easy so long as you stick with their predefined paradigm. No mixing and matching for you. What about Microsoft? Well, it is easy to imagine a similarly tight integration between Windows 8 and Windows Phone, as well as the whole existing Windows Live and Xbox Live ecosystem. As Microsoft gets better at presenting this as a single coherent whole, much like Apple does (and that’s where I think they want to be heading), we’ll have a similar situation as with Apple and Google. So, it’s a world of silos, and if you expect the smoothest experience possible it seems you’re no longer choosing between specific operating systems or specific devices. You are choosing between entire frigging companies! Either you go all in with Apple, or all in with Google, or all in with Microsoft. Take your pick. If you, however, choose to mix and match between them then you have to concede to a possibly suboptimal, perhaps messier, user experience. And then you have to fight off the constant barrage of marketing speak that keeps trying to bring you in line with the ecosystem of the platform you are primarily using. It gives me the feeling as if I am somehow underutilizing OS X by not taking full advantage of the iCloud because I haven’t fully bought into the Apple’s ecosystem. Mixing and Matching Now, it’s really not so bad, and I’m not trying to paint this as some kind of a disaster. There are plenty of third party solutions out there which work pretty smoothly by themselves, and independently of the major ecosystems. For instance we have Simplenote, a cloud based note taking service which is compatible with a whole bunch of different note taking apps across all platforms. I am using Notational Velocity on my Mac, and Notational Acceleration on my Android. Both hook up to the Simplenote cloud for instant iCloud-like syncing of all notes I make on either the Mac or the Android. This makes me independent of all the big ecosystems for my note taking. It makes me feel like I have my own little ecosystem. Of course, the experience still isn’t as slick as the one with Apple Notes, at least with the Android app (and others are actually worse), so I guess I can count that as a penalty for daring to stray into the dirty world of third parties. Open Cross-Platform Universal Clouds However, this example does lead to an interesting idea. What if we had the smooth user experience of the big closed ecosystems, but independent of the big closed ecosystems? In such a scenario we have open clouds which developers can hook into for all the data piping necessary, and users can register and login with to store their data on, using any compatible application. Let’s call one such cloud OpenCloud. You would have an OpenCloud ID (much like the Apple ID), and could choose between multitude of OpenCloud compatible photo apps (for example) on any platform. You choose one on your Android phone, one on Windows PC, and one on the iPad. Input your OpenCloud login into all of them and your photos between all of these apps on all of these devices get synced much in the same manner as iCloud does between iPhoto on iPad and Mac. So yes, you take a picture on your Android phone and voila it appears on your Windows PC, and your iPad immediately, thanks to the magic of the OpenCloud. Similarly, if you add a picture to the app on your iPad, it automatically appears on Windows and Android equivalents. If you change the application on any of these devices to another OpenCloud compatible device it could either migrate the data from the old app or just interface with the data stored on the OpenCloud, taking over where the previous app left off. The big difference between this and the iCloud (or Google and Microsoft’s ecosystems), of course, is that it all just works across all platforms instead of just within the confines of a single ecosystem. You can mix and match applications, devices, and operating systems at your hearts content, essentially creating your own ecosystem. We could go even further and imagine multiple different open clouds all following a certain set of standards that allows them to sync between each other. They would compete in their performance, storage pricing etc. If you decide to use a different universal open cloud service there would be an easy way to migrate your data, and happily continue on with the new cloud. Such a cloud might be a kind of blend between what already exists. Simperium and Dropbox come to mind whereas Simperium offers a developer-facing piece of the puzzle (data piping magic), and Dropbox offers a user friendly storage box and data syncing. As John Siracusa explained in his OSX Mountain Lion mega-review, iCloud itself actually consists of three separate parts handling various aspects necessary for the whole thing to work the way it does. Sometimes it seems as if everything in the tech world is getting closed up into walled gardens, but I tend to think things are a little less simplistic. Just as it seems things are getting too closed and consolidated this creates impetus for the creation of alternative paradigms that would bring back the balance. While it may seem as if we are being pushed between huge walled gardens, there is little reason why alternatives outside of those walls cannot be created, which provide the same smooth user experience. The components and beginnings of it are already out there, like Simperium and Dropbox. It doesn’t seem like this dream is so far fetched.   Follow Us!

You can download the build for free. You Can Now Download & Install iOS 10.2 Public Beta for Free Having released the developer oriented iOS 10.2 Beta just yesterday, Apple is taking things further today by releasing iOS 10.2 Public Beta software update. Unlike the developer-only release, this build is absolutely free to download, and all you are required to have is a compatible device as well as a working Apple ID. In order to install iOS 10.2 Public Beta right now, head over to the Apple Beta Software Program website (beta.apple.com) from your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Once you have opened up the page, simply sign in using your Apple ID and enroll your device. You will be required to download and install a Public Beta profile onto your device in order to receive iOS 10.2 Beta update over the air. Navigate to Settings > General > Software Update in order to complete the download and installation process. Despite how stable iOS 10.2 is in its current form, we still recommend proceeding with caution.

Huawei Huawei launches 'most powerful smartphone in the world' to take on Apple and Samsung Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei Consumer Business Group, presents the new Huawei Mate 9 high-end-phablet during the Huawei Global Product Launch in Munich, southern Germany, on November 3, 2016. Photo: AFP Huawei has launched the Mate 9, a high-spec, high-price smartphone which could see the China-based company square up to market leaders Apple and Samsung. The latest device in Huawei's Mate series boasts a 5.9 inch full HD screen, inviting comparison with Apple's iPhone 7 Plus and the now discontinued Samsung Galaxy Note 7. The manufacturer is making a big play on the handset's processing power, which Huawei said made it the "most powerful smartphone in the world." According to Huawei's testing, software in the Mate 9 performed 80 per cent better than major competitors after one year of use. 350540 Photo Gallery Huawei's Mate 9 touted as 'most powerful smartphone in the world' Source: AFP However, Neil Mawston, executive director at Strategy Analytics, was not overly impressed by these claims, describing the product as merely "another big screen smartphone." But, Mawston, speaking to CNBC on the phone, did concede that the Mate 9 was a "nice incremental improvement" and that the release did a good job of "filling the Note 7 gap, at a lower price point than Apple." Ben Wood, mobile industry analyst at CCS Insight, viewed the launch more positively, telling CNBC via telephone that it "shows just how ambitious Huawei are," and "reiterates (his organisation's) belief that Huawei is emerging as a force to be recognised in the smartphone market." The Mate 9's other key features include an 8 megapixel camera, 64GB memory and 4 microphones that in combination enable directional sound recording. Unlike the Apple's iPhone 7, the Mate 9 has a headphone jack. Huawei did not disclose where the device's battery was manufactured; thereby not ruling out that this could be the same as that of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which is now notorious for overheating. But, Huawei did stress that the Mate 9's battery had been tested in house, by the manufacturer of the component and in independent research labs. Whilst the Mate 9's release has been lucky in terms of its timing, the smartphone is likely to face stiff competition in a very competitive market space. Mawston told CNBC that "any differentiation from Huawei won't last long." Wood said that Apple and Samsung were unlikely to be worried by the release, but that the "Mate 9 just boosts Huawei's profile" in a "sea of smartphone sameness." Ultimately, Wood said that the launch's success "comes down to price." With regards to the Mate 9's reception in regional markets, Mawston said that "Huawei is coming under intense pressure at home in China as (lower end manufacturers) OPPO and Vivo offer similar phones at better price points. The Mate 9 will help alleviate some of that pressure." According to figures from the International Data Corporation released last week, both OPPO and Vivo saw their market share growth move into triple digits in the third quarter of this year, in comparison to the same period in 2015. But, Mawston added that the Mate 9 was more likely to boost the company's position in Europe and India where Samsung has left a space in the market. Huawei say that the Mate 9 is a "high end performance device aimed at professional users" and also serves as a "productivity tool." But, smartphone development is arguably reaching a plateau. "We're in a mature phase of the smartphone market, now only incremental changes are being made," Mawston said. No comments yet. Be the first to post comment.

Reuters/Danish Siddiqui The iMacs have always been a top favourite for numerous tech enthusiasts and they would love to see more of the powerful PC when the Apple iMac 2017 releases. An update seems imminent as it’s been a long time since the iMac has been updated. Macworld reported in October that US retailer Best Buy had accidentally listed a Kaby lake iMac on its website for sale. The listing was taken down soon. However, this raised hopes of thousands of Apple fans who desperately want to see the Kaby Lake chipset in the upcoming Apple iMac 2017. The potential refresh is coming and it could be in the first quarter of 2017. The Kaby Lake chipset is expected t bring awesome powers to the iMac 2017 and the processor will also be based on Intel’s Speed Shift V2 technology. Analysts are certain that the delay in the iMac release is primarily because of the Intel Kaby Lake processor. Apple may also be entering the VR race soon and what better way to do so than with the iMac 2017! There are talks that the iMac 2017 would be made VR capable as all major players are exploring VR capabilities for their gadgets and devices. The Apple iMac 2017 may have the Polaris 10 and 11 chipsets that are capable of providing decent VR experience. The Polaris graphics chips help in improving the resolution significantly and that’s particularly great for gamers, writes Tech Radar. Moreover, these chipsets are better than many other available chipsets in the market as they offer lower power consumption and faster speeds. The Apple iMac 2017 would be having the Thunderbolt 3 and USB Type-C ports for faster data transfer and battery charging. Apple could also be considering making the flash storage the next storage standard from the iMac 2017. The fusion drives could very well be the default storage for the new iMacs.

If accurate, it means at least some early Thunderbolt 3 docks already on the market will not work with Apple’s newest Mac laptop. Apple’s New MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Message from Plugable: On the product page for Plugable’s Thunderbolt 3 product line, the company posted the following note: Update 11/3/16: The version of OS X on the new MacBook Pros (late 2016) will not work with existing Certified Thunderbolt 3 docks and adapters (released prior to November 2016). These existing devices use Intel’s Thunderbolt 3 chipset (Alpine Ridge) in combination with the first generation of TI USB-C chipset (TPS65982). Apple requires the 2nd generation TPS65983 chipset for peripherals to be compatible. Certification of solutions across different device types is still in-progress for this 2nd generation chipset. From the Plugable product line, our dual display graphics adapters for DisplayPort and HDMI (TBT3-DP2X and TBT3-HDMI2X) are affected and are disabled by OS X on the new MacBooks. So we offer these products as Windows-only Thunderbolt 3 devices until a future hardware update. Our Thunderbolt 3 cables do not require this chip, and therefore are compatible. We’ve also made the difficult decision to postpone our TBT3-UD1 Docking Station to update to the TPS65983 chipset and re-certify to make this docking station MacBook-compatible. Our Flagship TBT3-UDV dock with Power Delivery/Charging was already planned to use the next generation controller chip from TI, and will be compatible with the 2016 Thunderbolt 3 MacBooks. We’ll continue to post updates with new Thunderbolt™ 3 product and release information as it becomes available. Unknowns There are a bunch of unknowns, starting with whether or not Apple might change its mind on supporting the first generation chips. Thunderbolt 3 has been a tad fluid in terms of specs—it seems quite likely that Apple decided some aspect of this first generation chip cause more problems than is worth it. So…could Apple change its corporate mind? It would be nifty if the company didn’t alienate early adopters of Thunderbolt 3, not to mention those companies looking to press the boundaries just like Apple is doing. We don’t know yet, and Apple hasn’t yet commented on the issue. If and when Apple does comment, we’ll post.
