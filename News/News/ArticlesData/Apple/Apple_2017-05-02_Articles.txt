PHOTO: AFP Apple reported a surprise fall in iPhone sales for its second quarter on Tuesday, indicating that customers may have held back purchases in anticipation of the 10th-anniversary edition of the company’s most important product later this year. Under pressure from shareholders to hand over more of its $250 billion-plus hoard of cash and investments, Apple boosted its capital return program by $50 billion, increased its share repurchase authorization by $35 billion and raised its quarterly dividend by 10.5 per cent. Investors were unmoved, sending shares of the world’s most valuable listed company down 1.9 per cent at $144.65 in after-hours trading. Apple sold 50.76 million iPhones in its fiscal second quarter ended April 1, down from 51.19 million a year earlier. Analysts on average had estimated iPhone sales of 52.27 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. Man throws iPhone 7 off world’s tallest building Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri argued the decline was not as bad as it looked, given the peculiarities of how phone sales are calculated. The company reports what are called “sell-in” figures for the iPhone, a measure of how many units it sells to retailers, rather than “sell-through” figures, which measure how many phones are actually sold to consumers. Maestri said the company reduced the volume of inventory going through its retail channel by about 1.2 million units in the quarter, meaning the company sold about 52 million phones to customers on a sell-through basis. Despite the dip in unit sales, iPhone revenues rose 1.2 percent in the quarter, helped by a higher average selling price. 10th anniversary Expectations are building ahead of Apple’s 10th-anniversary iPhone range this fall, with investors hoping that the launch would help bolster sales. Apple typically launches its new iPhones in September. A big jump in sales usually follows in the holiday quarter, before demand tapers over the next few quarters as customers hold back ahead of the next launch. Apple’s 10th-anniversary iPhone range might sport features such as wireless charging, 3-D facial recognition and a curved display. Don’t try this ‘trick’ on your iPhone “There is a general softening in phone demand to contend with as well as expectations of a big upgrade, all of which softens the blow of this quarter’s miss,” said James McQuivey, a Forrester Research analyst. “If we see Apple downplaying expectations before the next upgrade cycle, it might mean that the company isn’t confident it will beat those expectations.” The company forecast total revenue of between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion for the current quarter, while analysts on average were expecting $45.60 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts on average expect the company to sell 42.31 million iPhones in the current quarter, according to FactSet. For the second quarter, the company’s net income rose to $11.03 billion, or $2.10 per share, compared with $10.52 billion, or $1.90 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $2.02 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 4.6 per cent to $52.90 billion in the quarter, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $53.02 billion. Here’s how this man built his own iPhone for half the price A 17.5 per cent jump in the company’s services business – which includes the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud – to $7.04 billion, boosted revenue. “We are particularly encouraged by the fact that service revenue is nowhere near as cyclical as product revenue,” Neil Saunders, Managing Director of GlobalData Retail, wrote in a note to clients. Apple’s revenue from the Greater China region fell 14.1 per cent to $10.73 billion in the quarter, as cheaper rivals in the region chipped away at sales. Maestri said that sales of Macs and the company’s services were strong in China during the March quarter. “The performance we’re seeing in China should get better going forward this year,” he said. Apple’s gross margin hit 38.9 per cent, slightly ahead of analysts’ average expectation of 38.7 per cent, despite higher prices for memory chips. The company said it expects gross margins next quarter between 37.5 per cent and 38.5 per cent, versus analysts’ expectation of 38.3 per cent, according to FactSet. “NAND and DRAM (memory chips) are under pressure right now in terms of some price pressure. We saw that in the March quarter and expect that to continue into the June quarter, but for all the other commodities, we see prices declining,” Maestri said.

Those looking forward to the new phone may have held off on buying a new device until the fall, analysts said. The softer-than-expected sales come as Apple faces increased competition for the device that makes up the majority of Apple’s profits. Apple sold 50 million iPhones in the past quarter, 1 million less than in the same period last year. Analysts had expected Apple to sell 52 million units. The company reported $52.9 billion in revenue, slightly below analyst estimates. On an earnings call, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said that Apple did not correctly estimate how popular the iPhone 7 Plus would be compared with the iPhone 7, which caused some supply problems. The company did show strong profits thanks in part to its services unit, reporting earnings of $2.10 a share vs. an expected $2.02. But the disappointing iPhone sales, combined with a weak outlook for the next quarter, sent the stock down more than 2 percent in after-hours trading. U.S. sales grew 11 percent, but the company saw a 14 percent sales drop in China. Cook played down concerns about sales in the world’s largest phone market, saying that he thought those results were in line with previous years. He added that seven of the company’s most popular stores are in China. But local competition from Chinese smartphone makers such as Huawei have been chipping away at Apple’s market share. Cook addressed analyst questions about the Apple Watch, saying the company is happy with sales and remains “very committed to it and believe … over time it will be even larger.” Apple doesn’t break out sales numbers for its wearable, but analysts expected to see more growth from that part of Apple’s business as competitors leave the smartwatch market. Many analysts anticipate that the company will deliver a completely redesigned iPhone later this year. It is expected to be called the iPhone 8 and to have an edge-to-edge display similar to that of the well-reviewed Samsung Galaxy S8, which went on sale in April. And analysts are upbeat about Apple’s ability to bounce back, thanks to the company’s reputation and customer loyalty. “We’re bullish on the i­Phone 8 for three reasons: Apple’s ecosystem stickiness, the expected upgradability of the device, and teenage fondness of Apple devices,” said Clement Thibault, a senior investing analyst with Investing.com . Meanwhile, Apple is also facing increased competition in its growing Mac business. Microsoft announced Tuesday morning a sleek new laptop aimed at students that is designed to compete directly with the MacBook Air. Sales of the iPad continued to slide. The main bright spot for Apple continues to be in its services. The App Store, iTunes and other subscription products generated $7 billion, up 18 percent from the previous year. 17140999 View next article in Business     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Home News Companies Mobile Gadgets Opinion Cyber Security Multimedia Fin24 TechCompanies Apple delivers higher profits, but iPhone sales slip 2017-05-03 07:31 Post a comment 0 share: (Picture: AFP) RELATED ARTICLES Nasdaq jumps to fresh record on strong tech earnings Huawei closing gap on Samsung, Apple in smartphone market Apple touts greater use of recycled metal in gadgets San Francisco - Apple reported a rise in quarterly profits on Tuesday, but its shares took a hit from weaker iPhone sales ahead of a 10-year-anniversary model on the horizon. Apple said its profit climbed 4.9% to slightly more than $11bn on revenue rising 4.6% to $52.9bn in the quarterly period that ended April 1. Shares of the California-based company were down nearly two percent to $144.94 in after-market trades that followed release of the earnings figures. "We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus," Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in the earnings release. Still, iPhone sales dipped slightly compared with a year ago to 50.8 million units, below most forecasts for the key profit machine for Apple. During a conference call with analysts, Cook said Apple was seeing a "pause" in iPhone purchases that he felt was caused by unconfirmed "reports about future iPhones." "That is clearly what is going on," Cook said. Apple has annually unveiled new iPhone models during special events in September, with major innovations anticipated this year because it will mark the tenth anniversary of the debut of the world-changing mobile device. Still, the company contended that iPhone sales were better than it had expected, and skewed toward large-screen iPhone 7 models that have higher margins of profit. Buying back shares Apple also announced that its board of directors authorized an additional $50bn for dividends and buying back shares in the company, raising to $300bn on the total amount of cash to be spent in the program. While Apple has become the world's most valuable company, analysts are looking at how the company is diversifying in the face of a saturated smartphone market and increasing competition. Tuesday's report showed weaker sales of iPads and Mac computers. Apple also reported a 14% drop in revenues from a year earlier for "Greater China," dropping the region behind Europe and the Americas in terms of sales. A strong US dollar facing off with weaker currencies were blamed for a strong "headwind" that pushed revenue down. Keen on India Sales of Macintosh computers did well in China, with revenue up about 20%, and the company's retail shops were drawing crowds. "We continued to believe there is an enormous opportunity there," Cook said of mainland China. "In the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there." Apple is also investing heavily in India, the third largest smartphone market in the world behind China and the US, according to Cook. Apple set a new March quarter revenue record in India, growing by double digits. "We're very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country with its very large, young and tech savvy population, fast-growing economy and improving 4G network infrastructure," Cook said. Apple touted growth of revenue from online services or digital content, which it boasted was on its way to be on scale with a Fortune 100 company in terms of revenue. For the second quarter in a row, revenue reported from Apple services topped $7bn. While not disclosing exact numbers, executives said Apple Watch sales double from the same quarter last year and touted it as the best selling smartwatch in the world. Sales of "other products," which include AirPods wireless ear pieces and Apple Watch, posted a 31% increase in revenue over the prior year. Combining revenue from Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats headphone sales over the course of the last year would give Apple's "wearables" offerings the scale of a Fortune 500 company, according to Cook. Apple's cash holdings meanwhile rose to a record $256.8bn, a figure that raises questions for how the company will manage its massive reserves. Apple remains under pressure to wow the world with a tenth anniversary edition iPhone and to come up with a must-have next big thing. "Among many consumers, there is a sense that Apple is falling behind rivals," GlobalData Retail managing directory Neil Saunders said in an earnings note. "Apple needs to get back on the front foot if it is to grow its market share in phones." While Apple spotlights its growing services business, those offerings are tied to having iPhones in people's hands. Rumors buzzing ahead of an annual Apple developers conference next month include possible plans for a voice-controlled speaker that would take on Amazon's Echo and Google Home in the digital home assistant market. "In more cutting edge areas, like personal home assistants, Apple has seemingly little to offer and has allowed players like Google and Amazon to steal a march," Saunders said.

Now it's chasing another category many believe is Apple's to lose: the $1,000 laptop for everyone. Microsoft, a company once derided for buggy software, unstable hardware and indifferent design, debuted the Surface Laptop on Tuesday. The machine boots up in seconds, has a touch screen and gets a claimed 14 hours of battery life (two better than Apple's MacBook Air). Weighing in at 2.76 pounds, about a quarter-pound less than the Air, the Surface Laptop boasts a 13.5-inch screen and is one of the thinnest and lightest products in its class. Microsoft is targeting the education market-and even threw laptops inside backpacks stuffed with textbooks, notepads and keys to simulate college-kid wear-and-tear. Yet the Surface Laptop's affordable price, portability and features could appeal to a far broader audience-including Mac loyalists. During a tour at Microsoft's sprawling Redmond, Washington, headquarters last month, the Surface team showed off the $999 machine's evolution, starting from the first prototype-little more than a mashup of parts from older Microsoft devices-to the finished product. The engineers and designers spent two years working on the machine, creating multiple prototypes and inviting partners like Intel to set up shop right on campus. The team's pride was evident. After years of struggling to crack the hardware market, they were finally building products they themselves would use. "This product is a reflection of our learnings since we started this team," said Panos Panay, who oversees Surface-brand hardware and has been around long enough to have experienced first-hand the early flops and later successes. Microsoft set out to make a laptop with better-than-average battery life because students said they wanted a device that would last through a long day of classes. The trick was to design a machine with a bigger battery that was still slim and light. Panay's team adhered to a "fail-fast" philosophy that emphasized constant experimentation. Fancy prototyping machines were capable of spitting out mockups 24 hours a day; the prototypes were delivered to individual designers, allowing them to constantly refine the design. Working with Intel, the team shrank the motherboard, the circuit board containing a computer's main components, to provide space for the bigger battery. Intel also helped Microsoft make the machine run cooler. Microsoft, Apple Scramble to Capture US Schools After Google's Success In an effort to make the surface around the keyboard more pleasing to the eye and touch, designers used Alcantara, a synthetic microfiber that's more durable than the suede it mimics. The team brought in dozens of giant rolls of fabric and spent six months choosing colors, from a dark burgundy to a platinum hue. Microsoft already uses Alcantara in the covers of its tablets, but that didn't stop the team from taking a field trip to a BMW dealership to see how the material worked as upholstery. Microsoft chose Alcantara, Panay said, because "it gets rid of that cold, sterile feeling." The designers couldn't poke holes in the Alcantara for the speakers so they figured out a way to transmit sound via gaps in the keyboard. The audio was tested in one of many "anechoic" chambers, rooms that don't let sound in or out. The finished laptop, milled from a slab of custom aluminum alloy, has no screws or holes, save for a pair of microphones to converse with Cortana, Microsoft's voice assistant. With its hardware and software teams working together, Microsoft created a new version of its operating system, called Windows 10 S, that's tailored to the laptop. Terry Myerson, who runs both groups, said inspiration for the "S" came from the auto industry, which often uses the letter to flag sporty, high-performance models. The new OS is designed to prevent the computer from slowing down over time and remaining predictable even if under assault from malware-a selling point long touted by Apple's iOS. (Other manufacturers will install Windows 10 S into their own machines, giving Microsoft a way to compete with cheap machines running Google's Chrome OS.) Pushing the education market theme, Panay said the Surface Laptop will be "same on commencement day as it is on graduation day." (Users can still install Windows 10 Pro over Windows 10 S, but they won't be able to switch back.) The OS also runs only apps offered on Microsoft's app store. "Everything that runs on this device is going to be trusted and verified by Microsoft," Myerson said. Panay said the new OS unlocks performance and features not found on many Windows-based machines. The laptop wakes from sleep almost instantly when the lid is opened, and takes seconds to turn on from a fully powered-off state. The slick computer, which will be available June 15, arrives at an auspicious moment for Microsoft. The company is riding the success of its Surface Studio and Surface tablets (though sales slipped in the the most recent quarter, dragging down total revenue). Meanwhile, Apple has come under fire from Mac owners for focusing on the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch-and letting the Mac lineup languish. The Air hasn't had a serious makeover since 2010, just a modest upgrade two years ago. Stung by the criticism from the disgruntled faithful, Apple has pledged to do better. Panay said Microsoft has made its own luck, saying his team "created what we know our customers are asking for." Of course, luring Mac devotees will take some doing because Apple's OS syncs almost flawlessly with the iPhone, making it a snap to transfer photos, send and receive text messages and make online payments from a Mac. Users will lose that ability if they switch to the Surface Laptop. And despite the impressive hardware, people are used to the Mac interface, another sticking point. Finally, students may balk at paying almost $1,000 when they can get an adequate laptop for much less. Pete Kyriacou, who helps manage the devices team, is sanguine about the challenges facing Microsoft's first real laptop. "In the end," he said, "it's going to appeal to everyone." © 2017 Bloomberg L.P. For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on Twitter, Facebook, and subscribe to our YouTube channel.

Samsung, Apple keep top spots in smartphone marketTue, 02 May 2017 2:39 PM Share Your Email The 2017 market will feel the impact of the new Samsung Galaxy S8 flagship handset according to IDC. Picture: AFP     Samsung and Apple maintained their leadership in the smartphone market in early 2017 while Chinese-based Huawei's strong growth cemented its number three position, a market tracker said Thursday. Research firm IDC said overall smartphone shipments grew 4.3 percent in the first quarter, slightly better than its prior forecast, to 347 million units. "The first quarter smartphone results further prove that the smartphone industry is not dead and that growth still exists," said IDC analyst Ryan Reith. "There is no question that 2016 was a pivotal year for the industry as growth dipped to low single digits for the first time. However, we believe the industry will show some rebound in 2017, and the strong first quarter results certainly support this argument." Reith said the 2017 market will feel the impact of the new Samsung Galaxy S8 flagship handset, and a widely expected announcement from Apple for its new iPhone later this year. According to the survey, Samsung led the market in the first quarter with a 22.8 percent share to 14.9 percent for Apple, with little growth for the top two vendors. But Huawei's sales jumped 21.7 percent to give it a 9.8 percent share, and fellow Chinese makers Oppo and Vivo, the number four and five vendors, respectively, also boosted their sales. IDC said the bulk of smartphone growth is likely to come from low-cost handset makers. "Although we have seen an abundance of premium redesigned flagships that just entered the market, moving forward, we still expect most of the growth to come from more affordable models in a variety of markets," said IDC's Anthony Scarsella. "Despite all the popularity and media hype around premium devices, we continue to witness a shift in many companies' portfolios geared towards affordable devices with premium-type styling compared to flagship models." He added that makers "have started to implement a single premium design language that ultimately blurs the lines between the high-end and the low-end, allowing the average consumer to jump on the brand without a hefty upfront investment." The report is based on preliminary quarterly estimates, with Apple due to report sales figures next week.   AFP Read More SAMASUNG GALAXY S8 CELLPHONE APPLE Comments Please Note By commenting on this article, you are agreeing to the Terms and Conditions of the iafrica.com comments system.

Here’s why. Matthew Dunnnews.com.au@mattydunn11 news.com.au May 3, 20172:18pm Apple want’s your old iPhone back so it can make new products. DESPITE a proven record of being largely coy about its inner-workings, Apple has opened up about one future plan for all of its products and it’s pretty amazing. Apple’s 2017 Environmental Responsibility Report details the tech giants plans to manufacture all of its products with 100 per cent renewable or recycled materials. The company hopes to establish a “closed-loop supply chain” for aluminium, copper, tin and tungsten, with hopes to stop mining the earth altogether. Apple hopes to achieve this by using a combination of recycled metals from suppliers and recycled material from its own returned products. “We are committing as a company to not necessarily having to source from the earth for everything that we need,” Apple wrote on its updated Environment site. “One day, we’d like to be able to build new products with just recycled materials, including your old products.” While being fully sustainable is still a ways off yet, the building blocks are slowly being put into place. Since 2016, Apple has been using its recycling robot Liam, which extracts recyclable materials from iPhones. Liam: An Innovation Story1:03 True innovation means considering what happens to a product at every stage of its life cycle. Liam disassembles your iPhone when it?s no longer functioning, so the materials inside can live on. Courtesy: Apple May 3rd 2017 3 hours ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ The machine disassembles the company’s smartphones and takes gold and copper from the camera, cobalt and lithium from the battery, and silver and platinum from the logic board. Sustainability doesn’t just stop with recycling old iPhones, with the company’s massive new headquarters, Apple Park, using 100 per cent renewable energy from solar, hydro and wind sources. Apple also claims over 99 per cent of its packaging comes from materials sourced from protected sustainable forests. “We are now protecting and creating enough sustainably managed forests in China and the United States to cover all of Apple’s product packaging needs,” read the report. Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives Lisa Jackson added the company felt it was important to be open about its plans. “We’re actually doing something we rarely do, which is announce a goal before we’ve completely figured out how to do it,” she told Vice. “So we’re a little nervous, but we also think it’s really important, because as a sector we believe it’s where technology should be going.

Ford shares dropped 4.4 percent and General Motors fell 2.9 percent, as major automakers posted declines in U.S. new vehicle sales for April. After the market closed, Apple shares fell more than 1 percent after the company reported a surprise drop in iPhone sales for the quarter. Apple shares had gained 0.6 percent during regular trading ahead of the report. Investors also were awaiting other significant events later in the week, including Wednesday's expected statement from the Federal Reserve, which began meeting on Tuesday, and Friday's U.S. employment report. The Fed is widely expected to stand pat on interest rates, but may offer hints on the possibility of a rate hike in June. The benchmark S&P 500 <.SPX> is approaching record highs during an earnings season that has generally exceeded expectations. Overall, profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.9 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "The technicals in general look good for the S&P," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. "The fundamentals are improving, particularly as the earnings season unfolds here." The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 36.43 points, or 0.17 percent, to 20,949.89, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 2.83 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,391.16 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 3.76 points, or 0.06 percent, to 6,095.37. The technology sector <.SPLRCT> rose 0.3 percent, its fourth straight day of gains. Industrials <.SPLRCI> gained 0.5 percent, helped by airlines shares after Delta said its passenger unit revenue increased 1 percent in April. Energy shares <.SPNY> fell 0.5 percent as oil prices weakened. The S&P 500 has climbed 11.8 percent since President Donald Trump's Nov. 8 election, fueled by hopes for his plans for tax cuts, deregulation and infrastructure spending, though investors have questioned his ability to enact his agenda. "The administration continues to issue tons of contradictory or hard-to-understand proposals and ideas and I think it has left this market a little bit confused about next steps," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. In earnings news, Advanced Micro Devices tumbled 24.4 percent after the chipmaker's second-quarter gross margins forecast raised some concerns. The stock was the biggest percentage decliner in the S&P 500. Archer Daniels Midland sank 8.9 percent and CVS Health fell 3.6 percent after their respective quarterly reports. Coach shares rose 11.4 percent, making it the biggest gainer on the S&P, as the handbag maker cut back on discounting in the United States and sold more expensive bags. Advancing and declining issues were roughly even on the NYSE, while on Nasdaq, a 1.26-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 47 new 52-week highs and 9 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 145 new highs and 51 new lows. About 7 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 6.5 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

The Fed begins its meeting later in the day and while the central bank is widely expected to stand pat on interest rates, investors are awaiting its statement, due on Wednesday, for clues regarding the future path of rate hikes. "While no one expects any changes to policy, the 500-word statement will probably provide some direction to the dollar," said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM. "'Will the Fed acknowledge a slowdown in growth and thus send rate hike expectations lower for 2017?' The Fed's statement should be answering these questions, and based on that, traders will act." Strong corporate earnings for the first quarter have largely outweighed concerns about patches of weak economic data, including a report last week that showed the U.S. economy grew at its slowest pace in three years in the first quarter. Dow e-minis were down 16 points, or 0.08 percent, with 13,314 contracts changing hands at 8:17 a.m. ET (1217 GMT). S&P 500 e-minis were down 1 point, or 0.04 percent, with 79,398 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 4.75 points, or 0.08 percent, on volume of 18,336 contracts. Wall Street climbed on Monday, boosted by gains in marquee tech stocks, including Apple, that more than offset weak economic data and pushed the Nasdaq to another record high. The CBOE Volatility Index, a barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, closed at its lowest level since February 2007. Investors are bracing for another heavy week of corporate reports to see if quarterly earnings will keep on exceeding expectations. Overall, profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of Apple were up 0.3 percent at $147.02 in premarket trading, after hitting a record high a day earlier. The iPhone maker is due to report results after the close of market. Dow component Pfizer was down 0.5 percent at $33.60 after the drugmaker's quarterly revenue missed estimates. MasterCard rose 1.4 percent to $117.99 as the world's second-largest payments network's quarterly profit rose. Advanced Micro Devices tumbled 12.2 percent to $11.97 after the chipmaker's second-quarter gross margins forecast raised some concerns. Coach rose 6.5 percent to $41.25 after the handbag maker reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit. Angie's List soared 56.2 percent to $9.20 after IAC/InterActiveCorp said it would buy the consumer review website operator. IAC was up 10.5 percent at $93.01.

However, investors held off from making big bets as the two-day Federal Reserve meeting kicked off. The Fed is widely expected to stand pat on interest rates, but investors are awaiting the central bank's statement on Wednesday for hints on the possibility of a rate hike in June. The markets' gains were capped by a decline in auto stocks after automakers reported a fall in new vehicle sales for April. Ford dropped 3.8 percent, while General Motors fell 2.8 percent. "I think the auto sales numbers have caused the market to take a step back," said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. "I think people are reading too much into that. There's a fear that is building on last quarter's GDP numbers that the consumer is pulling back, which we don't think is the case." Data last week showed the U.S. economy grew at its slowest pace in three years in the first quarter. But, Schutte said strong corporate earnings have helped hold the market up. "With earnings rising, that is backdrop for positive stock returns moving forward." Overall, profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.9 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At 12:41 a.m. ET (1641 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 43.41 points, or 0.21 percent, at 20,956.87. The S&P 500 was up 3.36 points, or 0.14 percent, at 2,391.69 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 6.94 points, or 0.11 percent, at 6,098.54. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with the technology index's 0.39 percent rise leading the advancers. Apple hit a record high for the second straight day. The iPhone maker is due to report results after the close of market. A 0.3 percent fall in consumer staples led the laggard. CVS Health was down 2.8 percent at $79.70, while Archer Daniels Midland fell 8.2 percent to $41.98, both after reporting results. Dow component Pfizer was down 1 percent at $33.43 after the drugmaker's quarterly revenue missed estimates. Advanced Micro Devices tumbled 18.9 percent to $11.04 after the chipmaker's second-quarter gross margins forecast raised some concerns. Coach rose as much as 12.2 percent to a nine-month high of $43.47 after the handbag maker reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit.

Shares of the California-based company were down nearly two per cent to US$144.65 in after-market trades that followed released of the earnings figures. “We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus,” Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in the earnings release. Cook said the company has seen “great” response to new iPhone 7 Red Special Edition models and is “thrilled with the strong momentum of our services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter.” Still, iPhone sales dipped slightly compared with a year ago to 50.8 million units, below most forecast for the key profit machine for Apple. During a conference call with analysts, Cook said Apple was seeing a “pause” in iPhone purchases that he felt was caused by unconfirmed “reports about future iPhones”. “That is clearly what is going on,” Cook said. Apple has annually unveiled new iPhone models during special events in September, with major innovations anticipated this year because it will mark the tenth anniversary of the debut of the world-changing mobile device. Still the company contended that iPhone sales were better than it had expected, growing in four of its five top markets and skewing toward large-screen iPhone 7 models that have higher margins of profit.   BUYING BACK SHARES Apple also announced that its board of directors has authorised an addition US$50 billion for dividends and buying back shares in the company, raising to US$300 billion the total amount of cash to be spent in the programme during the coming two years. While Apple has become the world's most valuable company, analysts are looking at how the company is diversifying in the face of a saturated smartphone market and increasing competition. Yesterday's report showed weaker sales of iPads and Mac computers. Apple also reported a 14 per cent drop in revenues from a year earlier for “Greater China”, dropping the region behind Europe and the Americas in terms of sales. A strong US dollar facing off with weaker currencies were blamed for a strong “headwind” that pushed revenue down.   KEEN ON INDIA Sales of Macintosh computers did well in China, with revenue up about 20 per cent, and the company's retail shops were attracting visitors in what it saw as a good signal for its business there. “We continued to believe there is an enormous opportunity there,” Cook said on mainland China. “In the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there.” Apple is also investing heavily in India, the third -largest smartphone market in the world behind China and the US, according to Cook. Apple set a new March quarter revenue record in India, growing by double digits. “We're very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country with its very large, young and tech-savvy population, fast-growing economy and improving 4G network infrastructure,” Cook said. Apple continued to tout growth of revenue from online services or digital content, which it boasted was on its way to be on scale with a Fortune 100 company in terms of revenue. For the second quarter in a row, revenue from Apple services topped US$7 billion, the company reported. While not disclosing exact numbers, executives said Apple Watch sales doubled from the same quarter last year and touted it as the best-selling smartwatch in the world. Sales of other products, which include AirPods wireless ear pieces and Apple Watch, posted a 31 per cent increase in revenue over the prior year. Combining revenue from Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats headphone sales over the course of the last year would give Apple's “wearables” offerings the scale of a Fortune 500 company, according to Cook. Apple's cash holdings, meanwhile rose to a record US$256.8 billion, a figure that raises questions for how the company will manage its massive reserves. ADVERTISEMENT POST A COMMENT HOUSE RULES 1.

Those looking forward to the new phone may have held off on buying a new device until the fall, analysts said. The softer-than-expected sales come as Apple faces increased competition for the device that makes up the majority of Apple's profits. Apple sold 50 million iPhones in the past quarter, 1 million less than in the same period last year. Analysts had expected Apple to sell 52 million units. Apple CEO Tim Cook Says India's 4G Rollout Is 'Truly Impressive' On an earnings call, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said that Apple did not correctly estimate how popular the iPhone 7 Plus would be compared with the iPhone 7, which caused some supply problems. The company did show strong profits thanks in part to its services unit, reporting earnings of $2.10 a share vs. an expected $2.02. But the disappointing iPhone sales, combined with a weak outlook for the next quarter, sent the stock down more than 2 percent in after-hours trading. US sales grew 11 percent, but the company saw a 14 percent sales drop in China. Cook played down concerns about sales in the world's largest phone market, saying that he thought those results were in line with previous years. He added that seven of the company's most popular stores are in China. But local competition from Chinese smartphone makers such as Huawei have been chipping away at Apple's market share. Cook addressed analyst questions about the Apple Watch, saying the company is happy with sales and remains "very committed to it and believe . . . over time it will be even larger." Apple doesn't break out sales numbers for its wearable, but analysts expected to see more growth from that part of Apple's business as competitors leave the smartwatch market And analysts are upbeat about Apple's ability to bounce back, thanks to the company's reputation and customer loyalty. "We're bullish on the iPhone 8 for three reasons: Apple's ecosystem stickiness, the expected upgradability of the device, and teenage fondness of Apple devices," said Clement Thibault, a senior investing analyst with Investing.com. Meanwhile, Apple is also facing increased competition in its growing Mac business. Microsoft announced Tuesday morning a sleek new laptop aimed at students that is designed to compete directly with the MacBook Air. Sales of the iPad continued to slide. The company also increased the size of its share dividend and buyback programs to $300 billion through March 2019. Apple's stockpile of cash is nearly $260 billion, which - as The Washington Post reported - is more than the gross domestic product of Jamaica and Finland combined. The main bright spot for Apple continues to be in its services. The App Store, iTunes and other subscription products generated $7 billion, up 18 percent from the previous year. Apple faces stiff competition from Samsung but is in a strong enough position to weather a weaker quarter - as long as it delivers on the promise of the iPhone 8, said Thomas Cooke, a professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. "This is acceptable, considering the environment and that they have new products in the pipeline. That people are holding onto their phones a little longer than expected shouldn't be so alarming," he said. © 2017 The Washington Post For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on Twitter, Facebook, and subscribe to our YouTube channel.

The California-based company believes that the drop in sales is because the customers may have held back purchases in anticipation of the 10th-anniversary edition - iPhone 8 which Apple is expected to announce by the end of this year. iPhone 8 is going to Apple's most important product later this year. Under pressure from shareholders to hand over more of its $250 billion-plus (roughly Rs. 16,03,228 crores) hoard of cash and investments, Apple boosted its capital return programme by $50 billion (roughly Rs. 3,20,648 crores), increased its share repurchase authorization by $35 billion (roughly Rs. 2,24,448 crores) and raised its quarterly dividend by 10.5 percent. Investors were unmoved, sending shares of the world's most valuable listed company down 1.9 percent at $144.65 in after-hours trading. Apple sold 50.76 million iPhones in its fiscal second quarter ended April 1, down from 51.19 million a year earlier. Analysts on average had estimated iPhone sales of 52.27 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri argued the decline was not as bad as it looked, given the peculiarities of how phone sales are calculated. The company reports what are called "sell-in" figures for the iPhone, a measure of how many units it sells to retailers, rather than "sell-through" figures, which measure how many phones are actually sold to consumers. Also Read: Apple is reportedly gearing to launch its online store in India Maestri said the company reduced the volume of inventory going through its retail channel by about 1.2 million units in the quarter, meaning the company sold about 52 million phones to customers on a sell-through basis. Despite the dip in unit sales, iPhone revenues rose 1.2 percent in the quarter, helped by a higher average selling price. Apple on its 10th anniversary Expectations are building ahead of Apple's 10th-anniversary iPhone range this fall, with investors hoping that the launch would help bolster sales. Apple typically launches its new iPhones in September. A big jump in sales usually follows in the holiday quarter, before demand tapers over the next few quarters as customers hold back ahead of the next launch. Apple's 10th-anniversary iPhone range might sport features such as wireless charging, 3D facial recognition and a curved display. "There is a general softening in phone demand to contend with as well as expectations of a big upgrade, all of which softens the blow of this quarter's miss," said James McQuivey, a Forrester Research analyst. "If we see Apple downplaying expectations before the next upgrade cycle, it might mean that the company isn't confident it will beat those expectations." The company forecast total revenue of between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion (roughly Rs. 2,78,952 crores and Rs. 2,91,764 crores) for the current quarter, while analysts on average were expecting $45.60 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts on average expect the company to sell 42.31 million iPhones in the current quarter, according to FactSet. For the second quarter, the company's net income rose to $11.03 billion (roughly Rs. 70,728 crores), or $2.10 per share, compared with $10.52 billion (roughly Rs. 457 crores), or $1.90 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $2.02 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 4.6 percent to $52.90 billion (roughly Rs. 3,39,197 crores) in the quarter, compared with analysts' average estimate of $53.02 billion (roughly Rs. 3,39,964 crores). A 17.5 percent jump in the company's services business - which includes the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud - to $7.04 billion (roughly Rs. 45,141 crores), boosted revenue. Also Read: Samsung, Apple on top in phone market but Chinese companies chasing them hard: IDC "We are particularly encouraged by the fact that service revenue is nowhere near as cyclical as product revenue," Neil Saunders, Managing Director of GlobalData Retail, wrote in a note to clients. Apple's revenue from the Greater China region fell 14.1 percent to $10.73 billion (roughly Rs. 68,806 crores) in the quarter, as cheaper rivals in the region chipped away at sales. Maestri said that sales of Macs and the company's services were strong in China during the March quarter. "The performance we're seeing in China should get better going forward this year," he said. Apple's gross margin hit 38.9 percent, slightly ahead of analysts' average expectation of 38.7 percent, despite higher prices for memory chips. The company said it expects gross margins next quarter between 37.5 percent and 38.5 percent, versus analysts' expectation of 38.3 percent, according to FactSet. "NAND and DRAM (memory chips) are under pressure right now in terms of some price pressure. We saw that in the March quarter and expect that to continue into the June quarter, but for all the other commodities, we see prices declining," Maestri said. Apple is currently working on the upcoming iPhone edition for the year, dubbed iPhone 8. The smartphone is reportedly said to be a really special one for the company, as Apple is launching the handset with regards to celebrate their 10th anniversary.

On Tuesday’s earnings call, the Apple CEO blamed a slowdown in iPhone sales on rumors about future iPhones. Apple is expected to release an especially exciting new smartphone this fall to mark the device’s 10th anniversary. iPhone loyalists are putting off buying the still young iPhone 7 in anticipation of a better upgrade. Nobody wants to drop $800 on a phone that will be old news in a few months. As usual, details are sparse but here are a few ways Apple could live up to the hype. A new name Historically, Apple announces a new phone in September, and and a new numbered iPhone every other year. Last year was the iPhone 7, so this Fall it should release an iPhone 7S. Incremental upgrades don’t really sing “greatest update ever.” Apple could jump ahead to iPhone 8, or pick a new name entirely like iPhone Pro or iPhone X. Adding a higher-end iPhone to the line up would mean Apple could still release an iPhone 7S and 7S Plus. The “Pro” version might also add another digit to the price. Expect the new iPhone to start at $1,000. Nothing but screen Buttons are so 2015. Like the recently announced Samsung Galaxy S8, a new iPhone could extend the touchscreen so it dominates the entire front side of the phone. That would mean booting the physical home button for an on-screen button or buttons. Apple already took the first step towards this un-buttoning when it made the dot touch sensitive last year. The higher end iPhone might also switch from LED to a more advanced OLED screen. The edges may also curve for a smoother, seamless look. According to Nikkei, Apple placed an order for 70 million OLED panels this year. Eyes are the new fingers The Home button doubles as a fingerprint sensor. The same capacitive touch technology might not work with a full-screen phone. Instead of a fingerprint sensor, Apple could use different kinds of biometric security such as face recognition or iris scanning, according to KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Shape of things to come Tweaking the physical design of the iPhone is pretty minor, but it’s what will signal to the world, “Hey, I spent all my money on the very latest iPhone.” There’s not much you can do with a slim rectangle, but Apple will likely make a few tweaks to the body. In addition to the all-glass front, it could have another piece of glass on the back to double your chances of shattering something when it drops. Also look for different curves or cuts around the edges, and new materials like stainless steel. If you use a case and are worried nobody will know you’re an Apple early adopter, just pop in some Airpods. RIP wires Tech companies have been tinkering with wireless charging for years, but the technology just hasn’t been ready yet. Apple is rumored to be working on wireless charging for the new iPhone. Last year, Bloomberg reported Apple was working on wireless charging over the air. The reality may be less exciting, according to MacRumors: Inductive charging, which is also wireless but requires physical contact between the device and the charging station. More port drama The iPhone 7 removed the headphone jack. It was a controversial decision and forced people to use headphones that worked with the proprietary Lightning port, AirPods or an adapter. It’s unlikely Apple will bring the port back, but there is a small chance it could swap it out for the industry standard USB-C port. The usual They are the under appreciated upgrades, the predictable results of Moore’s Law and constantly improving technology. Every new iPhone, it seems, is faster, lighter and thinner. Expect new processors, improved cameras, and general spec upgrades. Battery life hasn’t significantly improved in years, in part due to other upgrades sucking up more power. Apple is also due to update the iOS this year. iOS 11 would likely be previewed at Apple’s developer conference this summer.

Shira Ovide The company is also finding ways to squeeze the iPhone sales price even higher, which can help Apple’s bottom line even as it becomes more difficult to persuade more people to pony up for a new model. Photo: Reuters New York: Even if Apple’s next iPhone proves to be a hit, it may seem like a letdown. The company’s stock price and valuation have been on a tear this year as investors look past the company’s transformation into a highly profitable but slow-growing leviathan. Shares have climbed 27%, outpacing most of the other technology superpowers, thanks to unshakable optimism about a sales rebound coming from the next versions of the iPhone. That’s the hope and this is the reality: Apple’s growth rate is still anaemic by the company’s standards, especially from the iPhone business that generates about two-thirds of its revenue. Total revenue rose 4.6% in the three months ended 1 April from a year earlier, Apple disclosed on Tuesday. That’s amazing for a company of Apple’s size, but not the impossible-to-believe growth machine of past years. The number of iPhones sold dipped 0.8%. That’s not good. Also read: Apple is under-penetrated in India, says CEO Tim Cook The belief is no matter what happens in Apple’s business in the next few months, it will be a prelude to a pickup in sales from a drastic makeover coming to Apple’s product lineup for the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. But a lot can go wrong with the hopes for an iPhone sales comeback starting in late 2017. People are opting to hold onto their existing smartphones for longer, and a higher percentage of people buying iPhones in the US have been opting for older or cheaper models than they did in the past. China is expected to be the biggest spot of iPhone sales growth, but a purchase spike there is no sure thing, either. Compared with the cycle of blockbuster iPhone sales in China starting in late 2014, Apple has more competition now from local companies that also sell feature-rich smartphones. Apple’s revenue from “greater China”—China, Hong Kong and Taiwan—fell for the fifth consecutive quarter. That’s not a great setup for a China revival. And there’s a risk that hopes of an iPhone growth rebound have gone too far. For the first time in years, Apple’s stock no longer looks like a bargain. The company’s multiple of forward earnings is the highest it has been since late 2014 and early 2015, when it was clear that the much-hyped debut of Apple’s first larger-screen phone models were a surefire hit. It’s hard to imagine a repeat of that iPhone 6 sales bounce, and indeed even the most optimistic Apple loyalists are not expecting a return to anything like that growth tear. In Apple’s 2015 fiscal year, the first full year of iPhone 6 sales, the number of iPhones sold climbed by 62 million, or 37%. On average, analysts who track Apple are expecting iPhone sales to increase by about 19 million units, or a 9% gain, in the fiscal year that will end in September 2018, according to a UBS analysis of Wall Street estimates. The good news for Apple is it doesn’t have to persuade many of its loyalists to trade up to newer models. About 500 million to 600 million iPhones are out there in the world, according to Mizuho estimates. If just 4% of those iPhone owners opt for a new model, that translates into at least 20 million new phones sold. The company is also finding ways to squeeze the iPhone sales price even higher, which can help Apple’s bottom line even as it becomes more difficult to persuade more people to pony up for a new model. The best advice, though, is to get used to Apple’s less-turbocharged future. The iPhone has run out of growth, and it’s not clear that driverless cars, streaming videos or anything else can fully pick up the slack. Still, Apple generates more profits than any other company, and it is swimming in cash. The company said on Tuesday that it was on track to return $300 billion in cash to stockholders by the end of March 2019. Even with the recent stock run-up, Apple barely trades like a growth stock. That is more than fine. But don’t let hopes of a mythic return to anything like the good old days obscure the reality of a bright and shiny Apple.

On Tuesday's earnings call, the Apple CEO blamed a slowdown in iPhone sales on rumors about future iPhones. Apple is expected to release an especially exciting new smartphone this fall to mark the device's 10th anniversary. iPhone loyalists are putting off buying the still young iPhone 7 in anticipation of a better upgrade. Nobody wants to drop $800 on a phone that will be old news in a few months. As usual, details are sparse but here are a few ways Apple could live up to the hype. A new name Historically, Apple announces a new phone in September, and and a new numbered iPhone every other year. Last year was the iPhone 7, so this Fall it should release an iPhone 7S. Incremental upgrades don't really sing "greatest update ever." Apple could jump ahead to iPhone 8, or pick a new name entirely like iPhone Pro or iPhone X. Adding a higher-end iPhone to the line up would mean Apple could still release an iPhone 7S and 7S Plus. The "Pro" version might also add another digit to the price. Expect the new iPhone to start at $1,000. Nothing but screen Buttons are so 2015. Like the recently announced Samsung Galaxy S8, a new iPhone could extend the touchscreen so it dominates the entire front side of the phone. That would mean booting the physical home button for an on-screen button or buttons. Apple already took the first step towards this un-buttoning when it made the dot touch sensitive last year. The higher end iPhone might also switch from LED to a more advanced OLED screen. The edges may also curve for a smoother, seamless look. According to Nikkei, Apple placed an order for 70 million OLED panels this year. Eye's are the new fingers The Home button doubles as a fingerprint sensor. The same capacitive touch technology might not work with a full-screen phone. Instead of a fingerprint sensor, Apple could use different kinds of biometric security such as face recognition or iris scanning, according to KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Shape of things to come Tweaking the physical design of the iPhone is pretty minor, but it's what will signal to the world, "Hey, I spent all my money on the very latest iPhone." There's not much you can do with a slim rectangle, but Apple will likely make a few tweaks to the body. In addition to the all-glass front, it could have another piece of glass on the back to double your chances of shattering something when it drops. Also look for different curves or cuts around the edges, and new materials like stainless steel. If you use a case and are worried nobody will know you're an Apple early adopter, just pop in some Airpods. RIP wires Tech companies have been tinkering with wireless charging for years, but the technology just hasn't been ready yet. Apple is rumored to be working on wireless charging for the new iPhone. Last year, Bloomberg reported Apple was working on wireless charging over the air. The reality may be less exciting, according to MacRumors: Inductive charging, which is also wireless but requires physical contact between the device and the charging station. More port drama The iPhone 7 removed the headphone jack. It was a controversial decision and forced people to use headphones that worked with the proprietary Lightning port, AirPods or an adapter. It's unlikely Apple will bring the port back, but there is a small chance it could swap it out for the industry standard USB-C port. The usual They are the under appreciated upgrades, the predictable results of Moore's Law and constantly improving technology. Every new iPhone, it seems, is faster, lighter and thinner. Expect new processors, improved cameras, and general spec upgrades. Battery life hasn't significantly improved in years, in part due to other upgrades sucking up more power. Apple is also due to update the iOS this year. iOS 11 would likely be previewed at Apple's developer conference this summer. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Apple’s iPad sales were also down on an yearly basis, and stood at 8.9 million, despite a new upgrade to the iPad being introduced this year. Apple’s Mac business saw a slight increase in yearly sales to 4.1 millions Macs. Revenue from Apple’s services business stood at 7.04 billion, which is slightly lower compared to last quarter’s 7.1 billion. However on an yearly basis, Apple’s revenue from services has grown by 18 per cent; last year Apple’s revenue from services stood at 5.9 billion for the same quarter. Here’s a look at the top comments that Apple CEO Tim Cook made in the investors earnings call: Investment in India Apple has been increasing its investments in India.

According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, March was a record quarter in India for the company, and they saw double digits growth. He also said the improving 4G network, “younger, tech-savvy population” and the growing economy meant this is a market they are optimistic about. “We continue to strengthen our local presence across the entire ecosystem, and we’re very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country,” said Cook in the investor earnings call.

China: For Apple, China is an important market, where the company has lost market share to homegrown players like Huawei, OPPO and vivo. However, Tim Cook said Apple said they saw “double-digit revenue growth” from Mac, Services in Greater China. Apple saw store revenue up 27 per cent from last year in Mainland China.

Apple reports earnings Tuesday, May 2, 2017. (Eric Risberg/The Associated Press)   By Michael Liedtke The Associated Press May 3, 2017   Today’s Business stories Houston and Pittsburgh developers buy Louie’s Village restaurant site in Eugene with eyes on an apartment tower for UO students Returning to the classroom Congress lambastes airlines Washington may tie Boeing’s tax breaks to how many employees it maintains in the state President swings wildly on banking regulations More Business »   SAN FRANCISCO — As Apple’s stash of cash grows, so does the possibility that the world’s most valuable company will use some of the money for a huge acquisition that would expand its empire beyond iPhones and other gadgets. The company currently holds more than a quarter-trillion dollars it could use to go shopping. So far, the guessing game has primarily focused on possible targets such as Netflix and Tesla Motors. Either deal could make sense, given Apple’s long-running interest in providing a TV service to consumers and its more recent work on self-driving cars. But in recent months the takeover talk has swirled around whether Apple might do something even more dramatic by making a bid for Walt Disney Co. The mouse and the apple Such a combination would create the world’s first company worth $1 trillion. Beyond that, an Apple-Disney marriage would unite some of the world’s most successful brands in technology and entertainment — a list that includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac computer, Mickey Mouse, Disneyland, ESPN, Lucasfilm, Pixar and Marvel. “If there’s a deal out there that would strike fear in the hearts of Silicon Valley and Hollywood, this could be it,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a recent research report assessing the logic of an Apple-Disney combination. Apple doesn’t discuss specific companies that it might buy, but it’s exploring far and wide, according to Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri. “We are looking at every size of acquisition, so we will see how it goes going forward,” Maestri told The Associated Press in a Tuesday interview. Disney hasn’t given any inclination that it’s looking for a buyer, but publicly held companies are required to consider all takeover offers. Buying Disney would be expensive. Daryanani estimates that Apple would have to pay $157 per share, or about $250 billion. Treasure chest Apple is one of the few companies — if not the only one — that could pay that sum out of pocket. The Cupertino, Calif., company ended March with nearly $257 billion in cash and marketable securities, according to numbers released Tuesday with Apple’s earnings report for the January-March quarter. That’s up from $233 billion a year ago, and the figure is expected to keep growing as Apple piles up more profits from the iPhone, iPad and Mac, as well as the applications and services that feed those devices. In its latest quarter, Apple’s earnings climbed 5 percent to $11 billion while revenue also rose 5 percent to nearly $53 billion. In recent years, Apple has used a large chunk of its cash to provide its shareholders with extra income. The company disclosed plans on Tuesday to raise its quarterly dividend by more than 10 percent to 63 cents per share, marking the fifth increase in five years. Apple also has spent $151 billion buying back its own stock since 2012. Doing a mega-deal would be a major departure for Apple, whose largest acquisition to date was its $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014 that helped launch its music streaming service. The slowing smartphone But Daryanani and other analysts believe Apple may need to make a pricier acquisition to lessen the company’s dependence on the iPhone at a time when smartphone sales have been slowing. IPhone sales edged up 1 percent in Apple’s latest quarter, extending a recovery from an unprecedented downturn last year. But many investors remain concerned that Apple has become too vulnerable to the ups and downs of the smartphone market, mostly because the company hasn’t been able to come up with another hit product since the 2011 death of its co-founder and CEO, Steve Jobs. Apple’s last big success, the iPad, came out in 2010, but sales of the tablet have been declining for more than three years. Meanwhile, the iPhone accounted for nearly two-thirds of Apple’s revenue in the past quarter. The Trump administration may give Apple another reason to mull a major acquisition, given earlier promises to lower U.S. taxes on overseas corporate cash brought back to the United States. Should that tax cut happen, Apple CEO Tim Cook has said the company will consider bringing back most of the more than $230 billion it now keeps in foreign countries, making it easier to finance a blockbuster deal in the United States.

Acknowledging that Apple is "underpenetrated" in India, CEO Tim Cook has said the US tech giant is strengthening its local presence in the country and is optimistic about its future given the fast-growing economy and improving 4G network infrastructure in the country. "We set a new March quarter record for India, where revenue grew by strong double digits. We continue to strengthen our local presence across the entire ecosystem, and we're very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country with its very large, young, and tech-savvy population, fast-growing economy, and improving 4G network infrastructure," Cook said in the second quarter results earnings call yesterday. Cook was asked that the California-based company is underpenetrated in India and whether the company will need to work with the country's government to have Apple-owned stores or production given the great opportunity in the country. "We think it's a great opportunity too, and so we're bringing all the things that we brought to bear in other markets that we've eventually done well in, and that's from channel to stores to our ecosystem and so forth, Cook said. Apple s senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller was in India opening a developer centre last quarter. "And so there are a ton of things going on there (India). And we agree that we are underpenetrated there. Our growth rates are good, really good by most people's expectations, maybe not mine as much, Cook said. He said the iPhone maker is putting a "lot of energy" in India, just like Apple has in other geographies that eventually wound up producing more. "So I'm very excited about it, he said. Cook emphasised that the 4G network investment began rolling in in a significant way toward the last quarter of last year in India, which is the third largest smartphone market in the world today behind China and the US. "But they are moving fast. They're moving at a speed that I have not seen in any other country in the world once they were started, and it is truly impressive, he said. Apple has been "investing quite a bit" in India and has a "ton of energy" going into the country on a number of fronts. Cook sounded a bullish tone for the future of Apple in India as the 4G network infrastructure grows in the country. "And so we believe, particularly now that the 4G infrastructure is going in the country and is continuing to be expanded, that there is a huge opportunity for Apple there. And so that and the demographics of the country is why we're putting so much energy there," he said. Apple's Senior Vice president and Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the company achieved double-digit growth in the US, Canada, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Turkey, Russia and Mexico. Apple s growth rates were even higher, over 20 per cent in many other markets, including Brazil, Scandinavia, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, India, Korea and Thailand, Maestri said. Apple posted revenue of US $52.9 billion for its fiscal 2017 second quarter ended April 1, 2017, up from $50.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 65 per cent of the quarter s revenue. It reported net income of US $11 billion for the second quarter as compared to US $10 billion a year ago. The company said that the number of iPhones sold globally fell 1 per cent in the first calendar quarter, compared with the same period a year ago. It sold 50.76 million iPhones in its fiscal second quarter ended April 1, down from 51.19 million a year earlier.

Under pressure from shareholders to hand over more of its $250 billion-plus (roughly Rs. 16,03,228 crores) hoard of cash and investments, Apple boosted its capital return programme by $50 billion (roughly Rs. 3,20,648 crores), increased its share repurchase authorization by $35 billion (roughly Rs. 2,24,448 crores) and raised its quarterly dividend by 10.5 percent. Investors were unmoved, sending shares of the world's most valuable listed company down 1.9 percent at $144.65 in after-hours trading. Apple sold 50.76 million iPhones in its fiscal second quarter ended April 1, down from 51.19 million a year earlier. Apple CEO Tim Cook Says India's 4G Rollout Is 'Truly Impressive' Analysts on average had estimated iPhone sales of 52.27 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri argued the decline was not as bad as it looked, given the peculiarities of how phone sales are calculated. The company reports what are called "sell-in" figures for the iPhone, a measure of how many units it sells to retailers, rather than "sell-through" figures, which measure how many phones are actually sold to consumers. Maestri said the company reduced the volume of inventory going through its retail channel by about 1.2 million units in the quarter, meaning the company sold about 52 million phones to customers on a sell-through basis. Despite the dip in unit sales, iPhone revenues rose 1.2 percent in the quarter, helped by a higher average selling price. 10th anniversary Expectations are building ahead of Apple's 10th-anniversary iPhone range this fall, with investors hoping that the launch would help bolster sales. Apple typically launches its new iPhones in September. A big jump in sales usually follows in the holiday quarter, before demand tapers over the next few quarters as customers hold back ahead of the next launch. Apple's 10th-anniversary iPhone range might sport features such as wireless charging, 3D facial recognition and a curved display. "There is a general softening in phone demand to contend with as well as expectations of a big upgrade, all of which softens the blow of this quarter's miss," said James McQuivey, a Forrester Research analyst. "If we see Apple downplaying expectations before the next upgrade cycle, it might mean that the company isn't confident it will beat those expectations." The company forecast total revenue of between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion (roughly Rs. 2,78,952 crores and Rs. 2,91,764 crores) for the current quarter, while analysts on average were expecting $45.60 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts on average expect the company to sell 42.31 million iPhones in the current quarter, according to FactSet. For the second quarter, the company's net income rose to $11.03 billion (roughly Rs. 70,728 crores), or $2.10 per share, compared with $10.52 billion (roughly Rs. 457 crores), or $1.90 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $2.02 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 4.6 percent to $52.90 billion (roughly Rs. 3,39,197 crores) in the quarter, compared with analysts' average estimate of $53.02 billion (roughly Rs. 3,39,964 crores). A 17.5 percent jump in the company's services business - which includes the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud - to $7.04 billion (roughly Rs. 45,141 crores), boosted revenue. "We are particularly encouraged by the fact that service revenue is nowhere near as cyclical as product revenue," Neil Saunders, Managing Director of GlobalData Retail, wrote in a note to clients. Apple's revenue from the Greater China region fell 14.1 percent to $10.73 billion (roughly Rs. 68,806 crores) in the quarter, as cheaper rivals in the region chipped away at sales. Maestri said that sales of Macs and the company's services were strong in China during the March quarter. "The performance we're seeing in China should get better going forward this year," he said. Apple's gross margin hit 38.9 percent, slightly ahead of analysts' average expectation of 38.7 percent, despite higher prices for memory chips. The company said it expects gross margins next quarter between 37.5 percent and 38.5 percent, versus analysts' expectation of 38.3 percent, according to FactSet. "NAND and DRAM (memory chips) are under pressure right now in terms of some price pressure. We saw that in the March quarter and expect that to continue into the June quarter, but for all the other commodities, we see prices declining," Maestri said. © Thomson Reuters 2017 For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on Twitter, Facebook, and subscribe to our YouTube channel.

Yoshita Singh A file photo of Apple CEO Tim Cook. Photo: Reuters New York: Acknowledging that Apple is “under-penetrated” in India, CEO Tim Cook has said the US tech company is strengthening its local presence in the country and is optimistic about its future given the fast-growing economy and improving 4G network infrastructure in the country. “We set a new March quarter record for India, where revenue grew by strong double digits. We continue to strengthen our local presence across the entire ecosystem, and we’re very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country with its very large, young, and tech-savvy population, fast-growing economy, and improving 4G network infrastructure,” Cook said in the second quarter results earnings call on Tuesday. Cook was asked that the California-based company is under-penetrated in India and whether the company will need to work with the country’s government to have Apple-owned stores or production given the great opportunity in the country. “We think it’s a great opportunity too, and so we’re bringing all the things that we brought to bear in other markets that we’ve eventually done well in, and that’s from channel to stores to our ecosystem and so forth,” Cook said. Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller was in India opening a developer centre last quarter. “And so there are a ton of things going on there (India). And we agree that we are underpenetrated there. Our growth rates are good, really good by most people’s expectations, maybe not mine as much,” Cook said. He said the iPhone maker is putting a “lot of energy” in India, just like Apple has in other geographies that eventually wound up producing more. “So I’m very excited about it,” he said. Cook emphasised that the 4G network investment began rolling in a significant way toward the last quarter of last year in India, which is the third largest smartphone market in the world today behind China and the US. “But they are moving fast. They’re moving at a speed that I have not seen in any other country in the world once they were started, and it is truly impressive,” he said. Apple has been “investing quite a bit” in India and has a “ton of energy” going into the country on a number of fronts. Cook sounded a bullish tone for the future of Apple in India as the 4G network infrastructure grows in the country. “And so we believe, particularly now that the 4G infrastructure is going in the country and is continuing to be expanded, that there is a huge opportunity for Apple there. And so that and the demographics of the country is why we’re putting so much energy there,” he said. Apple’s senior vice president and chief financial officer Luca Maestri said the company achieved double-digit growth in the US, Canada, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Turkey, Russia and Mexico. Apple’s growth rates were even higher, over 20% in many other markets, including Brazil, Scandinavia, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, India, Korea and Thailand, Maestri said. Apple posted revenue of $52.9 billion for its fiscal 2017 second quarter ended April 1, 2017, up from $50.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 65% of the quarter’s revenue. It reported net income of $11 billion for the second quarter as compared to $10 billion a year ago. The company said that the number of iPhones sold globally fell 1% in the first calendar quarter, compared with the same period a year ago. It sold 50.76 million iPhones in its fiscal second quarter ended 1 April, down from 51.19 million a year earlier.

Sometimes, those new features and those phones really are revolutionary, but more often than not, history has shown us that for every Samsung Galaxy or Apple iPhone, there are a dozen more products with amazing-sounding features that never took off. Here are some of the most significant phone flops of all time. The Nokia N-Gage (2003) Back in 2003, Nokia was still riding high as one of the most successful cell phone makers around. But the world was slowly starting to move to a more connected space. Devices such as Danger's SideKick and the Palm Treo were starting to show off the possibility of internet-connected mobile phones (i.e. the smartphone). At the same time, portable gaming was becoming more powerful wit Nintendo's GameBoy Advance, and thanks to the iPod, everyone wanted an MP3 player. So Nokia had an idea: What if there was a device that put all of those things together? And that's how we got the Nokia N-Gage. First launched in October 2003, this was supposed to be a smartphone, a media player, and a portable gaming machine. Unfortunately for Nokia, it failed at all three. We've already covered why it sucked as a console, so let's start with the shape. The N-Gage was shaped like a fucking taco (hence its nickname as "the taco phone"), which might work fine for playing games, but made actually using it as a phone difficult. To talk on the first version of the phone sans headset, users literally had to put the awkwardly-shaped device sideways against their head. Memes were born out of how ridiculous it looked. And the media player features were limited, with no ability to fast-forward or rewind tracks, the inability to put a song on a loop, and no support for playlists. An iPod killer this was not. Try as we might, it was impossible to find a reviewer who liked this gadget. Virtually everyone agreed that this was just a bad idea. But Nokia, God bless them, kept trying with the N-Gage, first with updated hardware, and then with a gaming platform no one used. Finally, in 2009, Nokia finally euthanised the brand. Gizmodo's then Editor-in-Chief Brian Lam was absolutely brutal in his eulogy for the device, writing, "hope we never have to see you again." The BlackBerry Storm (2008) If I'm being honest, I could almost write an entire article about all of BlackBerry's failures at "revolutionary" phones. From the Z10 with its gesture-driven OS that no one made apps for, to the bizarrely-designed Passport that was weird on every level, to the Android-based Priv that I wouldn't give to my worst enemy, BlackBerry has had a lot of duds over the years. But its biggest disaster is still the BlackBerry Storm. In 2008, BlackBerry was still one of the world's leaders, thanks to its trademark keyboarded smartphones like the Curve, the Pearl, and the Bold, which were adored by millions. But the iPhone — then exclusively on AT&T's network in the US — was rising fast. It had apps and games BlackBerry could only dream of, and its fancy glass touchscreen was a hit. So BlackBerry, largely at Verizon's behest, decided to create its own touchscreen "iPhone killer." The Storm was born. It was launched in the US in the fall of 2008 as a Verizon exclusive (it was available on other carriers in other parts of the world). The brilliant minds in Waterloo, Canada weren't content with just making a touch screen BlackBerry — they decided to help retain the keyboard millions of BlackBerry users loved by making the screen something you could press into to get a clicky feel. None of it really worked right. The old BBOS operating system was never truly optimised for touch, and the mechanical mechanism on the bottom of the screen that accomplished that "clicky" feature was a total dud. Oh, and the phone was designed so quickly, the software was insanely buggy from the get-go. But none of that deterred the BlackBerry faithful — at first. When respected gadget columnist David Pogue, then of The New York Times, gave the phone a blisteringly negative review, he got hate mail from BlackBerry fanbois. The backlash was so intense, it necessitated Pogue write a follow-up column, which included some of the more virulent remarks from BlackBerry defenders "I have serious doubts about your ability to evaluate tech. And your friends, for that matter. Yes, the Storm has a different emphasis than past BlackBerries, but it will continue to sell like pancakes." History ended up proving Pogue right. The Storm was a flop (and returns were reportedly very high), and it helped set the company down a shame spiral from which it would never really recover. Amazon Fire phone (2014) Before the Fire Phone, Amazon had a lot of success in hardware. Its Kindle e-readers are in a class by themselves, the Fire line of small tablets have always been a good, cheap iPad alternative, and the Fire TV ecosystem is truly excellent. Given that track record, people were really excited about the advent of an Amazon phone. In 2014, after months of hype and a reported five years of effort, Amazon finally unveiled its take on a mobile device, the Fire Phone. On paper, the phone came loaded with fancy specs, including five cameras, a 3D display, and a hardware/software feature called Firefly that could identify objects so that you could easily add them to your shopping cart. Although reviews were generally mixed, plenty of tech publications were willing to buy into the hype. Check out what my old colleagues at Mashable had to say about the phone after its release: With that philosophy behind it, the Fire pushes Amazon further on the path of becoming the next Apple. ... For the Amazon faithful, Fire completes the platform with the most powerful and intimate of devices — the one that's carried at all times. For the uninitiated, it's the most powerful gateway drug the company could have built. Except it ended up not really being a gateway drug, because no one wanted the phone. For all the hype from tech blogs, consumers just didn't care about the gimmicky features. Even worse, because of politics between Google and Amazon, the FireOS didn't have access to the Google Play Store, which meant the phone couldn't easily get Google Maps, Gmail, or Google Docs. Amazon and AT&T cut the on-contract price of the phone from $US200 ($266) to $US0.99 ($1) after just six weeks on the market. Amazon's mobile phone strategy ended up being a gross miscalculation, which cost the company more than $US170 ($226) million. In the fall of 2015, just over a year after the phone was released, Amazon finally extinguished the Fire Phone for good. Amazon has said it has no plans to re-enter the mobile phone space. That's probably a good thing. HTC First aka the Facebook Phone (2013) Starting in 2010 and then for the better part of three years, there were rumours and speculation that Facebook was planning its own mobile phone. With every new rumour and speculation, journalists and pundits (including me) were paraded on CNN and CNBC and the like to talk about all the reasons why it made sense for Facebook to have its own mobile phone. Even before it bought Instagram and WhatsApp, Facebook was the most powerful — and most popular — app on iOS and Android. What better way to assume world domination than to make your own "iPhone killer"? And so in the spring of 2013, Facebook finally did it. It released its own phone in partnership with HTC, the HTC First. Except, bizarrely, it wasn't really a "Facebook phone" as much as it was a special Android launcher built by Facebook, which was dubbed Facebook Home. The idea was that you could get all of your Facebook messages directly on your home screen, quickly chat with friends using something called Chat Heads, and get near-instant notifications about what was going on around you. Sounds fun and useful right? From Wired's review: It's nice to see that after so many failed attempts, Facebook has finally cracked the mobile software riddle. Here's to hoping it doesn't screw it up. Well, you know how this ends. It turns out, no one wanted a Facebook launcher on their smartphone. Especially when the smartphone itself was fairly boring. Barely a month after its release, AT&T dropped the price of the HTC First to $US0.99 ($1) (down from $US99 ($131)). Within a year, Facebook Home was also dead (in truth, Facebook stopped caring about it the moment the HTC First flopped), and Facebook moved on from trying to dominate the home screen into all the ways it could copy Snapchat. Microsoft Kin (2010) Despite being one of the first players in the smartphone space with Windows Mobile, Microsoft has never managed to make the inroads on mobile that it did on the desktop. But of all of Microsoft's mobile missteps, the worst might just be the short-lived Microsoft Kin. Born out of Microsoft's acquisition of Danger, the company behind the popular SideKick, the Kin was supposed to sit somewhere between a smartphone and a dumbphone. Unlike a true smartphone, the Kin didn't have apps, but it did have access to social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace, as well as Microsoft's own internal network for storing photos and videos. With a marketing campaign placed squarely at hipsters, the Kin was supposed to be a modern social media phone. But it had one glaring problem: price. Early on, a lot of people thought that if Microsoft could release the Kin at a low price without the need for an expensive smartphone data plan (remember the days before data plans?), it could capture the same market segmentation that had made the SideKick so popular in the early aughts. Microsoft and Verizon were alarmingly (in retrospect) coy about the cost of the data plans, but since it was a dumb phone, many of us had hopes that the price would be right. Verizon and Microsoft completely botched the pricing — requiring an expensive $US60+ ($80)+ a month smartphone plan for a phone that wasn't really a full smartphone. Still, I wrote positively about the phone's potential in an analysis piece in April 2010: [The Kin] is really targeted at teenagers — especially younger teenagers. And that's why Kin might just be brilliant. Of course, I ended up being completely wrong; the teens weren't interested. Just six weeks after launch, Microsoft killed the Kin. According to Business Insider, before the company pulled the plug, the phone sold just 500 units. Brutal. In the wake of the Kin disaster, much was leaked about the infighting and poor strategy that led to the phone's early demise. Years later, internal videos would show that even before its release, the Kin was just a disaster waiting to happen. Motorola Rokr (2005) In 2005, two of the most powerful consumer electronics brands were Apple and Motorola. Motorola was the leader in dumb phones, thanks to the success of the Motorola Razr. And Apple was well on its way to becoming the world's most valuable company, thanks to the success of the iPod. So obviously, a fusion between the two companies could only be successful. The resulting phone was called the Motorla Rokr, and it was the first phone with iTunes built in. Motorola's then chairman and CEO, Ed Zander wanted the world to really love the phone, check out this hype: The Motorola ROKR represents the ultimate convergence of mobile communications and music. Fusing iTunes with your always-with-you mobile phone, we're revolutionising the way the world experiences mobile self-expression and entertainment. Too bad the phone failed to deliver on those promises. In fact, signs were ominous from the get go. At an iTunes launch event, where Steve Jobs introduced the device to the world, he had problems getting the Rokr to work correctly (you can watch the entire segment in the video above). You can practically see the steam coming out of his ears when the music won't resume after a phone call. In addition to buggy software, users were limited to storing just 100 songs on the device, regardless of how much space was free on the phone. And the process of getting songs onto the phone was a total pain in the arse. Motorola tried to make things better with future iterations of the Rokr line, but the damage was done. The phone was a bomb for Motorola and an embarrassment for Apple. Ultimately, the failure of the Rokr was a good thing. Had it been successful, Apple might not have pushed forward as aggressively with its other phone project, internally known as M68, which became the iPhone. AT&T Picturephone (1964) Before Skype and before FaceTime, AT&T was trying to make video calling a reality. In fact, for more than 30 years, AT&T really tried to make video telephony a thing. It ended up being a great tech demo, but also one of the most expensive tech flops of all time. The first AT&T Picturephone made its debut at the World's Fair in Flushing Meadow Park in 1964. The demo — which my own mother saw as a teenager — left attendees excited about the future. Stanley Kubrick used ideas from the Picturephone in his epic, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Product brochures from the era promised "the bold beginning of tomorrow's telephoning." Unfortunately for AT&T, which spent half a billion on R&D for the PicturePhone between 1966 and 1973), "tomorrow" was really about 45 years away. At its peak in the 1970s, AT&T never managed to amass more than 500 subscribers to its video telephony service. The costs were just too high, the products too big, and the value was too unclear. AT&T's subsequent efforts at video telephony into the 1990s failed too. In 2005, Skype finally brought video calling to the masses — and for free. In 2010, Apple launched FaceTime, which finally, for real, made two-way video calling from your actual phone (or in this case, smartphone) a thing. ESPN Phone (2005) Back in the mid-aughts, there was a bizarre trend where non-phone companies decided to try their luck at being mobile carriers. Known as mobile virtual network operators (MVNO), the idea was that brands could lease spectrum from established wireless carriers to sell their own phones and services. Virgin Mobile, TracPhone, and Cricket Wireless all started out as MVNOs. For whatever reason, ESPN thought it would be a good idea to get into the branded phone and carrier space, and it launched Mobile ESPN in early 2006 with a big, glitzy Super Bowl ad (above). ESPN really believed that people would pay $US400 ($531) for its clamshell dumbphone, a Sanyo MVP (a Sanyo!), along with plans that started at $US35 ($46) a month for just 100 minutes of service, with no free nights or weekends. Why would anyone do this? Well, ESPN was convinced that sportsmen love sporting so much that they would be willing to pay a premium for a shitty phone running on the Sprint network (Sprint!) that would get the sports alerts and updates. The phone also offered subscribers access to mobile video of SportsCenter, score updates, and highlights. As silly as this all sounds now, some tech reviewers actually bought the concept. From PCMag's review, which gave the phone four stars: The Mobile ESPN MVP is a very good voice phone loaded up with massive quantities of sports information. You'll pay top dollar for top data, but have you seen the price of a Giants ticket recently? The general public didn't agree with that whole "pay top dollar for top data" argument and the phone ended up being a fairly famous business disaster. Just nine months after its splashy launch, ESPN killed Mobile ESPN. At the time, BusinessWeek reported in 2006 that ESPN had managed to gain just 30,000 subscribers, well below the 500,000 figure needed to make the investment break even. In hindsight, ESPN's then president George Bodenheimer probably should have listened to Steve Jobs, who according to the book Those Guys Have All the Fun: Inside the World of ESPN, told him "your phone is the dumbest fucking idea I have ever heard of." Stick to sporting, sportsmen. Samsung Galaxy Beam (2012) Samsung has made a lot of good phones over the years, exploding Note 7s notwithstanding. But Samsung has also made some supposedly innovative but really, really dumb phones. Take for example, the Samsung Galaxy Beam, which the company announced at Mobile World Congress in 2012. It was basically a Galaxy S Advance with a pico projector built-in. Samsung actually tried to do the whole phone projector thing in Korea a few years before bringing a version to North America. For whatever reason, the company really thought that people would want to use their smartphone as a way to project content at low resolution on a big screen. The company even made ads showing off the most unrealistic proposal of all time (above). Samsung was positively breathless in its marketing copy for the phone, with its then mobile chief, JK Shin, saying: Galaxy Beam provides mobile freedom, enabling a unique shared experience around digital content for everyone-anywhere and instantly-from a smartphone as slim and portable as any on the market. Sadly, that "unique shared experience" came by way of an overpriced, bulky, phone with specs straight out of 2010, running an old version of Android. Even after lacklustre response to the original Beam, Samsung still wasn't willing to give up the ghost. In 2014, the company released a successor — that still had shitty, outdated specs (again, the whole thing was very 2010), aimed at the Chinese market. Come on Samsung, know when to let a product die. No one wants a projector on their smartphone and no one will ever propose using said projector. Google's Project Ara (2013 - 2016) Technically, Project Ara wasn't a phone — it never had a chance to be. Instead, it was a project Google invested years of time (and lots and lots of hype), only to ultimately cancel the device in 2016. But let's back up. Back in 2013, Motorola (then part of Google), announced that it was working on a modular phone platform, known as "Project Ara." Project Ara was a basic phone with removable modules that could be switched out or upgraded, kind of like LEGO blocks. The idea was that instead of having to constantly upgrade an entire phone, specific components — the camera system, the storage, the CPU, and the battery — could all be expanded or upgraded with a new module. Additional modules could be available for extra stuff such as a a night vision camera or even a tardigrade aquarium. The tech press (including Gizmodo), was all too happy to spread the hype about this concept. Check out what we wrote about the concept, which had already been delayed several times at this point, back in 2015: This is the powerful idea behind Project Ara — the exact smartphone you want, exactly when you need it. Going on a long trip and need battery life? Swipe out for a low-res screen and extra battery modules. Need to take great photos at your kids soccer game? Get that camera module packed with megapixels. It's an ambitious dream to be sure, and one that won't jibe with everyone, but it's an idea worth exploring just to see where it goes. Too bad that "powerful idea" never turned into a real product. Not only did the project's specifics change direction with alarming regularity (originally it was hyped by Google as a $US50 ($66)-$US100 ($133) device; by 2016 the company admitted the first phones would cost the same as premium handsets), the people in charge of running the project changed too. According to Venture Beat's excellent history of Project Ara, the development team never really recovered after Regina Dugan, who ran ATAP at Google (the division Project Ara was under), abruptly left for Facebook. And look, it's possible that with the right leadership and support, Project Ara could have met the finish line, but that doesn't change a very large, very fundamental problem with Project Ara (and modular smartphones in general): No one wants a modular smartphone. Project Ara is the most ambitious modular phone failure, but even modular phones from LG and Motorola have totally flopped and failed to take on with audiences. Ultimately, Project Ara was a great demo, but it never had a chance at being a real product. And even if it had reached the finish line, something tells me that it would have wound up on this list anyway. WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments timbo2002 @timbo2002 May 3, 2017, 4:03pm I still have my original Nokia N-Gage. I was actually at the launch event at E3 in LA in 2003 and found the whole thing hilarious - to say that Nokia were out of their depth in the gaming space is a massive understatement. I remember the PR person had to run out to Gap before the launch to buy a pair of jeans for Nokia's Head of Gaming to make him look a bit hip (he was planning on wearing a suit to a gaming event!) - but when he got up on stage, they still had the size sticker in the leg, highlighted when the PR person hopped up and tore it off him... When they showed people talking on the N-Gage the audience (journos etc) actually laughed. I am actually secretly hoping that the next iPhone (10 year anniversary model) is actually taco-shaped with the speaker and microphone on the side of the phone. It would pay a great homage to the N-Gage. They could even call it the nPhone. Reply 0 skrybe @skrybe May 3, 2017, 4:33pm I don't think the NGage was a bad idea, just a bad implementation of a good idea. I mean after all we're all now playing music and gaming on our phones just like they were *trying* to achieve. I still think ARA is a great idea too. Possibly too far ahead of it's time. If we can get to a point where the manufacturing can produce smaller better quality components it would be more feasible. Sadly, at the same time smaller, better components would also imply you could just build a phone with *everything* built in so the need for modularity disappears. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

The two are the last of the top five U.S. tech companies by market value to release their quarterly results, following reports from Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon.com last week. Those reports impressed analysts and fueled confidence in the sector, which has so far been the top performer on Wall Street in 2017. “If we look at the lion’s share of the numbers, they’re performing above expectations,” said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, which owns shares of Apple worth about $41 million and shares of Facebook worth $68 million. “It gives validity to my position, which is that tech is, by far, the most exciting sector,” Morgan said. Shares of Facebook and Apple both hit record highs on Tuesday, up 0.53 percent and 0.75 percent respectively. Surges in Apple, Facebook and other Silicon Valley heavyweights have pushed the S&P 500 technology index up by 16 percent this year. And planned measures by President Donald Trump for steep corporate tax cuts and the easing of tax restrictions on profits made abroad would help Apple and other technology companies return more cash to shareholders. The largest five Silicon Valley companies for years have been increasing their share of revenue and profits generated in the technology sector at the expense of smaller competitors. Those five players boosted their share of revenue among technology companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index to 46 percent in 2016, from 38 percent in 2013, according to Thomson Reuters data. Their share of net income increased to 46 percent from 42 percent during the same time. Facebook and Google, which is owned by Alphabet, received 77 percent of gross spending on digital advertising in 2016, compared to 72 percent the year before, according to industry data analyzed by Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser. Technology company earnings are expected to have grown 17.7 percent in the latest three months, the strongest quarterly expansion since 2014, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Apple is expected by analysts to have boosted its revenue by 4.8 percent when it reports on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Facebook is expected to post a 45.6-percent leap in revenue and a similar increase in earnings per share, according to analysts’ estimates.

"We set a new March quarter record for India, where revenue grew by strong double digits. We continue to strengthen our local presence across the entire ecosystem, and we're very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country with its very large, young, and tech-savvy population, fast-growing economy, and improving 4G network infrastructure," Cook said in the second quarter results earnings call yesterday. Cook was asked that the California-based company is underpenetrated in India and whether the company will need to work with the country's government to have Apple-owned stores or production given the great opportunity in the country. "We think it's a great opportunity too, and so we're bringing all the things that we brought to bear in other markets that we've eventually done well in, and that's from channel to stores to our ecosystem and so forth,? Cook said. Apple?s senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller was in India opening a developer centre last quarter. "And so there are a ton of things going on there (India). And we agree that we are underpenetrated there. Our growth rates are good, really good by most people's expectations, maybe not mine as much,? Cook said. He said the iPhone maker is putting a "lot of energy" in India, just like Apple has in other geographies that eventually wound up producing more. "So I'm very excited about it,? he said. Cook emphasised that the 4G network investment began rolling in in a significant way toward the last quarter of last year in India, which is the third largest smartphone market in the world today behind China and the US. "But they are moving fast. They're moving at a speed that I have not seen in any other country in the world once they were started, and it is truly impressive,? he said. Apple has been "investing quite a bit" in India and has a "ton of energy" going into the country on a number of fronts. Cook sounded a bullish tone for the future of Apple in India as the 4G network infrastructure grows in the country. "And so we believe, particularly now that the 4G infrastructure is going in the country and is continuing to be expanded, that there is a huge opportunity for Apple there. And so that and the demographics of the country is why we're putting so much energy there," he said. Apple's Senior Vice president and Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the company achieved double-digit growth in the US, Canada, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Turkey, Russia and Mexico. Apple?s growth rates were even higher, over 20 per cent in many other markets, including Brazil, Scandinavia, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, India, Korea and Thailand,?Maestri?said. Apple posted revenue of USD 52.9 billion for its fiscal 2017 second quarter ended April 1, 2017, up from USD 50.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 65 per cent of the quarter?s revenue. It reported net income of USD 11 billion for the second quarter as compared to USD 10 billion a year ago. The company said that the number of iPhones sold globally fell 1 per cent in the first calendar quarter, compared with the same period a year ago. It sold 50.76 million iPhones in its fiscal second quarter ended April 1, down from 51.19 million a year earlier.

He said the iPhone maker is putting a “lot of energy” in India, just like Apple has in other geographies that eventually wound up producing more. “So I’m very excited about it,” he said. Mr. Cook emphasised that the 4G network investment began rolling in in a significant way toward the last quarter of last year in India, which is the third largest smartphone market in the world today behind China and the US. “But they are moving fast. They’re moving at a speed that I have not seen in any other country in the world once they were started, and it is truly impressive,” he said. Apple has been “investing quite a bit” in India and has a “ton of energy” going into the country on a number of fronts. Mr. Cook sounded a bullish tone for the future of Apple in India as the 4G network infrastructure grows in the country. “And so we believe, particularly now that the 4G infrastructure is going in the country and is continuing to be expanded, that there is a huge opportunity for Apple there. And so that and the demographics of the country is why we’re putting so much energy there,” he said. Revenue up Apple posted revenue of USD 52.9 billion for its fiscal 2017 second quarter ended April 1, 2017, up from USD 50.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 65 per cent of the quarter’s revenue. It reported net income of USD 11 billion for the second quarter as compared to USD 10 billion a year ago. The company said that the number of iPhones sold globally fell 1 per cent in the first calendar quarter, compared with the same period a year ago. It sold 50.76 million iPhones in its fiscal second quarter ended April 1, down from 51.19 million a year earlier.

Acknowledging that Apple is "underpenetrated" in India, CEO Tim Cook has said the US tech giant is strengthening its local presence in the country and is optimistic about its future given the fast-growing economy and improving 4G network infrastructure in the country. "We set a new March quarter record for India, where revenue grew by strong double digits. We continue to strengthen our local presence across the entire ecosystem, and we're very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country with its very large, young, and tech-savvy population, fast-growing economy, and improving 4G network infrastructure," Cook said in the second quarter results earnings call yesterday. Cook was asked that the California-based company is underpenetrated in India and whether the company will need to work with the country's government to have Apple-owned stores or production given the great opportunity in the country. "We think it's a great opportunity too, and so we're bringing all the things that we brought to bear in other markets that we've eventually done well in, and that's from channel to stores to our ecosystem and so forth,” Cook said. Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller was in India opening a developer centre last quarter. "And so there are a ton of things going on there (India).

And so that and the demographics of the country is why we're putting so much energy there," he said. Apple's Senior Vice president and Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the company achieved double-digit growth in the US, Canada, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Turkey, Russia and Mexico. Apple’s growth rates were even higher, over 20 per cent in many other markets, including Brazil, Scandinavia, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, India, Korea and Thailand, Maestri said.

Rumor has it Apple will jump on the smart-speaker bandwagon at next month's WWDC, giving the Amazon Echo and Google Home some stiff competition. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 147.51 +0.93 +0.63% BNP Paribas BNPQY ▲ 36.15 +0.75 +2.12% Alacer Gold Corp ALACF ▼ 1.75 -0.48 -21.52% Akamai Technologies Inc AKAM ▲ 62.50 +1.02 +1.66% What would such a device look like? What would it be called? (I'm going to put a marker on iHome, even though there's already a whole brand with that name.) And the big question: What will it cost? This is Apple we're talking about, so my guess puts it at $199, if not $229. And it probably won't ship until the second half of the year, at least according to industry analysts. Don't want to wait? Or pay that much? If you've got a spare iPhone (or iPad or iPod Touch) lying around, you can easily create your own "Siri speaker" setup. (Sound familiar? It's also possible to turn an old Android phone into a poor-man's Google Home.) Why this works and what you need Anyone familiar with Siri knows she already does the whole speak-and-say thing -- just within the confines of your iPhone. Because you can invoke this feature hands-free (by saying, "Hey, Siri"), all you need is a speaker to round out the equation.  Before we talk about the latter, though, let's finish with the brains of the operation. Any modern iDevice can be tasked for this project, so long as it has a reasonably current version of iOS. Although iPhone models older than the 6S must be plugged in for "Hey, Siri" to work when the screen is off, you're going to leave this iPhone plugged in full-time anyway -- so that's a nonissue. As for the speaker, anything you can connect your phone to is fair game. My recommendation is a simple Bluetooth speaker, though it has to meet one requirement: It needs to stay powered on when plugged in. Some speakers have an auto-off feature, which you don't want here. You can also take the wired route, plugging one end of a 3.5mm audio cable into your phone and the other into a speaker or even an old stereo. It's one more wire you'll have to look at, but of course a little decor disguising can help with all the wires. Speaking of which, as I noted above, you'll need to leave your phone plugged in full-time. Same goes for the speaker. Obviously all this won't provide the same aesthetic as whatever unified product Apple delivers, but functionally it should get reasonably close. And if you want to keep everything as consolidated as possible, consider getting a speaker that's also a stand. For example, the LuguLake Bluetooth speaker and phone stand shown here might prove a good option, if only because it gives your phone a forward-facing place to sit. It's currently priced at $30, £27 in the UK or AU$39 in Australia. Although you'll have to provide the wall USB plug for the speaker to stay powered, it has a physical on-off switch, so I'm pretty certain it won't automatically shut off after a period of inactivity. (Not positive, though; check with the manufacturer if you want to be sure.) What to say to your Siri speaker From there you just need to make sure the "Hey, Siri" option is enabled, which you can do by tapping Settings > Siri and making sure the top three options are toggled on. That way, the iPhone will be listening for -- and responding to -- your commands even when the screen is off. (What about your current iPhone? Won't it be listening as well? Sure enough, your spoken commands might trigger both phones at the same time. For now, there's no real workaround for this, other than to disable the option on your primary phone -- or just keep it out of earshot of your Siri speaker.) So what can you do with your new smart speaker? Pretty much anything and everything you can do with your iPhone. For example, you can ask Siri to tell you a joke, check your flight status, give you a weather forecast, play a podcast (if you have Apple's Podcasts app installed) and much more. Here's the complete list of Siri commands to date. You can also control your HomeKit-ready smart home devices, too. As for music, you can't currently use Siri to activate third-party apps such as Spotify, so if you want to issue verbal commands for songs, playlists and the like, you'll have to rely on your Apple Music library. That's a fairly major limitation (the DIY Google Home is similar in that respect), so it'll be interesting to see if Apple's standalone smart speaker -- assuming it exists -- overcomes it. In the meantime, what do you think of creating a home-grown Siri speaker? Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignain Apple faces more pressure than ever to deliver with its highly anticipated next-generation iPhone, as the company reported Tuesday that it sold fewer iPhones than analysts had expected in the company's second quarter. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 147.51 +0.93 +0.63% BNP Paribas BNPQY ▲ 36.15 +0.75 +2.12% Alacer Gold Corp ALACF ▼ 1.75 -0.48 -21.52% Akamai Technologies Inc AKAM ▲ 62.50 +1.02 +1.66% Those looking forward to the new phone may have held off on buying a new device until the fall, analysts said. The softer-than-expected sales come as Apple faces increased competition for the device that makes up the majority of Apple's profits. Apple sold 50 million iPhones in the past quarter, 1 million less than in the same period last year. Analysts had expected Apple to sell 52 million units. The company reported $52.9 billion in revenue, slightly below analyst estimates. On an earnings call, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said that Apple did not correctly estimate how popular the iPhone 7 Plus would be compared with the iPhone 7, which caused some supply problems. The company did show strong profits thanks in part to its services unit, reporting earnings of $2.10 a share vs. an expected $2.02.  But the disappointing iPhone sales, combined with a weak outlook for the next quarter, sent the stock down more than 2 percent in after-hours trading. U.S. sales grew 11 percent, but the company saw a 14 percent sales drop in China. Cook played down concerns about sales in the world's largest phone market, saying that he thought those results were in line with previous years. He added that seven of the company's most popular stores are in China. But local competition from Chinese smartphone makers such as Huawei have been chipping away at Apple's market share. Cook addressed analyst questions about the Apple Watch, saying the company is happy with sales and remains “very committed to it and believe … over time it will be even larger.” Apple doesn't break out sales numbers for its wearable, but analysts expected to see more growth from that part of Apple's business as competitors leave the smartwatch market. Many analysts anticipate that the company will deliver a completely redesigned iPhone later this year. It is expected to be called the iPhone 8 and to have an edge-to-edge display similar to that of the well-reviewed Samsung Galaxy S8, which went on sale in April. And analysts are upbeat about Apple's ability to bounce back, thanks to the company's reputation and customer loyalty. “We're bullish on the iPhone 8 for three reasons: Apple's ecosystem stickiness, the expected upgradability of the device, and teenage fondness of Apple devices,” said Clement Thibault, a senior investing analyst with Investing.com. Meanwhile, Apple is also facing increased competition in its growing Mac business. Microsoft announced Tuesday morning a sleek new laptop aimed at students that is designed to compete directly with the MacBook Air. The company also increased the size of its share dividend and buyback programs to $300 billion through March 2019. Apple's stockpile of cash is nearly $260 billion, which — as The Washington Post's Thomas Heath reported — is more than the gross domestic product of Jamaica and Finland combined. The main bright spot for Apple continues to be in its services. The App Store, iTunes and other subscription products generated $7 billion, up 18 percent from the previous year. Apple faces stiff competition from Samsung but is in a strong enough position to weather a weaker quarter — as long as it delivers on the promise of the iPhone 8, said Thomas Cooke, a professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. “This is acceptable, considering the environment and that they have new products in the pipeline. That people are holding onto their phones a little longer than expected shouldn’t be so alarming,” he said.

Show More Local Real Estate Subscribe Now APPLE CEO Tim Cook has admitted he's got a problem: the hype about the future of the iPhone is hurting iPhone sales right now. Apple today released the results for the quarter ending April 1, with sales of iPhone taking a surprising downturn despite optimistic Wall St expectations. Apple sold 50.76 million iPhones in the quarter, down from 51.19 million in the previous year and short of the 51.5 million expected. While that is not much of a drop, it was enough for the Apple share price to fall 1 per cent in after-hours trading. "We're seeing what we believe to be a pause in purchases of iPhone which we believe are due to the earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones," Cook said. With the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, Apple is expected to radically update its smartphone later this year and there has been a steady diet of leaks with conflicting reports about how Apple will change the form and function of the iPhone, including 3D facial recognication and a curved display. While the Apple boss believes the fevered hype around Apple's forthcoming device is having a chilling effect on sales, reports suggest the iPhone 8 is facing delay issues that could dramatically push back its release. This past week, analysts from Deutsche Bank produced a report in which they speculated that due to issues with suppliers, the iPhone 8 won't be ready for release before the end of the calendar year. They believe we could be stuck waiting for the OLED-screened phone until 2018. Today's sales figures shows just how reliant Apple is on the iPhone. Analyst Jan Dawson said in the past five years, the iPhone has gone from being half of Apple's revenue to two thirds, while iPad and Macs have dropped from 36 per cent to 19 per cent. Apple still is yet to give details on the sales of Apple Watch, although Apple CEO Tim Cook said the sales of Apple Watch have doubled in the past year. Cook said if you were to take the revenue from Apple Watch, Beats headphones and AirPods then it would equate to the size of a Fortune 500 company. Likewise, Cook equated Apple Services - which includes Apple Music and iCloud subscriptions - as being the size of a Fortune 100 company with more than $9.3 billion in revenue. The plight of the iPad continues to be grim, with sales falling for another quarter down to 8.9 million units, which is a drop in a year in unit sales of 13 per cent and 12 per cent in revenue. Photos View Photo Gallery   To find a quarter where the iPad has achieved such a low result, you have to go back to the first year of iPad sales back in 2011. Several times in the briefing after the results were posted, Cook talked of the challenge in finding the right balance in meeting demand. He said Apple was still not able to meet demand for the wireless AirPods, which this week scored the highest ever customer satisfaction rating for an Apple product, and he said Apple had got it wrong in underestimating demand for the iPhone 7 Plus, the first iPhone with a dual lens camera. Having two products be more popular than expected is not the only issue Cook faces. There is also the issue of what to do with Apple's enormous cash reserve which now is $340 billion. Other key points from today's results are: • App store revenue grew 40 per cent in the past year. • Apple Mac sales, despite the relaunched MacBook Pro, only grew by 4 per cent. • Apple plans to double the size of its service business by 2020. apple Read More Login to follow games and gadgets Read More Login to follow technology Read More Login to follow Topics:  apple games and gadgets technology 0 PRINT Have your say Just In Why Ipswich Hockey was voted state's best Woman cut from car after rollover on Warrego Danger time for Gold Coast Farmer given free Sunshine Coast apartment Ghost hunters to investigate Lockyer Valley Storm prepares to swoop on Milford Top Stories UPDATE: Booval night markets announce closure Booval Family Fair Twilight Market organisers reveal why the market is closing News Comment Woman cut from car after rollover on Warrego Ghost hunters to investigate Lockyer Valley INTERESTED in things that go bump in the night?

Apple's second-quarter results for 2017 are in. Here's our transcript of the call. Apple CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri spoke with analysts during the company's Q2 2017 earnings call. Here's our ongoing live transcript of their remarks! If you want more info on Apple's results, we recommend checking out the awesome charts from Six Colors. Cook's opening remarks Tim Cook Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today we are reporting strong March quarter results with accelerating revenue growth and earnings per share up 10% over last year. We feel great about this performance. Revenue was $52.9 billion — near the high end of our guidance range. Global revenue was up 5% year on year with growth accelerating from our December quarter performance. That's despite a $1 billion year-over-year revenue headwind from foreign exchange in the March quarter and a larger iPhone channel inventory reduction this year versus last year. iPhone sales were in line with our expectations and we're thrilled to see the continued strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus with its beautiful large display and dual camera system. Our active install base for iPhones grew by double digits year over year and based on the latest data from IDC, we gained market share in nearly every country we tried. Late in the quarter we released the stunning (Product)RED special edition versions of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in recognition of 10 years of our partnership with RED. This relationship has given our customers an unprecedented way to contribute to the global fund and bring the world closer to an AIDS-free generation. We've seen wonderful customer response to these eye-popping new iPhones. For the second quarter in a row, our services revenue topped $7 billion and it's well on the way to being the size of a fortune 100 company. We're very happy to see the deep level of customer engagement with the Apple ecosystem across all of our services. App store momentum is terrific, with revenue growing 40% year over year to an all-time quarterly record. The number of developers offering apps for sale on our store was up 26% over last year and we're thrilled to see their success. We also saw double-digit revenue growth from Apple Music subscriptions and iCloud storage, and overall very strong growth in the total number of paid subscriptions for our own services and the third party content we offer on our stores. Paid subscriptions now exceed 165 million. Apple Pay is experiencing phenomenal traction. With the launch of Taiwan and Ireland in the March quarter, Apple Pay is now live in 15 markets, with more than 20 million contactless-ready locations, including more than 4.5 million locations accepting Apple Pay in the U.S. alone. We're seeing strong, growing usage as points of acceptance expand with transaction volume up 450% over the last 12 months. In the UK, for example, points of acceptance have grown by 44% in the last year while monthly Apple Pay transactions have grown by nearly 300%. In Japan, where Apple Pay launched last October, more than half a million transit users are completing 20 million Apple Pay transactions per month and we're always excited to see our partners bring their customers new ways to use Apple Pay. You can now even send a Starbucks gift card via iMessage with just a touch. We're seeing great momentum from our powerful advances in iMessage. In fact, at one point during the Super Bowl in February, customers were sending 380,000 messages per second — more than double the previous year. A few weeks ago,we introduced Clips, a new app that's another great example how we're continually making our produtcs even more engaging and it's off to a great start. With Clips, it's fun and easy to combine video, photos, and music on an iPhone or an iPad into great-looking expressive videos with great visual effects and titles just using your voice, then share your Clips with friends through the Messages app or on social media. We had great Mac results during the quarter. Revenue grew 14% to a new March quarter record and gained market share thanks to strong demand for our new MacBook Pros. Our Mac business has generated over $25 billion in revenue over the past four quarters. We're investing aggressively in its future and we are very excited about the innovation we can bring to the platform. We also updated our most-popular sized iPad with a brighter retina display and best-in-class performance at its most affordable price ever and customer response to date has been very strong. iPad results were ahead of our expectations and we believe we gained shares in a number of major markets including the U.S., Japan, and Australia. iPad remains the world's most popular tablet and it's the primary computing device for millions of customers across the globe. Building on the momentum from the holiday quarter, Apple Watch sales nearly doubled year over year. Apple Watch is the best selling and most loved smartwatch in the world and we hear wonderful stories from our customers about its impact on our fitness and health. We're also seeing great response to AirPods with a 98% customer satisfaction rating based on a recent Creative Strategies survey. Demand for AirPods significantly exceeds supply and growth in Beats products has also been very strong. In fact, when we combine Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats headphones, our revenues from wearable products in the last four quarters was the size of a Fortune 500 company. In Greater China, we were very pleased to see strong, double-digit revenue growth from both Mac and services during the March quarter. We also had great results from our retail stores in mainland China, with total store revenue up 27% over last year and compstore revenue up 7%. These results contributed to our improving performance in Greater China. Through the first two quarters of fiscal 2017, our year over year comparisons improved significantly over the last two quarters of fiscal 2016. First-half revenue was down 13% year-over-year, about a third of which was attributable to FX. That's in contrast to a 32% revenue decline in the second half of last year. Our March quarter results were in line with our expectations and similar to the year-over-year performance we experienced in the December quarter. We continue to be very enthusiastic about our opportunity in China. We set a new March quarter record in India where revenue grew by strong double digits. We continue to strengthen our local presence across the entire ecosystem and we're very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country with its very large, young, and tech-savvy population, fast-growing economy, and improving 4G network infrastructure. Apple Retail is entering an exciting chapter with new experiences for customers and breathtaking new store designs. With the opening of our newest store in Dubai this past weekend, we now have 495 retail locations worldwide. The new Apple Dubai Mall is a truly international store, with employees who collectively speak 45 languages and are already welcoming customers from around the world. As Luca will discuss in a moment, today we're also providing an update to our capital return program. Given our strong confidence in our future, we're increasing the program's size by $50 billion, bringing the total to $300 billion, and we're extending the time frame through March of 2019. We're adding to our share repurchase authorization and increasing our dividend for the fifth time in less than five years. We're very excited about our upcoming World Wide Developers Conference taking place in San Jose next month. The conference is significantly oversubscribed and we'll be welcoming thousands of attendees. We look forward to helping them learn about breakthrough technologies across all four of our software platforms: iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS that enable developers to create incredible experiences for every aspect of customers' lives and improve the way they manage their homes, cars, health, and more. I'm very proud to mention that we recently released our tenth annual Environmental Responsibility Report, reflecting our amazing progress. In 2016, 96% of the electricity used at Apple's global facilities came from renewable sources of energy, reducing our carbon emissions by nearly 585,000 metric tons. We're now 100% renewable in 24 countries, including all of Apple's data centers. There's much more work to be done but we're committed to leaving the world better than we found it. Closer to home, we're excited about moving into our new corporate headquarters, Apple Park, our new center for innovation. The main building on Apple Park is designed to house 13,000 employees under one roof in an environment that fosters even greater collaboration among our incredibly talented team. We have many more ongoing investments in the U.S. economy since Apple is a company that could only have been created in America.Through our innovative products and the success of our business we're incredibly proud to support more than 2 million jobs in all 50 states and we expect to create even more. Last fiscal year we spent more than $50 billion in the United States with American suppliers, developers, and partners and we continue to invest confidently in our future. Now for more details on the March quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was 52.9 billion and we achieved double-digit growth in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Germany, The Netherlands, Turkey, and Mexico. Our growth-rates were even higher — over 20% — in many other markets, including Brazil, Scandinavia, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, India, Korea, and Thailand. Gross margin was 38.9% at the high end of our guidance range — that's a sequential increase from 38.5% in the December quarter, which is particularly impressive given the seasonal loss of leverage, sequential foreign exchange headwinds of 100 basis points, and cost pressures on certain commodities. Operating margin was 26.7% of revenue and that income was $11 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $2.10 — an increase of 10% over last year — and cash-flow from operations was strong at 12.5 billion. For details by product, I'll start with iPhone. We sold 50.8 million iPhones and we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 1.2 million units in the quarter, compared to a reduction of about 450,000 a year ago. So our iPhone performance was slightly better than last year on a sell-through basis. We had very solid iPhone growth in four of our five operating segments and experienced especially strong results in Western Europe, the Middle East, and the rest of the Asia Pacific segment — all areas of the world where iPhone sales were up double digits. iPhone ASP was $655, up from $642 a year ago thanks to a strong mix of iPhone 7 Plus, and in spite of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. We exited the March quarter within our five to seven week target channel inventory range. Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong, not only with consumers but also with business users. In the U.S., the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a 96% customer satisfaction rating among iPhone 7 owners and 98% for iPhone 7 Plus. Among corporate smartphone buyers, iPhone customer satisfaction was 95% and of those planning to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 79% planned to purchase iPhone. Turning to services, we generated 7 billion in revenue, an increase of 18% year-over-year, and our best results ever for a 13-week quarter. We're very happy with the strong level of growth, especially given the tough compare to last year as the busy week between Christmas and New Year fell within the March fiscal quarter a year ago, but was included in the December fiscal quarter this year. As we said last quarter, our goal is to double the size of our services business by 2020. The App Store established a new all-time revenue record and grew 40% year over year. We continue to see growth in average revenue per paying account, as well as the number of paying accounts across our content stores during the quarter. In fact, the quarterly increase in the number of paying accounts was the largest we ever experienced. According to App Annie's latest report, the App Store continues to be the preferred destination for customer purchases, generating twice the revenue of Google Play during the March quarter. Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was up 14% year over and set a new March quarter record. We sold 4.2 million Macs, up 4% over last year, compared to zero growth in the PC market, according to IDC's latest forecast. Demand for MacBook Pro was very strong, helping to drive overall portables growth of 10 %, twice the growth of the portables market. We ended the quarter at the low end of our four to five week target range for Mac channel inventory. Turning to iPad, we sold 8.9 million units which was ahead of our expectations despite supply constraints throughout the quarter. We're very pleased to see iPad growth in the U.S. during the March quarter and revenue growth worldwide for our 9.7-inch and our larger iPads over the last four quarters. iPad channel inventory was essentially flat from the beginning to the end of the quarter and we exited just below our five to seven week target range. iPad remains very successful in the segment of the tablet market where we compete. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad had 81% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And in February, 451 Research measured consumer satisfaction rates for iPad that ranged from 95% for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro to 100% for the 12.9-inch version. Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, purchase intention for iPad was 69%. Corporate buyers report a 96% satisfaction rate and a purchase intent of 68% for the June quarter. All our products continue to be extremely popular and drive mobile transformation in the enterprise market. We set a new enterprise revenue record for the March quarter and we expect this momentum to continue for the remainder of the year. Recently Volkswagen selected iPhone as their corporate standard smartphone, so 620,000 employees around the world have the opportunity to enjoy the best-in-class mobile experience that iPhone offers. Capital One has reimagined the customer banking experience by empowering their associates with Mac and Apple Watch and over 40 native iOS applications now running on nearly 30,000 iPhone and iPads. We're also seeing strong momentum with our enterprise partners who are helping us deliver long-lasting innovation and differentiation for iOS versus competing platforms. The -- partnership is off to a great start with more than 115 customer opportunities in the pipeline across 15 different industries. SAP released the SAP cloud platform SDK for iOS at the end of March and over 3 million SAP developers now have an even better means to develop powerful iOS-native apps for the enterprise. The partnership with CISCO enables optimized performance of iOS devices over their networks and is generating a large and growing pipeline of opportunities across multiple verticals, including healthcare and financial services. Our partnership with IBM continues to drive greater productivity and innovation. With IBM, mobilefirst for iOS apps now in more than 300,300 client engagements. And with its mobile-scale offering, IBM recently closed an agreement to deploy 11,000 iOS devices at -- bank to drive digital transformation. Our retail and online stores produced great results with strong revenue growth in all our geographic segments and 18% growth overall. Visitors to our retail and online stores are up 16% over last year and we added four new stores during the March quarter. With the opening of our store in Dubai last week, we're now at 495 stores in 18 countries. Let me now turn to our cash position: We ended the quarter with $256.8 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $10.8 billion — $239.6 billion of this cash, or 93% of the total, was outside of the United States. We issued $11 billion in debt during the quarter, bringing us to $88.5 billion in term debt and $10 billion in commercial paper outstanding. We returned over $10 billion to investors over the quarter. We paid $3 billion in dividends and equivalents and we spent $4 billion on repurchases of $31.1 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also launched a new $3 billion ASR, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 17.5 million shares and we retired 6.3 million shares upon the completion of our 9th accelerated share repurchase program in February. All of these activities contributed to a net diluted share count reduction of 66.3 million shares in the quarter. We have now completed $211.2 billion of our $250 billion capital return program, including $151 billion in share repurchases. As Tim mentioned, today we're announcing an update to our program, which we're extending by four quarters through March of 2019 and increasing in size to a total of $300 billion. Once again, given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value we see in our stock, we're allocating the majority of the program expansion to share repurchases. Our board has increased the share-repurchase authorization by $35 billion, raising it from the current $175 billion-level to $210 billion. We will also continue to net-share settle vesting employees restrictive stock units. In addition, we're raising our dividend for the fifth time in less than five years as we know this is very important to many of our investors who value income. The quarterly dividend will grow from 57 cents to 63 cents per share, an increase of 10.5%. This is effective with our next dividend which the board has declared today, payable on May 18, 2017 with shareholders of record as of May 15, 2017. With over $12 billion in annual dividend payments, we're proud to be one of the largest dividend-payers in the world and we continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. In total, with this updated program, during the next eight quarters we expect to return $89 billion to our investors, which represents about 12% of our market cap at the current stock price. We expect to continue to fund our capital return program with current US cash, future US cash generation, and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets. We will continue to review capital allocation regularly taking into account the needs of our business, investment opportunities, and our financial outlook. We will also continue to solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This approach will allow us to be flexible and thoughtful about the size, the mix, and the pace of our program. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $43.5 and $45.5 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5 and 38.5%. We expect -- to be between $6.6 and $6.7 billion. We expect OINE to be about $450 million. We expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. On Qualcomm and Apple's decision to halt royalty payments Katy Huberty, Morgan Stanley My first question is for Luca, around gross margins. How were you able to expand gross margins sequentially and guide rather seasonally for the June quarter in light of what's going on in the memory market? And maybe if you can comment in particular whether the hold back of payments to Qualcomm is benefiting you at all on gross margins year on year? And also, whether your contracts around commodity prices is likely to hit gross margins by more in the back half of this calendar year. Luca Maestri Thank you, Katie. A lot of questions. Let me take it one by one. Let me start with the performance for the March quarter, which we were very happy with. As you said, we were up 40 basis points sequentially and this is in spite of the fact as you know that we lose leverage as we go from the December quarter to the March quarter, foreign-exchange headwind on a sequential basis 100 basis points. Obviously that was also a negative and as you said we started to experience some level of cost pressure on the memory side particularly on on and on NAND and DRAM. To offset that and actually do better than that, we had very good cost performance on other commodities. And the fact that our services mix increases as we go through the year, that is, of course, also helping. Given the profile of our gross margin for services. But that answers the question around Q2. As we move into the June quarter, as you know we tend to have some level of gross margin compression as we go from the March quarter to the June quarter — again, the majority of that comes from the sequential loss of leverage, we also have a different mix of products as we move into the June quarter, and the cost pressures on memory will remain. We expect to offset, partially, these impacts with other cost efficiencies and a mixed shift towards services. The impact on NAND and DRAM will continue to be there and we expect it to be there. You know we don't guide past the June quarter but we expect it to be there for the time being. On Qualcomm, I just want to make it very, very clear that we are accruing. We do not expect to be paying more than what we are accruing right now, so we didn't get any benefit in our margins during the March quarter and we're not getting any benefit during the June quarter either. On the supply-constrained iPhone 7 launch OK, thank you, and just a follow-up for Tim: As you noted in your remarks, the iPhone 7 Plus demand is selling incredibly well. And this is a product that was pretty severely supply-constrained in the December quarter. I just wonder whether there are any lessons learned as you go forward into future product launches around how you manage the timing of announcing a product when there's supply constraints and how you might work with the supply chain differently around ramping some of these components that have particular difficulties around the yields early on. Tim Cook Katy, one of the things that we did not get right was the mix between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. It wound up the demand was much stronger to the 7 Plus than we had predicted, so it took us a little while to adjust all the way back through the supply chain and to bring iPhone 7 Plus into balance which occurred early this past quarter. What did we learn from it? Every time we go through a launch, we learn something. You can bet we're brushing our models and we'll apply everything we learned to the next time. On Apple's numbers in China and weak performance in Hong Kong Shannon Cross, Cross Research Tim, can you talk a bit about what's going on in China and give us some more color especially as you're going through the year and then — obviously we won't talk about the next product launch — but just, are there any shifts in demand with greater China down 14%? Was it all iPhone or mix? Anything you can provide and then I have a follow-up. Tim Cook Thanks for the question, Shannon. We saw in Q2 a performance that, combined with Q1, formed the first half of the year was much better than what we experienced in the second half of last year. And if you look at what was driving that, iPhone 7 Plus — we sold the highest number of Plus models in the first half than ever before compared to 6s Plus or compared to the 6 Plus. Also the Mac business did extremely well — Mac revenue growth was up 20% in China and we had extremely strong services growth during the quarter in China. As I mentioned in my comments, our retail and online stores did well overall and in China. They grew by 21%, which is an acceleration from what we had seen in the previous quarter. And traffic, which for us is incredibly important in the retail stores because we do a lot more than sell, traffic was up 27% year on year. And now seven of our top 10 highest trafficked stores are in greater China. And so that's the set of things that sort of went in our direction, so to speak. On the flip side, currency devalued by 5%, so that's not an insignificant headwind. And our performance continued to be weak in Hong Kong, which has been hit a bit harder as the tourism market continues to slump. Also where the iPhone 7 Plus did well, we didn't perform as well on some of the previous generation iPhones. So that's sort of the set of things on the plus and minus side. We did perform about where I thought we would — I thought it would be similar to the previous quarter and it was. What I now believe is we'll improve a bit more during this current quarter — not back to growth, but make more progress and we continue to believe that there's an enormous opportunity there. Y'know, in the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there. On Apple's plans for its massive amount of cash Alright, thank you. I don't know if Luca wants to take this, but thoughts on cash usage? Y'know, you increased your program but you still have, I think, 160 billion of net cash and obviously continue to generate cash. So I'm curious — given some of the commentary that's come out of the administration, which I think most companies were expecting some sort of a return, how do you generally think about what you need to run the business from a cash perspective, how you think about the balance sheet from a strength perspective, just, y'know, as we look forward to what hopefully will come through. Luca Maestri Shannon, you know how we run our capital return program we've been pretty consistent during the last five years. Essentially for the last five years the way we've run the company is essentially to return our free cash flow to our investors. That's what we've done with the program until now. And you know the expansion of the program that we've announced today goes in the same direction. Right? We know how much we need to invest in that business. We will never underinvest in the business. We are in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have and given the current capital structure that we have, we decided that until now we return about 100 percent of the free cash flow to investors. It is difficult for us to speculate about what might or might not happen. The program that we're announcing today reflects the current tax legislation in this country and there's a lot that still needs to happen there and we'll see. Obviously we will reassess our situation if things change. On Apple's growing subscriber base Rod Hall, J.P. Morgan I wanted to start off just going back to the 165 million subscriptions and ask Tim or Luca if you could comment on the unique number of users there and I think you had made a comment, Tim, in your prepared remarks that the average revenue per user is up or maybe that was you Luca? But if you guys could just talk about you know any more color around that average revenue per user it would be interesting to us. Luca Maestri We don't disclose into this number of subscriptions of course. We're just giving you that the total count of subscriptions that are out there. Of course there are several customers that subscribe to more than one of our services. There is some level of overlap but the total number of subscribers is very, very large. Obviously, less than 165 million. But it's very good for us to see the breadth of subscriptions that we offer and that customers are interested in. It's a large number. And if you remember, we quoted the same number a quarter ago and we talked about 150 million. So when you think about a sequential increase of 15 million subscriptions from the December quarter to the March quarter, it really gives you a sense for the momentum that we have on our content stores. It's quite impressive to have 15 million subscriptions in 90 days. As we look at the dynamics that are happening on our content stores and particularly on the App Store, which is the largest, we see fairly consistently two things: We see that the number of paying accounts is growing a lot, and I mentioned the increase in number of paying accounts that we've had during these last 90 days is the largest that we've ever had. So there's a very large number of people coming into the ecosystem, experiencing the ecosystem which is obviously improving all the time in quality and quantity, and then start paying and transacting on our stores. And that number is growing very very, strongly strong double digits. What we're also seeing as we look at the people that start paying on our stores, we see a pretty common trend over time, and we keep track of that across cohorts of customers, that as people come into the ecosystem and start paying on the ecosystem, we see a spending profile that is very similar around the world. People start at a certain level and then they tend to spend more over time. And so obviously the combination of people spending more over time and having more people that are now actually spending on the stores, contributes to this 40 percent growth that Tim mentioned for the App Store on a year over year basis. On pricing and profit of Apple's services business Tim, I wanted to just ask… The services revenue keeps growing and of course the profit contribution from that is growing. And we've also at the same time I think seen you maybe a little more aggressive than Apple has been historically in pricing certain—key technologies lets call them, that maybe you want to penetrate the market with? And I just wonder if you could just comment a little bit on your strategy there in terms of the usage of that extra profit contribution from that services business. You know, how you intend to apply it to the rest of the business. Thank you. Tim Cook Rod, the way that we think about pricing is, we come up with a price that we think is a good value for the product that we're delivering. And we do that on the hardware side as well as on the services side. And so that's how we think about it. We're really not thinking about taking profits from one to subsidize the other or vice versa. On Apple's successful wearables business and the future of its wearable devices Steve Milanovich, UBS Tim, could you comment on the opportunity in wearables? The watch some people consider disappointing, had what seems to be a very good quarter. And ironically the competition almost seems to be fading in that part of the market right now. The AirPods, of course, are doing well. Do you see wearables expanding over time into a broader product line and increasingly being independent of the iPhone longer term? Tim Cook We have seen the watch as, you know, a really key product category for us since before we launched it. And we took our time to get it right. And we've made it even better with the Series 2 offering. And we're really proud of the growth of the business. You know, Watch units more than doubled in six of our top 10 markets, which is phenomenal growth particularly in a non-holiday quarter. And so we couldn't be more satisfied with it. As some people are doing, when you begin to combine the watch revenues with the revenues for AirPods, and as you know is the first full quarter of shipments for AirPods, it's still very much in the ramping mode and we're not even coming close to satisfying the demand. And then add the Beats products that a group of our customers really enjoy as well. And look on the trailing 12 months—this is not a forecast—that business was was well into the Fortune 500. And so as I look at that, that's pretty fast to come that far. You know the watch hasn't been out very long and AirPods have been out there for three, four months. And so we feel really great about it. Where does it go? I wouldn't want to comment on that. But we do have a really great pipeline here. And I think in terms of competition falling out and so forth. The watch area is really hard. It in essence from an engineering point of view is similar to a phone in terms of the intricacies and so forth. And so I'm not very surprised that some people are falling out of it, but we're very committed to it and believe that it's already a big business and believe over time it will be even larger. On 451 Research's iPhone survey and the reported decline in iPhone retention rate You mentioned the 451 Research survey. They did have a couple of findings that were kind of interesting. One is a nine-year low in iPhone purchase intent, and that might just be where you are in the cycle, and the other was a declining retention rate in the US toward 80 percent. Any comment on either of those and whether you're concerned? Tim Cook I only glanced at it. And so I haven't had time to study it but in general what we are seeing, we're seeing what we believe to be a pause in purchases on iPhone which we believe are due to the earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones. And so that part is clearly going on, and it could be what's behind the data. I don't know. But but we are seeing that, in full transparency. More on Apple's decision to withhold royalty payments to Qualcomm Toni Sacconaghi, Bernstein Tim, I'm wondering if you can comment on your recent decision and the rationale for withholding royalty payments to Qualcomm. And really specifically, I wonder what you believe is the risk that Qualcomm could have a detrimental response such as withholding modem chip sales or potentially even getting an injunction on iPhones in select geographies around the world. And I'd like to understand your perspective on whether either those are real risks to any degree. And why would Apple potentially take on those risks, you know, just in advance of what will arguably be your most significant and largest product launch in history? Tim Cook Anyone that has a standards-essential patent has a responsibility to offer it to everyone that would like it under what are called FRAND terms. FRAND stands for "fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory" terms. That's both the price and the business terms. Qualcomm has not made such an offer to Apple. And so I don't believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that. I think that there's plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see. In terms of why we're withholding royalties. You can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount. You don't know how much to pay. And so, you know, they think we owe some amount we think we owe a different amount. And there hasn't been a meeting of the minds there, and so at this point we need the courts to decide that. Unless we are able to over time settle between us on some amount. But right now we are depending upon the courts to do that. And so that is the thinking. The reason that we're pursuing this is that Qualcomm's trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value, and they do some really great work around standards essential patents. But it's one small part of what an iPhone is. It has nothing to do with the display or the Touch ID or a gazillion other innovations that Apple has done. And so we don't think that's right. And so we're taking a principled stand on it, and we strongly believe we're in the right. I'm sure they believe that they are. And that's what courts are for and we'll let it go with that. On iPhone sales, upgrades, and switchers Thank you. I was wondering if I could just follow up a little bit on iPhone demand. If I try and adjust for the drawdown in inventory and the extra week last quarter, I think sequentially iPhones declined about 27 percent if I make those adjustments. And that's actually quite a bit lower than the normal seasonality we would see from Q1 and Q2, which is typically closer to 20 percent. I understand your comments around China but your comparison was 40 points easier this quarter relative to last quarter and the growth rate improved only marginally, I think when you adjust for the extra week. And then you made a final comment around "a pause" on iPhones. So I'm wondering if you could maybe elaborate on what's the below-sequential, at least by my calculation, growth rate in Q2 attributable to a pause. And can you characterize what you think upgrade rates are doing perhaps broadly by geography, to help us better understand what might be happening or whether there are competitive dynamics that also are at play here that again might be contributing to that pause and that sequential decline that I referenced. Thank you. Tim Cook Lot of questions there. Let me give you some color as I see it. In this quarter, we reduced channel inventory by 1.2 million units. And so if you look on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily what we look at from a unit point of view because it would have the seasonality embedded in that, we grew sell-through on a year-over-year basis. Last quarter, I'm sure other folks remember, was a 14-week quarter. So you sort of have to adjust the rates last quarter to get out what the underlying sell-through growth was. And so I think that when you do that you're going to find that actually the year over year performance is similar, between the quarters. In terms of upgraders, we saw the largest absolute number of upgraders ever in any six-month period in the first half of this year. First half of this fiscal year, to precise. And we saw the largest absolute number of switchers outside of Greater China in the same period that we've ever seen. And so in four of the five operating segments, as I think Luca mentioned in his comments, we had very good growth and it was really propelled by the demand for iPhone 7 Plus which is growing incredibly fast around the world. And so that's kind of the color I would add there and hopefully some of that is useful for you. On iPhone inventory Simona Jankowski, Goldman Sachs Last year you had a 4 million unit channel inventory reduction for the iPhone in the June quarter. So just curious what you're expecting for this year. Just so we have an apples-to-apples comparison if we think about your guidance. Luca Maestri As you know, Simona, we do not provide guidance around units and around channel inventory reduction. But our goal is always to have the right amount of weeks of inventory in the channel. And if you look at our history over the last several years, we have fairly consistently reduced channel inventory in the June quarter, so I think it's a fair expectation to have. On Apple's expansion into India and its affect on future sales Tim, you've been excited about the India market for some time and have made strides in establishing a retail manufacturing and R&D presence there. So just curious, as you look at the market and the rollout of 4G there, is it reasonable for us to assume that Apple can sell something on the order of 10 to 20 million iPhones there next year and then grow from there. Tim Cook Yeah, we make it a point not to forecast by geo. We just provide a current quarter forecast. But as hopefully you've seen, as we began to give you more information about India we've been investing quite a bit. We have a ton of energy going into the country on a number of fronts, and it is the third largest smartphone market in the world today behind China and the United States. And so we believe, particularly now that a 4G infrastructure is going in the country and it's continuing to be expanded, that there is a huge opportunity for Apple there. And so that's that, and the demographics of the country is why we're putting so much energy there. On Apple's reception in India and methods by which it can expand in the country Jim Suva, Citigroup Thank you very much and congratulations on returning to growth consistently. That's great. I believe, Tim, in your prepared comments, you mentioned India was growing double digits, which is great. But I believe if you look at geographic information, India is really under-penetrated from an Apple reception perceptive. But yet they have LTE, you have the iPhone SE, the lower priced iPhone. You think that, say, this next 12-18 months is going to be a turning point, or is it more you need to work with the government to have Apple own stores or production there, or what's it really going to take to get India going along, because we think it's really a great opportunity. Tim Cook Well we think it's a great opportunity too. And so we're we're bringing all the things that we've brought to bear in other markets that we've eventually done well in. That's from channel to stores to our ecosystem and so forth. Phil was just over there opening a developer's center last quarter. So there are a ton of things going on there, and we agree that we are under-penetrated there. Our growth rates are are good—really good by most people's expectations, maybe not mine as much. And so we're putting a lot of energy in, just like we have in other geo's that eventually wound up producing more and more. And so I'm very excited about it. The 4G network investment really began rolling in in a significant way toward the last quarter of last year, as you know. But they are moving fast, they're moving at a speed that I have not seen, in any other country in the world, once they were started. And it is truly impressive.

What's new with Apple? We've got the highlights of the Q2 2017 earnings call. Apple held its quarterly earnings call today where Apple CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri spoke with analysts about the second quarter of 2017. You can read our full transcript if you want to see everything they had to say, or check out our highlights below! Apple overall Apple sold 50.76 million iPhones, 8.9 million iPads, and 4.2 million Macs. The quarterly revenue was up 10% over last year at $52.9 billion. Apple now has 495 retail locations in 18 countries worldwide and revenue was up 27% year-over-year. Apple will be increasing its Capital Return Program size by $50 billion, bringing the total to $300 billion. WWDC is "significantly oversubscribed" and expected to have thousands of attendees. Cook noted that WWDC will cover macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. In 2016, 96% of Apple's electricity usage came from renewable sources. Apple Park will house 13 thousand employees under one roof. Apple also provides more than two million jobs in the U.S. with American suppliers. When asked about Apple's decision to withhold royalty payments to Qualcomm, Cook commented, "You can't pay something when you don't know what you have to pay. They think we owe one amount, we think we owe a different amount. We need the courts to decide that. Qualcomm is charging Apple a percentage of the total iPhone. They do some great work around standards essentials patents, but that's a very small part of what iPhone is. We don't think that's right. We are taking a principled stand on it." The Capital Return Program Apple returned $10 billion to investors and paid $3 billion in dividends and equivalents. Apple paid out $12 billion in annual dividends, which is one of the largest payouts in the world. The program will be extended to March of 2019. Apple allocating the majority of the program expansion to shareholders. Raising dividends for the fifth time in less than five years. Services Services generated $7 billion in revenue, up 18% year-over-year. The number of app developers has increased by 26% in the March quarter. Paid subscriptions for all services exceed $165 million, up $15 million from last quarter. Maestri noted that, when people starts buying on the App Store, they end up spending more over time as they get more comfortable Apple Pay transactions have increased by 450%. In Japan, more than 500 thousand transit users use Apple Pay to pay for their fares. During the Super Bowl at one point, people sent 183 thousand iMessages per second. iPhone iPhone sales were in line with expectations and still see a large demand. Sales topped $7 billion. The iPhone grew by double-digits year over year. Regarding the supply constraints on the iPhone 7, Cook said, "We did not get right, the mix of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Demand was much stronger to the iPhone 7 Plus than we expected. It took us longer to adjust through the supply chain. What did we learn from it? We're brushing up our models and will apply everything we learned to the next time." iPad Though sales have tapered off, the iPad still remains the worlds most popular tablet. Apple sold 8.9 million iPads, which is 81% of the U.S. market for tablets over $200. The satisfaction ratings for the iPad remains at 95 - 100%. The Mac Mac sales generated $25 billion in revenue over the past four quarters. Mac revenue was up 20% in the March quarter in China. Revenue of Mac sales is up 14% over the previous quarter which is a new March record. Apple sold 14.2 Macs, which is a growth of 10% in the portables market. Cook commented that Apple is "Investing heavily in the Mac's future." Wearables Apple Watch sales have doubled year-over-year and sales have more than doubled in more than six of the top 10 markets. AirPods have a 98% satisfaction rating. Revenue for wearables over the past four quarters was the size of a Fortune 500 company. Cook said, "As I see it, that's pretty fast to come this far. The Watch hasn't been out very out very long and AirPods have only been out for three or four months." Want more details on Apples Q1 2017 earnings call? Go read our transcript!

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats combined would make 'Apple Wearables' a Fortune 500 company. So spake Tim Cook during Apple's Q2 2017 financial results call. It's a bold statement but also a necessary one. Despite last quarter making it time to admit Apple Watch is a success, last week media and financial hot-takers were once again tripping all over themselves and their logic to declare Apple Watch once again beleagured. Or doomed. Or whatever else fit their narrative. Meanwhile, Apple was not only enjoying twice the Apple Watch sales success as last year, the company was building on its wearable products like with the newly-released AirPods and the newly updated Beats wireless headphones. Here's Cook's full statement from the call: Building on the momentum from the holiday quarter, Apple Watch sales nearly doubled year over year. Apple Watch is the best selling and most loved smartwatch in the world and we hear wonderful stories from our customers about its impact on our fitness and health. We're also seeing great response to AirPods with a 98% customer satisfaction rating based on a recent Creative Strategies survey. Demand for AirPods significantly exceeds supply and growth in Beats products has also been very strong. In fact, when we combine Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats headphones, our revenues from wearable products in the last four quarters was the size of a Fortune 500 company. The survey suggests people not only love their AirPods, but love them so much they want to tell all their friends about them; At least in the case of AirPods, though, it seems like customers are not only currently finding them worth the 6-week wait, but finding them worth recommending in spite of it. And I think it's easy to see why: AirPods are truly delightful. The controls can leave a lot to be desired at times, but there's a euphoria that comes from being truly wireless. It feels freeing — almost humanizing. Once you start using them, you never want to be tethered to a device, or have buds tethered to each other, again. AirPods are also a gateway to augmented reality. Most people talk about visual AR, but audio AR could be here in faster and be a lot less obtrusive than glasses or spectacles, taking commands and overlaying information through sound. It's anyone's guess when the pundits will wake up their tired narratives and realize it, but wearable technology is an incredibly important space and right now it seems like Apple isn't just ahead, but accelerating.

When I bought my Sony headphones I debated buying a pair of Beats ones and decided that aside from the colours matching my iOS devices there wasn't much a reason to get them, also I'm not a huge fan of heavy bass. Of course that was all before the W1 chip. If I were buying today and not overly concerned about cost I'd probably be willing to sacrifice the superior noise cancellation of the Sony cans in order to be able to easily switch between my MacBook Pro, iPhone, iPad and Watch. (Though I really do hope Apple comes out with their own over the ear Apple branded pair, I doubt they will. But the Beats brand is still too associated with hiphop, and so it just doesn't resonate with me.) 0 4 hours ago Reply returnmyjedi For the couple of seconds that the W1 chip saves you in clicking on Bluetooth settings, is it really worth sacrificing audio fidelity for? 0 1 hour ago Reply cmdacos Audio AR?

This GPS-tracking smart sports watch with a built-in fitness coach is perfect for a mom seeking fitness motivation The Polar M400 isn't just a fitness tracker, it's a fitness-tracking smart watch. If you've got a fitness-forward mom who also wouldn't mind keeping up with incoming notifications (messages, calls, calendar alerts, etc.), the M400 is sure to please. The best part about the M400 isn't its smart watch functionality, though. It's the built-in smart coach that motivates, tracks and analyzes activity, and offers fitness feedback for improvements. See at Amazon 3. This wildly popular heart-rate-tracking fitness band is for the mom who likes things subtle and understated If an Apple Watch is more than mom needs and a Polar M400 is too bulky for her tastes, consider the Fitbit Charge 2!

The device can track sleep, send you reminders to get moving, guide you through mindful breathing sessions, and sends notifications for calls, texts, and calendar alerts.

See at Amazon 6. These uber-popular, sweat-proof in-ear headphones are the perfect choice for any mom that worries about warranties (lifetime warranty, y'all!) They don't have the 12 hours of battery life the Powerbeats3 tout, but these JayBird X2 Sport in-ear headphones are incredibly popular for a reason. With eight hours of battery life, multi-sized Comply ear tips for a custom fit, in-line mic and volume controls, and special rubberized "ear fins" that keep 'em held securely in your ears, the X2s are feature-packed. They also offer a lifetime sweat-proof warranty so mom never has to worry about 'em wearing out due to sweat. See at Amazon 7. This fitness armband for holding mom's phone in place during workouts Bringing a gigantic smartphone along for a workout can be a pain: It's uncomfortable storing it in your pocket, it gets all sweaty and unwieldy in your hand, and it's out of reach in a backpack. If you've ever heard mom complain about managing her phone during a workout, a fitness armband like this one from JOTO could be perfect! Aside from securely storing your phone on your arm and within reach, JOTO's looped fastening method makes it very easy to adjust with one hand and it features on-board pouches for storing keys, money, and credit cards.

Only problem is juicing can be a lot of work.

Cutting down on cutting time (pun entirely intended) makes it a little easier to commit to juicing regularly. It also packs in a pulp-ejector and collector and many of its pieces are dishwasher safe. If mom's ever talked about getting into juicing, surprise her with the Breville Juice Fountain Plus! See at Amazon 10. This fast-heating sous vide precision cooker will help your mom eat healthier, better-tasting food (that you'd better be making for her!)

Whether mom's a regular wine drinker or she's interested in trying something new, Winc's Wine Club is a terrific subscription box. She'll start off by answering six questions about foods, flavors, and interests that Winc uses to recommend wines.

The company will use those ratings to inform future wine recommendations. See at Winc 12. This adorable humidifying essential oil diffuser that can improve your mom's environment with good smells and fresher air This 3.4-ounce Urpower ultrasonic humidifier and essential oil diffuser is perfect for mom's office or a room in her home.

The winning bidder will be eating with Cook at Apple's new campus, Apple Park. The winner will be able to bring one guest along, and the lunch is expected to last around an hour. The lunch currently has an estimated value of $100,000, with the current bid as of this writing sitting at $79,888. Last year's auction for a lunch with Cook raised $515,000. Just as in previous years, this auction benefits one of Cook's favorite organizations, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, formerly known as the Robert R. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights. Participants should note that based on availability, it could take up to a year to schedule the lunch.

In her spare time, she sketches, sings, and in her secret superhero life, plays roller derby. Follow her on Twitter @settern. Want to outfit your 12.9-inch iPad Pro with the very best? Here are our recommendations. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro may not look like your traditional Mac laptop, but Apple's tablet is a computer in its own right for many people who simply don't need the bulk or mouse interface of a 13-inch laptop. If you have a 12.9-inch iPad Pro you're looking to outfit with the very best accessories, what should you choose? We've got you covered. Apple Pencil No questions here: If you ever plan to write, draw, sketch, doodle, or otherwise interact with your 12.9-inch iPad Pro, you need an Apple Pencil. The best styluses for iPad Apple Pencil: The Ultimate Guide Best Apple Pencil accessories It's the very best stylus on the market, and even if you don't think you need one, trust me: You need one. See at Apple Apple Smart Keyboard If you plan on doing any extensive writing on your iPad Pro, the Apple Smart Keyboard is the most versatile option: It folds up into a neat package and protects your iPad's screen when not in use, but unfolds into a full soft-keyboard package when you need it. Best keyboards for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro The Smart Keyboard isn't my absolute favorite to type on (that honor goes to the Logitech Create, but it's by far the most convenient and lightest option for writers. See at Apple Yohann Stand If you want to use your iPad on a table, couch, or bedside, you're going to need a good stand — and Yohann's beautiful wood and fiberglass options are both desk art in their own right and incredibly versatile stands. Best iPad Pro Stands The Swiss-based design firm has created U-shaped stands for all iPad models, but its top-tier features it saves for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro — offering a magnetic rest for the iPad at the bottom of the stand, and a proper storage hole inside the frame when you're not using the Pencil at all. I've used my Yohann stand at my desk, kitchen table, and on the couch — it's incredibly lightweight, but sturdy enough I'm not afraid to break it while moving from place to place. See at Yohann Pad & Quill Valet Leather Bag If you need a simple sleeve for your 12.9-inch iPad Pro that also carries around some basics, I adore Pad & Quill's Valet Leather Bag: If you like leather bags, it's a great look for both men and women, all while being as functional as it is stylish. Best Sleeves for iPad Pro You'll be able to store your 12.9-inch iPad along with your iPad Pro, charging cord, and even a portable keyboard, book, or physical notebook or two. See at Pad & Quill Beats X If I had to pick a single set of headphones to bring around town with my 12.9-inch iPad Pro, it'd be Apple's Beats X earbuds. Best Bluetooth headphones for iPad Pro The in-ear wireless options may not be as futuristically sleek as Apple's AirPods or as calming as the noise-cancelling Bose QC35s, but they're inexpensive, boast great sound, lengthy battery life, and fantastic noise isolation.  See at Apple A bunch of great apps Okay, so they're not hardware accessories per say, but I consider the software on my iPad just as crucial to its success as my accessories — and for my iPad Pro, I can't live without my drawing apps and second-screen software. Apps like Linea and Bear help me write and draw like a champ, while Astropad Studio ensures I can use my iPad as a drawing tablet for my iMac whenever I need it. Best drawing apps for iPad Pro With an iPad Pro and Astropad Studio, I may never need a Wacom tablet again Your favorites? What are your favorite iPad Pro accessories? Let us know below!

Why do I have to have another device I have to charge to use, Samsung has a stylus, pencil, what have you and it doesn't take a battery. Perhaps it will improve with time, but I don't do a lot of drawing on my iPad Pro I use the keyboard a lot and use it for work for webex events and showing clients info. 0 6 hours ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Sign Up Online Newspaper Log In SectionsSubscribe Nation & World Apple's growing cash stash spurs talk of huge acquisition By MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Technology Writer11:22 pm Apple Caption As Apple's stash of cash grows, so does the possibility that the world's most valuable company will use some of the money for a huge acquisition that would expand its empire beyond iPhones, iPads (above) and other gadgets. SAN FRANCISCO (AP) – As Apple’s stash of cash grows, so does the possibility that the world’s most valuable company will use some of the money for a huge acquisition that would expand its empire beyond iPhones and other gadgets. The company holds more than a quarter-trillion dollars it could use to go shopping. So far, the guessing game has primarily focused on possible targets such as Netflix and Tesla Motors. Either deal could make sense, given Apple’s long-running interest in providing a TV service to consumers and its more recent work on self-driving cars . But in recent months the takeover talk has swirled around whether Apple might do something even more dramatic by making a bid for Walt Disney Co. Mouse and Apple Such a combination would create the world’s first company worth $1 trillion. Beyond that, an Apple-Disney marriage would unite some of the world’s most successful brands in technology and entertainment – a list that includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac computer, Mickey Mouse, Disneyland, ESPN, Lucasfilm, Pixar and Marvel. “If there’s a deal out there that would strike fear in the hearts of Silicon Valley and Hollywood, this could be it,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a recent research report assessing the logic of an Apple-Disney combination. Apple doesn’t discuss specific companies that it might buy, but it’s exploring far and wide, according to Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri. “We are looking at every size of acquisition, so we will see how it goes going forward,” Maestri told The Associated Press in a Tuesday interview. Disney hasn’t given any inclination that it’s looking for a buyer, but publicly held companies are required to consider all takeover offers. Buying Disney would be expensive. Daryanani estimates that Apple would have to pay $157 per share, or about $250 billion. Treasure Chest Apple is one of the few companies – if not the only one – that could pay that sum out of its pocket. The Cupertino, California, company ended March with nearly $257 billion in cash and marketable securities, according to numbers released Tuesday with Apple’s earnings report for the January-March quarter. That’s up from $233 billion a year ago, and the figure is expected to keep growing as Apple piles up more profits from the iPhone, iPad and Mac, as well as the applications and services that feed those devices. In its latest quarter, Apple’s earnings climbed 5 percent to $11 billion while revenue also rose 5 percent to nearly $53 billion. In recent years, Apple has used a large chunk of its cash to provide its shareholders with extra income. The company disclosed plans on Tuesday to raise its quarterly dividend by more than 10 percent to 63 cents per share, marking the fifth increase in 5 years. Apple also has spent $151 billion buying back its own stock since 2012. The Trump administration might give Apple another reason to mull a major acquisition, given earlier promises to lower U.S. taxes on overseas corporate cash brought back to the U.S. Should that tax cut happen, Apple CEO Tim Cook has said the company will consider bringing back most of the more than $230 billion it now keeps in foreign countries, making it easier to finance a blockbuster deal in the U.S. Related Links Apple's growing cash stash spurs talk of huge acquisition Manufacturing leader: Job losses are destroying Illinois' middle class Don’t dip into your reserves Uber’s ‘flying cars’ set to land in Dallas by 2020 Sbarro now open in Walmart Tweets from https://twitter.com/saukvalley/lists/svm-news-sports-staff Reader Poll Donald Trump has been president for about 100 days.

Ford shares dropped 4.4 per cent and General Motors fell 2.9 per cent, as major automakers posted declines in US new vehicle sales for April. After the market closed, Apple shares fell more than 1 per cent after the company reported a surprise drop in iPhone sales for the quarter. Apple shares had gained 0.6 per cent during regular trading ahead of the report. Investors also were awaiting other significant events later in the week, including Wednesday's expected statement from the Federal Reserve, which began meeting on Tuesday, and Friday's US employment report. The Fed is widely expected to stand pat on interest rates, but may offer hints on the possibility of a rate hike in June. The benchmark S&P 500 is approaching record highs during an earnings season that has generally exceeded expectations. Overall, profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.9 per cent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The technicals in general look good for the S&P,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. “The fundamentals are improving, particularly as the earnings season unfolds here.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 36.43 points, or 0.17 per cent, to 20,949.89, the S&P 500 gained 2.83 points, or 0.12 per cent, to 2,391.16 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.76 points, or 0.06 per cent, to 6,095.37. The technology sector rose 0.3 per cent, its fourth straight day of gains. Industrials gained 0.5 per cent, helped by airlines shares after Delta said its passenger unit revenue increased 1 per cent in April. Energy shares fell 0.5 per cent as oil prices weakened. The S&P 500 has climbed 11.8 per cent since President Donald Trump's November 8 election, fuelled by hopes for his plans for tax cuts, deregulation and infrastructure spending, though investors have questioned his ability to enact his agenda. “The administration continues to issue tons of contradictory or hard-to-understand proposals and ideas and I think it has left this market a little bit confused about next steps,” said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. In earnings news, Advanced Micro Devices tumbled 24.4 per cent after the chipmaker's second-quarter gross margins forecast raised some concerns. The stock was the biggest percentage decliner in the S&P 500. Archer Daniels Midland sank 8.9 per cent and CVS Health fell 3.6 per cent after their respective quarterly reports. Coach shares rose 11.4 per cent, making it the biggest gainer on the S&P, as the handbag maker cut back on discounting in the United States and sold more expensive bags. Advancing and declining issues were roughly even on the NYSE, while on Nasdaq, a 1.26-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 47 new 52-week highs and 9 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 145 new highs and 51 new lows. About 7 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, above the 6.5 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Apple doesn’t discuss specific companies that it might buy, but it’s exploring far and wide, according to Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri. “We are looking at every size of acquisition, so we will see how it goes going forward,” Maestri told The Associated Press in a Tuesday interview. Disney hasn’t given any inclination that it’s looking for a buyer, but publicly held companies are required to consider all takeover offers. Buying Disney would be expensive. Daryanani estimates that Apple would have to pay $157 per share, or about $250 billion. Treasure Chest Apple is one of the few companies – if not the only one – that could pay that sum out of its pocket. The Cupertino, California, company ended March with nearly $257 billion in cash and marketable securities, according to numbers released Tuesday with Apple’s earnings report for the January-March quarter. That’s up from $233 billion a year ago, and the figure is expected to keep growing as Apple piles up more profits from the iPhone, iPad and Mac, as well as the applications and services that feed those devices. In its latest quarter, Apple’s earnings climbed 5 percent to $11 billion while revenue also rose 5 percent to nearly $53 billion. In recent years, Apple has used a large chunk of its cash to provide its shareholders with extra income. The company disclosed plans on Tuesday to raise its quarterly dividend by more than 10 percent to 63 cents per share, marking the fifth increase in 5 years. Apple also has spent $151 billion buying back its own stock since 2012. The Trump administration might give Apple another reason to mull a major acquisition, given earlier promises to lower U.S. taxes on overseas corporate cash brought back to the U.S. Should that tax cut happen, Apple CEO Tim Cook has said the company will consider bringing back most of the more than $230 billion it now keeps in foreign countries, making it easier to finance a blockbuster deal in the U.S. Related Links Apple's growing cash stash spurs talk of huge acquisition Manufacturing leader: Job losses are destroying Illinois' middle class Don’t dip into your reserves Uber’s ‘flying cars’ set to land in Dallas by 2020 Sbarro now open in Walmart Tweets from https://twitter.com/saukvalley/lists/svm-news-sports-staff Reader Poll Donald Trump has been president for about 100 days.

Looking ahead, financial analysts cited concerns about the ongoing iPhone slump in China, high memory prices and Apple’s suit with Qualcomm. Apple nudged second quarter revenues up 5 percent from the same period last year to $52.896 billion despite a 14 percent decline in sales to China. Overall sales of iPhones—which account for almost two-thirds of Apple’s revenue—were up just 1 percent, while iPads continued their decline with a 12 percent slide and Mac revenues were up 14 percent year-over year. One analyst on the quarterly call asked why Apple recently decided to withhold royalty payments from Qualcomm, risking supply of modem chips and injunctions on iPhones. “Why would Apple take on these risks in advance of what is arguably the largest and most significant product launch of its history” asked Toni Sacconaghi, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, referring to the much anticipate tenth-anniversary iPhone. “Qualcomm has not made an offer to Apple to license its standard-essential patents [SEPs] on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms,” said Apple chief executive Tim Cook. “I don’t believe anyone will enjoin iPhone based on that, there’s plenty of case law around that subject,” Cook said. The two companies need courts to fix a FRAND rate on the Qualcomm cellular patents, Cook said. “Qualcomm is trying to charge Apple a percentage of the iPhone’s value--they do great work around SEP but its one small part of what an iPhone is and has nothing to do with a gazillion other innovations in the iPhone,” he added. Apple filed suit against Qualcomm in January, claiming that Qualcomm’s royalties were exorbitant and the chip vendor pressured it to remain silent. In a countersuit filed earlier this month, Qualcomm said that it paid Apple to refrain from asserting patents and revealed that it gets royalty payments for iPhones and iPads through Apple’s contract manufacturers including Compal, Foxconn, Pegatron, and Wistron. Sacconaghi also questioned whether Apple is making a significant return to iPhone growth after hitting a slump last year, suggesting quarterly sales were below seasonal trends. Cook noted Apple drew down 1.2 million units in iPhone channel inventory in the quarter, more than twice the 450,000 units it purged from the supply chain in the same period a year ago. The average sales price of iPhones increased to $655 from $642 last year, said CFO Luca Maestri. Responding to a separate question about the China slump, Cook argued Apple has seen the slide slow in the six months compared to the prior six months. “I believe we’ll improve a bit more in this coming quarter, not back to growth but we’ll make more progress. We continue to believe there’s a tremendous opportunity there,” he said. Over the past year a new cluster of homegrown smartphone makers such as Oppo and Vivo are rising in China. They have joined Huawei and Xiaomi, who have become established players. Cook noted Mac sales were up 20 percent in China in the quarter. Apple stores in China saw a 27 percent increase in traffic in the period, he said.

Q4 (will go by calendar quarters) iphone was flatish on year on a sell-through basis but it was a 14 weeks quarter and the launch was pulled forward in many jurisdictions. Adjusted for that the iphone was down quite a bit on year. In Q1, 52 million sell-through is flat on year and that's quite a bit better than normal considering Q4. Apple made efforts to get there with the red iphone late in Q1 and the iphone 6 resurrection in some markets. All in all the iphone was quite in line with reason. Apple has crippled the Mac with the iPad Pro and Q1 Mac sales were boosted by MacBook Pro shortages in Q4. Look at both quarters, normalize for the launch and Mac was weak.The iPad is struggling hard even if Apple made efforts to boost Q1 with the 329$ iPad. The Pro line failed to help in both units and ASPs. Apple doesn't even know what a tablet is anymore, conceptually. Services and Software, the ones with decent margins depend on the iphone. Shareholders and analysts that are desperate to find upsides are ferocious about Services but without hardware sales there wouldn't be anything left here. Apple doesn't have anything that can stand on its own, even less so any services that make money and can stand on their own. The interesting part is Q2 iphone. Last year Apple had the SE starting to generate revenue in Q2 and they need to drain inventory to some extent again. Given all that, they will have a hard time shipping 40 million units in Q2 and there is the risk of close to 35 due to leaks on next gen products. In Q1 Huawei shipped 34.55 million units (their own numbers) and they can overtake Apple in Q2 in units.

To be accurate, Apple's cash pile swelled to US$$256.8 billion by the end of March of 2017. That mind-boggling sum makes the iPhone maker the richest company in the world. Here are other interesting nuggets about Apple's treasure chest: 1. Its cash hoard is bigger than the GDP of 150 countries, including Finland (US$232.4 billion), New Zealand (US$173.8 billion) and Hungary (US$121.7 billion). 2. Apple doubled its cash pile in just over 4½ years. In the last three months of 2016, it racked up new cash at a rate of about US$3.6 million an hour. 3. Apple has more cash than the US$126 million stockpile of Microsoft, the next richest tech company. 4. Over 90 per cent of Apple's cash is stockpiled outside of the US, in countries like Switzerland, Luxembourg and Ireland. 5. US companies, many of them tech giants like Apple and Google, have accumulated over US$2 trillion in cash overseas to avoid paying US corporate taxes, whose top rate of 35 per cent is one of the highest in the world. 6. US President Donald Trump has proposed slashing business taxes and a one-time tax holiday to bring that cash home. Should he succeed, Apple CEO Tim Cook has said the company will consider bringing back most of its overseas cash. That will ratchet up pressure on Apple to make big acquisitions or dole out more money to shareholders. 7. Apple's Tim Cook has already returned over US$200 billion to shareholders since 2012. On Tuesday, he stepped up the pace, announcing an additional US$50 billion for dividends and share buybacks. 8. Apple could make more and bigger acquisitions after largely choosing to grow organically by inventing new products. Apple's biggest deal so far has been its US$3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014 - peanuts in comparison to its cash hoard. 9. But analysts are speculating that Apple might target Netflix (valued at US$65 billion) or Tesla Motors (worth US$51 billion), given its long interest in television and, more recently, in self-driving cars. 10. There is even talk Apple might go for a really big one - Walt Disney Co - a giant worth about US$250 billion. An Apple-Disney merger would create the world's first company worth US$1 trillion. It would also bring together some of the world's most successful brands in technology and entertainment - the iPhone, iPad, Mac computer, Mickey Mouse, Disneyland, Lucasfilm, Pixar and Marvel.

Skip to main content asia one Singapore Malaysia China Asia World Singapore Malaysia China Asia World Business Showbiz Health Food Singapore's first ever Apple store might just be unveiled in May PHOTO: Vulcan Post M. Shazni Vulcan Post May 02, 2017 I don't think anyone would have forgotten about the massively covered retail facade over at Knightsbridge where Singapore's first ever Apple store is allegedly being built behind closed doors. Since last year, the Apple faithful has been counting down the days when they will finally be able to set foot in the legendary Apple store on home soil. If a report by news site CNBC is anything to go by, their wish might have just been granted. Looks Like The Apple Will be Dropping In May According to 'sources' whom CNBC quoted, it was mentioned that whatever problems that the construction of the Apple store has faced has been resolved and that it is on course for its launch in the coming month in the heart of Orchard Road. What's interesting is that these 'sources' were described as people who were aware of the situation, and from what was described, are also staff of a neighbouring retail store and hotel. The reliability of these 'sources' can be doubtful as they were not people who are directly involved with the construction of the Apple store. CNBC also spoke to the vice president of IDC Asia Pacific, Bryan Ma. He shares how significant this new Apple store will be because it has the potential to converge Apple fans from not only in Singapore, but also the region, since it is the only official retail store for Apple in Southeast Asia. To round off the report, of course the news site got in touch with Apple to find out if this news is indeed true. While Apple's head of corporate communications for Southeast Asia and India who responded to them did not deny that an Apple store was being built in Singapore, it was also mentioned that construction was going on as scheduled, and that there isn't a specific date for its opening. Singapore May Indeed Be Next If you remembered earlier this year in February, CEO Tim Cook and notable executives from Apple made a press conference call to share the company's sales figures to round off a strong 2016 with another record breaking year in revenue. In that announcement as well, Apple's CEO also mentioned that the tech giant was also looking to open their first stores in Dubai and Singapore. Well guess which one of them recently got their curtains lifted? Photo: Foster+Partners Here's the Apple store in Dubai. Located in the grand Dubai Mall, the store is designed by renowned architectural firm Foster+Partners and features one the world's largest kinetic art installation as its facade to put it as the centerpiece of the mall. It looks set to rival even the Burj Khalifa in attracting visitors into the Gulf region through its first Apple store. The one in Singapore in all likelihood will have a similar effect. Apple fans in Southeast Asia are definitely waiting for the big day to arrive where they travel here not just for the Marina Bay Sands and Universal Studios, but also the Apple store.

This is the most notable major new product Apple has created under his stewardship. He's never released revenue or unit sales. However, during the company's quarterly earnings call with analysts on Tuesday he gave a hint. He said that Apple's wearable business, which includes the Watch, Beats headphones and the new Airpods, is now "the size of a Fortune 500 company." OK, then. Burlington Stores is No. 500 on the Fortune 500 list, with just over $5.1 billion in annual revenue. So Cook is saying the combined annual revenue of its "wearable" products is at least $5 billion. Later he emphasized that over the past 12 months, these combined products were "well into the Fortune 500" suggesting that the business could be even bigger than the $5 billion base assumption.  But exactly how much of that mysterious revenue number of more than $5 billion is from sales of the Apple Watch versus, say, the Beats headphones, which had about one-third the $2.5 billion headphone market in 2016, according to NPD? Cook's remarks were carefully construed not to reveal that. For more news videos visit Yahoo View, available on iOS and Android.   The Watch keeps ticking We do know that Apple's "other" category of products, which includes these products plus Apple TV, iPod and Apple-branded and third-party accessories, came in at $2.87 billion for the quarter and just over $4 billion for the quarter before that. So nearly $7 billion so far this year. Cook did say that Apple Watch sales nearly doubled year-over-year and that "Watch units have more than doubled in 6 of our top 10 markets, which is phenomenal growth, particularly in a non-holiday quarter." While there's a general sense that Watch has been sort of a dud, he insisted that Watch is both a success and a product that Apple plans to keep selling for a long time. "Watch has been a key category for us. We’re really proud of the growth of the business," he said. "We’re very committed to it. It's already a big business and we believe over time it will be even larger." Meanwhile, market researcher Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies estimates Apple sold around 3.2 million Watch units.  So Apple Watch units were likely around 3.2m units last quarter. — Ben Bajarin (@BenBajarin) May 2, 2017 View photos bii apple other products revenue and yoy growth q1 2017More (Apple's "Other Products" revenue and year-over-year growth q1 2017Business Insider Intelligence) NOW WATCH: I won't trade in my iPhone for a Samsung Galaxy S8 — here's why More From Business Insider What to expect from Apple's upcoming earnings Apple CEO blames iPhone 8 rumors for slow iPhone sales People really like their Apple AirPods, survey says Reblog Share Tweet Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

Revenue was up 5% year-over-year to $52.896 billion. Operating income for the quarter was up 6.6% to $14.097 billion, and net income was up just under 5% to $11.029 billion. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $2.10. Apple is also announcing they are expanding their capital return program, and the board has increased the capital return to shareholders another $50 billion, making the total program worth $300 billion in dividends and share repurchases by the time it wraps up in March 2019.

For the quarter, Apple sold 50.763 million iPhones, down 1% from a year ago, but with higher average selling prices, revenue was up 1% to $33.249 billion for the quarter. Of course, last quarter was the iPhone refresh, and they sold 78.29 million iPhones last quarter, so the business isn’t exactly doing poorly, but iPhone is the device that has transformed Apple, so we’ll have to see how sales go over this calendar year. Mac sales were strong though, considering the PC market. Mac had an increase in device sales of 4%, to 4.199 million units. With a new Mac Pro refresh, this is perhaps not as strong as expected, but revenue for the unit was up 14% to $5.844 billion, so they are making more per Mac sale. Services seem to be the next big growth area for Apple, and with an install base of iPhones as high as it is, this is arguably a good way to capitalize on that base. Apple’s services segment, which includes revenue for digital content, AppleCare Apple Pay, licensing, and other services, had revenue growth of 18% to $7.041 billion. The difference with services compared to iPhone sales is that there isn’t the massive swing quarter to quarter either, with services only dropping 2% from Q1, compared to iPhone which dropped 39% from the holiday quarter. The iPad continues its drop, and nothing Apple has done yet seems to have had any impact on this trend. iPad was down 12% in revenue year-over-year to $3.889 billion, and of course that’s still a huge amount of revenue, but when it has to compete against the iPhone it seems poorer than it is. In terms of device sales, Apple sold 8.922 million iPads this quarter, down 13% from a year ago where they sold 10.251 million. Apple Q2 2017 Device Sales (thousands)   Q2'2017 Q1'2017 Q2'2016 Seq Change Year/Year Change iPhone 50,763 78,290 51,983 -35% -1% iPad 8,922 13,081 10,251 -32% -13% Mac 4,199 5,374 4,034 -22% +4% Other products, which is where Apple puts Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats, iPod, and accessories, actually had a solid quarter, with revenue up 31% to $2.873 billion. Apple never breaks down the individual parts of this though, which is understandable, but unfortunate. Apple is forecasting revenue for Q3 to be between $43.5 and $45.5 billion, with a gross margin of 38% plus or minus 0.5%.

Published: 04:47 May 3, 2017 AFP   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE San Francisco: Apple on Tuesday reported a rise in quarterly profits but its shares took a hit from slow-growing revenues and weaker iPhone sales ahead of a 10-year-anniversary model on the horizon. Apple said that its profit climbed 4.9 percent to slightly more than $11 billion (Dh40.1 billion) on revenue rising 4.6 percent to $52.9 billion in the quarterly that ended April 1. Shares of the California-based company were down nearly two percent to $144.65 in after-market trades that followed released of the earnings figures. “We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus,” Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in the earnings release. Cook said the company has seen “great” response to new iPhone 7 Red Special Edition models and is “thrilled with the strong momentum of our services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter.” Still, iPhone sales dipped slightly compared with a year ago to 50.8 million units, below most forecast for the key profit machine for Apple. During a conference call with analysts, Cook said Apple was seeing a “pause” in iPhone purchases that he felt was caused by unconfirmed “reports about future iPhones.” “That is clearly what is going on,” Cook said. Apple has annually unveiled new iPhone models during special events in September, with major innovations anticipated this year because it will mark the tenth anniversary of the debut of the world-changing mobile device. Still, the company contended that iPhone sales were better than it had expected, growing in four of its five top markets and skewing toward large-screen iPhone 7 models that have higher margins of profit. Buying back shares Apple also announced that its board of directors has authorized an addition $50 billion for dividends and buying back shares in the company, raising to $300 billion the total amount of cash to be spent in the program during the coming two years. While Apple has become the world’s most valuable company, analysts are looking at how the company is diversifying in the face of a saturated smartphone market and increasing competition. Tuesday’s report showed weaker sales of iPads and Mac computers. Apple also reported a 14 percent drop in revenues from a year earlier for “Greater China,” dropping the region behind Europe and the Americas in terms of sales. A strong US dollar facing off with weaker currencies were blamed for a strong “headwind” that pushed revenue down. Keen on India Sales of Macintosh computers did well in China, with revenue up about 20 percent, and the company’s retail shops were attracting visitors in what it saw as a good signal for its business there. “We continued to believe there is an enormous opportunity there,” Cook said on mainland China. “In the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there.” Apple is also investing heavily in India, the third largest smartphone market in the world behind China and the US, according to Cook. Apple set a new March quarter revenue record in India, growing by double digits. “We’re very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country with its very large, young and tech savvy population, fast growing economy and improving 4G network infrastructure,” Cook said. Apple continued to tout growth of revenue from online services or digital content, which it boasted was on its way to be on scale with a Fortune 100 company in terms of revenue. For the second quarter in a row, revenue from Apple services topped $7 billion, the company reported. While not disclosing exact numbers, executives said Apple Watch sales double from the same quarter last year and touted it as the best selling smartwatch in the world. Sales of other products, which include AirPods wireless ear pieces and Apple Watch, posted a 31 percent increase in revenue over the prior year. Combining revenue from Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats headphone sales over the course of the last year would give Apple’s “wearables” offerings the scale of a Fortune 500 company, according to Cook. Apple’s cash holdings meanwhile rose to a record $256.8 billion, a figure that raises questions for how the company will manage its massive reserves.

(Lori Van Buren / Times Union) Photo: Lori Van Buren Buy this photo Witnesses describe post-shooting panic 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Albany After hearing two loud sounds and a male voice ordering everyone to the ground, Elise Van Allen found herself crawling on the floor and thinking she was going to die in the chaos of the Crossgates Mall Apple Store. "I pondered if it was an act of terrorism or another mall shooting," the Apple employee and prosecution witness testified Tuesday at the trial of Tasheem Maeweather, who is charged with attempted murder. Prosecutors say the 20-year-old Albany man fired on a group of rival gang members after a chance encounter near the Apple Store on November 12, a busy Saturday afternoon. Widespread panic ensued as people tried to escape, but there were no injuries. Prosecutor Steven Sharp showed parts of the surveillance footage from inside the store in the seconds before and after the shooting. The defense contends police have the wrong man, focused exclusively on Maeweather and disregarded other potential suspects. Van Allen was one of five Apple workers who took the stand and recalled hearing what many described as two loud bangs that sent them diving for cover and in some instances crawling to the back room for safety. Employees from nearby shops took the stand. Two of them said they found bloody clothing on the premises that they turned over to police. On cross-examination, defense attorney Lee Kindlon asked each of the prosecution witnesses the same basic questions: Had they ever seen Maeweather, did they see him with a gun and did they witness the shooting. They all responded to no to each question. Jurors viewed Maeweather, who is also charged with attempted assault, criminal possession of a weapon and reckless endangerment, being interviewed by Guilderland police Detective Charles Tanner, the lead investigator on the case. Maeweather tells Tanner that he took his two younger sisters to the H&M store and bought a $205 pair of Air Jordan sneakers for himself at Champs but insisted he had nothing to do with the shooting, is not part of a gang and knows a lot of people but doesn't have beef with anyone. "I ain't in no crew, no gang, nothing," he said. "I just be hanging around people." In the interview, when Tanner shows Maeweather a photo of him in front of the Apple Store, he acknowledges in the interview that he was there talking to a man he calls his cousin when somebody punched him in the face. He said he started running and heard gunshots before later meeting up outside with his sisters. Kindlon argued that Guilderland cops focused on Maeweather even though Albany police came up with other potential suspects, including one who was standing outside the Apple Store at the time of the shooting and was later picked up in Colonie and charged with criminal possession of a weapon. Under questioning from Kindlon, Tanner said a search of Maeweather's home didn't turn up a gun or any ballistic evidence linking him to the shooting and that detectives didn't search other locations recorded by Maeweather's GPS monitor he was wearing while on probation for drug-related conviction in 2015, Earlier in the day, Ernest Rennhack, the man who was playing Santa Claus at the mall, testified he saw shoppers heading for the doors after he heard what sounded like two gunshots. "I saw a lot of frightened people running looking for the nearest exit to get out of the mall," said Rennhack. The jury also heard from State Police crime lab experts in ballistics and forensics. Testimony in Albany County Court will resume Wednesday morning before Judge Roger McDonough. pnelson@timesunion.com • 518-454-5347 • @apaulnelson News Videos Most Popular 1 Manhunt for driver of stolen SUV after crash in East Greenbush 2 Drunk driver from Albany gets prison after repeat offenses 3 Defense witness agrees with prosecutor in Lake George crash 4 State Police to expand uniformed patrols in Albany, Schenectady 5 $20 tickets for SPAC shows offered as kickoff to summer 6 SEEN: Wildwood Spring Gala 7 A.M.

(Reuters/Thomas Peter) Share Written by Josh Horwitz 4 hours ago Apple just announced its earnings for the quarter ending March 2017, and in China, the numbers tell a familiar tale. Sales are slowing, confirming the company’s heyday in the country has come to an end and that it can no longer rely on China as a growth engine. Apple reported Greater China (Hong Kong, mainland China, and Taiwan) revenues of $10.73 billion, marking an annual decrease of 14%. That marks the fifth quarter in a row where Apple has logged negative growth in the region. And while the company suffered a global lag in sales from late 2015 to late 2016, revenues from China continue to sink even as others recover. For the past two quarters, Greater China marks the only region where annual sales growth has been negative. In the company’s earnings call, CEO Tim Cook blamed unfavorable exchange rates, as well as falling numbers of mainland Chinese tourists to Hong Kong—the city was once a popular place for Chinese visitors to buy iPhones, due to a lag in release dates and price differences. But the true cause likely remains the larger problem Apple faces in China—everyone who wanted an iPhone now has one already. Cook did point to the App Store (and in other countries, iCloud, Apple Music, and other offerings) as one bright spot. He stated that the company logged “double-digit revenue growth” from its “services” segment in China, which includes software sales from the App Store. But that double-digit growth is likely coming from a relatively small base. Moreover, maintaining that double-digit sales growth for software in China will prove difficult. The Chinese government, ever keen to police both foreign companies and its online media industry, has thrown hurdles at Apple’s software ambitions. Throughout the past year, authorities have forced Apple to shut down its iBooks and iTunes movie stores and remove the the New York Times app from the App Store. The company also faces an “inquiry” for allegedly offering apps that contain pornographic content. And on top of that, there’s the possibility that Tencent, makers of the popular WeChat chat app, will attempt to develop a pseudo-app store of its own that will go head to head with Apple’s App Store.

By Anthony Cuthbertson On 5/2/17 at 4:52 PM Close Business Apple If Apple were a country, it would be the 11th richest in the world—at least by the measure of cash reserves. The latest quarterly results of the iPhone maker revealed it has a cash pile of more than $250 billion, a sum greater than the foreign reserves of Germany and Spain combined. While comparing a country’s foreign reserves with a company’s cash hoard is like comparing oranges to, well, apples, the figure inevitably raises questions about what the world’s richest company is saving up for. The most likely answer is it will continue to sit on its stockpile like the corporate incarnation of Scrooge McDuck, but if Apple does decide to go on a spending spree, Newsweek has come up with six ways of how best to do it. Subscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week Buy Tesla, Netflix and Uber The old adage of ‘if you can’t beat them, join them,’ has had a multi-billion-dollar resurgence thanks to Silicon Valley. Facebook’s $1 billion acquisition of Instagram, followed by its $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp, seems like proof that buying out the competition can sometimes be easier than fighting it. An Apple Inc logo. Apple reported a surprise fall in iPhone sales for its second quarter Tuesday May 2, 2017. Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images/ Newsweek/ Composite Apple’s widely-rumored plans to develop an autonomous electric car—described by Elon Musk last year as an “open secret” —has already helped it poach several engineers from leading electric car maker Tesla. With Tesla’s market cap hovering around $53 bn, Apple could could afford to swallow up its rival with enough left over to buy a number of other high-profile tech companies. Two potential targets are Netflix and Uber, who have estimated values of $66 billion and $68 billion respectively, with the most likely one being the streaming giant. Apple’s head of content, Eddie Cue, dismissed this speculation earlier this year. “If we wanted to do what everybody else is doing, then you’re right, we might be better off buying somebody or doing that,” Cue said at Recode’s Code Media conference in February. “But that’s not what we’re trying to do.” ‘Spaceship’ Headquarters in Every U.S. State Employees started moving into Apple’s new campus in Cupertino, California, earlier this month, as the company puts the final touches to its 3 million square feet headquarters. Apple Park, nicknamed “the spaceship,” can house more than twice the number of people as Apple’s existing campus—but it’s come at a cost. Construction is estimated to have cost around $5 billion, meaning Apple could afford to build another 50 with what it has in the bank—one for every U.S. state. The Apple Campus 2 is seen under construction in Cupertino, California in this aerial photo taken January 13, 2017. REUTERS/Noah Berger Pay Off its European Tax Bill 17 Times Over Like any wily billionaire, Apple knows how to protect its assets from being taxed—with more than 90 percent of its cash reserves kept overseas. But Apple’s accountants were unable to outsmart the European Commission last year, and was ordered to pay €13 billion ($14.5 billion) in back taxes to Ireland. The ruling followed a three-year investigation into the U.S. company’s tax arrangements in Europe, and concluded that tax rulings issued by Ireland since 1991 artificially lowered the tax paid by Apple. The Commission found that Apple had paid as little as 0.005 percent corporate tax on its annual profits, yet CEO Tim Cook still called the ruling “total political crap.” He shouldn’t worry too much, as Apple has plenty of money to pay it—and 16 times again after that. Solve the Global Food Crisis An Apple advert from 1996 for the Macintosh Powerbook concluded with the line: “The power to save the world.” The company was referring to the device’s computing power, but two decades later, the company is in a position to actually make a significant contribution to saving the planet—or at least millions of lives of people living on it. According to United Nations estimates from 2015, it would take $267 billion per year until 2030 to “eliminate hunger immediately.” Jose Graziano da Silva, the director-general of the Food and Agriculture Organization, said at the time: “Given that this is more or less equivalent to 0.3 percent of the global GDP, I personally think it is a relatively small price to pay to end hunger.” Apple CEO Tim Cook stands on stage during a Special Event at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium September 9, 2015 in San Francisco, California. He has decried the recent EU ruling that Apple should play Ireland €13bn in back taxes. Stephen Lam/ Getty Images Three iPhone 7s for Every American A bottom-of-the-range iPhone 7 may cost an American consumer between $650 and $850 off-contract, but it costs Apple less than $220 to actually build it—at least according to device teardown experts from IHS Markit. At this price, Apple could afford to manufacture more than 1 billion of its flagship smartphones and give one to every seventh person living in the world today. (The iPhone 8 is expected to be launched later this summer, so if Apple did choose this option, it may want to wait a few months.)   Make Every Apple Employee a Multi-Millionaire   Henry Ford, one of the greatest business minds of the 20th Century, apparently reasoned that doubling his workers wages would mean they could afford the products they were making. The truth behind the wage rise was in fact more to do with worker morale, but it is still a lesson Apple could learn from. Apple executives rank among the richest people in the world, with CEO Tim Cook’s net worth estimated at around $785 million. If Apple wanted to, Apple could afford to make all 115,000 of its employees multi-millionaires—with a one-off bonus of $2.17 million.

SAN FRANCISCO: Apple on Tuesday reported a rise in quarterly profits but its shares took a hit from slow-growing revenues and weaker iPhone sales ahead of a 10-year-anniversary model on the horizon. Apple said that its profit climbed 4.9 percent to slightly more than $11 billion on revenue rising 4.6 percent to $52.9 billion in the quarterly that ended April 1. Shares of the California-based company were down nearly two percent to $144.65 in after-market trades that followed released of the earnings figures. "We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus," Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in the earnings release. Cook said the company has seen "great" response to new iPhone 7 Red Special Edition models and is "thrilled with the strong momentum of our services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter." Still, iPhone sales dipped slightly compared with a year ago to 50.8 million units, below most forecast for the key profit machine for Apple. During a conference call with analysts, Cook said Apple was seeing a "pause" in iPhone purchases that he felt was caused by unconfirmed "reports about future iPhones." "That is clearly what is going on," Cook said. Apple has annually unveiled new iPhone models during special events in September, with major innovations anticipated this year because it will mark the tenth anniversary of the debut of the world-changing mobile device. Still, the company contended that iPhone sales were better than it had expected, growing in four of its five top markets and skewing toward large-screen iPhone 7 models that have higher margins of profit. Apple also announced that its board of directors has authorized an addition $50 billion for dividends and buying back shares in the company, raising to $300 billion the total amount of cash to be spent in the program during the coming two years. While Apple has become the world's most valuable company, analysts are looking at how the company is diversifying in the face of a saturated smartphone market and increasing competition. Tuesday's report showed weaker sales of iPads and Mac computers. Apple also reported a 14 percent drop in revenues from a year earlier for "Greater China," dropping the region behind Europe and the Americas in terms of sales. A strong US dollar facing off with weaker currencies were blamed for a strong "headwind" that pushed revenue down. Sales of Macintosh computers did well in China, with revenue up about 20 percent, and the company's retail shops were attracting visitors in what it saw as a good signal for its business there. "We continued to believe there is an enormous opportunity there," Cook said on mainland China. "In the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there." Apple is also investing heavily in India, the third largest smartphone market in the world behind China and the US, according to Cook. Apple set a new March quarter revenue record in India, growing by double digits. "We're very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country with its very large, young and tech savvy population, fast growing economy and improving 4G network infrastructure," Cook said. Apple continued to tout growth of revenue from online services or digital content, which it boasted was on its way to be on scale with a Fortune 100 company in terms of revenue. For the second quarter in a row, revenue from Apple services topped $7 billion, the company reported. While not disclosing exact numbers, executives said Apple Watch sales double from the same quarter last year and touted it as the best selling smartwatch in the world. Sales of other products, which include AirPods wireless ear pieces and Apple Watch, posted a 31 percent increase in revenue over the prior year. Combining revenue from Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats headphone sales over the course of the last year would give Apple's "wearables" offerings the scale of a Fortune 500 company, according to Cook. Apple's cash holdings meanwhile rose to a record $256.8 billion, a figure that raises questions for how the company will manage its massive reserves.

Revenue increased 14 percent compared to last year’s second quarter. Apple only released a single new Mac product, the new MacBook Pro, in late 2016. What could Cupertino accomplish if it did something crazy like update all of its Mac products at once? What would happen with Mac Sales if all of these got upgraded at once? (Image Credit: iRent A Mac) A Magical Uptick in Mac Sales Mac sales were down during most of 2016. The first three quarters of the year saw Mac sales declining, and then Cupertino released the new MacBook Pro models, including two with Touch Bars. Almost magically, Mac sales went up. Granted, that increase was only a single percentage point. That’s not where the story ends, though. Even after the Christmas holidays ended, Apple continued to bank on what Bryan Chaffin called its “one weird trick” for boosting Mac sales. The new MacBook Pro models fueled an increase in sales during the March quarter that amounted to a year-over-year increase of four percent in units sold, and 14 percent in revenue. With just a single product category refreshed, Cupertino was able to maintain the winning streak that eluded the company the previous year. Most of Us Are Itching for New Macs Not everyone is in the market for a new MacBook Pro, even a 13-inch model. Some of us, myself included, don’t care as much about portability and are looking for a new desktop Mac. Others want a new MacBook Air. Even more folks are clamoring for new servers, like the Mac Mini Server, or Mac Pro computers. The moral of the story is that plenty of folks are waiting, impatiently, for Cupertino to refresh their Mac product category of preference. If Apple went so far as to offer new models of the MacBook Air, iMac, and Mac Pro simultaneously, what would that do to its sales figures in the Mac product summary? I could be wrong here, but I think we’d be likely to see those “units sold” numbers increase by double digits, at least low ones. That’s being modest, I believe. Let’s Go Crazy, Cupertino Even better, what if Apple did what just about every other computer manufacturer does, and released new models for all of its product categories during the same year? I realize that not every consumer would upgrade their computers in the same year. But, I’m sure the number of folks waiting for a new model of their favorite platform is great enough that Cupertino would surely see sales figures jump by much more than four percent or even low double-digit percentages.

Company CEO Tim Cook shared that detail during the company’s second fiscal quarter earnings report on Tuesday. Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats sales hit Fortune 500 level “We’re happy with the growth of the business. Watch units more than doubled in six of our top 10 markets,” Mr. Cook said. He added, When you begin to combine watch revenues with those for AirPods—this was the first full quarter for AirPod shipments, and we’re not satisfying demand yet—and then add Beats products, and look on the trailing 12 months, that business was well into the Fortune 500. Considering Apple Watch launched in spring 2015, and AirPods started shipping in December 2016, that’s pretty impressive growth. The “other products” category Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats headphones fall into also includes the iPod lineup, Apple TV, and Apple-branded accessories such as the Magic Trackpad and the adapters Touch Bar MacBook Pro owners are buying. Making a comparison to companies on the Fortune 500 list seems pretty much obligatory, so that has Apple’s “other products” business rubbing elbows with Walmart ($482 billion), Exxon Mobil ($246 billion), and Apple ($233 billion). Since comparing one division to the top three Fortune 500 companies doesn’t seem all that fair, let’s go with companies that are probably more in line with Apple’s “other product” sales such as J.M. Smucker ($5.6 billion), SanDisk ($5.5 billion), and Western Union ($5.4 billion). Apple’s “other products” revenue was up 31% year over year. What we don’t know, however, are solid figures for everything Apple lumps into that group because it doesn’t break out individual sales. The numbers Apple did give us include $52.9 billion in revenue for the quarter, $11 billion in earnings, and $2.10 EPS. Mac sales were up 4% at 4.2 million units for the quarter, and iPhone sales were down 1% year over year at 50.8 million. The company’s services business brought in $7 billion, up 18% year over year. Apple’s quarterly numbers stand in contrast to complaints some pundits are tossing around saying the company is floundering and in aiming for a death spiral. Apple is one of the most valuable companies in the world, quarterly earnings eclipse most company’s annual revenues, and product categories are performing at levels that would be considered very successful for most stand-alone businesses. That doesn’t mean Apple can rest on its laurels and stop innovating. New and compelling products and services are critical Apple’s success. What Apple can do now—and hopefully is—to keep its financial lead is to invest what other companies would consider a small fortune into making sure its upcoming product announcements blow our socks off.

By: MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Posted:May 02 2017 06:53PM EDT Updated:May 02 2017 07:56PM EDT Related Stories 2 police officers shot in Back of the Yards Bicyclists run redlight, swerve to avoid being hit AP: Justice will not charge Baton Rouge officers PHOTOS: April and baby 'Tajiri' SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — As Apple's stash of cash grows, so does the possibility that the world's most valuable company will use some of the money for a huge acquisition that would expand its empire beyond iPhones and other gadgets. The company currently holds more than a quarter-trillion dollars it could use to go shopping. So far, the guessing game has primarily focused on possible targets such as Netflix and Tesla Motors. Either deal could make sense, given Apple's long-running interest in providing a TV service to consumers and its more recent work on self-driving cars . But in recent months the takeover talk has swirled around whether Apple might do something even more dramatic by making a bid for Walt Disney Co. THE MOUSE AND THE APPLE Such a combination would create the world's first company worth $1 trillion. Beyond that, an Apple-Disney marriage would unite some of the world's most successful brands in technology and entertainment — a list that includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac computer, Mickey Mouse, Disneyland, ESPN, Lucasfilm, Pixar and Marvel. "If there's a deal out there that would strike fear in the hearts of Silicon Valley and Hollywood, this could be it," RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a recent research report assessing the logic of an Apple-Disney combination. Apple doesn't discuss specific companies that it might buy, but it's exploring far and wide, according to Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri. "We are looking at every size of acquisition, so we will see how it goes going forward," Maestri told The Associated Press in a Tuesday interview. Disney hasn't given any inclination that it's looking for a buyer, but publicly held companies are required to consider all takeover offers. Buying Disney would be expensive. Daryanani estimates that Apple would have to pay $157 per share, or about $250 billion. TREASURE CHEST Apple is one of the few companies — if not the only one — that could pay that sum out of its pocket. The Cupertino, California, company ended March with nearly $257 billion in cash and marketable securities, according to numbers released Tuesday with Apple's earnings report for the January-March quarter. That's up from $233 billion a year ago, and the figure is expected to keep growing as Apple piles up more profits from the iPhone, iPad and Mac, as well as the applications and services that feed those devices. In its latest quarter, Apple's earnings climbed 5 percent to $11 billion while revenue also rose 5 percent to nearly $53 billion. In recent years, Apple has used a large chunk of its cash to provide its shareholders with extra income. The company disclosed plans on Tuesday to raise its quarterly dividend by more than 10 percent to 63 cents per share, marking the fifth increase in five years. Apple also has spent $151 billion buying back its own stock since 2012. Doing a mega-deal would be a major departure for Apple, whose largest acquisition to date was its $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014 that helped launch its music streaming service. THE SLOWING SMARTPHONE But Daryanani and other analysts believe Apple may need to make a pricier acquisition to lessen the company's dependence on the iPhone at a time when smartphone sales have been slowing. IPhone sales edged up 1 percent in Apple's latest quarter, extending a recovery from an unprecedented downturn last year. But many investors remain concerned that Apple has become too vulnerable to the ups and downs of the smartphone market, mostly because the company hasn't been able to come up with another hit product since the 2011 death of its co-founder and CEO, Steve Jobs. Apple's last big success, the iPad, came out in 2010, but sales of the tablet have been declining for more than three years. Meanwhile, the iPhone accounted for nearly two-thirds of Apple's revenue in the past quarter. The Trump administration may give Apple another reason to mull a major acquisition, given earlier promises to lower U.S. taxes on overseas corporate cash brought back to the U.S. Should that tax cut happen, Apple CEO Tim Cook has said the company will consider bringing back most of the more than $230 billion it now keeps in foreign countries, making it easier to finance a blockbuster deal in the U.S.   false false false false false false false false false Popular false false false Recent 2 police officers shot in Back of the Yards Bicyclists run redlight, swerve to avoid being hit Is Apple getting ready for a huge acquisition?

The Cupertino, Calif., tech giant sold 50.8 million iPhones in its fiscal second quarter ended April 1 — down from 51.2 million a year earlier, and missing Wall Street’s forecast of 52.3 million, according to FactSet. Apple’s stock tumbled 2.2 percent in extended trading Tuesday, despite the fact that the company’s iPhone revenue rose 1.2 percent, to $33.2 billion — a sign that Apple has had success selling pricier iPhones like the oversize Plus line. On a conference call with analysts, Cook griped that an endless barrage of leaks about the next iPhone — branded alternately by Apple watchers as the “iPhone 8” or the “iPhone X” — appear to have curbed sales of the current iPhone 7. “We are seeing a pause in purchases of the iPhone due to earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones,” he said. The new models, which will mark the iPhone’s 10th anniversary, are slated for release in September or October. Revenue from iPhones accounted for the bulk of Apple’s total sales of $52.9 billion, which represented a year-over-year increase of 5 percent but came in slightly below the $52.97 billion that Wall Street analysts were looking for. On the bright side, earnings per share of $2.10 beat the $2.02 expected by analysts, and marked a 10.5-percent gain from a year ago. Cook noted that revenue growth had accelerated from the previous quarter and cited “great customer response to both models of the new iPhone 7.” Nevertheless, Apple’s third-quarter revenue forecast of $43.5 billion to $45.5 billion fell slightly short of the Street’s $45.6 billion consensus. In all, Apple ended the quarter with $257 billion on its balance sheet, with 93 percent of that total residing overseas to avoid US corporate taxes. Apple’s second-largest product category, Mac computers, increased sales by 14.4 percent, to total $5.84 billion. Units sold rose 4.1 percent, to 4.2 million. Sales of iPads fell 11.9 percent, to $3.89 billion, while the 8.9 million units sold represented a 13-percent decline from the year-earlier quarter. Yet the product still managed to beat sales expectations of 8.6 million units. Apple’s services category, which includes the iPhone’s app store and Apple Music, contributed $7 billion to the corporate coffers — an 18 percent increase — to reinforce its position as the company’s second-most important category. In terms of geography, Apple’s revenue from the Americas and Europe was up in the double digits. Revenue from Greater China, however, plummeted 14 percent. Cook blamed a 5-percent currency devaluation for some of China’s weakness, and insisted Apple still had great hopes for the world’s most populous country. He also noted that seven of Apple’s Top 10 retail outlets in terms of traffic are located there.

AFP Apple also announced that its board of directors has authorized an addition $50 billion for dividends and buying back shares in the company, raising to $300 billion the total amount of cash to be spent in the program during the coming two years. Photo: Reuters San Francisco: Apple on Tuesday reported a rise in quarterly profits but its shares took a hit from slow-growing revenues and weaker iPhone sales ahead of a 10-year-anniversary model on the horizon. Apple said that its profit climbed 4.9% to slightly more than $11 billion on revenue rising 4.6% to $52.9 billion in the quarterly that ended 1 April. Shares of the California-based company were down nearly 2% to $144.65 in after-market trades that followed released of the earnings figures. “We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus,” Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in the earnings release. Cook said the company has seen “great” response to new iPhone 7 Red Special Edition models and is “thrilled with the strong momentum of our services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter.” Still, iPhone sales dipped slightly compared with a year ago to 50.8 million units, below most forecast for the key profit machine for Apple. During a conference call with analysts, Cook said Apple was seeing a “pause” in iPhone purchases that he felt was caused by unconfirmed “reports about future iPhones.” “That is clearly what is going on,” Cook said. Apple has annually unveiled new iPhone models during special events in September, with major innovations anticipated this year because it will mark the tenth anniversary of the debut of the world-changing mobile device. Still, the company contended that iPhone sales were better than it had expected, growing in four of its five top markets and skewing toward large-screen iPhone 7 models that have higher margins of profit. Apple also announced that its board of directors has authorized an addition $50 billion for dividends and buying back shares in the company, raising to $300 billion the total amount of cash to be spent in the program during the coming two years. While Apple has become the world’s most valuable company, analysts are looking at how the company is diversifying in the face of a saturated smartphone market and increasing competition. Tuesday’s report showed weaker sales of iPads and Mac computers. Apple also reported a 14% drop in revenues from a year earlier for “Greater China,” dropping the region behind Europe and the Americas in terms of sales. A strong US dollar facing off with weaker currencies were blamed for a strong “headwind” that pushed revenue down. Sales of Macintosh computers did well in China, with revenue up about 20%, and the company’s retail shops were attracting visitors in what it saw as a good signal for its business there. “We continued to believe there is an enormous opportunity there,” Cook said on mainland China. “In the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there.” Apple is also investing heavily in India, the third largest smartphone market in the world behind China and the US, according to Cook. Apple set a new March quarter revenue record in India, growing by double digits. “We’re very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country with its very large, young and tech savvy population, fast growing economy and improving 4G network infrastructure,” Cook said. Apple continued to tout growth of revenue from online services or digital content, which it boasted was on its way to be on scale with a Fortune 100 company in terms of revenue. For the second quarter in a row, revenue from Apple services topped $7 billion, the company reported. While not disclosing exact numbers, executives said Apple Watch sales double from the same quarter last year and touted it as the best selling smartwatch in the world. Sales of other products, which include AirPods wireless ear pieces and Apple Watch, posted a 31% increase in revenue over the prior year. Combining revenue from Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats headphone sales over the course of the last year would give Apple’s “wearables” offerings the scale of a Fortune 500 company, according to Cook. Apple’s cash holdings meanwhile rose to a record $256.8 billion, a figure that raises questions for how the company will manage its massive reserves.

Here’s Why It’s Not All Bad News Reuters May 02, 2017 Apple (aapl) sold fewer iPhones than expected in the first three months of the year, but that bare statistic hides an important bright spot for the company. The average selling price of an iPhone grew more than it has since the days of the iPhone 6. Apple does not break out figures for how many of each model it sells, but executives pointed to the premium-priced iPhone 7 Plus, which sells for up to $969 fully loaded, as the key to boosting the amount it gets on average for each phone. The average selling price of iPhones is important to Apple because the smartphone market is maturing and its growth slowing. Apple's ability to get more cash for each phone sold is critical to growing its profits. "One of the things that we did not get right was the mix between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus," Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told analysts on the company's earnings conference call on Tuesday, in response to a question about how supply of its top-end phone was constrained during the holiday shopping season. "The demand was much stronger for the 7 Plus than we had predicted, and so it took us a little while to adjust all the way back through the supply chain and to bring iPhone 7 Plus into balance, which occurred this past quarter." The popularity of the iPhone 7 Plus model represents a triumph for Apple with a new departure: packing a unique feature into its most expensive iPhone. The iPhone 6 Plus differed from its smaller sibling only in screen size, but the 7 Plus model has a physically different camera that enables what Apple calls "portrait mode" for taking shots with a blurred background - a feature more commonly found on large, expensive digital cameras. It is a strategy Apple could use again. Many analysts believe the company will reserve certain features for the premium-priced model of its next, eagerly awaited iPhone - such as a higher-quality display - that could sell for more than $1,000. So far, customers seem to be willing to pay more for the extra camera in the iPhone 7 Plus, which is one reason that Apple made slightly more revenue selling slightly fewer iPhones in the latest quarter than a year ago, for an average price of $656. That price was 2% higher than 12 months ago, the best improvement in a year. During 2016, selling prices even went into a decline, year on year, during the iPhone 6s cycle after soaring on the release of the original iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which introduced larger screens to the Apple lineup for the first time. "The important thing is the average selling price should not fall," said Anil Doradla, a research analyst with William Blair & Co. "I have full confidence that it won't. Apple just doesn't cut pricing to gain market share. It's not in their DNA."

Some details and diagrams do manage to slip through the cracks every now and then, but it’s undeniable that the company is imposing strict measures to keep new iPhones a secret until it’s time for them to be introduced to the world.  Just recently, NYU grad student Dejian Zeng detailed his experience when he did some undercover work in a Pegatron iPhone factory in Shanghai to get first-hand information on how Apple manufactures its iPhones. In the six weeks that Zeng worked in the facility, he’s learned one of the many things that interests many Apple fans and it’s how the tech giant keeps its new iPhones from leaking.  When Zeng worked at the Pegatron iPhone factory, Apple was in the process or transitioning from the iPhone 6s to the iPhone 7, according to Business Insider. Hence, he had the privilege to know what it was like when Apple switches from a current model to an upcoming one. In his statement, Zeng revealed that when he and the workers were producing the iPhone 6s, Apple was already working on some facilities and infrastructure for the assembly line of the 2016 iPhone. Unfortunately, they initially did not have a means of seeing what these facilities were since they were blocked by a “big curtain.” READ: Tim Cook blames reports and rumors for “pause” in iPhone sales  Zeng said that they only had seen the assembly line producing the iPhone 7 handsets when they were moved back to the factory after being assigned to work in another sub-factory building for a while. Apart from the “big curtain” that Zeng mentioned earlier, he revealed that Apple also imposed a strict rule about metals. Workers were instructed to leave their phones, keys and all their metals in their assigned locker room.  The Apple workers were also subjected to a facial recognition technology and a metal detector whenever they entered the facility. This is on top of the cards they need to swipe just to get access to the locker room. Zeng also disclosed that when it was time for Apple to assemble the iPhone 7, the company increased both the number and the sensitivity levels of he metal detectors in the factories. So how strict is Apple’s system? Zeng said it’s very strict to cause female employees to go back and change if their bras were found to contain metals. Also, it’s quite strict that any kind of metal is not allowed in factories, so it was impossible to sneak in cameras. Managers who have the privilege of bringing their phones with them were also asked to prove that what they were using were not any of the newly manufactured iPhones. This is done by instructing the managers to turn on the screen of their device after going through the metal detectors.  The factory also has cameras to monitor the activities of the workers and to ensure that no one in the workshop is trying to carry prototypes outside of the facility. Those who did get caught for attempting to smuggle the new iPhones were right away sent to the police. Having learned of all these, Ubergizmo considers the level of security in Apple’s manufacturing facilities as “pretty scary.” However, it seems this isn’t the case for some workers at all because many things about the new iPhones have already been leaked online. In fact, the hardware specs and features of the iPhone 8 that’s expected to launch this September have already been outed by several leaks. Apple’s method of preventing iPhone prototypes from leaking has been revealed.

The quarter ending 1 April saw no new flagship iPhones, though there was a refreshed iPhone SE and a special edition red model. But Apple usually sees a decline from Q1 to Q2. And the results are better than the year-ago Q2, which saw profit of US$1.90 per share on US$50.6 billion in revenue. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company saw “continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus” and “strong momentum of our services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter.” Well, it wouldn’t be an Apple earnings report if some record wasn’t shattered, right? Apple’s profits beat analyst expectations on profit but missed slightly on revenue and iPhone sales, for those who care about that sort of thing. Some things to note before Apple’s Q2 earnings call, which will shed more light on its overall OK quarter: Sales in Europe and China were down year-over-year, but the Americas, Japan and rest of the Asia Pacific were up. Expect to hear more about China from Tim Cook and Co. on the call. Apple sold fewer iPhones in Q2 than Q1, as always, but also sold fewer phones than in Q2 of 2016. However, the company made more money off the iPhones it did sell this quarter over last – US$33.25 billion vs. US$32.86 billion, to be precise. That indicates that perhaps people are choosing the more expensive 7 Plus when they upgrade. Somewhat surprisingly, the Mac saw an upswing in Q2. Apple sold 4.2 million Macs, up from four percent year-over-year. iPad sales were down 13 percent, but revenue from other products (which includes the Apple Watch) was up 31 percent. As Cook said (and has said time and time again), services remain a bright spot for the company as it moves to diversify its revenue sources. In the March quarter, Apple made more than US$7 billion from services (which includes Apple Pay, AppleCare, Apple Music, the iTunes Store, etc., etc., etc.). That’s up from just shy of $6 billion a year ago. Adding a billion dollars to a business in one year isn’t bad, though analysts had expected Apple to hit US$7.06 billion. Basically, Apple is disappointing Wall Street, as always. But it’s still a very valuable company, and its market cap on Tuesday hit US$776.59 billion. The company is also sitting on more $250 billion in cash.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Google Maps and Amazon discontinue Apple Watch apps, but that’s not a bad thing Caitlin McGarry 3 May, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News Google, Amazon, and eBay have left the Apple Watch App Store in recent weeks, as have Target and TripAdvisor. While this could be a sign that the developers consider the watch a failed platform, there might be more to the story. The disappearing apps, spotted by AppleInsider, were, frankly, not that great. Google’s Maps app was a half-hearted attempt at providing directions on your wrist and no match for Apple’s native Maps app (though perhaps that’s an unfair comparison, given that the watch is such a new platform and Apple obviously knows its use cases best). Google said on Tuesday it is actually revamping its Maps app and plans to stage a comeback with a future iOS update, which makes sense. App developers rushed to push out Apple Watch apps before they figured out what the watch was best for. Notifications, fitness and messaging? Yes. Shopping and social networking? Not so much. Of the major apps that have vanished from the watch App Store, eBay’s app was the most useful. Its main function was sending alerts about bids on auction items. Anyone who’s lost out on an auction after looking away for a few minutes knows that a buzz on the wrist could’ve been helpful. Why this matters: As a platform, the Apple Watch has improved by leaps and bounds since the device launched two years ago. But app developers are learning that the wrist is not the best place for many, many services. Hopefully major players like Amazon and Google are rethinking their watch strategy and will return with apps you’ll actually want to use. Update: TripAdvisor may also be back on the Apple Watch at some point. A company spokesperson told Macworld that TripAdvisor pulled its watch app in February, but added: “We believe in the Apple Watch as a platform and intend to continue to explore how wearables can help travellers throughout their planning and in destination experiences.” Related Tags:  Share: Comments Related Posts Random Posts Fishman TriplePlay Apple’s iPad trademark continues in China as Proview avoids liquidation One more thing… What to do with your old Apple gear iOS 8 changes we’d like to see: The OS and Home screen Dodgy USB-C cable fries vigilante engineer’s $1000 laptop Leave a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Apple has won a battle in India but it has yet to win the war Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession The Next Billion 5 hours ago Quartz india India's a good Apple. (AP Photo/Tsering Topgyal) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession The Next Billion 5 hours ago Quartz india Apple is dreaming big in India. On the the heels of announcing a new development center in the country, Apple reported in an earnings call on May 02 that in the past quarter, revenue in India was 20% higher than the same period a year earlier. “We have a ton of energy going into the country on a number of fronts,” said chief executive Tim Cook. Thanks to the growth of India’s 4G infrastructure, as well the country’s young and tech-savvy population, “there is a huge opportunity for Apple there,” Cook says. In the past year or so, Apple has scored a series of wins in India: In 2016, it reached a major landmark: 2.5 million iPhones sold in one calendar year in India. Apple sales in India got an unlikely boost from demonetization in November. The company has long wanted to produce hardware in India, and finally made headway on the issue: Apple is expected to start producing (paywall) the iPhone 6, iPhone 6S, and iPhone SE out of a Bengaluru factory run by the Taiwanese manufacturer Wistron, and it has secured permission to set up a distribution center on the outskirts of Mumbai. But there’s still a lot of ground for Apple to cover in India. “We agree that we are under-penetrated,” Cook said on the May 02 call. “They’re moving at a speed that I have not seen in any other country in the world once they were started. And it is truly impressive.” Catching up will be a challenge for Apple. The company has sought concessions to the regulation mandating companies retailing in India to source at least 30% of their parts locally. But those have not been granted, commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman told the Rajya Sabha (the Council of States, one of two houses of parliament in India). Apple had earlier sought and failed to secure permission to sell refurbished second-hand devices. (The government was concerned that they would dump used goods and add to India’s spiraling e-waste problem.) In India, Apple’s latest handsets cost upwards of $1,000—well above the $158 average smartphone price in the country. That’s led its market share to slip to a measly 2%, falling far behind Android devices. Recently, Apple resurrected the iPhone 6 at a lower price but in a market littered with stiff competition from Chinese phones, it is struggling to make a real dent.

Set to carry the tagline “It was all a dream…,” the film is said to center on the life and work of 47-year old American rapper – Sean John Combs (perhaps better known under international alters: Puff Daddy or ‘Diddy’), as Billboard explains that the doc will see the Bad Boy, Interscope, Uptown-signed R&B star partner with “two of most powerful music business entities on the planet” in order to distribute the film. Those being Live Nation and (of course) Apple Music. “While exact terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, Apple Music will have exclusive rights to the doc for at least the next year,” the music publication reports, citing that the win will mark just another of the company’s planned streaming incentives to get both new subscribers onboard, and existing ones to keep paying … […] [The plans include] a deal with James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke” franchise, Dr. Dre’s “Vital Signs, ” a semi-autobiographical scripted series as well as “Planet of the Apps,” a show with the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow, Gary Vaynerchuk, Jessica Alba, and will.i.am offering mentorship to app developers […] It’s not yet clear if after this initial period Apple will lose exclusivity over the movie, or whether, like Taylor Swift’s popular The 1989 World Tour concert film released at the back end of 2015, the company will keep perpetual rights.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print Apple has done something remarkable. Five years after first claiming the @Apple handle on Twitter, the company has finally shown the account some love. Twitter/CNNMoney Enlarge Apple's iPhone sales declined again. Today, Apple reported that it sold 50.8 million iPhones in the most recent quarter, down from 51.2 million units sold in the same quarter a year earlier. The surprise sales decline pushed down Apple's stock 1.5% in after hours trading. A year ago, Apple reported its first ever decline in iPhone sales. The iPhone slump continued in the following two quarters, which led to Apple's first annual sales decline since 2001. Apple managed to break its losing streak in the December quarter thanks to strong demand for the iPhone 7 Plus. But that reversal proved to be short lived. Apple's overall sales for the March quarter rose to $52.9 million from $50.6 billion a year earlier. But the slight dip in iPhone demand is nonetheless a red flag. Ahead of the earnings, some analysts suggested users would hold off on purchasing new iPhones ahead of a big refresh expected later this year. "It appears Apple users are holding off upgrading but not necessarily leaving the ecosystem," Steven Milunovich, an analyst with UBS, wrote in an investor note this week. "Investors need faith that users are waiting rather than switching." Wall Street has been focused on pent up demand for the next iPhone, which will mark the smartphone's tenth anniversary. For three years, the iPhone's exterior design has remained mostly unchanged, cutting into the demand for upgrades. However, the next iPhone model is rumored to have everything from wireless charging to a curved screen and a glass design. Apple's stock has soared to new highs in recent months on optimism for the next iPhone. The company's market cap was closing in on the $800 billion mark for the first time before the earnings report today. Click to comment Guidelines: Please keep your comments smart and civil.

And in an escalation of tit-for-tat "Australians first" migration policies, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten will accuse the Turnbull government of announcing "little more than a con job" when it announced the abolition of the 457 visa program last month.

More videos 457 visas: PM's Australia-first rhetoric The decision to abolish 457 temporary work visas is presented by Malcolm Turnbull as putting the interests of Australians first. The suite of prospective policy changes also include a promise that Labor in government will not sign another free trade agreement that allows local labour market testing to be waived, as the South Korean, Japanese and Chinese deals do. They will be unveiled by Mr Shorten in a pre-budget address to the McKell Institute in Sydney on Wednesday. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Bill Shorten is set to announce Labor's plans for skilled migration visas. Photo: Andrew Meares Labor was heavily critical of the Turnbull government's new visa policies, which included the abolition of the 457 visa and creation of two new temporary skills shortage visas, tougher English language tests, stricter labour market testing, at least two years of work experience and a mandatory police check. It argued the changes were window dressing, did not go far enough on labour market testing and also caused problems for universities and the advanced technology sector, by making it too hard to bring highly educated professionals to Australia. Advertisement The policies outlined by Labor on Wednesday follow the government's package of measures, some of which will need to pass parliament, and underscore the fact that both major parties have shifted to a more strident, nationalist position on immigration in recent months. "With underemployment at record highs and young people across the country struggling to find work, too many employers are turning to temporary work visas to undercut local jobs, wages and conditions. It's time to change the system so locals get the first shot at local jobs," Mr Shorten will say. Draw It Yourself: See the full interactive quiz about how the economy has performed under the Coalition. Under the changes, fees for temporary skilled migrant visas will increase to 3 per cent of the Temporary Skilled Migration Income Threshold, which is currently $53,900. That means, in practice, visa fees for temporary skilled migrants would rise to $1617 per year, $3234 for two years or $6468 for four years. In comparison, the Turnbull government's planned visa fee hikes will see fees for the new two-year visa set at $1150, or $575 per year, and  $2400 for the new four-year visa. "This is a strong price signal to employers that they should be looking for local workers first. Under Labor, putting local workers first won't just be fairer – it will be cheaper," Mr Shorten will say. The money raised from the fee hike will establish the "SkillUP Training Fund" to be used to fund Labor's agenda in skills and training. The Turnbull government has also promised a greater focus on skills training as part of its new visa plans. The so-called "SMART" visa, designed for highly-skilled workers in the Science, Medicine, Academia, Research and Technology sector, is designed to help ensure "universities, research institutes, medical, scientific and advanced technology industries and companies and public research agencies to bring the best and brightest here". "The current surge in anti-intellectual, anti-scientific sentiment in great research nations offers Australia a unique opportunity to attract the world's finest minds. That's why Labor will introduce a new, four-year visa, with appropriate salary safeguards." A new, independent Australian Skills Authority will take charge of labour market testing and create a single skills shortage occupations list, while the current Ministerial Advisory Committee on Skilled Migration be abolished.

Apple Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | May 2, 2017 1 shares 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0               Last year, when Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, they also took the wraps off a couple of new colors. New-ish colors is probably the better way to put it. The standard Black variant, with its matte finish, looks a lot more like Apple's Space Gray gradient, but apparently they didn't want to carry that over to the iPhone lineup. The real stand-out new addition was Jet Black, which was glossy and prone to fingerprints, but a welcomed new member of the iPhone family. The other colors: Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold, have been around for awhile now. Rose Gold was the latest new addition, but at this point, considering that color scheme has found its way to other Apple products, including the MacBook, it's hard to argue that it isn't sticking around. So we had five different color options to choose from. And now we've got six. Earlier this year, Apple announced the (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. I wrote up an article about how I wish Apple would branch out in the color options and maybe give me a blue iPhone some day, but I'm not holding my breath on that one (even if the rumor mill got me excited once upon a time). Companies launching a new color scheme well after the initial launch of their phone isn't new. We've seen it time and time again. And while Apple isn't completely immune to it, they've at least done a better job of releasing all of their phones and color options at the same time. This year was different, and they certainly made a mark with the eye-catching red. And the red iPhone is really, really red. I know plenty of fans of the new color, and for good reason. It stands out, and it's different. Especially for an iPhone. But I'm not a fan of the white front at all. I spent some time with it, and I just prefer a dark front, especially when I watch so much stuff on my phone as I do. Earlier today, Apple's CEO Tim Cook said the company saw plenty of positive feedback and adoption of the (PRODUCT)RED lineup after its debut. We don't (and won't) know how many Apple sold, but I have no doubt that it's gone over well enough. At least, as far as a variant can be after the initial phone launch happened months and months before. And that's my question for you tonight. Did you buy a red iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus? Do you know anyone who did? And if you, or they pulled the trigger on one, did you get rid of a different variant of the iPhone 7 to pick it up? Or did you skip the red option because you already have an iPhone 7 and you didn't see a reason to make the lateral trade, just for a new color? Let me know!

The effect of iPhone 8 rumors? By Alex Eule May 2, 2017 6:20 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple sold fewer iPhones than expected in its latest quarter. Illustration: Getty Images You’d think by now investors would be used to the cycle: Rumors about the next iPhone heat up and consumers hold off on making big phone purchases. But Wall Street continues to underestimate the power of wanting the next big thing. The latest example came this afternoon. More from Barron’s Next Apple’s MacBook Trouble is a Cautionary Tale Apple Makes an Uncharacteristic Move Why a T-Mobile Deal Could Happen Soon Apple shares are down 2.2% in after-hours trading after the company reported a generally unremarkable quarter after the market closed on Tuesday. What bothered investors was the latest news on iPhone sales and a projection of what’s to come. iPhone shipments in the first three months of the year were 50.8 million, below Wall Street’s estimates. The company’s forecast for the current quarter also disappointed, with Apple projecting sales of $43.5 billion to $45.5. Wall Street had been expecting $45.6 billion. With all the talk of the iPhone 8 and the anticipated new features, it’s really little surprise that the numbers look soft. The more exciting the rumors get, the less enticing the current models seem. Big Picture: Apple might be giving up some sales today because of the big hopes for what’s to come.

Under pressure from shareholders to hand over more of its US$250 billion-plus (RM1.08 trillion) hoard of cash and investments, Apple boosted its capital return programme by US$50 billion, increased its share repurchase authorisation by US$35 billion and raised its quarterly dividend by 10.5 per cent. Investors were unmoved, sending shares of the world's most valuable listed company down 1.9 per cent at US$144.65 in after-hours trading. Apple sold 50.76 million iPhones in its fiscal second quarter ended April 1, down from 51.19 million a year earlier. Analysts on average had estimated iPhone sales of 52.27 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri argued the decline was not as bad as it looked, given the peculiarities of how phone sales are calculated. The company reports what are called “sell-in” figures for the iPhone, a measure of how many units it sells to retailers, rather than “sell-through” figures, which measure how many phones are actually sold to consumers. Maestri said the company reduced the volume of inventory going through its retail channel by about 1.2 million units in the quarter, meaning the company sold about 52 million phones to customers on a sell-through basis. Despite the dip in unit sales, iPhone revenues rose 1.2 per cent in the quarter, helped by a higher average selling price. 10th anniversay Expectations are building ahead of Apple's 10th-anniversary iPhone range this fall, with investors hoping that the launch would help bolster sales. Apple typically launches its new iPhones in September. A big jump in sales usually follows in the holiday quarter, before demand tapers over the next few quarters as customers hold back ahead of the next launch. Apple's 10th-anniversary iPhone range might sport features such as wireless charging, 3-D facial recognition and a curved display. “There is a general softening in phone demand to contend with as well as expectations of a big upgrade, all of which softens the blow of this quarter's miss,” said James McQuivey, a Forrester Research analyst. “If we see Apple downplaying expectations before the next upgrade cycle, it might mean that the company isn't confident it will beat those expectations.” The company forecast total revenue of between US$43.5 billion and US$45.5 billion for the current quarter, while analysts on average were expecting US$45.60 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts on average expect the company to sell 42.31 million iPhones in the current quarter, according to FactSet. For the second quarter, the company's net income rose to US$11.03 billion, or US$2.10 per share, compared with US$10.52 billion, or US$1.90 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected US$2.02 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 4.6 per cent to US$52.90 billion in the quarter, compared with analysts' average estimate of US$53.02 billion. A 17.5 per cent jump in the company's services business — which includes the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud — to US$7.04 billion, boosted revenue. “We are particularly encouraged by the fact that service revenue is nowhere near as cyclical as product revenue,” Neil Saunders, Managing Director of GlobalData Retail, wrote in a note to clients. Apple's revenue from the Greater China region fell 14.1 per cent to US$10.73 billion in the quarter, as cheaper rivals in the region chipped away at sales. Maestri said that sales of Macs and the company's services were strong in China during the March quarter. “The performance we’re seeing in China should get better going forward this year,” he said. Apple's gross margin hit 38.9 per cent, slightly ahead of analysts' average expectation of 38.7 per cent, despite higher prices for memory chips. The company said it expects gross margins next quarter between 37.5 per cent and 38.5 per cent, versus analysts' expectation of 38.3 per cent, according to FactSet. “NAND and DRAM (memory chips) are under pressure right now in terms of some price pressure. We saw that in the March quarter and expect that to continue into the June quarter, but for all the other commodities, we see prices declining,” Maestri said. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Ringgit extends gains against US dollar at opening Apple posts surprise dip in iPhone sales, shares fall (VIDEO) Service workers' union calls for probe on McDonald's rent policies Asia stocks ride global momentum, US dollar up on rate hike bets Oil rebounds on US stocks drawdown, declining Opec compliance weighs Saudis, oil majors discuss gas investments ahead of giant IPO Petronas Dagangan registers record profit in 34 years KL’s largest urban entertainment, F&B and retail hub to be ready by 2018 Standard Chartered rolls out 20-week maternity leave in Malaysia Why are global players chasing Proton?

Apple passed a new milestone Tuesday — reporting more than $256 billion in cash and marketable securities. That’s a lot of iPhones and iPads, but perhaps more notably, it’s more cash than fellow tech giants Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet and Amazon combined. Apple’s Tim Cook, left, and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos during a gathering of tech execs at Microsoft to greet Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2015. (GeekWire File Photo) The growing cash pile shows just how much of a financial juggernaut Apple remains, even as sales of its flagship iPhones and iPads slipped in the most recent quarter. GeekWire’s chart above provides a snapshot of revenues, profits and cash balances among those four companies as of the end of the first calendar quarter. In the cash rankings, Microsoft is second among those four companies, with $126 billion in cash and equivalents. Alphabet, the Google parent, has $92 billion in cash, and Amazon comes in at $22 billion among the four. (We should note that these companies are selected by us for purposes of illustration. This isn’t meant to be a comprehensive ranking of tech cash holdings. See this Moody’s data from last year for a more comprehensive ranking of corporate cash holdings.) Facebook, which reports first-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, had $29.45 billion in cash, equivalents and marketable securities in its year-end report. Apple extended its plan to return capital to shareholders by an extra $50 billion as part of its earnings announcement, through dividends and share buybacks. However, the company faces pressure from some shareholders to put the cash to use for something more aggressive, such as blockbuster acquisitions to fuel the future of its business. Along those lines, the Wall Street Journal is having fun imagining the possibilities for all that money, with this interactive graphic showing how many companies someone could buy outright with Apple’s cash. Personally, I’ll take Snapchat, Uber, Twitter, and Netflix, and pocket the remaining $14.8 billion for a rainy day.

Rod ChesterNews Corp Australia Network May 3, 201710:54am Video Image Iphone 8 Rumours1:10 Rumours are ramping up over the much anticipated iPhone 8. Only time will tell how many of them will come true. February 23rd 2017 2 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Apple CEO Tim Cook admits the hype around the iPhone 8 is slowing sales of current models. Picture: AP APPLE CEO Tim Cook has admitted he’s got a problem: the hype about the future of the iPhone is hurting iPhone sales right now. Apple today released the results for the quarter ending April 1, with sales of iPhone taking a surprising downturn despite optimistic Wall St expectations. Apple sold 50.76 million iPhones in the quarter, down from 51.19 million in the previous year and short of the 51.5 million expected. While that is not much of a drop, it was enough for the Apple share price to fall 1 per cent in after-hours trading. A leaked image of the iPhone 8 sent the internet into a frenzy. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied RELATED: Leaked schematic of iPhone 8 reveals big switch in Apple’s design “We’re seeing what we believe to be a pause in purchases of iPhone which we believe are due to the earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones,” Cook said. With the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, Apple is expected to radically update its smartphone later this year and there has been a steady diet of leaks with conflicting reports about how Apple will change the form and function of the iPhone, including 3D facial recognication and a curved display. While the Apple boss believes the fevered hype around Apple’s forthcoming device is having a chilling effect on sales, reports suggest the iPhone 8 is facing delay issues that could dramatically push back its release. This past week, analysts from Deutsche Bank produced a report in which they speculated that due to issues with suppliers, the iPhone 8 won’t be ready for release before the end of the calendar year. They believe we could be stuck waiting for the OLED-screened phone until 2018. The Samsung Galaxy S8 is sure to give the iPhone a run for its money. Picture: AFPSource:AFP Today’s sales figures shows just how reliant Apple is on the iPhone. Analyst Jan Dawson said in the past five years, the iPhone has gone from being half of Apple’s revenue to two thirds, while iPad and Macs have dropped from 36 per cent to 19 per cent. Apple still is yet to give details on the sales of Apple Watch, although Apple CEO Tim Cook said the sales of Apple Watch have doubled in the past year. Cook said if you were to take the revenue from Apple Watch, Beats headphones and AirPods then it would equate to the size of a Fortune 500 company. Likewise, Cook equated Apple Services — which includes Apple Music and iCloud subscriptions — as being the size of a Fortune 100 company with more than $9.3 billion in revenue. Tale of two businesses at Apple – Services and iPad trends very different pic.twitter.com/H5vBr8EiMx— Jan Dawson (@jandawson) May 2, 2017 The plight of the iPad continues to be grim, with sales falling for another quarter down to 8.9 million units, which is a drop in a year in unit sales of 13 per cent and 12 per cent in revenue. To find a quarter where the iPad has achieved such a low result, you have to go back to the first year of iPad sales back in 2011. Several times in the briefing after the results were posted, Cook talked of the challenge in finding the right balance in meeting demand. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the future of the iPhone is hurting sales. Picture: AFP/GettySource:AFP He said Apple was still not able to meet demand for the wireless AirPods, which this week scored the highest ever customer satisfaction rating for an Apple product, and he said Apple had got it wrong in underestimating demand for the iPhone 7 Plus, the first iPhone with a dual lens camera. Having two products be more popular than expected is not the only issue Cook faces. There is also the issue of what to do with Apple’s enormous cash reserve which now is $340 billion. Other key points from today’s results are: • App store revenue grew 40 per cent in the past year. • Apple Mac sales, despite the relaunched MacBook Pro, only grew by 4 per cent. • Apple plans to double the size of its service business by 2020.

Apple Inc sold fewer iPhones than expected in the first three months of the year, but that bare statistic hides an important bright spot for the company. The average selling price of an iPhone grew more than it has since the days of the iPhone 6. Apple does not break out figures for how many of each model it sells, but executives pointed to the premium-priced iPhone 7 Plus, which sells for up to $969 fully loaded, as the key to boosting the amount it gets on average for each phone. The average selling price of iPhones is important to Apple because the smartphone market is maturing and its growth slowing. Apple's ability to get more cash for each phone sold is critical to growing its profits. "One of the things that we did not get right was the mix between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus," Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told analysts on the company's earnings conference call on Tuesday, in response to a question about how supply of its top-end phone was constrained during the holiday shopping season. "The demand was much stronger for the 7 Plus than we had predicted, and so it took us a little while to adjust all the way back through the supply chain and to bring iPhone 7 Plus into balance, which occurred this past quarter." The popularity of the iPhone 7 Plus model represents a triumph for Apple with a new departure: packing a unique feature into its most expensive iPhone. The iPhone 6 Plus differed from its smaller sibling only in screen size, but the 7 Plus model has a physically different camera that enables what Apple calls "portrait mode" for taking shots with a blurred background - a feature more commonly found on large, expensive digital cameras. It is a strategy Apple could use again. Many analysts believe the company will reserve certain features for the premium-priced model of its next, eagerly awaited iPhone - such as a higher-quality display - that could sell for more than $1,000. So far, customers seem to be willing to pay more for the extra camera in the iPhone 7 Plus, which is one reason that Apple made slightly more revenue selling slightly fewer iPhones in the latest quarter than a year ago, for an average price of $656. That price was 2 percent higher than 12 months ago, the best improvement in a year. During 2016, selling prices even went into a decline, year on year, during the iPhone 6s cycle after soaring on the release of the original iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which introduced larger screens to the Apple lineup for the first time. "The important thing is the average selling price should not fall," said Anil Doradla, a research analyst with William Blair & Co. "I have full confidence that it won't. Apple just doesn't cut pricing to gain market share. It's not in their DNA."

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Some Major iPhone Apps Have Dropped Support For The Apple Watch By Ali Salman 7 hours ago 11Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple Watch is a very capable device in terms of both internals and design. While some would question the usability of the wearable, others would gladly accept it as a complementary product to go with their iPhone. One of the best features of the wearable is its support for third-party apps. These apps allow users to make use of basic functionality without taking the iPhone out of their pocket. With that said and done, some major apps have ditched support for the Apple Watch. So let’s see some more details on which apps have removed watchOS support and why. Major Apps Dropping Support For The Apple Watch? Previously, Google Maps, Amazon and eBay featured support for the Apple Watch, who released an Apple Watch app after it first debuted in April of 2015. As first noted by AppleInsider all three of these companies have removed support for the wearable – silently removing the functionality through App Store updates. It is not clear when did the companies dropped their respective Apple Watch support. Related Instant Games On Facebook Messenger Is Expanding Globally With New Features So what became a reason to this? Why did these three major apps dropped support for the Apple Watch? It could be possible that the companies decided to remove support for the wearable due to the fact that there were not many users using the app. Nonetheless, the support has been eliminated and we’re  not sure for how long will they remain this way or will they ever come back or not. However Google spokesperson on Twitter revealed that they removed support for the Apple Watch in the latest iOS release. Moreover, it also asks users to expect the support again in the future. Henceforth, the search engine giant will add the support again as it seems it has been temporarily removed. Nonetheless, it’s still not known why the company decided to opt for this.

However, its functionality is still available through the dedicated Cartwheel by Target app. What’s worth noting is that nearly all of the apps which have removed support are online retailers. It could be true that their wearable support did not pan out as much users as expected. Apple’s wearable has been with us for more than 2 years now and it’s getting clear what sort of apps are available and suited for a wearable. Nonetheless, there will probably be more to the story, so be sure to stay tuned in for that. This is it for now, folks.

Mark GurmanDina Bass Microsoft set out to make a laptop with better-than-average battery life because students said they wanted a device that would last through a long day of classes. Photo: Bloomberg San Francisco/Seattle: Microsoft has already cracked the professional and creative markets with inventive tablets and a desktop that turns into a virtual drafting table. Now it’s chasing another category many believe is Apple’s to lose: the $1,000 laptop for everyone. Microsoft Corp., a company once derided for buggy software, unstable hardware and indifferent design, debuted the Surface Laptop on Tuesday. The machine boots up in seconds, has a touch screen and gets a claimed 14 hours of battery life (two better than Apple’s MacBook Air). Weighing in at 2.76 pounds, about a quarter-pound less than the Air, the Surface Laptop boasts a 13.5-inch screen and is one of the thinnest and lightest products in its class. Microsoft is targeting the education market—and even threw laptops inside backpacks stuffed with textbooks, notepads and keys to simulate college-kid wear-and-tear. Yet the Surface Laptop’s affordable price, portability and features could appeal to a far broader audience—including Mac loyalists. ALSO READ : Microsoft launches $999 laptop in hardware push to college students During a tour at Microsoft’s sprawling Redmond, Washington, headquarters last month, the Surface team showed off the machine’s evolution, starting from the first prototype—little more than a mashup of parts from older Microsoft devices—to the finished product. The engineers and designers spent two years working on the machine, creating multiple prototypes and inviting partners like Intel to set up shop right on campus. The team’s pride was evident. After years of struggling to crack the hardware market, they were finally building products they themselves would use. “This product is a reflection of our learnings since we started this team,” said Panos Panay, who oversees Surface-brand hardware and has been around long enough to have experienced first-hand the early flops and later successes. Microsoft set out to make a laptop with better-than-average battery life because students said they wanted a device that would last through a long day of classes. The trick was to design a machine with a bigger battery that was still slim and light. Panay’s team adhered to a “fail-fast” philosophy that emphasized constant experimentation. Fancy prototyping machines were capable of spitting out mockups 24 hours a day; the prototypes were delivered to individual designers, allowing them to constantly refine the design. Working with Intel, the team shrank the motherboard, the circuit board containing a computer’s main components, to provide space for the bigger battery. Intel also helped Microsoft make the machine run cooler. In an effort to make the surface around the keyboard more pleasing to the eye and touch, designers used Alcantara, a synthetic microfibre that’s more durable than the suede it mimics. The team brought in dozens of giant rolls of fabric and spent six months choosing colours, from a dark burgundy to a platinum hue. Microsoft already uses Alcantara in the covers of its tablets, but that didn’t stop the team from taking a field trip to a BMW dealership to see how the material worked as upholstery. Microsoft chose Alcantara, Panay said, because “it gets rid of that cold, sterile feeling.” The designers couldn’t poke holes in the Alcantara for the speakers so they figured out a way to transmit sound via gaps in the keyboard. The audio was tested in one of many “anechoic” chambers, rooms that don’t let sound in or out. The finished laptop, milled from a slab of custom aluminum alloy, has no screws or holes, save for a pair of microphones to converse with Cortana, Microsoft’s voice assistant. With its hardware and software teams working together, Microsoft created a new version of its operating system, called Windows 10 S, that’s tailored to the laptop. Terry Myerson, who runs both groups, said inspiration for the “S” came from the auto industry, which often uses the letter to flag sporty, high-performance models. The new OS is designed to prevent the computer from slowing down over time and remaining predictable even if under assault from malware—a selling point long touted by Apple’s iOS. (Other manufacturers will install Windows 10 S into their own machines, giving Microsoft a way to compete with cheap machines running Google’s Chrome OS.) Pushing the education market theme, Panay said the Surface Laptop will be “same on commencement day as it is on graduation day.” (Users can still install Windows 10 Pro over Windows 10 S, but they won’t be able to switch back.) The OS also runs only apps offered on Microsoft’s app store. “Everything that runs on this device is going to be trusted and verified by Microsoft,” Myerson said. Panay said the new OS unlocks performance and features not found on many Windows-based machines. The laptop wakes from sleep almost instantly when the lid is opened, and takes seconds to turn on from a fully powered-off state. The slick computer, which will be available 15 June, arrives at an auspicious moment for Microsoft. The company is riding the success of its Surface Studio and Surface tablets (though sales slipped in the most recent quarter, dragging down total revenue). Meanwhile, Apple has come under fire from Mac owners for focusing on the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch—and letting the Mac lineup languish. The Air hasn’t had a serious makeover since 2010, just a modest upgrade two years ago. Stung by the criticism from the disgruntled faithful, Apple has pledged to do better. Panay said Microsoft has made its own luck, saying his team “created what we know our customers are asking for.” Of course, luring Mac devotees will take some doing because Apple’s OS syncs almost flawlessly with the iPhone, making it a snap to transfer photos, send and receive text messages and make online payments from a Mac. Users will lose that ability if they switch to the Surface Laptop. And despite the impressive hardware, people are used to the Mac interface, another sticking point. Finally, students may balk at paying almost $1,000 when they can get an adequate laptop for much less. Pete Kyriacou, who helps manage the devices team, is sanguine about the challenges facing Microsoft’s first real laptop. “In the end,” he said, “it’s going to appeal to everyone.” Bloomberg Mark GurmanDina Bass Topics: Microsoft Laptop Surface Laptop college students Apple More From Livemint READ MORE Flipkart Summer Shopping Days Sale is all about genuine discounts Test of US defence against North Korea missiles set this month SAT admits Reliance Industries’ plea against Sebi ban First Published: Tue, May 02 2017. 11 05 PM IST Editor's Picks SoftBank takes Snapdeal closer to Flipkart sale but yet to seal terms Madhya Pradesh decides to change to January-December fiscal year Infosys to hire 10,000 US workers after Donald Trump targets H1B visas Latest News Flipkart Summer Shopping Days Sale is all about genuine discounts Test of US defence against North Korea missiles set this month SAT admits Reliance Industries’ plea against Sebi ban Populism is great for stock buyers ‘Baahubali 2’ dominates cinemas in April Mint On Sunday The private lives of Delhi’s LGBT youth Getting Justin Bieber to India is very, very hard work 2003 World Cup final: If only India had chosen to bat first...

This Weekend Only! Apple Launches ‘Treat Yourself Tuesday’ in Select Markets Leaked iPhone 8 Schematic From “Unknown Source” Proliferates Web Apple Apple Announces Q2, 2017 Earnings Results [PR] By Arron Hirst 6 hours ago Share Tweet As expected, Apple on Tuesday revealed its earnings results for the second quarter of FY2017 – and with it came the announcement of its Capital Return Program expanding to $300 Billion. Covering the company’s combined earnings for the second quarter of the year, (which ended on April 1, 2017), Apple posted quarterly revenue of $52.9 billion and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $2.10. Comparing these results to the year-ago quarter, in which the firm posted revenue of $50.6 billion and earnings per diluted share of $1.90, and we can see that the company experienced revenue growth to the tune of roughly $2.3 billion. Alongside this, international sales accounted for 65 percent of the quarter’s revenue. “We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’ve seen great customer response to both models of the new iPhone 7 (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition and we’re thrilled with the strong momentum of our Services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter. Looking ahead, we are excited to welcome attendees from around the world to our annual Worldwide Developers Conference next month in San Jose,” he added. The company’s slight boost in YoY quarterly revenue follows the Californian company posting its first year-over-year revenue decline – back in October. In terms of sales the company reported 50.76 million iPhone units had been sold during the quarter, with 8.9 million iPads and 4.1 million Mac units having also left store shelves. Meanwhile, doomsayers of the Apple Watch and AirPods may be dismayed to hear that the two products together now represent the “size of [a] Fortune 500 company,” according to Apple, with Apple Watch sales specifically said to have doubled year-over-year. As mentioned previously, Apple also announced this week that its Board of Directors had authorized an increase of $50 billion to the company’s program designed to return capital to shareholders, with it also set to extend the program’s timeframe by four quarters. “Under the expanded program, Apple plans to spend a cumulative total of $300 billion by the end of March 2019,” the company said in a press statement. “We generated strong operating cash flow of $12.5 billion and returned over $10 billion to our investors in the March quarter,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “Given the strength of our business and our confidence in our future, we are happy to announce another $50 billion increase to our capital return program today.” As part of the latest update to its Capital Return Program, the Board has in addition increased its share repurchase authorization to $210 billion from the $175 billion level announced a year ago. Apple says that it also expects to continue to “net-share-settle” vesting restricted stock units. The company has provided the following guidance for its fiscal 2017 third quarter: – revenue between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion – gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38.5 percent – operating expenses between $6.6 billion and $6.7 billion – other income/(expense) of $450 million – tax rate of 25.5 percent Those who missed Apple’s earnings call on Tuesday can listen again – here. / Apple PR Continue Reading You may also like...

Ford shares dropped 4.2 percent and General Motors fell 2.9 percent, as major automakers posted declines in U.S. new vehicle sales for April. Apple shares rose 0.5 percent ahead of the iPhone maker's quarterly results due later on Tuesday. Investors also were awaiting other significant events later in the week, including Wednesday's expected statement from the Federal Reserve, which began meeting on Tuesday, and Friday's U.S. employment report. The Fed is widely expected to stand pat on interest rates, but may offer hints on the possibility of a rate hike in June. The S&P 500 is approaching record highs during an earnings season that has generally exceeded expectations. Overall, profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.9 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "The technicals in general look good for the S&P," Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. "The fundamentals are improving, particularly as the earnings season unfolds here." The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 9.39 points, or 0.04 percent, to 20,922.85 and the S&P 500 lost 1.08 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,387.25. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.67 points, or 0.09 percent, to 6,085.93, after eking out an intraday record high earlier in the session. The technology sector rose 0.2 percent, on track for its fourth straight day of gains. Energy shares fell 0.8 percent as oil prices weakened. In earnings news, Advanced Micro Devices tumbled 22.5 percent after the chipmaker's second-quarter gross margins forecast raised some concerns. The stock was the biggest percentage decliner in the S&P 500. Archer Daniels Midland sank 8.6 percent and CVS Health fell 3 percent after their respective reports. Coach shares rose 11.5 percent, making them the biggest gainers on the S&P, as the handbag maker cut back on discounting in the United States and sold more expensive bags. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.23-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 46 new 52-week highs and 9 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 139 new highs and 43 new lows.

Apple said that its profit climbed 4.9 percent to slightly more than US$11 billion on revenue rising 4.6 percent to US$52.9 billion in the quarterly that ended April 1. Shares of the California-based company were down nearly two percent to US$144.65 in after-market trades that followed released of the earnings figures. "We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus," Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in the earnings release. Cook said the company has seen "great" response to new iPhone 7 Red Special Edition models and is "thrilled with the strong momentum of our services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter." Still, iPhone sales dipped slightly compared with a year ago to 50.8 million units, below most forecast for the key profit machine for Apple. During a conference call with analysts, Cook said Apple was seeing a "pause" in iPhone purchases that he felt was caused by unconfirmed "reports about future iPhones." "That is clearly what is going on," Cook said. Apple has annually unveiled new iPhone models during special events in September, with major innovations anticipated this year because it will mark the tenth anniversary of the debut of the world-changing mobile device. Still, the company contended that iPhone sales were better than it had expected, growing in four of its five top markets and skewing toward large-screen iPhone 7 models that have higher margins of profit. Buying back shares Apple also announced that its board of directors has authorized an addition US$50 billion for dividends and buying back shares in the company, raising to US$300 billion the total amount of cash to be spent in the program during the coming two years. While Apple has become the world's most valuable company, analysts are looking at how the company is diversifying in the face of a saturated smartphone market and increasing competition. Tuesday's report showed weaker sales of iPads and Mac computers. Apple also reported a 14 percent drop in revenues from a year earlier for "Greater China," dropping the region behind Europe and the Americas in terms of sales. A strong US dollar facing off with weaker currencies were blamed for a strong "headwind" that pushed revenue down. Keen on India Sales of Macintosh computers did well in China, with revenue up about 20 percent, and the company's retail shops were attracting visitors in what it saw as a good signal for its business there. "We continued to believe there is an enormous opportunity there," Cook said on China’s mainland. "In the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there." Apple is also investing heavily in India, the third largest smartphone market in the world behind China and the US, according to Cook. Apple set a new March quarter revenue record in India, growing by double digits. "We're very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country with its very large, young and tech savvy population, fast growing economy and improving 4G network infrastructure," Cook said. Apple continued to tout growth of revenue from online services or digital content, which it boasted was on its way to be on scale with a Fortune 100 company in terms of revenue. For the second quarter in a row, revenue from Apple services topped US$7 billion, the company reported. While not disclosing exact numbers, executives said Apple Watch sales double from the same quarter last year and touted it as the best selling smartwatch in the world. Sales of other products, which include AirPods wireless ear pieces and Apple Watch, posted a 31 percent increase in revenue over the prior year. Combining revenue from Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats headphone sales over the course of the last year would give Apple's "wearables" offerings the scale of a Fortune 500 company, according to Cook. Apple's cash holdings meanwhile rose to a record US$256.8 billion, a figure that raises questions for how the company will manage its massive reserves.

Under pressure from shareholders to hand over more of its $250 billion-plus hoard of cash and investments, Apple boosted its capital return program by $50 billion, increased its share repurchase authorization by $35 billion and raised its quarterly dividend by 10.5 percent. Investors were unmoved, sending shares of the world's most valuable listed company down 1.8 percent at $144.80 in after-hours trading. Apple sold 50.76 million iPhones in its fiscal second quarter ended April 1, down from 51.19 million a year earlier. Analysts on average had estimated iPhone sales of 52.27 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri argued the decline was not as bad as it looked, given the peculiarities of how phone sales are calculated. The company reports what are called "sell-in" figures for the iPhone, a measure of how many units it sells to retailers, rather than "sell-through" figures, which measure how many phones are actually sold to consumers. Maestri said the company reduced the volume of inventory going through its retail channel by about 1.2 million units in the quarter, meaning the company sold about 52 million phones to customers on a sell-through basis. Despite the dip in unit sales, iPhone revenue rose 1.2 percent in the quarter, helped by a higher average selling price. Expectations are building ahead of Apple's 10th-anniversary iPhone range this fall, with investors hoping that the launch would help bolster sales. Apple typically launches its new iPhones in September. A big jump in sales usually follows in the holiday quarter, before demand tapers over the next few quarters as customers hold back ahead of the next launch. Apple's 10th-anniversary iPhone range might sport features such as wireless charging, 3-D facial recognition and a curved display. "There is a general softening in phone demand to contend with as well as expectations of a big upgrade, all of which softens the blow of this quarter's miss," said James McQuivey, a Forrester Research analyst. "If we see Apple downplaying expectations before the next upgrade cycle, it might mean that the company isn't confident it will beat those expectations."

Cabral/Dubai Filed on May 3, 2017 | Last updated on May 3, 2017 at 07.28 am Share More > Vote Apple's 10th-anniversary iPhone, which will be unveiled this September, is rumoured to have a curved or bezel-less display, 3D facial recognition and wireless charging. (Reuters file) Revenue practically matches views; China down again, 'tonnes of things going on' in India Looks like iPhone users are waiting for the highly-anticipated "X". Tech giant Apple posted a surprise drop in sales of its flagship device in its fiscal second quarter, in an apparent sign that customers are eagerly waiting for its 10th-anniversary iPhone this September, which is rumoured to have a curved or bezel-less display, 3D facial recognition and wireless charging. The world's most valuable company by market capitalisation reported that it sold 50.76 million iPhones in the three-month period ended April 1, marginally down one per cent from 51.19 million a year earlier, according to figures released at around 12:30am Dubai time on Wednesday. Revenue, however, rose five per cent from last first quarter's $50.56 billion to $52.9 billion, not far from forecasts of $53.02 billion, helped by an 18 per cent leap in its Services area - which include the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud and Apple Pay - from last year's $5.99 billion to $7.04 billion. Its Other Products category - which includes the Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats products - also provided a lift, up at $2.87 billion, 31 per cent better than the year-ago's $2.19 billion. iPad sales, meanwhile, dropped 12 per cent year-on-year from $4.41 billion to $3.89 billion year-on-year, while Macs jumped 14 per cent from $5.11 billion to $5.84 billion. "We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for the iPhone 7," Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. He added that the iPhone Product(RED) had seen "great customer demand", and highlighted that Apple's Services business posted its highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter.   China crisis? Later at the conference call that began at 1am, Cook was in high spirits. "We feel great," he told journalists, regarding Apple's performance in the second quarter. A red flag, however, was once again China. Revenue was down 14 per cent from a year earlier - the only area in Apple's five operating segments, which also include the Americas, Europe, Japan and rest of the Asia-Pacific, which posted a year-on-year drop, with the last region again accounting for the biggest increase at 20 per cent. Cook said during the call that the China performance was affected by currency headwinds, but is still very bullish in the world's second-largest economy, pointing out that store revenue leapt 27 per cent and Mac sales grew 20 per cent. India, meanwhile, is "underpenetrated" according to Cook, though Apple has been investing heavily there as of late, opening a developer centre in the country. The rollout of 4G in the country of over a billion people should also help the company there. "There are a tonne of things going on there," he said. "We're putting a lot of energy there." Cook also highlighted Apple's "America First" policy under President Donald Trump, saying that the company supports over two million jobs in the US, while also spending billions on American suppliers. Chief financial officer Luca Maestri said that Apple added $10.8 billion in cash and equivalents - which brings its war chest to almost $257 billion (Dh944 billion), from the first quarter's $246 billion. Shares of Apple, however, dropped 1.9 per cent in after-hours trading. Its market capitalisation stood at $773.9 billion on Tuesday. Apple had 165 million paid subscriptions, though Maestri didn't break this down further. On wearables, Cook shot down the notion that the market was weakening. Apple Watch sales, he said, more than doubled in six out of its top 10 markets - but, again, Apple did not reveal any figures. "We're very committed [on wearables]," he said. "It's already a big business; over time it will be bigger." Practically no discussions were made on the upcoming iPhone or Apple's autonomous car, which has made headlines recently. - alvin@khaleejtimes.com Share More > Vote MORE FROM Technology Technology iPhone sales in surprise dip, but there's a good...

Photos Videos Topics Live WI 40/1 (14) - PAK 393/10 (140) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Narendra Modi Donald Trump Bahubali 2 Exam results 2017 IPL 2017 News Technology News US STOCKS-Wall St edges up on heavy earnings day; Fed on tap Shares0 Wed, 3 May 2017-06:16am , Reuters Wall Street edged higher on Tuesday as gains for the tech and industrial sectors countered weakness in auto and energy stocks and investors digested a heavy day of earnings reports. Ford shares dropped 4.4 percent and General Motors fell 2.9 percent, as major automakers posted declines in U.S. new vehicle sales for April. After the market closed, Apple shares fell more than 1 percent after the company reported a surprise drop in iPhone sales for the quarter. Apple shares had gained 0.6 percent during regular trading ahead of the report. Investors also were awaiting other significant events later in the week, including Wednesday's expected statement from the Federal Reserve, which began meeting on Tuesday, and Friday's U.S. employment report. The Fed is widely expected to stand pat on interest rates, but may offer hints on the possibility of a rate hike in June. The benchmark S&P 500 is approaching record highs during an earnings season that has generally exceeded expectations. Overall, profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.9 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "The technicals in general look good for the S&P," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. "The fundamentals are improving, particularly as the earnings season unfolds here." The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 36.43 points, or 0.17 percent, to 20,949.89, the S&P 500 gained 2.83 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,391.16 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.76 points, or 0.06 percent, to 6,095.37. The technology sector rose 0.3 percent, its fourth straight day of gains. Industrials gained 0.5 percent, helped by airlines shares after Delta said its passenger unit revenue increased 1 percent in April. Energy shares fell 0.5 percent as oil prices weakened. The S&P 500 has climbed 11.8 percent since President Donald Trump's Nov. 8 election, fueled by hopes for his plans for tax cuts, deregulation and infrastructure spending, though investors have questioned his ability to enact his agenda. "The administration continues to issue tons of contradictory or hard-to-understand proposals and ideas and I think it has left this market a little bit confused about next steps," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. In earnings news, Advanced Micro Devices tumbled 24.4 percent after the chipmaker's second-quarter gross margins forecast raised some concerns. The stock was the biggest percentage decliner in the S&P 500. Archer Daniels Midland sank 8.9 percent and CVS Health fell 3.6 percent after their respective quarterly reports. Coach shares rose 11.4 percent, making it the biggest gainer on the S&P, as the handbag maker cut back on discounting in the United States and sold more expensive bags. Advancing and declining issues were roughly even on the NYSE, while on Nasdaq, a 1.26-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 47 new 52-week highs and 9 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 145 new highs and 51 new lows. About 7 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 6.5 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Travis Pope05/02/2017 There was a time when almost no one seriously competed with Apple’s MacBook line of laptops. The machines were too well designed for cheaper Windows laptops to compete against. Even those that matched its price and offered improved hardware couldn’t match its sales. The Surface Laptop, Microsoft’s newly announced Windows 10 PC, will take the battle to Apple this summer. The Surface Laptop hopes to become the college status symbol that the MacBook Air has been by offering long battery life and a thin profile that’s easy to stuff into a bag. Microsoft is also hoping that its compatibility with some Surface accessories and Microsoft software will make it the obvious choice for students. The Microsoft Surface Laptop. Read: Surface Laptop Release Date, Pre-Orders & Features How does the Surface Laptop compare to the MacBook Air? Which should students buy when the summer arrives and they’re looking for their university laptop? You’ll be surprised how easy this decision is. Surface Laptop vs MacBook Air: Internals The Surface Laptop is made of up Aluminum. That’s the same material that previous devices in the Surface line-up have used. Microsoft mixed its Surface Book design with the way a Surface Pro 4 looks when paired with a cover. The lid and body are made of metal, but the keyboard deck is covered in the Alcantara fabric that is also used for the Surface Signature Type Cover. The device comes in Platinum, Burgundy, Cobalt and Gold, depending on which model you order. Read: 6 Best Surface Pro 4 Keyboards They each weigh 2.76 pounds. They are only.57-inches thick from top to bottom. Its 13.5-inch display has a resolution of 2256 x 1504 pixels. It also uses the Intel HD 620 graphics in its least expensive model. Upgraded versions use Intel Iris Plus 640 technology. It was the MacBook Air that ushered in the era of ultra-thin laptops. Which is why it’s ironic that it measures 0.68 inches from top to bottom. It’s thicker than Surface Laptop. It has the same all Aluminum design that it started out with. It weighs 2.96 pounds, which is slightly more than the new Surface Laptop. MacBook Air 2015 The MacBook Air’s 13.3-inch display has a resolution of 1440 by 900 pixels. Videos will be less crisp on the Air than the Surface Laptop. There’s no touch experience because it’d be wasted on the Air if there was a touchscreen. MacOS isn’t made for anything but a mouse and keyboard. The entry-level models come with a 1.6GHz Dual-Core processor and 8GB of RAM DDR3 RAM. An option lets you add Intel’s 2.2GHz Core i7 processor but no additional RAM. Read: 2015 MacBook Air Release Retina vs MacBook Air: 5 Exciting Details The MacBook Air and Surface Laptop both cost a minimum of $999, and if the MacBook Air sounds underpowered compared to the Surface Laptop is because it is. Microsoft is attempting to go after a huge weak spot in Apple’s line-up. Rather than refresh the MacBook Air, Apple has focused on dropping ports and slimming down the mainline New MacBook. The only thing that makes Microsoft’s comparisons to the MacBook Air fair is Apple’s refusal to drop the price of the slimmer MacBook and its continual sale for $999 on the company’s website and in stores. Surface Laptop vs MacBook Air: Features The MacBook Air is the last Apple mobile computer to offer a MagSafe 2 power plug. It’s one of the few that offers two USB 3.0 ports, a Thunderbolt 2 port and a headset jack too. The current mainstream New MacBook dumps all that for a single USB Type-C port instead. The SDXC card slot allows the MacBook to pull video and photos off cameras without attaching a cable or hub. The trackpad uses Apple’s multi-touch technology to emulate some of the same gestures you’d use on an iPad to navigate and browser. The Surface Laptop features a full multi-touch display, meaning it can detect 10 different points of input. The company has also gone and added support for its other Surface accessories. Surface Dial lets you manipulate apps and programs naturally. Surface Pen lets you write in your apps, and the Surface Connect port is for docking and charging. There’s a Mini DisplayPort, a headset jack, and a full-size USB 3.0 port. You can sign into the laptop using the front-facing Windows Hello camera that the Surface Pro 4 pioneered. The MacBook Air runs the latest version of MacOS, while the Surface Laptop will run a new version of Windows 10 called Windows 10 S. Windows 10 S is just like the regular version of Windows 10 except that you have to get all your apps and programs from the Windows Store. That means no Chrome and no iTunes unless the companies that make those programs decides to bring them to the Windows Store or you upgrade the operating system. For the first year, Microsoft will upgrade Surface Laptop buyers to a version of Windows 10 without this limitation for free. The company will throw in a subscription to Office 365 too. After the free period, upgrading to Windows 10 Pro will cost Surface Laptop buyers $50. It’s worth noting that Apple gives away its iWork suite of apps to all buyers. That offer doesn’t expire and neither do the apps. The MacBook Air lasts 12 hours between charges. The Surface Laptop lasts 14 hours. There’s something that Microsoft can’t best with hardware alone that the MacBook Air has to its credit: the iPhone and iPad. Both are so successful that you may have one already. The services and iTunes content that’s available on your iPhone can be loaded into Windows 10 with iTunes. However, Surface Laptop can’t replicate how easy it is to switch tasks or reply to messages on your iPhone with a MacBook Air. Surface Laptop vs MacBook Air: Which Should You Buy? The MacBook Air is the original thin-and-light notebook. It arrived even before the original Surface devices did. Steve Jobs revealed the notebook by pulling it out of an inter-office envelope. Its days are numbered though, and even Microsoft knows it. For the same price as the MacBook Air you can get a Surface Laptop with a modern processor, modern design and modern integrated graphics, thinner profile, lighter chassis and more battery life. The 4GB of RAM in the entry Surface Laptop is clearly a misstep that users will have to decide if they’re okay with. So is the use of Windows 10 S instead of Windows 10 Home. After 2017, users won’t be happy that they have to pay Microsoft to do something that has been free in existing versions of Windows that they’ve used. Look into the Surface Laptop, if you’d planned for an upcoming MacBook Air purchase to be your first foray into Apple’s hardware. The Surface Laptop may have enough advantages to keep you from leaving. If you love MacOS already, you should consider the New MacBook. It’s a bit more expensive, but you’ll all the latest features Apple’s offers. At this point, the MacBoo Air is a bit old. The Surface Laptop arrives on store shelves June 15th. You can place a pre-order now from the Microsoft Store. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

Apple sold a total of 50.76 million iPhones over the second quarter of the year. But that’s still down from the 51 million phones it sold this time last year. Ever been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE On the other hand, Apple’s revenue from the iPhone increased, albeit just as slightly as the sales numbers decreased. Tim Cook made it clear that he thought the more-expensive iPhone 7 Plus was behind the growth, saying: We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus. The data seems to suggest Apple makes more money per smartphone than before, and that might be because we’re choosing to buy the deluxe models. This might explain why the company is taking the risk to make the (potentially very) expensive iPhone 8. via The Verge Apple Reports Second Quarter Results on Apple Read next: Google Maps gets a custom home screen for easier navigation across India AppleMoney Share on Facebook (65) Share on Twitter (189) Rachel Kaser is a reporter from Texas.

In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 ended down 0.98 percent, or 58.065 points, at 5892.30, amid declines in banking and some resources shares. On the mainland, the Shanghai Composite shed 0.28 percent, while the Shenzhen Composite was off 0.25 percent in afternoon trade. Taiwan's Taiex closed up 0.14 percent, or 14.06 points, at 9955.33, while in afternoon trade, Singapore's Straits Times Index added 0.73 percent. Markets in Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong are shut Wednesday for public holidays. Japan is shut for the rest of the week for the Golden Week holiday. The Fed was expected to hold interest rates steady after its two-day meeting that began Tuesday, as it pauses to examine more economic data, but it may hint that conditions are on track for an increase in June. Market expectations for a rate hike following this meeting are just 4.8 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. "The solid increase in first quarter employment costs will give the FOMC confidence that inflation remains on track to meet its medium term target of 2 percent per annum. We expect the FOMC to leave policy unchanged tomorrow but increase the Funds rate in June," Commonwealth Bank said in a note on Wednesday. Asia-Pacific Markets Shares of Apple suppliers were mixed after the iPhone maker's earnings disappointed. Apple reported after the bell. While quarterly earnings beat expectations, revenue fell short of estimates as the company sold fewer iPhones than expected. The tech giant guided to third quarter revenue of around $44.5 billion, a bit below market consensus. Apple shares were down 2.4 percent in post-market trade. Among suppliers, Hon Hai ended up 0.50 percent and Pegatron was flat, but Largan added 0.4 percent and Catcher rose 0.81 percent. Nomura said in a note on Wednesday that the outlook for suppliers could improve ahead. "The market expects Apple to launch new iPad series in the June quarter, and we think the new products will help to revive iPad component makers' revenues in the second quarter of 2017," Nomura said. Teradat Santivivut | Getty Images In Asian trade, oil prices rebounded with U.S. light crude up 0.80 percent at $48.03 a barrel at 2:46 p.m. HK/SIN, after dropping 2.4 percent overnight, and Brent rose 0.89 percent to $50.90, after falling 2.3 percent overnight. Overnight, oil prices sharply extended losses just before Tuesday's settlement, with U.S. crude breaking below $48 a barrel for the first time in more than a month. The contracts had tumbled overnight as rising output in the United States, Canada and Libya offset news of falling production in Russia and OPEC. But after the market close, industry estimates showed crude inventories fell a more than expected 4.16 million barrels at the end of last week, the American Petroleum Institute (API) said Tuesday, offering support. Symbol Name Price   Change %Change NIKKEI --- HSI --- ASX 200 --- SHANGHAI --- KOSPI --- CNBC 100 --- Among Australian-listed companies, BHP Billiton's ration outlook was changed to positive from stable by Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday, while keeping the A3 rating unchanged. "The change in outlook to positive reflects our expectation that BHP Billiton will continue to generate material earnings and solid free cash flow in the current environment," Matthew Moore, a senior credit officer at Moody's said in a statement. "This will allow the group to maintain strong margins and credit metrics for its ratings over the next 12-18 months, despite our expectations for lower commodity prices." BHP shares ended down 2.31 percent, swept in a downdraft among Australian resources plays. Rio Tinto was down 0.95 percent, Alacer Gold was off 3.35 percent and Woodside shed 0.50 percent. Shares of Australia-listed telecom Vocus plunged 27.16 percent to end at A$2.44 after the company cut its earnings outlook for fiscal 2017, saying it expected earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) at $365 million to $375 million, compared with previous guidance of $430 million to $450 million. That followed an accounting review of when to recognize revenue as well as lower forecast billings and an increase in service delivery headcount. Citi cut shares of Vocus to Neutral from Buy and slashed its target price to A$3.40 from A$6.00 in a note on Tuesday. "With revenue falling short of expectations and operating costs rising, we no longer have confidence that Vocus will be able to deliver on the full potential of its recently combined businesses," Citi said. But it added that it didn't cut the shares to sell because while the company "clearly faces some serious challenges," its underlying assets are valuable and the stock has already dropped significantly. In the currency markets, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was at 99.064 at 2:49 p.m. HK/SIN. The dollar fetched 112.05 yen at 2:49 p.m. HK/SIN, down from highs around 112.30 yen overnight. U.S. equities closed mostly flat on Tuesday. The Nasdaq composite hit an intraday record of 6,102.72 and eked out a closing record, with shares of Apple also hitting a new high. Apple's stock also had the most positive impact on the Nasdaq 100 index, which also reached a record high ahead of the results.

Apple said that its profit climbed 4.9 per cent to slightly more than USD 11 billion on revenue rising 4.6 per cent to USD 52.9 billion in the quarterly that ended April 1. Shares of the California-based company were down nearly two per cent to USD 144.79 in after-market trades that followed released of the earnings figures. "We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus," Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in the earnings release. Cook said the company has seen "great" response to new iPhone 7 Red Special Edition models and is "thrilled with the strong momentum of our services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter." Still, iPhone sales dipped slightly compared with a year ago to 50.8 million units, below most forecast for the key profit machine for Apple. Apple also announced that its board of directors has authorised an addition USD 50 billion for dividends and buying back shares in the company, raising to USD 300 billion the total amount of cash to be spent in the program during the coming two years. While Apple has become the world's most valuable company, analysts are looking at how the company is diversifying in the face of a saturated smartphone market and increasing competition. The report showed weaker sales of iPads and Mac computers, and a drop in revenue from "other" products including the Apple Watch, specific figures for which were not released. Apple also reported a 14 per cent drop in revenues from a year earlier for "Greater China," dropping the region behind Europe and the Americas in terms of sales. Apple's cash holdings meanwhile rose to a record $256.8 billion, a figure which raises questions for how the company will manage its massive reserves.

Shares have climbed 27 per cent, outpacing most of the other technology superpowers, thanks to unshakable optimism about a sales rebound coming from the next versions of the iPhone. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Get used to Apple’s less-turbocharged future. The tech giant still generates more profits than any other company, and it is swimming in cash. Photo: AP That’s the hope and this is the reality: Apple’s growth rate is still anemic by the company’s standards, especially from the iPhone business that generates about two-thirds of its revenue.Total revenue rose 4.6 per cent in the three months ended April 1 from a year earlier, Apple disclosed overnight. That’s amazing for a company of Apple’s size, but not the impossible-to-believe growth machine of past years. The number of iPhones sold dipped 0.8 per cent. That’s not good. Related Content Apple posts surprise fall in iPhone sales Apple can’t ignore Microsoft’s slick, new laptop The belief is no matter what happens in Apple’s business in the next few months, it will be a prelude to a pickup in sales from a drastic makeover coming to Apple’s product lineup for the 10th anniversary of the iPhone.But a lot can go wrong with the hopes for an iPhone sales comeback starting in late 2017. People are opting to hold onto their existing smartphones for longer, and a higher percentage of people buying iPhones in the US, still Apple’s biggest market, have been opting for older or cheaper models than they did in the past. Advertisement China is expected to be the biggest spot of iPhone sales growth, but a purchase spike there is no sure thing, either. Compared with the cycle of blockbuster iPhone sales in China starting in late 2014, Apple has more competition now from local companies that also sell feature-rich smartphones. Apple’s revenue from “greater China” – China, Hong Kong and Taiwan – fell for the fifth consecutive quarter. That’s not a great setup for a China revival.And there’s a risk that hopes of an iPhone growth rebound have gone too far. For the first time in years, Apple’s stock no longer looks like a bargain. The company’s multiple of forward earnings is the highest it has been since late 2014 and early 2015, when it was clear that the much-hyped debut of Apple’s first larger-screen phone models were a surefire hit.It’s hard to imagine a repeat of that iPhone 6 sales bounce, and indeed even the most optimistic Apple loyalists are not expecting a return to anything like that growth tear.In Apple’s 2015 fiscal year, the first full yea… Post navigation Misbah-ul-Haq dismissed for 99 against West Indies, third time in his career Eurovision May 02: Meet & Gret photo impressions Search for: Recent Posts Johnny Depp has compulsive spending disorder, hired sound engineer to feed him lines: Ex-managers claim Nach Baliye 8: Mona Lisa and husband Vikrant Rajpoot to get EVICTED this week from the show Justin Bieber has made these 11 ABSURD DEMANDS for his upcoming Purpose Tour Baahubali 2 box office collection day 5 collection: Prabhas’ movie garners Rs 710 crore, all set to shatter yet an Suffering from mid-life obesity?

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 2 Top Dividend Stocks in Phablets Apple and Samsung are the best dividend stocks in this increasingly important area of the smartphone market. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) May 2, 2017 at 7:25PM Phablets -- smartphones with screens larger than 5.5 inches -- are perhaps the lone bright spot in an otherwise listless and maturing smartphone market. In fact, research firm IDC has estimated that phablet shipments grew 49% last year, compared with 2.5% growth for the broader smartphone market.  Like the smartphone market itself, the phablet space is dominated by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), each of which offers a notable dividend. So let's delve deeper into why Apple and Samsung are the best dividend-paying phablet stocks to own today. Apple Apple didn't start the phablet craze, but the Mac maker has embraced the trend with open arms in recent years. Though it moved toward larger screen sizes with the iPhone 5, Apple didn't launch its first phablet until it rolled out the iPhone 6 Plus in 2015. Over its past three device cycles, Apple has charged about $100 more for its entry-level 5.5-inch iPhones than for its 4.7-inch handset. However, estimates suggest that the larger screen and improved cameras associated with Apple's larger iPhones add only about $40 to the larger iPhone's bill of materials. Put another way, Apple makes more gross profit from each phablet it sells than it does on its regular iPhones. This trend seems likely to accelerate in the year ahead. A persistent rumor surrounding Apple's coming iPhone 8 claims the company plans to significantly increase the price of its new phone, perhaps charging as much as $1,000, according to some sources. As a result, Morgan Stanley estimates that Apple will increase its iPhone average selling price from $695 in last year's Q4 to $753 for its fiscal year 2017. Keep in mind that the average Android handset retails at a far lower $254.  It is this pricing power that lets Apple remain a compelling option for dividend investors. Its 1.6% dividend yield  might appear a bit disappointing at first glance; the S&P 500 yields 1.9% in comparison. However, Apple's immense financial resources -- it carried $159 billion in net cash on its balance sheet last quarter -- give it almost unlimited flexibility to continue to reward shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company is due to raise its dividend as part of its Q2 earnings report on May 2, which will extend its streak of consecutive annual dividend increases since Apple started paying its dividend in 2012.  Image source: Samsung  Samsung Samsung sells its phablets across a wider variety of price points than Apple, but it has employed many of the same strategies to make its mobile business into a profit center.  As with iPhones, Samsung generates the bulk of its phone profits from sales of high-end smartphone franchises, such as its Galaxy and Note devices. With prices for the recent Galaxy S8 ($750) and S8+ ($850) starting at $100 more than the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, Samsung will certainly derive meaningful profits from the sale of smartphones and phablets alike. In fact, Galaxy S8 and S8+ pre-orders increased 30% compared with the last year's Galaxy S-series, according to reports. Even after weathering last year's highly publicized recall of the Galaxy Note 7, Samsung appears to have regained its mojo as the leading supplier of high-end Android devices. At 1.4%, Samsung shares with Apple a below-average dividend yield.  However, Samsung should also be viewed as a stock with considerable room for dividend growth in the year ahead. The company has publicly pledged to increase its dividend payouts from 30% of free cash flows it paid in 2015 to as high as 50%, in a bid to pacify activist shareholder Elliott Management.  As I have noted in recent articles, analysts generally expect Samsung's sales and profits to increase in 2017, which suggests its free cash flow will also rise. (Free cash flow estimates weren't available at the time of writing.) As such, like Apple, Samsung looks like a phablet stock deserving of income investors' attention today. Andrew Tonner owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple, Inc. Earnings: Growth Accelerates Only recently returning to growth, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was put to the test in its second fiscal quarter of 2017 as investors looked to see whether the company’s return to growth would continue. On Tuesday, Apple showed investors that it can not only continue to grow its business, but can also grow it at an even faster rate than it did in its first quarter. Going further, Apple also expanded its capital-return program, announcing a larger authorization for share repurchases and a bigger dividend. Here’s a look at Apple’s second-quarter results. Red special edition iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. The raw numbers Metric Q2 2017 Q2 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $52.9 billion $50.6 billion 4.5% EPS $2.10 $1.90 10.5% Gross margin 38.9% 39.5% (60 basis points) Data source: Apple’s second-quarter earnings release . Table by author. In Q2, Apple’s revenue and EPS increased 4.5% and 10.5%, respectively, compared with the year-ago quarter. This growth is up from Apple’s 3.3% and 2.4% respective growth in revenue and EPS in Apple’s first quarter. This makes for Apple’s second quarter in a row of growing its revenue and EPS on a year-over-year basis, following a period in fiscal 2016 in which Apple’s business declined on a year-over-year basis for three quarters in a row. „We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook in the company’s second-quarter press release. Cook cited „great customer response” to the new iPhone 7 (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition and Apple’s services business as key drivers during the quarter. Second-quarter highlights Beyond Apple’s accelerating revenue and EPS growth, here are some other key takeaways from Apple’s second quarter. Apple expanded its total capital return authorization by $50 billion and extended the program’s expiration by one year, to March 2019. Of its incremental capital return authorization, Apple plans to spend $35 billion on repurchases and $15 billion on dividends. Apple increased its quarterly dividend by 10.5% to $0.63 per share. The dividend increase is slightly higher than its 10% increase last year. iPhone revenue, which accounted for about 63% of Apple’s revenue, increased 1% year over year. iPhone unit sales, however, were down 1% year over year. iPad revenue declined 12% year over year. iMac revenue increased 14% year over year. Services revenue increased 18% year over year. Other products, which includes sales of Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, iPod, and Apple-branded and third-party accessories, jumped 31% year over year, marking a notable change of direction compared with the segment’s 8% year-over-year decline in Apple’s first quarter of 2017. Apple generated $12.5 billion in operating cash flow and returned $10.2 billion to investors through repurchases and dividends. Image source: Apple. What now? Going forward, Apple expects growth to continue. The company guided for third-quarter revenue to be between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion. In the third quarter of 2016, Apple’s revenue was $42.4 billion. Apple also said it expects its third-quarter gross profit margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. Those figures compare with a gross profit margin of 38% in the year-ago quarter. With revenue expected to increase and management anticipating a similar gross profit margin to the year-ago quarter, Apple’s EPS should also increase in Q3. Investors should look for Apple’s recent return to year-over-year growth to continue throughout 2017 and beyond.  %sfr%} Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12 MW of solar power — more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing — and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018 — equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in 23 countries, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

Cook said the company has seen "great" response to new iPhone 7 Red Special Edition models and is "thrilled with the strong momentum of our services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter." Still, iPhone sales dipped slightly compared with a year ago to 50.8 million units, below most forecast for the key profit machine for Apple. Apple also announced that its board of directors has authorised an addition USD 50 billion for dividends and buying back shares in the company, raising to USD 300 billion the total amount of cash to be spent in the program during the coming two years. While Apple has become the world's most valuable company, analysts are looking at how the company is diversifying in the face of a saturated smartphone market and increasing competition. The report showed weaker sales of iPads and Mac computers, and a drop in revenue from "other" products including the Apple Watch, specific figures for which were not released. Apple also reported a 14 per cent drop in revenues from a year earlier for "Greater China," dropping the region behind Europe and the Americas in terms of sales. Apple's cash holdings meanwhile rose to a record $256.8 billion, a figure which raises questions for how the company will manage its massive reserves.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Analysts Say Apple Is Eyeing Major Acquisition Of A Media Company By Tyler Lee on 05/02/2017 17:05 PDT When it comes to Apple’s acquisitions, most of them are companies that the average person might not be familiar with. However one of the Apple’s more mainstream acquisitions was Beats from a couple of years ago, which many are familiar not only with their headphones and audio equipment, but also Beats Music. It turns out that Apple could be making another major acquisition in the future, or at least are contemplating it because according to a note from analysts at Barclays, it seems that there is talk that Apple is eyeing the acquisition of a media company. The company in question was not specified. This note comes from analysts Mark Moskowitz and Daniel Gaide who claims that this acquisition will allow Apple to achieve its services growth goals. An alternative would be a cloud services company. “Based on our conversations, many investors currently believe that a major acquisition by Apple would be focused on the media sector. However, we believe a cloud acquisition could better position Apple for the long term by providing the company with greater exposure to the enterprise, while allowing the company to utilize its large consumer cloud resources.” Whether or not this acquisition will happen remains to be seen, but in the past there have been talks about Apple eyeing media companies, so maybe this isn’t really that much of a stretch after all.

Business Home LBoard Government to nullify Anwar’s suit seeking to quash sodomy conviction V Anbalagan Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Apple posts surprise dip in iPhone sales, shares fall Reuters | May 3, 2017 Apple sold 50.76 million iPhones in its fiscal second quarter ended April 1, down from 51.19 million a year earlier. NEW YORK: Apple Inc reported a surprise fall in iPhone sales for its second quarter on Tuesday, indicating that customers may have held back purchases in anticipation of the 10th-anniversary edition of the company’s most important product later this year. Under pressure from shareholders to hand over more of its $250 billion-plus hoard of cash and investments, Apple boosted its capital return program by $50 billion, increased its share repurchase authorization by $35 billion and raised its quarterly dividend by 10.5 percent. Investors were unmoved, sending shares of the world’s most valuable listed company down 1.9 percent at $144.65 in after-hours trading. Apple sold 50.76 million iPhones in its fiscal second quarter ended April 1, down from 51.19 million a year earlier. Analysts on average had estimated iPhone sales of 52.27 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri argued the decline was not as bad as it looked, given the peculiarities of how phone sales are calculated. The company reports what are called “sell-in” figures for the iPhone, a measure of how many units it sells to retailers, rather than “sell-through” figures, which measure how many phones are actually sold to consumers. Maestri said the company reduced the volume of inventory going through its retail channel by about 1.2 million units in the quarter, meaning the company sold about 52 million phones to customers on a sell-through basis. Despite the dip in unit sales, iPhone revenues rose 1.2 percent in the quarter, helped by a higher average selling price. 10th anniversary Expectations are building ahead of Apple’s 10th-anniversary iPhone range this fall, with investors hoping that the launch would help bolster sales. Apple typically launches its new iPhones in September. A big jump in sales usually follows in the holiday quarter, before demand tapers over the next few quarters as customers hold back ahead of the next launch. Apple’s 10th-anniversary iPhone range might sport features such as wireless charging, 3-D facial recognition and a curved display. “There is a general softening in phone demand to contend with as well as expectations of a big upgrade, all of which softens the blow of this quarter’s miss,” said James McQuivey, a Forrester Research analyst. “If we see Apple downplaying expectations before the next upgrade cycle, it might mean that the company isn’t confident it will beat those expectations.” The company forecast total revenue of between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion for the current quarter, while analysts on average were expecting $45.60 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. Analysts on average expect the company to sell 42.31 million iPhones in the current quarter, according to FactSet. For the second quarter, the company’s net income rose to $11.03 billion, or $2.10 per share, compared with $10.52 billion, or $1.90 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $2.02 per share, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 4.6 percent to $52.90 billion in the quarter, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $53.02 billion. A 17.5 percent jump in the company’s services business – which includes the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud – to $7.04 billion, boosted revenue. “We are particularly encouraged by the fact that service revenue is nowhere near as cyclical as product revenue,” Neil Saunders, Managing Director of GlobalData Retail, wrote in a note to clients. Apple’s revenue from the Greater China region fell 14.1 percent to $10.73 billion in the quarter, as cheaper rivals in the region chipped away at sales. Maestri said that sales of Macs and the company’s services were strong in China during the March quarter. “The performance we’re seeing in China should get better going forward this year,” he said. Apple’s gross margin hit 38.9 percent, slightly ahead of analysts’ average expectation of 38.7 percent, despite higher prices for memory chips. The company said it expects gross margins next quarter between 37.5 percent and 38.5 percent, versus analysts’ expectation of 38.3 percent, according to FactSet. “NAND and DRAM (memory chips) are under pressure right now in terms of some price pressure. We saw that in the March quarter and expect that to continue into the June quarter, but for all the other commodities, we see prices declining,” Maestri said.

With that in mind, we want to take a look at the most important things to know about the iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update. Last year, Apple rolled out its highly anticipated iOS 9.3 update. The update went through an extensive beta but the update caused problems for many iPhone and iPad users. To address these bugs and other lingering issues, Apple pushed out several new versions of iOS 9.3. iOS 9.3.1 arrived with some important bug fixes and patches. After that, Apple pushed out an iOS 9.3.2 update to the iPhone 4s and other iOS 9-powered devices. A few days after that, it released iOS 9.3.3 update. Soon after that, the company pushed out iOS 9.3.4 update. Shortly after the release of iOS 9.3.4, Apple released an iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update. As we push into 2017, the iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 serves as the most up-to-date version of iOS for the 4-inch device. If you’re coming from the iOS 9.3.4 update, iOS 9.3.5 features three three patches and nothing else. If you’re coming from something older than iOS 9.3.4, your iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update is going to be a much larger update. The features and fixes from Apple’s previous iOS updates are baked in. With that in mind we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone 4s users need to know about the iOS 9.3.5 update’s performance, its problems, and the iOS downgrade process, as we push into the year. iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 Reviews   1 / 7 We've been able to spend some quality hands-on time with many of Apple's other iOS updates but we haven't spent enough time to provide quality feedback about the iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update. So, we must turn to the opinions of others. As we push further and further away from Apple's iOS 9.3.5 release date we've seen iPhone 4s users from all over the world relay feedback about the update's performance. If you haven't installed yet you should make it a point to dig into these mini reviews. iPhone 4s iOS 9.3.5 update reviews are still mixed months after the update's release. While some users are seeing solid performance in key areas like battery life and connectivity, others are complaining about lag, freezes, and occasional stuttering.  Some users have said that they are sticking with the iOS 8 update, others are saying the iOS 9.3.4 and iOS 9.3.5 updates solved some of the lag issues they had with earlier versions of iOS 9. As of right now there is no clear cut answer which means those of you with an iPhone 4s need to be extremely careful with this upgrade. Dig into this feedback and decide if it's worth it to you and your device. For most of you, it will be thanks to the nature of the security patches on board.    1 / 7 23 Responses 04/20/2016 Enajrowe Reply Hurrah..!!!Ｉ ᴊᴜｓᴛ ɢᴏᴛ ᴘᴀɪᴅ 6784ＵＳＤ ᴡᴏʀᴋɪɴɢ ᴏғғ ᴍʏ ʟᴀᴘᴛᴏᴘ ᴛʜɪｓ ᴍᴏɴᴛʜ.

You do it this way, make sure the phone is off AND connected to your mac or pc and leave iTunes open, press and hold down the power button and count 3 seconds, after you count those 3 seconds, you push down the home button but don’t release the power button, hold the power button and home button pressed simultaneously for about 10 seconds, in mean time the screen should turn black as you reach 6 or 7, after 10 second, release the power button but keep holding down the home button until you see a prompt in iTunes that will tell you to restore you’re iPhone. Good luck! 11/01/2016 Mike Morley Reply Since updating to ios 9.3.5 my iPhone 4s shuts down at 35% battery level. I have heard that Apple do not plan to release any further updates to iphone 4s so I either put up with this or upgrade the phone. Of course apple would love me to upgrade the phone. I also upgraded my ipad2 to ios 9.3.5 and found it would then not let me past password sign in, it to a great deal of time to sort this out including complete reset and restore of the machine. I don’t have time to fix apples mistakes so I’m switching to android, at least you are not badgered continuously to upgrade it’s operating system APPLE NEVER AGAIN ! 12/17/2016 Satheesh Reply When i update to 9.3.5 My 4s asking to connect itunes.

One of the key metrics investors will be watching out for in those earnings will be iPhone sales. The tech giant makes most of its money from iPhones — and even if it meets estimates of 52 million, that's not a lot more than the 51 million it reported a year ago. Wall Street also kept an eye on the Federal Reserve, with the central bank kicking off a two-day monetary policy meeting. The Fed, however, is not expected to shift monetary policy when their meeting concludes. Market expectations for a rate hike following this meeting are just 4.8 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. That said, investors will be looking for more clues about the Fed's plan to unwind its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet. "The FOMC has always encountered turbulence when trying to 'land the plane.' Reducing an inventory of $4.5T of fixed income securities to something far more stable presents the biggest challenge of the most protracted and complex tightening cycle facing the central bank since its founding in 1913," said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities, in a note to clients. The U.S. central bank raised rates at its March meeting, pushing the overnight funds rate to a target range of 0.75 percent to 1 percent. Investors also looked ahead to a slew of economic data due later this week, including the April jobs report, which is due Friday. "We have some more data later this week, so I'd expect [relative] volatility to pick up in the coming days," said Matt Weller, senior market analyst at Faraday Research. Equities closed mixed on Monday after a brief shock stemming from President Donald Trump's comments on breaking up the big banks. In an interview with Bloomberg, Trump said he was "looking at that right now." Stocks declined sharply after Trump's remarks but managed to rebound. "That seems pretty alarming, but if you look beyond the headlines, the Vix sustained those levels for most of 2004 and 2005," said Faraday's Weller. "So it may not be indicative that a top is near." In economic news, U.S. automakers will be releasing monthly sales numbers throughout the day. Earnings season continued, with Mondelez and Gilead Sciences set to report after the bell.

The company announced revenue of $52.9 billion, up from $50.6 billion during the same quarter a year ago, an increase of around 4.5%. Its net income rose to $11.03 billion, rising from $10.52 billion year-over-year (YoY). It was a bit of a mixed bag for Apple's hardware range, with iPhone sales declining by around 1%, with 50.8 million units sold, compared with 51.2 million last year. iPad sales fell from 10.3 million to 8.92 million last quarter, a drop of around 13%; but there was a modest YoY increase in Mac sales which rose from 4 million to 4.2 million. However, Apple Watch sales almost doubled YoY, and Apple's Tim Cook said that its wearable device sales - which includes not just Watches, but also its range of headphones - were the 'size of a Fortune 500 company' over the last twelve months, putting its annual revenue from those accessories at more than $5.1 billion. However, it's certainly interesting that Apple insisted on presenting that information in such a vague, abstract way, rather than simply dishing out some real numbers to tell the story of how successful its wearable devices really are. Apple had no qualms about boasting of the success of its services business with some actual numbers to back it up, though. Its services revenue - which comes from products such as the App Store, iTunes, iCloud storage, and Apple Music subscriptions - rose by around 18% YoY to $7.04 billion, and now accounts for 13.3% of Apple's total revenue. Apple expects to generate between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion during its next fiscal quarter.

Currently, it’s a requirement for companies like Apple to publicly share details of its driverless vehicle testing processes, which goes against the company’s usual process of keeping software and hardware developments a secret prior to release. In a letter from the Cupertino-based firm, Apple says it is “investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation”, adding that the company is “excited” about the potential of autonomous systems in numerous fields including transport. The document asks that the DMV amends or clarifies its positions in the areas of disengagement reporting, definitions and testing without safety drivers, citing concern surrounding inconsistent disengagement reporting can lead to media coverage that causes confusion and misunderstanding amongst the public. In its letter to the DMV, Apple says the following: “Apple suggests the following changes to the disengagement reporting requirements to achieve an objective set of data to accurately and clearly inform the public about the safety of the automated vehicles being tested A disengagement should be defined as an unexpected event or failure that requires the safety driver to take control of the vehicle in order to prevent a crash or traffic violation. A disengagement should not be reported for the following: – Operational constraints where either the safety driver has been trained to disengage the system, or when the system detects the constraint and disengages automatically. For example, a system that requires the safety driver to navigate through a construction zone. –  System errors or failures. For example, a software bug or sensor dropout that does not affect the safe operation of the system. – Discretionary decisions made by the safety driver. For example, when the safety driver perceives a vehicle is approaching too quickly and opts to disengage the system. – Any tests that are planned to result in a disengagement. – The end of a test or experiment. Additionally, the proposed requirement in §227.50(b)(3)(B)(vi) to describe the type of incident that would have happened without the disengagement should be removed. It requires speculation about future events that have not occurred” Last month Apple was granted a permit for testing autonomous vehicles on public roads, and has already deployed three Lexus RX SUVs – similar vehicles to those used by arch-rival Google (below) – equipped with an array of sensors and cameras.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple (AAPL) Misses Q2 iPhone Sales Estimates, 50.8 Million Units Sold Shutterstock photo Apple AAPL just released its second-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings data, and as always, the investment world is buzzing. Coming into today, one of the hottest points of discussion surrounding Apple was iPhone sales, and the new report has provided us with some updated numbers. Apple’s second fiscal quarter marks the second full quarter of iPhone 7 sales. Of course, the iPhone 7 caused great controversy upon its announcement after Apple chose not to include the industry-standard 3.5mm headphone jack on the device, but the device seems almost overlooked as investors are already gearing up for the 10 th anniversary iPhone 8. iPhone sales have typically accounted for around 60% of Apple’s revenue, but total sales of the phone have not been consistently climbing like they once did. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, Apple iPhone unit sales came in at about 45.5 million, down 5% year-over-year. Last quarter, during the all-important holiday season, Apple sold 78.290 million iPhone units. This represented 5% year-over-year growth-the first quarter of iPhone sales growth after three consecutive quarterly declines. According to today’s report, Apple sold 50.8 million iPhones in the second quarter. This was a 1% drop from the year-ago quarter. Today’s figures came in short of our consensus estimate, which called for unit sales of 51.2 million. This consensus figure was based on the research of 19 analysts and can be found in our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file. These estimates are updated daily and are based on the independent research of expert stock analysts. Learn more here >>> Want more stock market analysis from this author?

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Industry Apple delivers higher profits, but iPhone sales slip Apple delivers higher profits, but iPhone sales slip Apple reported a rise in quarterly profits but its shares took a hit from slow-growing revenues and weaker iPhone sales ahead of a 10-year- anniversary model on the horizon. By: AFP | San Francisco | Published: May 3, 2017 5:12 AM Apple said that its profit climbed 4.9 per cent to slightly more than USD 11 billion on revenue rising 4.6 per cent to USD 52.9 billion in the quarterly that ended April 1.(Reuters) Apple reported a rise in quarterly profits but its shares took a hit from slow-growing revenues and weaker iPhone sales ahead of a 10-year- anniversary model on the horizon. Apple said that its profit climbed 4.9 per cent to slightly more than USD 11 billion on revenue rising 4.6 per cent to USD 52.9 billion in the quarterly that ended April 1. Shares of the California-based company were down nearly two per cent to USD 144.79 in after-market trades that followed released of the earnings figures. “We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus,” Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in the earnings release. You may also like to watch: Cook said the company has seen “great” response to new iPhone 7 Red Special Edition models and is “thrilled with the strong momentum of our services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter.” Still, iPhone sales dipped slightly compared with a year ago to 50.8 million units, below most forecast for the key profit machine for Apple. Apple also announced that its board of directors has authorised an addition USD 50 billion for dividends and buying back shares in the company, raising to USD 300 billion the total amount of cash to be spent in the program during the coming two years. While Apple has become the world’s most valuable company, analysts are looking at how the company is diversifying in the face of a saturated smartphone market and increasing competition. The report showed weaker sales of iPads and Mac computers, and a drop in revenue from “other” products including the Apple Watch, specific figures for which were not released. Apple also reported a 14 per cent drop in revenues from a year earlier for “Greater China,” dropping the region behind Europe and the Americas in terms of sales. Apple’s cash holdings meanwhile rose to a record $256.8 billion, a figure which raises questions for how the company will manage its massive reserves. No Comments.

As Yahoo Finance previously reported in April, the San Francisco-based fitness tracker company is gearing up to release both devices later this year after a series of production snafus delayed the smartwatch project. “It was originally planned for this spring to likely get ahead of whenever Apple plans their normal fall announcement,” a source familiar with the matter told Yahoo Finance. “Fitbit always likes to try and get in front of it.” As you can see in the photo above, the watch resembles a somewhat more evolved version of a product in the company’s current product line, the Blaze. “It was very retro-looking with the lines and stuff — definitely not sexy,” another source previously told Yahoo Finance of the upcoming smartwatch. “Several employees who saw the design complained about it.” Specs on the new products The smartwatch, codenamed “Higgs” internally, will sport a color display with 1,000 nits of brightness similar to the Apple Watch Series 2, a built-in GPS chip, heart-rate monitoring, the ability to make touchless payments, the ability to store and play music from Pandora (P), and four days of battery life between charges, according to the two sources familiar with the matter. All those features will come housed in an aluminum unibody design, which will let users swap watch bands when it eventually hits shelves this fall for around $300. A photo of Fitbit's upcoming earbuds, which was leaked to Yahoo Finance.More Fitbit also plans on releasing a pair of Bluetooth earbuds, codenamed “Parkside” internally, alongside the smartwatch, according to two of Yahoo Finance’s sources. Similar in design to Beats and Apple’s (AAPL) Beats X earbuds, Project Parkside will hang around your neck. Expect the wireless earbuds in two colors, which the company will market as “Nightfall Blue” and “Lunar Gray,” for around $150. The “Nightfall Blue” version of Project Parkside is featured in the photo obtained by Yahoo Finance. It sports a metallic accent but otherwise appears to have a traditional-looking earbud design with in-ear molds to help drown out ambient noise. The design mishaps Project Higgs’ development has been a long, troubled journey, due in part to a number of design mishaps. The GPS feature in one of the near-final smartwatch prototypes for Project Higgs simply didn’t work because the antennae wasn’t in the right place, according to two sources familiar with the matter. That forced the Fitbit team to return to the drawing board and redesign the product so the GPS received a strong, consistent signal. A photo of Fitbit's upcoming smartwatch, which was leaked to Yahoo Finance.More Fitbit’s design team also ran into problems making Project Higgs fully waterproof, even though that’s a key design element of the Apple Watch Series 2 and a longstanding feature in many traditional watches. It was unclear as of the publication of this article whether the device will launch with the waterproof feature. If it is not waterproof, critics may perceive Project Higgs to be an inferior product to Apple’s, especially given that the smartwatch is still scheduled to launch roughly a year after the Apple Watch Series 2. Software Snafus Project Higgs has also run into problems on the software side. Yahoo Finance has learned that Pandora was not the first partner of choice when Fitbit envisioned music playing functionality for its smartwatch. A potential partnership with the popular Swedish streaming company Spotify was ruled out earlier on in development.  Read More Another photo of Fitbit's upcoming Smartwatch, which was leaked to Yahoo Finance.More And while Fitbit CEO James Park had promised an app store was in the works, Yahoo Finance has also confirmed with two sources the app store will very likely not arrive in time for Project Higgs’ fall launch. Instead, the device will launch with a small selection of customized apps. “Unfortunately, James let the cat out of the bag way too early with the app store news,” a source familiar with the matter told Yahoo Finance. A Fitbit spokesperson declined to comment on these details, referring instead to a previously released comment provided to Yahoo Finance. “We know there is a lot of interest in our entry into the smartwatch category,” the spokesperson previously said. “We don’t have news to share at this time and do not comment on rumors or speculation.” Fitbit is hanging its 2017 product line almost entirely on Project Higgs, according to sources. The only other new releases on its product roadmap for the year include Project Parkside and an internal hardware update to Fitbit’s previously launched WiFi-enabled weighing scale, Aria Scale. Fitbit cut 6% of its workforce earlier this year, and its fourth-quarter revenue plummeted 19% even with the help of the holiday season. If the Project Higgs’ launch disappoints, Fitbit may be forced to search for more revenue streams. Park told Yahoo Finance’s Dan Howley this January the company is trying to decrease its dependence on hardware sales and increase the importance of its software business through areas including social, health insurance and third-party developers. Fitbit will announce earnings this Wednesday, May 3, after the market closes. Last month, the company’s shares were down 3% after Yahoo Finance reported on the smartwatch troubles. — JP Mangalindan is a senior correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business.

Business CNBC.com Apple now pays the biggest dividend in the world, surpassing Exxon's payout There was a time when Apple investors were loath to call it a "dividend stock." Now it's the biggest dividend stock there is. Apple announced after the bell Tuesday a 10.5 percent increase in its dividend to $13.22 billion annually, surpassing Exxon Mobil's $12.77 billion payout and making it the biggest-paying dividend stock in the world. The iPhone maker reported quarterly earnings after the bell which slightly disappointed Wall Street as sales fell short of estimates. But it also said it was hiking its quarterly dividend to 63 cents a share from 57 cents a share. The giant payout increase, a luxury made possible by the tech company's now $256.8 billion cash hoard, should help cushion the blow. Business barrons.com General Electric: Who Ya Callin’ Lumpy? General Electric (GE) reported earnings on April 21--and the folks at Oppenheimer are just now getting out a final note on its results, which either says something about the complexity of General Electrics earnings or the pace of the work at Oppenheimer. Let's go with the former. General Electric is known for its complex numbers, and that's apparent from reading Oppenheimer's Christopher Glynn and Patrick Schuchard report on General Electric, in which they note that "core profit visibility remains lumpy."

Business Reuters Brent crude falls to five-month low, erases gains since OPEC agreed to cuts By Scott DiSavino NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brent crude oil prices fell on Tuesday to its lowest level in over five months, erasing all of the gains since OPEC agreed to cut production at the end of November, after breaking through a key technical support level. The market was already trading lower prior to the technical selloff on reports of rising output in the United States, Canada and Libya and declining compliance by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with the deal to cut output during the first half of this year. Brent futures fell $1.06, or 2.1 percent, to settle at $50.46 a barrel, the lowest close since Nov. 29 - the day before OPEC agreed to cut supply.

Business MarketWatch AMD’s stock plunges toward biggest loss in over 12 years Shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. plunged on heavy volume Tuesday toward their worst day in over 12 years, as the chipmaker’s results didn’t live up to analysts’ high hopes.

It has been a somewhat tough day in the Fairfax office so thanks for being patient with the paucity of posts and delays in publishing your comments. We will see you all again tomorrow from 9am.   4:38pm The sharemarket's seemingly relentless rise towards the elusive 6000-point threshold suffered a setback on Wednesday, as heavy selling in the big banks and major miners handed the ASX its worst session in six weeks. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index dropped 58 points, or 1 per cent, to 5892. Investors continued to take profits in the major lenders after ANZ Bank's disappointing half-yearly profit figure on Tuesday. ANZ shed another 2.8 per cent while NAB, which reports on Thursday, lost 2.7 per cent and CBA 1.7 per cent. Macquarie Group fell 1.3 per cent ahead of its earnings result on Friday. "It's time to get off the bank bandwagon," Bell Potter director of institutional Sales and trading Richard Coppleson said ahead of what is a traditionally poor month for the major lenders' stock. "I still see the banks higher by the end of the year, but a period of consolidation is ahead and from a trading view I'd be now taking profits and waiting." The pessimism extended to blue-chip miners BHP Billiton, which lost 2.3 per cent, and Rio Tinto, which fell 1 per cent. Fortescue dropped 0.9 per cent and South32 1.1 per cent. Meanwhile Woolworths gave up some of its recent gains, dropping a hefty 2.7 per cent. Wesfarmers, owner of Coles, climbed 0.2 per cent. "Stocks are vulnerable to a correction after their sharp gains since February last year," AMP Capital head of investment strategy Shane Oliver said. That said, their relative attractiveness compared to bonds "along with the favourable outlook for growth and profits suggests that any short-term pullback in shares will simply be a correction in a still rising trend". Also dragging on the index was a 27 per cent plunge in the share price of Vocus, as the telecommunications company revealed its second profit downgrade in the space of less than seven months. Brokers were harsh in their response. Citi analysts led by David Kaynes wrote that they "no longer have confidence that Vocus will be able to deliver on the full potential of its recently combined businesses". Energy stocks were among the winners on the day after global oil prices rebounded from six-week lows early Wednesday morning. Origin Energy climbed 2.3 per cent, Oil Search added 2 per cent, and Santos 2 per cent. Content marketing firm Isentia was the day's best performer, jumping 13 per cent after revealing an upbeat sale update at an investor conference in Sydney. Winners and losers in the ASX 200. Photo: Bloomberg 3:24pm ANZ Bank's bid to become a smaller but higher-returning bank has sparked predictions the lender could return billions in capital to shareholders by buying back its own shares. After the bank on Tuesday showed it was generating substantial capital as it hives off poorly performing assets, several analysts believe the lender will have more capital than it needs to satisfy the regulator, and return some of this to shareholders. That could take the form of a multi-billion dollar share buyback, analysts said, though this would not occur until the banking regulator settles on how much capital banks must hold against mortgages. APRA is expected to finalise its decision on bank capital, which protects lenders against a downturn, in the coming months. Under chief executive Shayne Elliott, ANZ has dumped lower-returning businesses, especially in Asia, launched a cost-cutting drive, and set its goals on becoming a smaller but higher-returning bank. While the bank's $3.4 billion profit performance on Tuesday disappointed investors, the result showed the bank's top tier capital was 10.1 per cent of assets, making it the best capitalised of the big four. This ratio is likely to climb significantly higher as ANZ sells off Asian retail assets, and there is an expectation is will also sell its remaining stake in China's Bank of Tianjin. Macquarie analyst Victor German said in a note this would take the bank's capital ratio to 11 per cent, and he said there was potential for share buybacks, a move that would increase earnings per share (EPS). "The key positive in this result was ongoing organic capital build-up," wrote Mr German, who has a neutral rating on the stock. "Given ongoing capital build-up we have now incorporated a capital return benefit of $3 billion to $4 billion." Citi's Craig Williams said that although ANZ Bank's road ahead appeared "bumpy" considering the weak revenue in its core Australian business, a "significant" capital management initiative appeared more likely. "We are more confident ANZ can grow EPS through significant capital initiatives following the completion of the divestment program and finalisation of APRA capital rules," wrote Mr Williams, who also has a neutral weighting. Morgan Stanley's Richard Wiles, who has an overweight rating on ANZ, also lifted his estimate for how much capital ANZ would deploy on buybacks in 2018-19, from $5 billion to $6 billion.  ANZ shares were down 1.8 per cent to $31.66 shortly after midday on Wednesday. ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott. Photo: Ben Rushton 1:19pm The chief investment officer of Platinum Asset Management, Andrew Clifford, says investors who are directing billions of dollars into low-cost index-tracking funds will be left disappointed when markets turn. "In bull markets everyone starts to believe it's easy and that they can do it themselves," he told The Australian Financial Review. "There will be times when it gets a bit harder." On Friday, Platinum said it would lower the fees it charges on managed funds to reflect the increased efficiencies if investing in global markets. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said the decision to cut its base management fees from 1.50 percentage points to 1.35 percentage points would cut earnings in 2018 by 10 per cent. While the fees were more aligned with its peers, the Morgan Stanley analysts said they were "not cheap". Platinum shares have fallen almost 13 per cent in two trading sessions since announcing the fee cuts, and have declined by about 17 per cent since the start of the year. The stock has halved since its February 2015 peak of about $9. The fund has suffered an acceleration of outflows of $500 million in March following about $500 million of outflows in February.

The MSCI Asia Pacific Index extended last week's gains, rising 0.5 percent to 150.21 as of 10:28 a.m. in Hong Kong after most markets reopened after the May Day holiday. That's the highest intraday level since June 2015. Yamaha Corp. was the top performer on the gauge, rising as much as 17 percent after forecasting record operating profit. In Hong Kong, footwear retailer Belle International Holdings Ltd. also gained as much 17 percent after getting a $6.8 billion buyout offer. Most markets across Asia rose, following the lead of the US, where the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index rose to a new record amid optimism over corporate profits. The yen weakened against the dollar for the fourth straight session and Japan's Topix rose 0.7 percent. South Korea's Kospi Index, which rallied past its record close in May 2011, has climbed 10 percent this year as foreigners snapped up $5.8 billion of shares. "Positive leads from Wall Street look set to power Asian markets at the start of the week," Jingyi Pan, Singapore-based market strategist for IG Asia, said in an email. Stocks were lower in Shanghai as Caixin Media and Markit Economics said its manufacturing purchasing managers' index slipped to 50.3 in April, the lowest since September.

It's the biggest single-day drop for the stock since 2001. "We expect the market to react harshly, and rightly so, towards Vocus' latest downgrade," UBS analysts led by Eric Choi write in May 2 note. Meeanwhile, Citi analysts led by David Kaynes wrote that they "no longer have confidence that Vocus will be able to deliver on the full potential of its recently combined businesses". Citi cut Vocus to 'neutral' in light of today's guidance downgrade.  The market's losses have extended since the open - the ASX200 is now down 0.5 per cent. Photo: Myriam Robin 11:48am There's some slightly gloomy research - though it depends how you look at it - out today from the RBC Capital Markets, whose chief US economist Tom Porcelli thinks the US economic observers should prepare themselves for "a big letdown". Put simply, he thinks forecasters have placed too much emphasis on 'soft' US data that shows sentiment at recent highs, despite such surveys not really being an imperfect measure of how people feel about the economy as a whole.  "It is a letdown based mostly on mismanaged expectations about sentiment," he wrote. "In our view this hard vs soft data conversation is completely overdone. "Think about this practically for a moment. When the University of Michigan calls folks to ask how they are feeling, when they give their response do you think any of them consider what it means from a GDP perspective? ... "Most purchasing managers have no idea what their response equates to in GDP terms. People have been feeling really good about the backdrop so they are going to answer the question in exuberant terms. So is ISM [which is an index of manufacturing activity] and consumer confidence going to slip? Of course they are and the growth rates suggested by those indicators are highly unlikely to be achieved!" "So you can either feel let down by the inevitable slippage in sentiment and succumb (as so many people will) to the silly/hysteric notion that 'the economy is losing momentum' or you can just come to grips with this reality that we thought was obvious: the recent exuberance in the sentiment numbers was overdone and growth was never going to achieve a 4%+ sustainable pace suggested by the so-called soft data." Speaking of US sentiment, the Nasdaq may have only edged up 0.1 per cent, or 3.76 points overnight, but that's still kept it at a record high. The tech-heavy index has surged in recent days, but this may be has high as it gets - for now at least. Nasdaq futures are lower this morning, having been weakened by a drop in Apple Inc. as traders awaited commentary from the Federal Reserve policy meeting. Apple dropped 2.3 percent in after-hours U.S. trading after reporting falling iPhone sales. 11:26am Downer EDI will not raise its $1.15 per share offer for Spotless, declaring its current $1.2 billion takeover bid to be "final." "The Downer board has determined that its offer price of $1.15 per Spotless share represents Downer's final offer price in the absence of a superior proposal," the company stated in a release to the ASX on Wednesday.  Spotless investors will now need to decide whether to accept the recommendation of the Spotless board, which has told investors to reject the offer, or take Downer's cash offer. Spotless shares closed on Tuesday at $1.09, and were trading at $1.08 this morning. Spotless's board claims Downer's offer is "opportunistic" and has been timed to take advantage of a historically low share price. Downer says that its offer provides "certain, all cash value" for Spotless shares in contrast to the "risk, uncertainty and time involved in the delivery of value by Spotless." Spotless shares were trading at 72.5¢ before Downer announced its takeover bid on March 21. There's more at the Australian Financial Review.  Downer CEO Grant Fenn has held firm on his offer for Spotless.   11:03am RGC Corp (who owns the Athlete's foot chain of footwear stores) plunged 27 per cent on Monday after downgrading its full-year 2017 profits. But as Joe Aston writes in Rear Window, at least the directors have spared themselves some (financial) pain: The footwear retailer downgraded its FY17 earnings forecast a second time on Monday, having promised $90 million in EBITDA at its full-year results announcement in August last year, then nudged it southward to between $85 and $88 million at its interim result in February. On Monday, it was revised again to between $74 million and $80 million. Its shares headed in the same direction, down 27 per cent to 65¢ at the closing bell. The company's directors will be relieved to have relieved themselves of so much stock in RCG's far happier FY16 – $38.5 million of stock to be precise. Yes, on March 4 last year, five of the board's 10 members sold down at $1.50 a pop. Chairman Ivan Hammerschlag (founder of Freedom Furniture) cashed in $9.6 million, co-chief executive Hilton Brett trousered $5.5 million, CFO Michael Hirschowitz took home $6.75 million, non-executive director David Gordon (who is also chairman of the sinking Ten Network) made $8.85 million while Athlete's Foot boss Michael Cooper made $7.8 million.  Read more at the Financial Review. RCG Corporation shares plunged 27 per cent after it downgraded its 2017 full-year profit guidance for the second time.  Photo: Jessica Shapiro 10:39am A senior property data expert has warned Australians not to fall for "propaganda" claiming the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets have already cooled. Louis Christopher, head of SQM Research, said all available data contradicted rival firm CoreLogic, whose numbers last week sparked dire headlines and talk of a market crash. Even Treasurer Scott Morrison cited CoreLogic's numbers on Friday to argue the housing market needed a "scalpel, not Labor's chainsaw". "The concern here is that we've actually had the Treasurer refer to the index, basically to imply that he doesn't really need to do that much more on affordability," Mr Christopher told The New Daily. "It couldn't be further from the truth. Our opinion is that the market continues to boom and APRA will likely have to step into the market later this year. "This is being used as propaganda, as an excuse for people to hold back from taking real action in the market." Unlike CoreLogic, SQM Research calculated that asking prices for houses rose over the last month by 1.1 per cent in Melbourne and 2.2 per cent in Sydney, coupled with steadily falling property listings and strong auction clearance rates around 80 per cent. Falling listings were probably a sign that vendors were "holding back" because they expected prices to rise even higher, Mr Christopher said. ​CoreLogic's own research director, Tim Lawless, urged "caution" last week about over-interpreting the company's numbers. He said "potentially there is some seasonality creeping into these numbers", as the index is generally moderated in April and May. The Reserve Bank dumped CoreLogic as a data source last year over concerns about its methodology. Mr Christopher said while the data continued to paint a picture of a booming market, he did not rule out a "slowdown" later in 2017, especially if regulator APRA cracks down further on bank lending. By "real action" on affordability, he meant a temporary cut to immigration; incentives for migrants to move to regional areas; and the replacement of state-imposed stamp duties with a federal land tax. Talk of the end of the housing price boom in Sydney and Melbourne is premature and "propaganda".  Back to top 10:26am Vocus Group plunged 27.76 per cent at the open after it unveiled its second profit downgrade in the space of less than seven months (see below), slashing its guidance for underlying earnings by almost a quarter.  The ASX200 index is only off a touch - 0.1 per cent, or 6 points lower - but several names have taken big hits. Pact Group Holdings is down 12.1 per cent, while G8 Education is 8.0 per cent lower.  On a sector-by-sector basis, telecomms were the biggest drag, largely due to Vocus. Materials and financials started the day lower, with ANZ continuing to fall after its results yesterday - it was down 1.1 per cent at the open. Also down strongly at the open - off 2.3 per cent - was Fairfax Media, after the New Zealand Commerce Commission denied its proposed merger with NZME. But media company's fortunes recovered to be down just 0.9 per cent in early trading. Real estate and utilities were up.  "After inching into new high ground for the year on Monday, the ASX 200 has lacked the momentum to break clearly through resistance," said CMC Markets chief market analyst Ric Spooner. "Markets are looking for a catalyst to trigger a change in investor outlook to reignite the uptrend. "While metals prices were firm overnight, China's manufacturing PMI's have not helped the outlook for mining stocks. Both the official and Caixin manufacturing PMI's eased in April. Manufacturing employment declined while cost pressures eased and growth in output and new orders slowed. This overall weakening in trend growth in China's manufacturing sector may be starting to reflect the impact of the wind back in government economic stimulus." Gaining at the open were Isentia Group and Bellamy's up 6.2 and 4.0 per cent respectively.  Photo: Myriam Robin 9:58am on 3 May 2017 Fairfax chief executive Greg Hywood says the Australian media company will have to make cuts in New Zealand after the country's competition watchdog blocked a merger with NZME. The New Zealand Commerce Commission denied permission for the country's two largest newspaper networks to merge on the grounds that it would likely lessen competition for advertising and readers. But Mr Hywood said the commission was too focused on traditional media and that Fairfax, the publisher of this blog, will now look to save money in the face of competition from global giants. "This decision does nothing to address the challenge of the global search and social giants, which produce no local journalism, employ very few New Zealanders, and pay minimal, if any, local taxes," Mr Hywood said. NZCC chairman Mark Berry said the commission accepted the merger could extend the lifespan of some newspapers and save the companies costs of between $A37 million to $A184 million over the next five years, but that the benefits did not outweigh the negative impact. Mr Hywood said Fairfax had been working on an alternative plan in case of this outcome, which it will now implement. "In light of the NZCC decision, an even greater focus on cost efficiency will be necessary," Mr Hywood said. "Further publishing frequency changes and consolidation of titles is an inevitability." Fairfax Media Chief Executive Officer Greg Hywood. Photo: James Brickwood 9:56am on 3 May 2017 Richard Coppleson, the Bell Potter institutional trader and author of the famous Coppo Report, says it's time to sell the banks. He still sees them ending the year higher, but told clients yesterday that "a period of consolidation is ahead and from a trading view I'd be now taking profits and waiting". He's been on something of a run lately about the likely underperformance of banks in the next little while. Monday's Coppo Report outlined how the banks tend to underperform the market in May – they've lost, on average, 1.6 per cent in the month if you consider every year since 2000. " The banks as I mentioned many times and again yesterday perform poorly in May ... and after the big run they have had and following the ANZ result – it's time to 'get off the bank bandwagon'." The big banks all led the index lower yesterday after ANZ's result. It was, as star UBS bank analyst Jonathan Mott described it, a "lumpy" result. But others pointed to positives, including the bank's announcement it was going to neutralise the impact of its dividend reinvestment plan. Usually, such plans allow investors to buy more shares in a company using their dividend, which are sold at a discount. If the shares are new, it can function as something of a stealth capital-raising. But ANZ said it would "neutralise" this scheme, meaning after granting new shares to investors, it will then purchase an equivalent number of shares on the open market (as approved by APRA). Given this, perhaps the market had "over-reacted" a bit in its punishment of ANZ yesterday, said Atlas Fund Management's Hugh Dive. Neutralising the DRP is "a nice sign of confidence in their capital situation", he said. Bell Potter's Richard Coppleson said when it came to the big banks, "I'd be now taking profits and waiting".  Photo: ASA 9:35am on 3 May 2017 SPONSORED POST As local investors fret over bank earnings, eyes are turning to the US Fed's rates decision tonight, writes IG strategist Chris Weston: Keep in mind the interest rate markets are pricing a 60% chance of a hike from the Fed in June, so this could move depending on the tone of the statement. The market that got the bulk of the attention has clearly been US and Brent crude, with price falling 2.5% on the session and breaking to the lowest levels since November 2016 on the front month futures contract. There has been little news that I have seen that has driven price down so heavily, and while we have seen the Saudi crown prince Mohammed Bin Salman talking about a desire to see price hold $US45, on the whole, he didn't say much that was overtly negative for the barrel. One could say that the below-forecast total US vehicle sales at 16.81 million (vs consensus at 17.10 million) could be seen as a tailwind for the oil move, although price was already moving prior to the data release. Certainly, the poor vehicle sales print can be added to a growing list of below-par US data points of late and that will almost certainly be a theme the Federal Reserve will explore in tonight's FOMC statement. Recall, Q2 is shaping up to be in far better shape and we are already seeing calls from economists for growth north of 3%. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's model (for what it's worth) is calling for Q2 GDP at 4.27%. This seems a little high however and will likely be revised lower. Read more.

Under pressure from shareholders to hand over more of its $US250 billion-plus hoard of cash and investments, Apple boosted its capital return program by $50 billion, increased its share repurchase authorization by $35 billion and raised its quarterly dividend by 10.5 per cent (EDs: !). Investors were unmoved, sending shares of the world's most valuable listed company down 1.9 percent at $144.65 in after-hours trading. Apple sold 50.76 million iPhones in its fiscal second quarter ended April 1, down from 51.19 million a year earlier. Analysts on average had estimated iPhone sales of 52.27 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri argued the decline was not as bad as it looked, given the peculiarities of how phone sales are calculated. The company reports what are called "sell-in" figures for the iPhone, a measure of how many units it sells to retailers, rather than "sell-through" figures, which measure how many phones are actually sold to consumers. Despite the dip in unit sales, iPhone revenues rose 1.2 per cent in the quarter, helped by a higher average selling price. Expectations are building ahead of Apple's 10th-anniversary iPhone range this fall, with investors hoping that the launch would help bolster sales. Apple typically launches its new iPhones in September. A big jump in sales usually follows in the holiday quarter, before demand tapers over the next few quarters as customers hold back ahead of the next launch. Apple's 10th-anniversary iPhone range might sport features such as wireless charging, 3-D facial recognition and a curved display. "There is a general softening in phone demand to contend with as well as expectations of a big upgrade, all of which softens the blow of this quarter's miss," said James McQuivey, a Forrester Research analyst. "If we see Apple downplaying expectations before the next upgrade cycle, it might mean that the company isn't confident it will beat those expectations." Apple sold fewer of its iconic iPhone than expected over the quarter. Photo: Supplied Back to top 9:17am on 3 May 2017 In early and unwelcome corporate news, junior telecommunications group Vocus has unveiled its second profit downgrade in the space of less than seven months, slashing its forecast for underlying earnings from between $205 million and $215 million to $160 million to $165 million. The trading update, released after the market closed yesterday, follows a weaker-than-expected trading outlook issued in late November. Back then, chief executive Geoff Horth told investors that the company's full-year results would be skewed to the June half. However, Tuesday's profit downgrade suggests a major deterioration in the performance of the business. Vocus said revenue was now likely to be around $1.8 billion, compared with an earlier forecast of $1.9 billion. The company said an accounting review of "negotiated contract terms on a number of large projects included in the 2HFY17 forecast" had found that "the revenue associated with these projects will be predominantly recognised in future periods rather than recognised as an upfront contribution in FY17". This wiped $40 million of the revenue outlook at $33 million off the outlook for EBITDA. Another $10 million of EBIDTA was lost through the "impact of lower than forecast billings combined with an increase in service delivery headcount in the enterprise and wholesale division". A further $12 million of EBITDA disappeared to higher costs in "group services" while "other trading variances across the group" will wipe out another $10 million in earnings. The EBITDA forecast for 2016-17 has been cut from $430 million to $450 million to $365 million to $375 million. Vocus now expects net debt will be $1.1 billion to $1 billion at June 30, but said this was "well within" covenant levels. The telco's share price has plunged more than 60 per cent in the last 12 months, after it grew rapidly through a string of big deals in the past two years, including a $1.2 billion merger with Amcom, a $3.8 million merger with M2 and the acquisition of Nextgen for $807 million. Vocus chief executive Geoff Horth has more bad news for shareholders. Photo: Ben Rushton 9:14am on 3 May 2017 Wall Street edged higher overnight as gains for the tech and industrial sectors countered weakness in auto and energy stocks and investors digested a heavy day of earnings reports Ford shares dropped 4.4 per cent and General Motors fell 2.9 pe rcent, as major automakers posted declines in US new vehicle sales for April.

Apple shares had gained 0.6 per cent during regular trading ahead of the report. We'll have more on the Apple report in a tic. Investors also were awaiting other significant events, including tonight's expected statement from the Federal Reserve, which began meeting on Tuesday, and Friday's US employment report. The Fed is widely expected to stand pat on interest rates, but may offer hints on the possibility of a rate hike in June. The benchmark S&P 500 is approaching record highs during an earnings season that has generally exceeded expectations. Overall, profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.9 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "The technicals in general look good for the S&P," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management. "The fundamentals are improving, particularly as the earnings season unfolds here." The Dow Jones rose 0.2 per cent, the S&P 500 gained 0.1 per cent, and the Nasdaq Composite nudged only marginally higher. Oil fell to the lowest in more than a month as the US crude glut is seen moving to brimming fuel tanks. The drop intensified after Saudi Arabia signalled it's faring better than expected with low prices. West Texas Intermediate closed 2.4 per cent lower overnight. The S&P 500 has climbed 12 per cent since President Donald Trump's Nov. 8 election, fueled by hopes for his plans for tax cuts, deregulation and infrastructure spending, though investors have questioned his ability to enact his agenda. "The administration continues to issue tonnes of contradictory or hard-to-understand proposals and ideas and I think it has left this market a little bit confused about next steps," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management. Investors have generally been buoyed by the US quarterly earnings season thus far. Photo: AP 8:59am on 3 May 2017 Good morning and welcome to the Markets Live blog for Wednesday.

GeekWire takes the Farhad Challenge by Kurt Schlosser on May 2, 2017 at 3:46 pmMay 2, 2017 at 9:38 pm Comments  4 Share  92 Tweet Share  8 Reddit Email Cloud Summit: Early-bird tix on sale here! (GeekWire Illustration) It was a tweet that stopped almost everyone at GeekWire and started a conversation in our Slack channel: “What’s the order in which you would drop Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook from your life, if forced to — from first to last.” That was the question posed by New York Times writer Farhad Manjoo on Tuesday afternoon. In less than 30 minutes, the replies on his tweet were coming in hot and approaching 200. He’d clearly hit a tech nerve. What’s the order in which you would drop Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook from your life, if forced to — from first to last. — Farhad Manjoo 🐣 (@fmanjoo) May 2, 2017 As dedicated followers of all of those companies and users of many of the products that they make, several of us couldn’t help but debate which ones would be easier to give up, which could be more seamlessly replaced by other services or gadgets and which ones were too much of a part of our daily digital lives. It seems like a simple enough “game,” to drop the names of four companies and say pick your favorites. But these are four of the biggest companies in the world (sorry, Microsoft, you didn’t make the tweet) and billions of users interact with their products all day, every day. So how do they rate for GeekWire staffers? And how do they rate for you? Make sure you share your list in the comments below. Todd Bishop, GeekWire co-founder: Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon “Apple and Google make great products, but they are largely replaceable in the digital world, thanks to Windows PCs and Microsoft Bing. Facebook less so. But you’ll have to pry my Amazon Prime from my cold, digital hands.” John Cook, GeekWire co-founder: Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google “I would ditch Amazon first. I try hard not to buy new things, and when I do, I’d rather support local shops. I have other reasons why I don’t shop on Amazon, but that’s a story for another day. Next up, I’d say goodbye to Facebook. I barely use it for personal use — I think my Twitter feed is still auto-populating my page. (Sorry followers!) The business case of Facebook is a bit more interesting to me, since it is a strong referral source of readers to GeekWire, so that would be hard to give up. The final two are really tough. Can there be a tie between Google and Apple? Probably not. If I had to choose, I think I’d eliminate Apple next. I can always ditch my iPhone and learn the Android ecosystem, including picking up a Google Pixel phone. My Android friends have been telling me to make the switch for years. Also, Microsoft just came out with a new $999 Surface notebook that would replace my MacBook Pro. I’d probably regret that decision on day one. My last MacBook I used so hard, that I wore off the varnish on the space bar. It would be tough to say goodbye to Apple and my MacBook and iPhone, but I just can’t live without Google, from Gmail to Google Docs to Google analytics.” Nat Levy, reporter: Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google “Apple is completely replaceable for me, and that’s true of Facebook to a point as well. Amazon is pretty unparalleled in what it does, and I use a lot of its services outside of e-commerce (Prime Video, Prime Music, Prime Photos). Google not only is my life, but it also runs my life with my email, calendar and cell phone all under that same umbrella.” Tom Krazit, cloud tech editor: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google “Facebook is pretty dumb, even the kids are ditching it. I like Amazon as a store, but I can buy things local pretty easy if I have to. (Boycotting AWS would be practically impossible so I’m not counting that). I love my iPhone and would hate to part with it, but I could get an Android (theoretically). I’m not quite sure what I’d do without Google search and email, both personally and professionally.” Alan Boyle, space and science editor: Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google “First to go would be Apple, assuming I would get an Android phone (see below). I’m not invested at all in iTunes or other Apple services. The only link I have is through the iPhone. Then Facebook goes. For me, it’s mostly work-related rather than part of my personal life. Then it gets tougher. I would have to pry the Amazon.com URL away from my wife’s clawing fingers, but I mostly use it for Amazon Prime video rather than shopping per se. I’d also have to give up my Kindle and Echo, which would hurt. But I think I’d rather do that than forgo Google search, maps, email, etc., etc. Unless … I switched fully over to the Microsoft/Bing/Hotmail realm. For what it’s worth, if they added Microsoft to the list, I would definitely have to throw Google out the Windows.” Taylor Soper, reporter: Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google “Google is my email and smartphone — too crucial to drop. It’s a cool question because, what is replaceable and what isn’t?” Monica Nickelsburg, reporter: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google “I hold onto Facebook for just a small fraction of the services it offers and it doesn’t bring me much joy. I like my iPhone but I could live without it. I don’t really use other Apple products and I have a lot of gripes (ahem, charger port) with the company. I use Amazon almost every day but I wish it supported more small businesses. Getting rid of it would be a moral play. Google is my life.” Kurt Schlosser, reporter: Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple “As much as I like Prime, I still do most of my shopping in person. I’m addicted to Facebook, but ditching it would be a nice life change. There are other search engines and email providers, but there is only one iPhone.” Clare McGrane, reporter: Apple, Amazon, Facebook, (Microsoft), Google “I’ve literally never owned an Apple device or used any of their products (maybe iTunes once upon a time). I also rarely use Amazon, because I prefer in-person shopping and even when I order things online I prefer to get them directly from small local businesses. I could drop both of those from my life and it really wouldn’t be too different. I mostly use Facebook to keep in touch with family overseas. But I am pretty tied in to Windows. I would be pretty lost without Google, because I have an Android phone and Gmail, and a lot of my work life is organized on Chrome.” Cara Kuhlman, advertising and marketing coordinator: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google “If I didn’t need it for work I would ditch Facebook and not miss it. It creeps me out. I use a MacBook but would be happy with a new PC, they’ve come a long way and are much more affordable. I use Amazon for video services but really only shop online for items that I can’t easily source locally (there are a lot of stores in an urban area) and I use Gmail, have an Android device and probably use Google in many other ways I don’t realize. It also creeps me out.” Tim Ellis, contributor: Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google “For me the first two are easy. I literally don’t use Apple today already, and I barely use FB. Between Amazon and Google it’s a tough call but like Taylor, Google is pretty integrated into my phone (and smart home) so that’s gotta go last.” And, because it’s the internet and because the possibilities are endless, this is already happening: Piggy-backing off of this: In what order would you drop Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter?

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 3 May 2017 | MYT 5:30 AM Wall Street closes higher on heavy earnings day; Fed on tap DJIA rose 0.17pct to 20,949 while S&P added 0.12% to 2,3917. US crude fell 1.84% to $47.94 and Brent fell 1.46% to $50.77 NEW YORK: Wall Street closed higher on Tuesday as gains for the tech and industrial sectors countered weakness in auto and energy stocks and investors digested a heavy day of earnings reports. Ford shares dropped 4.4 percent and General Motors fell 2.9 percent, as major automakers posted declines in U.S. new vehicle sales for April. After the market closed, Apple shares fell more than 1 percent after the company reported a surprise drop in iPhone sales for the quarter. Apple shares had gained 0.6 percent during regular trading ahead of the report. Investors also were awaiting other significant events later in the week, including Wednesday's expected statement from the Federal Reserve, which began meeting on Tuesday, and Friday's U.S. employment report. The Fed is widely expected to stand pat on interest rates, but may offer hints on the possibility of a rate hike in June. The benchmark S&P 500 is approaching record highs during an earnings season that has generally exceeded expectations. Overall, profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.9 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "The technicals in general look good for the S&P," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. "The fundamentals are improving, particularly as the earnings season unfolds here." The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 36.43 points, or 0.17 percent, to 20,949.89, the S&P 500 gained 2.83 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,391.16 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.76 points, or 0.06 percent, to 6,095.37. The technology sector rose 0.3 percent, its fourth straight day of gains. Industrials gained 0.5 percent, helped by airlines shares after Delta said its passenger unit revenue increased 1 percent in April. Energy shares fell 0.5 percent as oil prices weakened. The S&P 500 has climbed 11.8 percent since President Donald Trump's Nov. 8 election, fueled by hopes for his plans for tax cuts, deregulation and infrastructure spending, though investors have questioned his ability to enact his agenda. "The administration continues to issue tons of contradictory or hard-to-understand proposals and ideas and I think it has left this market a little bit confused about next steps," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. In earnings news, Advanced Micro Devices tumbled 24.4 percent after the chipmaker's second-quarter gross margins forecast raised some concerns. The stock was the biggest percentage decliner in the S&P 500. Archer Daniels Midland sank 8.9 percent and CVS Health fell 3.6 percent after their respective quarterly reports. Coach shares rose 11.4 percent, making it the biggest gainer on the S&P, as the handbag maker cut back on discounting in the United States and sold more expensive bags. Advancing and declining issues were roughly even on the NYSE, while on Nasdaq, a 1.26-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 47 new 52-week highs and 9 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 145 new highs and 51 new lows. About 7 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 6.5 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.- Reuters Earlier report: Wall St modestly higher as Apple leads tech stocks' gains (Update 1) NEW YORK: US stocks were modestly higher in early afternoon trading on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq Composite eking out another record high, helped by an Apple-led rise in technology stocks. However, investors held off from making big bets as the two-day Federal Reserve meeting kicked off. The Fed is widely expected to stand pat on interest rates, but investors are awaiting the central bank’s statement on Wednesday for hints on the possibility of a rate hike in June. The markets’ gains were capped by a decline in auto stocks after automakers reported a fall in new vehicle sales for April. Ford dropped 3.8%, while General Motors fell 2.8%. “I think the auto sales numbers have caused the market to take a step back,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. “I think people are reading too much into that. There’s a fear that is building on last quarter’s GDP numbers that the consumer is pulling back, which we don’t think is the case.” Data last week showed the US economy grew at its slowest pace in three years in the first quarter. But, Schutte said strong corporate earnings have helped hold the market up. “With earnings rising, that is backdrop for positive stock returns moving forward.” Overall, profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.9% in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At 12:41am ET (1641 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 43.41 points, or 0.21%, at 20,956.87. The S&P 500 was up 3.36 points, or 0.14%, at 2,391.69 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 6.94 points, or 0.11%, at 6,098.54. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with the technology index’s 0.39% rise leading the advancers. Apple hit a record high for the second straight day. The iPhone maker is due to report results after the close of market. A 0.3% fall in consumer staples led the laggard. CVS Health was down 2.8% at US$79.70, while Archer Daniels Midland fell 8.2% to US$41.98, both after reporting results. Dow component Pfizer was down 1% at US$33.43 after the drugmaker’s quarterly revenue missed estimates. Advanced Micro Devices tumbled 18.9% to US$11.04 after the chipmaker’s second-quarter gross margins forecast raised some concerns. Coach rose as much as 12.2% to a nine-month high of US$43.47 after the handbag maker reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,477 to 1,311. On the Nasdaq, 1,542 issues fell and 1,232 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 43 new 52-week highs and nine new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 129 new highs and 36 new lows. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Stocks , Earnings , Forex , Investing , Markets Related Stories You May Be Interested Wall Street closes higher on heavy earnings day; Fed on tap Trading ideas: Ikhmas Jaya, Anzo, Trive Property, Vitrox New Robo advisory is the right way to go Internet abuzz with video of freak storm in Rawang EKA Noodles chairman and group MD resign from the board More young investors entering into Malaysian market Others Also Read U.S. officials want study of world records proposal Top-notch security screen Kicking out the jams for a blast Property Related advertisement Latest News BNP Paribas Q1 profit rise powered by trading rebound I-Bhd sure of RM500m revenue by 2018 Cagamas mulls RM11b bond and sukuk this year Tender for KL-Singapore high speed rail asset firm by year end NZ nixes merger of top 2 publishing groups citing concentration of media power Most Viewed in Business EKA Noodles chairman and group MD resign from the board Several banks at 52-week high, ringgit shines More young investors entering into Malaysian market Ringgit extends gains against US$ early Wednesday Sunway gaining investors interests, stable growth across its businesses New Robo advisory is the right way to go Trading volume hits 1b in first hour Wednesday, KLCI climbs Oil price rebounds early Wednesday on US stocks drawdown Apple posts surprise dip in iPhone sales, shares fall Tender for KL-Singapore high speed rail asset firm by year end advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Tech News | 02 May 2017 | Print  | Comment (0) Apple’s Q2 2017 Financial Results Show Slight Growth by Josh Centers and Michael E. Cohen Reporting on its second quarter 2017 financial results, Apple has announced net profits of $11.03 billion ($2.10 per diluted share) on revenues of $52.9 billion. The company’s revenues were up 5 percent compared to the $50.6 million revenue recorded in the somber year-ago quarter (see “In Q2 2016, Apple Sees First Revenue Decline in 13 Years,” 26 April 2016). The big news — literally — was Apple’s cash hoard, which has swollen to $256.8 billion — over a quarter of a trillion dollars. Perhaps Apple will be announcing macOS 10.13 Erebor at WWDC in honor of the dragon-plagued mountain that houses a similar-sized treasure trove in J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Hobbit.” In other good news, the Mac continued its unlikely ascent, with a whopping 14 percent year-over-year revenue boost, with 4.2 million units sold. Mac sales have accounted for $25 billion of Apple’s revenue in the past year. Services revenue was also once again a bright and shiny spot for Apple, increasing year over year by 18 percent and accounting for some $7 billion. Cook attributed the growth primarily to Apple Pay, which has seen transaction volume climb by 450 percent over the past year, and to double-digit revenue growth in Apple Music and iCloud Drive subscriptions. Cook said that paid App Store subscriptions, including those offered by third-party apps, now exceeded 165 million. Apple CFO Luca Maestri said Apple’s goal is to double Services revenue by 2020. Given the stratospheric growth of the Services segment for the past several quarters, that seems entirely doable. There was less enthusiasm surrounding Apple’s core iPhone business. It saw revenue growth, but just barely: 1 percent year over year, with a total of 50.8 million units sold. Apple must be making more on each iPhone, since the company actually saw a 1 percent decrease in units sold compared with the same quarter last year. Cook said Apple had miscalculated the product mix, with the iPhone 7 Plus being more popular than expected, which might explain how Apple made more money with fewer sales. On the negative end of things, the iPad’s downward revenue spiral continued, posting a 12 percent drop year over year, with only 8.9 million units sold in Q2 2017. Nonetheless, according to Cook, although iPad sales growth continued to decline, the quarter’s results did exceed Apple’s expectations. CFO Luca Maestri also noted “supply constraints” for iPad, implying that might have been one cause for the lower sales. The Other Products category, which took a beating in Q1 2017 (see “Apple Sees Apparent Return to Growth with Q1 2017’s Record Results,” 31 January 2017), recorded a staggering 31 percent increase in year-over-year revenue. That’s good news for fans of products like the AirPods, Apple Watch, and Beats headphones, which Cook identified as the main drivers of growth. “Our revenue from wearable products in the past four quarters was the size of a Fortune 500 company,” Cook said. Internationally, Apple saw a 14 percent revenue drop in its Greater China operating segment, which would be more worrisome had the company not also tallied an 11 percent increase in the Americas, a 10 percent increase in Europe, a 5 percent rise in Japan, and a very healthy 20 percent increase for the rest of the Asia Pacific market. However, Apple did see double-digit Chinese revenue growth from the Mac, Services, and retail. Cook made a point of noting that Apple’s results in China were once again trending upward, and he remains “very enthusiastic” about China. Speaking of retail, Cook said that Apple Retail is entering a new phase of its life, with new experiences and new designs thanks to retail chief Angela Ahrendts. Cook highlighted Apple’s new store in Dubai, which is the 495th Apple Store location. It will be interesting to see if Apple makes a fuss over the 500th store. Apple may be looking to make nice with the current U.S. administration, which has been talking about reducing taxes on offshore corporate earnings. Cook made it a point to mention that Apple had created 2 million jobs across all 50 states in the country, and he added that Apple spent $50 billion last year with American suppliers and developers. “Apple is a company that could only have been created in America,” Cook said. Finally, Apple has expanded its $250 billion capital return program to $300 billion, which includes an increase in the company’s quarterly dividend for shareholders. On 18 May 2017, Apple shareholders will receive a dividend of $0.63 per share (up from $0.57 per share last quarter, a 10.5 percent increase). Maestri said that Apple expects to keep increasing the dividend every year, and Apple expects to return $89 billion to shareholders over the next eight quarters. All told, Apple’s quarterly financial performance fell right in the middle of Meh Valley. The company’s revenue and sales results were neither outstanding nor dismal, merely OK, and, as if in imitation, the quarterly analyst’s conference call was unusually low energy. The fact is that we’re seeing the same non-dramatic, boringly consistent signs we’ve observed each quarter of the past year: the iPad in slow decline, Services on a steady rise, and a topsy-turvy Other Products category. With Apple’s financial security buoyed by its quarter of a trillion dollars in cash, investors might have some long-term concerns about an inevitable slowdown in iPhone growth, but, in the here and now, increased stock dividends should keep them happy.   PDFpen and PDFpenPro 9 add 100+ enhancements to improve your PDF editing experience, with annotations, Tables of Contents, and more export options.

(Regis Duvignain/Reuters) Apple faces more pressure than ever to deliver with its highly anticipated next-generation iPhone, as the company reported Tuesday that it sold fewer iPhones than analysts had expected in the company's second quarter. Those looking forward to the new phone may have held off on buying a new device until the fall, analysts said. The softer-than-expected sales come as Apple faces increased competition for the device that makes up the majority of Apple's profits. Apple sold 50 million iPhones in the past quarter, 1 million less than in the same period last year. Analysts had expected Apple to sell 52 million units. The company reported $52.9 billion in revenue, slightly below analyst estimates. On an earnings call, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said that Apple did not correctly estimate how popular the iPhone 7 Plus would be compared with the iPhone 7, which caused some supply problems. The company did show strong profits thanks in part to its services unit, reporting earnings of $2.10 a share vs. an expected $2.02.  But the disappointing iPhone sales, combined with a weak outlook for the next quarter, sent the stock down more than 2 percent in after-hours trading. U.S. sales grew 11 percent, but the company saw a 14 percent sales drop in China. Cook played down concerns about sales in the world's largest phone market, saying that he thought those results were in line with previous years. He added that seven of the company's most popular stores are in China. But local competition from Chinese smartphone makers such as Huawei have been chipping away at Apple's market share. Cook addressed analyst questions about the Apple Watch, saying the company is happy with sales and remains “very committed to it and believe … over time it will be even larger.” Apple doesn't break out sales numbers for its wearable, but analysts expected to see more growth from that part of Apple's business as competitors leave the smartwatch market . Many analysts anticipate that the company will deliver a completely redesigned iPhone later this year. It is expected to be called the iPhone 8 and to have an edge-to-edge display similar to that of the well-reviewed Samsung Galaxy S8, which went on sale in April. And analysts are upbeat about Apple's ability to bounce back, thanks to the company's reputation and customer loyalty. “We're bullish on the iPhone 8 for three reasons: Apple's ecosystem stickiness, the expected upgradability of the device, and teenage fondness of Apple devices,” said Clement Thibault, a senior investing analyst with Investing.com. Meanwhile, Apple is also facing increased competition in its growing Mac business. Microsoft announced Tuesday morning a sleek new laptop aimed at students that is designed to compete directly with the MacBook Air. [Microsoft takes aim at Apple and Google in the classroom with new products] Sales of the iPad continued to slide. The company also increased the size of its share dividend and buyback programs to $300 billion through March 2019. Apple's stockpile of cash is nearly $260 billion, which — as The Washington Post's Thomas Heath reported — is more than the gross domestic product of Jamaica and Finland combined. [Apple’s cash pile is as big as the GDP of Finland and Jamaica, combined] The main bright spot for Apple continues to be in its services. The App Store, iTunes and other subscription products generated $7 billion, up 18 percent from the previous year. Apple faces stiff competition from Samsung but is in a strong enough position to weather a weaker quarter — as long as it delivers on the promise of the iPhone 8, said Thomas Cooke, a professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. “This is acceptable, considering the environment and that they have new products in the pipeline. That people are holding onto their phones a little longer than expected shouldn’t be so alarming,” he said. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Finance  ⋮  Mobile Apple Q2 2017 Results Exceed $50 Billion in Revenue But iPhone Sales See Massive Drop Against Previous Quarter – Anticipation of iPhone 8 Relatively High? By Omar Sohail 10 hours ago 21Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL 147.51 0.63%) has just announced its Q2 2017 quarter results with the tech giant once again taking the lead against its other smartphone competitors in terms of both revenue, iPhone sales and other categories. However, in comparison to the record-breaking breaking Q1 2017 quarter, the results are a bit pale, mostly due to lack of iPhone sales, which are the primary bread and butter of the company. However, the anticipation of the radically overhauled iPhone 8 could inject massive growth thanks to its array of exclusive features and massive design change. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL 147.51 0.63%) Still Impresses in Q2 2017 Financial Results in Regards to YoY Results – Massive Dip in Performance Could Have a Silver Lining With $52.9 million in revenue and slightly over $11 billion in profit, Apple has displayed far better financial performance than its competitors, even though the slump compared to the previous quarter is huge. Still, compare it to the year-over-year results and we still see that the tech giant is going strong in revenue generation and iPhone sales, though there is a noticeable drop in iPad and Mac sales quarter-over-quarter. Related Some Major iPhone Apps Have Dropped Support For The Apple Watch The announcement of the new iPhone 7 (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition and $329 iPad was not sufficient to bring in a hefty amount of sales, though newer products in the form of the iPhone 8 and iPad Pro could reverse this. “We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus. We’ve seen great customer response to both models of the new iPhone 7 (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition and we’re thrilled with the strong momentum of our Services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter. Looking ahead, we are excited to welcome attendees from around the world to our annual Worldwide Developers Conference next month in San Jose.” Advertisement Previously reported data stated that lack of design change hurt Apple’s iPhone sales metric, suggesting that a huge makeover in aesthetics in regards to the iPhone 8 could bring back the sales momentum in its favor. Apple has also provided guidance for its Q3 2017 financial results, with revenue slipping even further for that quarter. Hopefully, we’ll get to see a record-breaking quarter from the company once it announces its Q1 2018 results. Critics could be incessantly chanting the demise of Apple and its iPhone due to the aforementioned results, but we’re still showing a positive outcome thanks to the upgraded models of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac that are expected to get unveiled later in the year.

Tech Search Search WMPWThe World’s Most Powerful Women: May 3 ChinaChina Has Tightened Its Grip on Online News With Sweeping New Controls HIVDoctors Discuss What it Will Take to Rid the World of AIDS genomicsHow Scientists Think CRISPR Will Change Medicine Apple CEO Tim Cook  Thomas Peter REUTERS Apple How Tim Cook Brags About Apple’s Success Without Giving Too Much Away Aaron Pressman May 02, 2017 Apple CEO Tim Cook's predecessor, Steve Jobs, wasn't fond of talking to Wall Street analysts. And on the rare occasions Jobs did show up for a quarterly earnings call, it was usually to attack rivals. Thus, even before becoming CEO, Cook, as one of Jobs' underlings, had to explain Apple's strategy and results to investors. Lacking Jobs' gift for the zinger, in his nearly six years as CEO, Cook has instead developed his own lingo— his own code. The goal seems to be to give analysts a smidgen of information to incorporate evidence into their financial reports that Apple is succeeding. But Cook and other executives always seem to draw a line to avoid giving away too much real information that may help competitors figure out how Apple is really doing. Tuesday evening's call with analysts for Apple's fiscal second quarter results, was loaded with plenty of Cook-isms. Lately, one of his new favorite techniques is using other companies in the Fortune 500 as a measuring stick. For example, Cook on Tuesday repeated a claim he's made before that Apple's growing services business, which encompasses everything from music and video sales to online storage and app sales, is growing so quickly that its revenue will soon equal that of a Fortune 100 company. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. In fact, Apple may have already reached that milestone. For the past two quarters, services revenue has exceeded $7 billion, or $28 billion annually if that rate continues. The 100th-largest company in the Fortune 500 by revenue is insurer Northwestern Mutual, which had just over $28 billion of revenue. Why Cook uses the Fortune 100 measuring stick instead of just saying $28 billion of revenue, no one knows for sure. Perhaps it sounds more impressive to the MBA-trained exec (For the record, Apple itself ranks third, behind only Exxon Mobile and Walmart). On Tuesday, Cook offered another Fortune reference, though this time in a somewhat more convoluted formulation. The CEO said that sales of Apple's watch, AirPod earphones, and other Beats-branded earphones brought in as much revenue over the past year as a Fortune 500 company. In a second reference, he said the total was "well into" the Fortune 500. Apple's wearable sales, therefore, equals the revenue of another sort of wearables company, Burlington Stores (burl). The coat maker had revenue of just over $5 billion to rank No. 500 in the Fortune 500. Analyst Jan Dawson estimated Apple wearable revenue may reach $6 billion, equal to the revenue of No. 430 on the Fortune list, LifePoint Health. Aside from the Fortune 500 measuring stick, Cook seems to have adopted the tactic used by Amazon (amzn) CEO Jeff Bezos to report the size of increases in various businesses, without reporting the actual dollar amount of the increases. Revenue in the App Store was up 40% last quarter while Apple Music sales were up double-digit percentages, Cook said. Over the last 12 months the amount of Apple Pay transactions increased 450%. At another point, Cook said sales of the Apple Watch by unit had more than doubled in six of the company's 10 top markets without revealing which countries were included. It's all very interesting and it can certainly be used in a Wall Street analyst's report to make a case for Apple (aapl). But it's not exactly what Cook's professors back at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business might demand from students analyzing a company's value.

While the regular and Plus models aren’t new, the main difference here is that the iPhone 7 Plus came with a dual camera setup, and it was also priced higher than the regular iPhone 7. It turns out that Apple wasn’t expecting the demand for the iPhone 7 Plus to be this strong, or at least that’s according to Apple’s CEO Tim Cook during the company’s recent earnings call. According to Cook, “One of the things we didn’t get right was the mix between the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Demand was much stronger towards the iPhone 7 Plus than we expected.” Ultimately this led to shortages when it came to supply, resulting in iPhone 7 Plus owners having to wait quite a bit to get their hands on the phone if they didn’t pre-order it early enough. Cook was quoted as saying, “Every time we launch something, we learn something, and we brush up our models and apply everything we learn for next time.” That being said, we wonder if the lessons they learnt from the iPhone 7 Plus will be applied to the rumored iPhone 8. There have been talks that Apple could be in short supply for the iPhone 8 right out the gate apparently due to the difficulty of manufacturing some of the components for the phone.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Apple’s iPhone Sales Continue Their Decline By Tyler Lee on 05/02/2017 16:14 PDT According to the popular saying, what goes up must come down. While presumably it is talking about gravity, we suppose it does have its place even in sales where nothing can last forever. Apple has enjoyed the longest streak ever for its iPhones where quarter after quarter, sales have continued to increase. However in recent times, Apple has seen sales starting to decline, and unfortunately things don’t appear to be changing. Based on Apple’s latest financials, it seems that iPhone sales are continuing to decline. Apple is reporting that they have sold 50.8 million iPhones in the last quarter, which is down by a smidge from the 51.2 million iPhones that they sold a year ago. Now clearly 50.8 million iPhones isn’t a number you would sneeze at, and Apple is far from being in trouble, but it is a sign that perhaps interest in the iPhone is starting to diminish. However despite the decline in sales, revenue is up, presumably due to the slightly higher price tag where Apple managed to make $52.9 billion, which is up by 5% year-over-year.

Apple CEO Steve Jobs shows the new MacBook Air during the Macworld Convention and Expo in San Francisco, California January 15, 2008. REUTERS/Robert GalbraithMore (Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveils the very first MacBook Air.Thomson Reuters) Almost a decade later, the MacBook Air is now one of the thickest laptops in Apple's lineup. It's true: According to Apple's website, only the older MacBook Pro — both the 13- and 15-inch models — is thicker than the MacBook Air. All other laptops, including the 12-inch MacBook and even the new MacBook Pro models unveiled last year, are thinner.  Here are all the laptops Apple sells, arranged from thickest to thinnest: MacBook Pro (older 13- and 15-inch models) - 0.71 inches thick MacBook Air (13-inch) - 0.68 inches thick MacBook Pro (new 15-inch model) - 0.61 inches thick MacBook Pro (both new 13-inch models) - 0.59 inches thick MacBook (12-inch) - 0.52 inches thick Even though the MacBook Air can no longer be advertised as the "world's thinnest notebook" — or even the thinnest notebook Apple sells — it is still one of the lightest Apple laptops you can buy. Here are all those laptops, arranged from heaviest to lightest: MacBook Pro (older 15-inch model) - 4.49 pounds MacBook Pro (new 15-inch model) - 4.02 pounds MacBook Pro (older 13-inch model) - 3.48 pounds MacBook Pro (both new 13-inch models) - 3.02 pounds MacBook Air (13-inch) - 2.96 pounds MacBook (12-inch) - 2.03 pounds As you can see, the MacBook Air is only slightly lighter than the new 13-inch MacBook Pro models, but significantly heavier than last year's 12-inch MacBook. Based on the data above, it wouldn't be surprising to see Apple dump the MacBook Air line after this year. The 12-inch MacBook seems to have supplanted the need for a MacBook Air, since that computer is both thinner and lighter than the Air. It would make sense, moving forward, for Apple to sell just two kinds of laptops: MacBooks (thin and portable for casual or mobile users), and MacBook Pros (for productivity and complex tasks).

Apple said its profit climbed 4.9 percent to slightly more than $11 billion on revenue rising 4.6 percent to $52.9 billion in the quarterly period that ended April 1. Shares of the California-based company were down nearly two percent to $144.94 in after-market trades that followed release of the earnings figures. "We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus," Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in the earnings release. Still, iPhone sales dipped slightly compared with a year ago to 50.8 million units, below most forecasts for the key profit machine for Apple. During a conference call with analysts, Cook said Apple was seeing a "pause" in iPhone purchases that he felt was caused by unconfirmed "reports about future iPhones." "That is clearly what is going on," Cook said. Apple has annually unveiled new iPhone models during special events in September, with major innovations anticipated this year because it will mark the tenth anniversary of the debut of the world-changing mobile device. Still, the company contended that iPhone sales were better than it had expected, and skewed toward large-screen iPhone 7 models that have higher margins of profit. - Buying back shares - Apple also announced that its board of directors authorized an additional $50 billion for dividends and buying back shares in the company, raising to $300 billion the total amount of cash to be spent in the program. While Apple has become the world's most valuable company, analysts are looking at how the company is diversifying in the face of a saturated smartphone market and increasing competition. Tuesday's report showed weaker sales of iPads and Mac computers. Apple also reported a 14 percent drop in revenues from a year earlier for "Greater China," dropping the region behind Europe and the Americas in terms of sales. A strong US dollar facing off with weaker currencies were blamed for a strong "headwind" that pushed revenue down. - Keen on India - Sales of Macintosh computers did well in China, with revenue up about 20 percent, and the company's retail shops were drawing crowds. "We continued to believe there is an enormous opportunity there," Cook said of mainland China. "In the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there." Apple is also investing heavily in India, the third largest smartphone market in the world behind China and the US, according to Cook. Apple set a new March quarter revenue record in India, growing by double digits. "We're very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country with its very large, young and tech savvy population, fast-growing economy and improving 4G network infrastructure," Cook said. Apple touted growth of revenue from online services or digital content, which it boasted was on its way to be on scale with a Fortune 100 company in terms of revenue. For the second quarter in a row, revenue reported from Apple services topped $7 billion. While not disclosing exact numbers, executives said Apple Watch sales double from the same quarter last year and touted it as the best selling smartwatch in the world. Sales of "other products," which include AirPods wireless ear pieces and Apple Watch, posted a 31 percent increase in revenue over the prior year. Combining revenue from Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats headphone sales over the course of the last year would give Apple's "wearables" offerings the scale of a Fortune 500 company, according to Cook. Apple's cash holdings meanwhile rose to a record $256.8 billion, a figure that raises questions for how the company will manage its massive reserves. Apple remains under pressure to wow the world with a tenth anniversary edition iPhone and to come up with a must-have next big thing. "Among many consumers, there is a sense that Apple is falling behind rivals," GlobalData Retail managing directory Neil Saunders said in an earnings note. "Apple needs to get back on the front foot if it is to grow its market share in phones." While Apple spotlights its growing services business, those offerings are tied to having iPhones in people's hands. Rumors buzzing ahead of an annual Apple developers conference next month include possible plans for a voice-controlled speaker that would take on Amazon's Echo and Google Home in the digital home assistant market. "In more cutting edge areas, like personal home assistants, Apple has seemingly little to offer and has allowed players like Google and Amazon to steal a march," Saunders said.

The fact that an Apple-specialized tech publication has only now noticed the discreet functionality reduction of the world’s top-selling smartwatch says a lot about the still-fledgling market, since we’re apparently several weeks after the beginning of this odd phenomenon already. Granted, wrist titles like Amazon or even eBay have always been regarded as largely useless, especially with an “iWatch” disconnected from an iPhone. Meanwhile, Target no longer offers integration for its main app, but the Cartwheel service remains supported on the Apple Watch. As for Google Maps, the Mountain View-based search giant has told members of the press the quiet, unexplained removal of compatibility is just temporary, having discarded Apple Watch support “from our latest iOS release but expect to support it again in the future.” Bottom line, this is perhaps not a huge story in itself, though it may help alleviate Fitbit’s fears that the company’s first “proper” smartwatch will have its mainstream appeal severely damaged by the absence of a promised full-on app store.

Apple reports earnings Tuesday, May 2, 2017. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) SAN FRANCISCO — As Apple's stash of cash grows, so does the possibility that the world's most valuable company will use some of the money for a huge acquisition that would expand its empire beyond iPhones and other gadgets. The company currently holds more than a quarter-trillion dollars it could use to go shopping. So far, the guessing game has primarily focused on possible targets such as Netflix and Tesla Motors. Either deal could make sense, given Apple's long-running interest in providing a TV service to consumers and its more recent work on self-driving cars . But in recent months the takeover talk has swirled around whether Apple might do something even more dramatic by making a bid for Walt Disney Co. THE MOUSE AND THE APPLE Such a combination would create the world's first company worth $1 trillion. Beyond that, an Apple-Disney marriage would unite some of the world's most successful brands in technology and entertainment — a list that includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac computer, Mickey Mouse, Disneyland, ESPN, Lucasfilm, Pixar and Marvel. "If there's a deal out there that would strike fear in the hearts of Silicon Valley and Hollywood, this could be it," RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a recent research report assessing the logic of an Apple-Disney combination. Apple doesn't discuss specific companies that it might buy, but it's exploring far and wide, according to Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri. "We are looking at every size of acquisition, so we will see how it goes going forward," Maestri told The Associated Press in a Tuesday interview. Disney hasn't given any inclination that it's looking for a buyer, but publicly held companies are required to consider all takeover offers. Buying Disney would be expensive. Daryanani estimates that Apple would have to pay $157 per share, or about $250 billion. TREASURE CHEST Apple is one of the few companies — if not the only one — that could pay that sum out of its pocket. The Cupertino, California, company ended March with nearly $257 billion in cash and marketable securities, according to numbers released Tuesday with Apple's earnings report for the January-March quarter. That's up from $233 billion a year ago, and the figure is expected to keep growing as Apple piles up more profits from the iPhone, iPad and Mac, as well as the applications and services that feed those devices. In its latest quarter, Apple's earnings climbed 5 per cent to $11 billion while revenue also rose 5 per cent to nearly $53 billion. In recent years, Apple has used a large chunk of its cash to provide its shareholders with extra income. The company disclosed plans on Tuesday to raise its quarterly dividend by more than 10 per cent to 63 cents per share, marking the fifth increase in five years. Apple also has spent $151 billion buying back its own stock since 2012. Doing a mega-deal would be a major departure for Apple, whose largest acquisition to date was its $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014 that helped launch its music streaming service. THE SLOWING SMARTPHONE But Daryanani and other analysts believe Apple may need to make a pricier acquisition to lessen the company's dependence on the iPhone at a time when smartphone sales have been slowing. IPhone sales edged up 1 per cent in Apple's latest quarter, extending a recovery from an unprecedented downturn last year. But many investors remain concerned that Apple has become too vulnerable to the ups and downs of the smartphone market, mostly because the company hasn't been able to come up with another hit product since the 2011 death of its co-founder and CEO, Steve Jobs. Apple's last big success, the iPad, came out in 2010, but sales of the tablet have been declining for more than three years. Meanwhile, the iPhone accounted for nearly two-thirds of Apple's revenue in the past quarter. The Trump administration may give Apple another reason to mull a major acquisition, given earlier promises to lower U.S. taxes on overseas corporate cash brought back to the U.S. Should that tax cut happen, Apple CEO Tim Cook has said the company will consider bringing back most of the more than $230 billion it now keeps in foreign countries, making it easier to finance a blockbuster deal in the U.S.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *       FILE - This Thursday, May 19, 2016, file photo shows the Apple logo on the side of the Apple Union Square store, in San Francisco.

House Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster, R-Pa., said carriers should use the notoriety of the violent event — and a separate incident in which a mother with a stroller was bullied by a flight attendant — to make long-needed improvements. If the airlines don't make changes, Congress is likely to step in, Shuster and other lawmakers said. ___ Apple growing cash stash spurs talk of huge acquisition SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — As Apple's stash of cash grows, so does the possibility that the company will use some of the money for a huge acquisition that would expand its empire beyond iPhones and other gadgets. The guessing game primarily has focused on potential acquisitions of video streaming service Netflix and electric car maker Tesla Motors. But in recent months the takeover talk has swirled around whether Apple might do something even more dramatic by trying to buy Walt Disney Co. ___ Visa crackdown threatens seasonal help at US resorts PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Innkeepers, restaurateurs and landscapers around the U.S. say they are struggling to find seasonal help and turning down business in some cases because the government tightened up on visas for temporary foreign workers. At issue are H-2B temporary visas, which are issued for workers holding down seasonal, nonagricultural jobs. The U.S. caps the number at 66,000 per fiscal year. Some workers return year after year, and Congress has let them do so in the past without being counted toward the limit. No such exception was passed for 2017 at the end of last year, after the presidential election. ___ Pay for news? More than half of Americans say they do NEW YORK (AP) — A battered news industry can find some flickers of hope in a survey that gauges public willingness to pay for journalism, as long as its leaders plan judiciously. A little more than half of American adults regularly pay for news, through newspaper and magazine subscriptions, apps on electronic devices or contributions to public media, according to the Media Insight Project, a collaboration between the American Press Institute and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. ___ Auto sales fall 4.7 per cent.; 7-year win streak may come to end DETROIT (AP) — U.S. auto sales fell 4.7 per cent last month, the most pronounced slowdown of the year and a strong indication that 2017 will put an end to seven straight years of growth. Auto executives and analysts, who have been anticipating a slowdown, saw no cause for panic. Many expect sales in the important economic sector to top 17 million for the third straight year, an industry first. Still, sales have dropped for four straight months, the first time that's happened since the economy ground to a halt in 2009. April sales totalled just over 1.4 million, a figure that translates to an annual sales rate of 16.9 million, far below last year's record of 17.5 million. The April decline brought year-to-date sales down by 2.4 per cent from a year ago. ___ Shakeup at Molina, CEO and CFO, sons of founder are out INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Brothers Mario and John Molina have been ousted as leaders of Molina Healthcare, the publicly traded health insurer their father founded to serve poor families. The company cited disappointing financial performance and its need to improve its operations and profits for the shake-up.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that it will lift the ban on lemons from northwestern Argentina on May 26. The decision came days after President Donald Trump said that he was reviewing the position of his administration on the issue. In December, President Barack Obama's administration said it would lift the ban, which had been imposed following complaints by producers in California that the Argentine lemons carried diseases. ___ Italy to loan Alitalia $650 million as it seeks a new buyer MILAN (AP) — Struggling Italian air carrier Alitalia entered its second period of bankruptcy protection in a decade on Tuesday with the government approving a 600 million-euro ($650 million) bridge loan to keep the airline operating as it seeks a new buyer. The move came after the Alitalia board acknowledged the failure of a government-brokered relaunch plan, which workers overwhelmingly rejected despite softened job and salary cuts, out of concern it lacked a realistic strategy to revive revenue. ___ The Standard & Poor's 500 index edged up 2.84 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 2,391.17.

Earnings: Growth Accelerates Apple continued its recent return to growth in its second quarter. Even more, the company's revenue and EPS growth both accelerated. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) May 2, 2017 at 6:04PM Only recently returning to growth, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was put to the test in its second fiscal quarter of 2017 as investors looked to see whether the company's return to growth would continue. On Tuesday, Apple showed investors that it can not only continue to grow its business, but can also grow it at an even faster rate than it did in its first quarter. Going further, Apple also expanded its capital-return program, announcing a larger authorization for share repurchases and a bigger dividend. Here's a look at Apple's second-quarter results. Red special edition iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. The raw numbers Metric Q2 2017 Q2 2016  Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $52.9 billion $50.6 billion 4.5% EPS $2.10 $1.90 10.5% Gross margin 38.9% 39.5% (60 basis points) Data source: Apple's second-quarter earnings release. Table by author. In Q2, Apple's revenue and EPS increased 4.5% and 10.5%, respectively, compared with the year-ago quarter. This growth is up from Apple's 3.3% and 2.4% respective growth in revenue and EPS in Apple's first quarter. This makes for Apple's second quarter in a row of growing its revenue and EPS on a year-over-year basis, following a period in fiscal 2016 in which Apple's business declined on a year-over-year basis for three quarters in a row. "We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus," said Apple CEO Tim Cook in the company's second-quarter press release. Cook cited "great customer response" to the new iPhone 7 (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition and Apple's services business as key drivers during the quarter. Second-quarter highlights Beyond Apple's accelerating revenue and EPS growth, here are some other key takeaways from Apple's second quarter. Apple expanded its total capital return authorization by $50 billion and extended the program's expiration by one year, to March 2019. Of its incremental capital return authorization, Apple plans to spend $35 billion on repurchases and $15 billion on dividends. Apple increased its quarterly dividend by 10.5% to $0.63 per share. The dividend increase is slightly higher than its 10% increase last year. iPhone revenue, which accounted for about 63% of Apple's revenue, increased 1% year over year. iPhone unit sales, however, were down 1% year over year. iPad revenue declined 12% year over year. iMac revenue increased 14% year over year. Services revenue increased 18% year over year. Other products, which includes sales of Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, iPod, and Apple-branded and third-party accessories, jumped 31% year over year, marking a notable change of direction compared with the segment's 8% year-over-year decline in Apple's first quarter of 2017.  Apple generated $12.5 billion in operating cash flow and returned $10.2 billion to investors through repurchases and dividends.  Image source: Apple. What now? Going forward, Apple expects growth to continue. The company guided for third-quarter revenue to be between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion. In the third quarter of 2016, Apple's revenue was $42.4 billion. Apple also said it expects its third-quarter gross profit margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. Those figures compare with a gross profit margin of 38% in the year-ago quarter. With revenue expected to increase and management anticipating a similar gross profit margin to the year-ago quarter, Apple's EPS should also increase in Q3. Investors should look for Apple's recent return to year-over-year growth to continue throughout 2017 and beyond.   Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

The company shipped 50.8m iPhones in the quarter ended 1 April, down from 51.2m shipped in the second quarter of 2016. Analysts on average had estimated iPhone sales of 52.27m, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. This means that the iPhone’s return to growth following the launch of the iPhone 7 only lasted the so-called holiday quarter at the end of 2016. The company reported a 4.6% revenue rise to $52.9bn, but this was shy of the $53.02bn estimate – leading to stock dropping by about 1.5% in after hours trading. Apple's annual profits fall for first time in 15 years as iPhone sales decline Read more The company reported higher-than-expected profits resulting in earnings per share of $2.10 – higher than the Wall Street expectation of $2.02 earnings per share. “This is a very mixed report for Apple in terms of results. Apple sold less iPhones than it did a year ago, but the possibility of consumers holding out until the new iPhone release is very real, especially when the upgrade is rumored to be more meaningful than in previous years,” said Clement Thibault, Senior Analyst at Investing.com. iPad sales were 8.9m units, another year-on-year decline, although Mac sales rose from 4m a year ago to 4.2 million with sales price increases meaning revenue grew by 14%. Apple typically launches its new iPhones in September. A big jump in sales usually follows in the holiday quarter, before demand tapers over the next few quarters as customers hold back ahead of the next launch. Apple’s 10th-anniversary iPhone range might sport features such as wireless charging, 3D facial recognition and a curved display. The company forecast total revenue of between $43.5bn and $45.5bn for the current quarter, while analysts on average were expecting $45.6bn, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts on average expect the company to sell 42.31m iPhones in the current quarter, according to FactSet. Earlier in the day, Apple’s market capitalization briefly topped its peak market value of $774.91bn to reach $776.59bn. It remains the only US-listed stock with a market value of more than $700bn. “We’re not disappointed but our expectations were low to begin with,” said Thibault. “We would have liked to have seen stronger renewed growth, but after spoiling us for the past few years, it doesn’t come as easy for Apple as it used to.” Topics Apple iPhone news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home US politics world opinion sports soccer tech selected arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home US politics world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech selected arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food recipes health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed weekend video Technology › Apple back to top tech US world science US politics business Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us advertise with us contact us work for us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2017 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The company reported a surprise fall in quarterly iPhone sales, selling 50.8 million phones. Its revenue rose less than expected, and Apple's revenue forecast fell shy of analysts' expectations. Earlier, tech and industrial stocks helped lift Wall Street. But investors made small moves ahead of Apple's results and the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting. U.S. Bank's Eric Wiegand: SOUNDBITE: ERIC WIEGAND, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, U.S. BANK, (ENGLISH) SAYING: "I think it's a little bit of consolidation. Still a bunch of big data points to gain over the course of the remainder of the week. Certainly, the Fed meeting getting those comments tomorrow." Auto stocks skidding after automakers reported a sharp drop in vechile sales in April. GM's sales fell 6 percent. Ford's sank more than 7 percent. Coach shares soaring. The handbag maker's quarterly profit rose nearly 9 percent after Coach cut back on discounting in the U.S. and sold pricier bags. Advanced Micro Devices shares plummeted. The chipmaker's revenue rose sharply. But investors fretted over its weak forecast for gross margins. In Europe, healthy corporate earnings powered shares higher. Financial and industrial stocks led the pack.

Macs showed signs of life. And services are a rising star. [Photo: courtesy of Apple] By Mark Sullivan05.02.17 | 7:03 pm Apple reported financial results for the first three months of 2017 that were mainly in line with expectations, with a couple of concerning line-item misses. advertisement The company earned $11 billion on revenues of $52.9 billion. The revenue number just missed the $53 billion most analysts expected, but landed toward the top end of Apple’s own projections for the quarter. The company said earlier it expected to report between $51.5B and $53.5B. iPhone: The Waiting Game Apple sold around 50.8 million iPhones during the March quarter—a one percent increase over Q2 last year. The first quarter of the calendar year is typically a seasonally down quarter, so expectations weren’t high. Last quarter (including the holiday season) Apple sold a surprising 78.3 million of the devices, ending a three-consecutive-quarter trend of declining sales. Also, the hype cycle about the Apple’s next phones—likely announced in the fall—is well under way and many people are probably holding off upgrading their iPhone in the meantime. Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledged this during the earnings call with analysts Tuesday. “We’re seeing what we believe to be a pause in purchases on iPhone, which we believe is the result of earlier and much more frequent reports of future iPhones,” he said. Services: Big And Getting Bigger Investors have been emboldened by the impressive growth of Apple’s services business, including all the digital content we buy from the App Store or iTunes. Apple reported services revenue of $7.0 billion, off 2% from last quarter but up 18% from the March-ending quarter last year. Analysts had expected about $6.78 billion. Services also grew 18% in final calendar quarter of 2016, contributing $7.2 billion of revenue (Cook said the services business contributed $20 billion in revenues in full year 2016). advertisement “It’s well on its way toward being the size of a Fortune 100 company,” Cook said during the earnings call. Apple has big plans for the business: Cook said Apple is trying to double its services business in the next four years. China: The Slipping Giant In the nearer term, Apple is depending on strong revenues from sales in China, which it expects to be its largest market in the world. But China sales haven’t been growing as hoped, slipping below European sales in the last three quarters. This quarter was a continuation of the theme. Apple reported China revenues of $10.7 billion, a drop of 14% from the $12.49 billion in sales from China in the March-ending quarter last year. Analysts had expected sales of less than $12 billion. Cook did his best to spin the situation to the positive, pointing out during a call with investors that the first two fiscal quarters combined had significantly more China revenue than the final two quarters of the previous year. “We continue to be very optimistic about our opportunity in China,” he said. Macs: Still Life In The Old Platform Yet Mac sales are a pleasant surprise this quarter. Apple says it sold 4.2 million units, an increase of 4% from the same quarter last year. Mac sales had slid down for a whole year before growing slightly year-over-year last quarter. The continued growth is welcome news, especially as some users (creatives and professionals) have questioned Apple’s commitment to the Mac. iPad: The Doldrums Continue We’ve been waiting for some good news on the iPad front for a good while now, and we didn’t get it today. iPad sales fell again to 8.9 million units, a 13% slide from last year’s March quarter. advertisement Apple recently announced (in early April) a competitively priced $329 iPad, but it’s too early to see exactly how enthusiastically the market is receiving that device. Apple has been trying hard to sell iPads (and iPhones) into enterprises, and is apparently making some progress. CFO Luca Maestri said Apple set an enterprise sales record in the March quarter, and he expects the same kind of growth in enterprise sales over the next few quarters. But so far, the enterprise growth hasn’t been enough to move the needle on iPad sales. Cook spun the iPad picture by citing a 451 Research study saying that satisfaction levels for the iPad were 95% and above. (He smartly avoided mentioning the most recent J.D. Power user satisfaction report that put Microsoft’s Surface Tablet ahead of the iPad for the first time.) But later on in the earnings call one analyst pointed out that the same 451 Research study reported a nine-year low in iPad purchasing intent, as well as a drop in retention rates. Spin unspun. Apple Watch: Doing The Math Apple doesn’t report unit sales or revenue numbers for the Apple Watch, lumping it in with “Other Products” that include accessories and AirPods. But the numbers suggest that Watch sales had a solid quarter. Total Other Products revenue for the quarter was $2.8 million. Above Avalon analyst Neil Cybart calculated that if Other Products revenue was close to $3 million for the quarter it would indicate that Apple sold more than 3 million Watches. If the revenue number had been closer to $2 billion, Cybart said, Watch sales would have probably been closer to 1 million units. Analysts were looking for signs that Watch sales sustained somewhat after a breakout holiday quarter in which the wearable may have sold as many as 5 million units worldwide. A strong performance this quarter would suggest the Watch is making progress toward being a mass market product. Finally, Apple gave some encouraging guidance numbers for the June-ending quarter, predicting between $43.5 and $45.5 billion in revenue.

Rod ChesterNews Corp Australia Network May 3, 20179:31am Video Image Iphone 8 Rumours1:10 Rumours are ramping up over the much anticipated iPhone 8. Only time will tell how many of them will come true. February 23rd 2017 2 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Apple CEO Tim Cook admits the hype around the iPhone 8 is slowing sales of current models. Picture: AP APPLE CEO Tim Cook has admitted he’s got a problem: the hype about the future of the iPhone is hurting iPhone sales right now. Apple today released the results for the quarter ending April 1, with sales of iPhone taking a surprising downturn despite optimistic Wall St expectations. Apple sold 50.76 million iPhones in the quarter, down from 51.19 million in the previous year and short of the 51.5 million expected. While that is not much of a drop, it was enough for the Apple share price to fall 1 per cent in after-hours trading. A leaked image of the iPhone 8 sent the internet into a frenzy. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied RELATED: Leaked schematic of iPhone 8 reveals big switch in Apple’s design “We’re seeing what we believe to be a pause in purchases of iPhone which we believe are due to the earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones,” Cook said. With the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, Apple is expected to radically update its smartphone later this year and there has been a steady diet of leaks with conflicting reports about how Apple will change the form and function of the iPhone, including 3D facial recognication and a curved display. And today’s figures shows just how reliant Apple is on the iPhone. The Samsung Galaxy S8 is sure to give the iPhone a run for its money. Picture: AFPSource:AFP Analyst Jan Dawson said in the past five years, the iPhone has gone from being half of Apple’s revenue to two thirds, while iPad and Macs have dropped from 36 per cent to 19 per cent. Apple still is yet to give details on the sales of Apple Watch, although Apple CEO Tim Cook said the sales of Apple Watch have doubled in the past year. Cook said if you were to take the revenue from Apple Watch, Beats headphones and AirPods then it would equate to the size of a Fortune 500 company. Likewise, Cook equated Apple Services — which includes Apple Music and iCloud subscriptions — as being the size of a Fortune 100 company with more than $9.3 billion in revenue. Tale of two businesses at Apple – Services and iPad trends very different pic.twitter.com/H5vBr8EiMx— Jan Dawson (@jandawson) May 2, 2017 The plight of the iPad continues to be grim, with sales falling for another quarter down to 8.9 million units, which is a drop in a year in unit sales of 13 per cent and 12 per cent in revenue. To find a quarter where the iPad has achieved such a low result, you have to go back to the first year of iPad sales back in 2011. Several times in the briefing after the results were posted, Cook talked of the challenge in finding the right balance in meeting demand. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the future of the iPhone is hurting sales. Picture: AFP/GettySource:AFP He said Apple was still not able to meet demand for the wireless AirPods, which this week scored the highest ever customer satisfaction rating for an Apple product, and he said Apple had got it wrong in underestimating demand for the iPhone 7 Plus, the first iPhone with a dual lens camera. Having two products be more popular than expected is not the only issue Cook faces. There is also the issue of what to do with Apple’s enormous cash reserve which now is $340 billion. Other key points from today’s results are: • App store revenue grew 40 per cent in the past year. • Apple Mac sales, despite the relaunched MacBook Pro, only grew by 4 per cent. • Apple plans to double the size of its service business by 2020.

Apple reported a net profit of $11 billion on revenue of $52.9 billion for the quarter, or $2.10 per diluted share, up from the $1.90 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. The revenue figure was up 5 percent from the comparable quarter last year, with international sales making up 65 percent of the total. Read: Siri Speaker: There's An 'Over 50% Chance' Apple Will Announce Device At June's WWDC “We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. “We’ve seen great customer response to both models of the new iPhone 7 (Product)RED Special Edition, and we’re thrilled with the strong momentum of our Services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter.” The reported revenue was less than the $53.02 billion estimated by Thomson Reuters analysts. iPhone 7 Sales Apple sold 50.76 million iPhones, fewer than it did in the year-ago quarter when it sold 51.19 million. Cook admitted Apple had some trouble handling the high demand for the iPhone 7 Plus. “One of the things we didn't get right was the mix between the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Demand was much stronger towards iPhone 7 Plus than we expected,” he said in the company’s earnings call Tuesday. “Took us a little while to adjust all the way through the supply chain, to bring iPhone 7 Plus into balance, which finally occurred early in this quarter.

Apple's second-quarter results for 2017 are in. Here's our transcript of the call. Apple CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri spoke with analysts during the company's Q2 2017 earnings call. Here's our ongoing live transcript of their remarks! If you want more info on Apple's results, we recommend checking out the awesome charts from Six Colors. Cook's opening remarks Tim Cook Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today we are reporting strong March quarter results with accelerating revenue growth and earnings per share up 10% over last year. We feel great about this performance. Revenue was $52.9 billion — near the high end of our guidance range. Global revenue was up 5% year on year with growth accelerating from our December quarter performance. That's despite a $1 billion year-over-year revenue headwind from foreign exchange in the March quarter and a larger iPhone channel inventory reduction this year versus last year. iPhone sales were in line with our expectations and we're thrilled to see the continued strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus with its beautiful large display and dual camera system. Our active install base for iPhones grew by double digits year over year and based on the latest data from IDC, we gained market share in nearly every country we tried. Late in the quarter we released the stunning (Product)RED special edition versions of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in recognition of 10 years of our partnership with RED. This relationship has given our customers an unprecedented way to contribute to the global fund and bring the world closer to an AIDS-free generation. We've seen wonderful customer response to these eye-popping new iPhones. For the second quarter in a row, our services revenue topped $7 billion and it's well on the way to being the size of a fortune 100 company. We're very happy to see the deep level of customer engagement with the Apple ecosystem across all of our services. App store momentum is terrific, with revenue growing 40% year over year to an all-time quarterly record. The number of developers offering apps for sale on our store was up 26% over last year and we're thrilled to see their success. We also saw double-digit revenue growth from Apple Music subscriptions and iCloud storage, and overall very strong growth in the total number of paid subscriptions for our own services and the third party content we offer on our stores. Paid subscriptions now exceed 165 million. Apple Pay is experiencing phenomenal traction. With the launch of Taiwan and Ireland in the March quarter, Apple Pay is now live in 15 markets, with more than 20 million contactless-ready locations, including more than 4.5 million locations accepting Apple Pay in the U.S. alone. We're seeing strong, growing usage as points of acceptance expand with transaction volume up 450% over the last 12 months. In the UK, for example, points of acceptance have grown by 44% in the last year while monthly Apple Pay transactions have grown by nearly 300%. In Japan, where Apple Pay launched last October, more than half a million transit users are completing 20 million Apple Pay transactions per month and we're always excited to see our partners bring their customers new ways to use Apple Pay. You can now even send a Starbucks gift card via iMessage with just a touch. We're seeing great momentum from our powerful advances in iMessage. In fact, at one point during the Super Bowl in February, customers were sending 380,000 messages per second — more than double the previous year. A few weeks ago,we introduced Clips, a new app that's another great example how we're continually making our produtcs even more engaging and it's off to a great start. With Clips, it's fun and easy to combine video, photos, and music on an iPhone or an iPad into great-looking expressive videos with great visual effects and titles just using your voice, then share your Clips with friends through the Messages app or on social media. We had great Mac results during the quarter. Revenue grew 14% to a new March quarter record and gained market share thanks to strong demand for our new MacBook Pros. Our Mac business has generated over $25 billion in revenue over the past four quarters. We're investing aggressively in its future and we are very excited about the innovation we can bring to the platform. We also updated our most-popular sized iPad with a brighter retina display and best-in-class performance at its most affordable price ever and customer response to date has been very strong. iPad results were ahead of our expectations and we believe we gained shares in a number of major markets including the U.S., Japan, and Australia. iPad remains the world's most popular tablet and it's the primary computing device for millions of customers across the globe. Building on the momentum from the holiday quarter, Apple Watch sales nearly doubled year over year. Apple Watch is the best selling and most loved smartwatch in the world and we hear wonderful stories from our customers about its impact on our fitness and health. We're also seeing great response to AirPods with a 98% customer satisfaction rating based on a recent Creative Strategies survey. Demand for AirPods significantly exceeds supply and growth in Beats products has also been very strong. In fact, when we combine Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats headphones, our revenues from wearable products in the last four quarters was the size of a Fortune 500 company. In Greater China, we were very pleased to see strong, double-digit revenue growth from both Mac and services during the March quarter. We also had great results from our retail stores in mainland China, with total store revenue up 27% over last year and compstore revenue up 7%. These results contributed to our improving performance in Greater China. Through the first two quarters of fiscal 2017, our year over year comparisons improved significantly over the last two quarters of fiscal 2016. First-half revenue was down 13% year-over-year, about a third of which was attributable to FX. That's in contrast to a 32% revenue decline in the second half of last year. Our March quarter results were in line with our expectations and similar to the year-over-year performance we experienced in the December quarter. We continue to be very enthusiastic about our opportunity in China. We set a new March quarter record in India where revenue grew by strong double digits. We continue to strengthen our local presence across the entire ecosystem and we're very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country with its very large, young, and tech-savvy population, fast-growing economy, and improving 4G network infrastructure. Apple Retail is entering an exciting chapter with new experiences for customers and breathtaking new store designs. With the opening of our newest store in Dubai this past weekend, we now have 495 retail locations worldwide. The new Apple Dubai Mall is a truly international store, with employees who collectively speak 45 languages and are already welcoming customers from around the world. As Luca will discuss in a moment, today we're also providing an update to our capital return program. Given our strong confidence in our future, we're increasing the program's size by $50 billion, bringing the total to $300 billion, and we're extending the time frame through March of 2019. We're adding to our share repurchase authorization and increasing our dividend for the fifth time in less than five years. We're very excited about our upcoming World Wide Developers Conference taking place in San Jose next month. The conference is significantly oversubscribed and we'll be welcoming thousands of attendees. We look forward to helping them learn about breakthrough technologies across all four of our software platforms: iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS that enable developers to create incredible experiences for every aspect of customers' lives and improve the way they manage their homes, cars, health, and more. I'm very proud to mention that we recently released our tenth annual Environmental Responsibility Report, reflecting our amazing progress. In 2016, 96% of the electricity used at Apple's global facilities came from renewable sources of energy, reducing our carbon emissions by nearly 585,000 metric tons. We're now 100% renewable in 24 countries, including all of Apple's data centers. There's much more work to be done but we're committed to leaving the world better than we found it. Closer to home, we're excited about moving into our new corporate headquarters, Apple Park, our new center for innovation. The main building on Apple Park is designed to house 13,000 employees under one roof in an environment that fosters even greater collaboration among our incredibly talented team. We have many more ongoing investments in the U.S. economy since Apple is a company that could only have been created in America.Through our innovative products and the success of our business we're incredibly proud to support more than 2 million jobs in all 50 states and we expect to create even more. Last fiscal year we spent more than $50 billion in the United States with American suppliers, developers, and partners and we continue to invest confidently in our future. Now for more details on the March quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was 52.9 billion and we achieved double-digit growth in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Germany, The Netherlands, Turkey, and Mexico. Our growth-rates were even higher — over 20% — in many other markets, including Brazil, Scandinavia, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, India, Korea, and Thailand. Gross margin was 38.9% at the high end of our guidance range — that's a sequential increase from 38.5% in the December quarter, which is particularly impressive given the seasonal loss of leverage, sequential foreign exchange headwinds of 100 basis points, and cost pressures on certain commodities. Operating margin was 26.7% of revenue and that income was $11 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $2.10 — an increase of 10% over last year — and cash-flow from operations was strong at 12.5 billion. For details by product, I'll start with iPhone. We sold 50.8 million iPhones and we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 1.2 million units in the quarter, compared to a reduction of about 450,000 a year ago. So our iPhone performance was slightly better than last year on a sell-through basis. We had very solid iPhone growth in four of our five operating segments and experienced especially strong results in Western Europe, the Middle East, and the rest of the Asia Pacific segment — all areas of the world where iPhone sales were up double digits. iPhone ASP was $655, up from $642 a year ago thanks to a strong mix of iPhone 7 Plus, and in spite of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. We exited the March quarter within our five to seven week target channel inventory range. Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong, not only with consumers but also with business users. In the U.S., the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a 96% customer satisfaction rating among iPhone 7 owners and 98% for iPhone 7 Plus. Among corporate smartphone buyers, iPhone customer satisfaction was 95% and of those planning to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 79% planned to purchase iPhone. Turning to services, we generated 7 billion in revenue, an increase of 18% year-over-year, and our best results ever for a 13-week quarter. We're very happy with the strong level of growth, especially given the tough compare to last year as the busy week between Christmas and New Year fell within the March fiscal quarter a year ago, but was included in the December fiscal quarter this year. As we said last quarter, our goal is to double the size of our services business by 2020. The App Store established a new all-time revenue record and grew 40% year over year. We continue to see growth in average revenue per paying account, as well as the number of paying accounts across our content stores during the quarter. In fact, the quarterly increase in the number of paying accounts was the largest we ever experienced. According to App Annie's latest report, the App Store continues to be the preferred destination for customer purchases, generating twice the revenue of Google Play during the March quarter. Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was up 14% year over and set a new March quarter record. We sold 4.2 million Macs, up 4% over last year, compared to zero growth in the PC market, according to IDC's latest forecast. Demand for MacBook Pro was very strong, helping to drive overall portables growth of 10 %, twice the growth of the portables market. We ended the quarter at the low end of our four to five week target range for Mac channel inventory. Turning to iPad, we sold 8.9 million units which was ahead of our expectations despite supply constraints throughout the quarter. We're very pleased to see iPad growth in the U.S. during the March quarter and revenue growth worldwide for our 9.7-inch and our larger iPads over the last four quarters. iPad channel inventory was essentially flat from the beginning to the end of the quarter and we exited just below our five to seven week target range. iPad remains very successful in the segment of the tablet market where we compete. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad had 81% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And in February, 451 Research measured consumer satisfaction rates for iPad that ranged from 95% for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro to 100% for the 12.9-inch version. Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, purchase intention for iPad was 69%. Corporate buyers report a 96% satisfaction rate and a purchase intent of 68% for the June quarter. All our products continue to be extremely popular and drive mobile transformation in the enterprise market. We set a new enterprise revenue record for the March quarter and we expect this momentum to continue for the remainder of the year. Recently Volkswagen selected iPhone as their corporate standard smartphone, so 620,000 employees around the world have the opportunity to enjoy the best-in-class mobile experience that iPhone offers. Capital One has reimagined the customer banking experience by empowering their associates with Mac and Apple Watch and over 40 native iOS applications now running on nearly 30,000 iPhone and iPads. We're also seeing strong momentum with our enterprise partners who are helping us deliver long-lasting innovation and differentiation for iOS versus competing platforms. The -- partnership is off to a great start with more than 115 customer opportunities in the pipeline across 15 different industries. SAP released the SAP cloud platform SDK for iOS at the end of March and over 3 million SAP developers now have an even better means to develop powerful iOS-native apps for the enterprise. The partnership with CISCO enables optimized performance of iOS devices over their networks and is generating a large and growing pipeline of opportunities across multiple verticals, including healthcare and financial services. Our partnership with IBM continues to drive greater productivity and innovation. With IBM, mobilefirst for iOS apps now in more than 300,300 client engagements. And with its mobile-scale offering, IBM recently closed an agreement to deploy 11,000 iOS devices at -- bank to drive digital transformation. Our retail and online stores produced great results with strong revenue growth in all our geographic segments and 18% growth overall. Visitors to our retail and online stores are up 16% over last year and we added four new stores during the March quarter. With the opening of our store in Dubai last week, we're now at 495 stores in 18 countries. Let me now turn to our cash position: We ended the quarter with $256.8 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $10.8 billion — $239.6 billion of this cash, or 93% of the total, was outside of the United States. We issued $11 billion in debt during the quarter, bringing us to $88.5 billion in term debt and $10 billion in commercial paper outstanding. We returned over $10 billion to investors over the quarter. We paid $3 billion in dividends and equivalents and we spent $4 billion on repurchases of $31.1 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also launched a new $3 billion ASR, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 17.5 million shares and we retired 6.3 million shares upon the completion of our 9th accelerated share repurchase program in February. All of these activities contributed to a net diluted share count reduction of 66.3 million shares in the quarter. We have now completed $211.2 billion of our $250 billion capital return program, including $151 billion in share repurchases. As Tim mentioned, today we're announcing an update to our program, which we're extending by four quarters through March of 2019 and increasing in size to a total of $300 billion. Once again, given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value we see in our stock, we're allocating the majority of the program expansion to share repurchases. Our board has increased the share-repurchase authorization by $35 billion, raising it from the current $175 billion-level to $210 billion. We will also continue to net-share settle vesting employees restrictive stock units. In addition, we're raising our dividend for the fifth time in less than five years as we know this is very important to many of our investors who value income. The quarterly dividend will grow from 57 cents to 63 cents per share, an increase of 10.5%. This is effective with our next dividend which the board has declared today, payable on May 18, 2017 with shareholders of record as of May 15, 2017. With over $12 billion in annual dividend payments, we're proud to be one of the largest dividend-payers in the world and we continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. In total, with this updated program, during the next eight quarters we expect to return $89 billion to our investors, which represents about 12% of our market cap at the current stock price. We expect to continue to fund our capital return program with current US cash, future US cash generation, and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets. We will continue to review capital allocation regularly taking into account the needs of our business, investment opportunities, and our financial outlook. We will also continue to solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This approach will allow us to be flexible and thoughtful about the size, the mix, and the pace of our program. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $43.5 and $45.5 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5 and 38.5%. We expect -- to be between $6.6 and $6.7 billion. We expect OINE to be about $450 million. We expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. On Qualcomm and Apple's decision to halt royalty payments Katy Huberty, Morgan Stanley My first question is for Luca, around gross margins. How were you able to expand gross margins sequentially and guide rather seasonally for the June quarter in light of what's going on in the memory market? And maybe if you can comment in particular whether the hold back of payments to Qualcomm is benefiting you at all on gross margins year on year? And also, whether your contracts around commodity prices is likely to hit gross margins by more in the back half of this calendar year. Luca Maestri Thank you, Katie. A lot of questions. Let me take it one by one. Let me start with the performance for the March quarter, which we were very happy with. As you said, we were up 40 basis points sequentially and this is in spite of the fact as you know that we lose leverage as we go from the December quarter to the March quarter, foreign-exchange headwind on a sequential basis 100 basis points. Obviously that was also a negative and as you said we started to experience some level of cost pressure on the memory side particularly on on and on NAND and DRAM. To offset that and actually do better than that, we had very good cost performance on other commodities. And the fact that our services mix increases as we go through the year, that is, of course, also helping. Given the profile of our gross margin for services. But that answers the question around Q2. As we move into the June quarter, as you know we tend to have some level of gross margin compression as we go from the March quarter to the June quarter — again, the majority of that comes from the sequential loss of leverage, we also have a different mix of products as we move into the June quarter, and the cost pressures on memory will remain. We expect to offset, partially, these impacts with other cost efficiencies and a mixed shift towards services. The impact on NAND and DRAM will continue to be there and we expect it to be there. You know we don't guide past the June quarter but we expect it to be there for the time being. On Qualcomm, I just want to make it very, very clear that we are accruing. We do not expect to be paying more than what we are accruing right now, so we didn't get any benefit in our margins during the March quarter and we're not getting any benefit during the June quarter either. On the supply-constrained iPhone 7 launch OK, thank you, and just a follow-up for Tim: As you noted in your remarks, the iPhone 7 Plus demand is selling incredibly well. And this is a product that was pretty severely supply-constrained in the December quarter. I just wonder whether there are any lessons learned as you go forward into future product launches around how you manage the timing of announcing a product when there's supply constraints and how you might work with the supply chain differently around ramping some of these components that have particular difficulties around the yields early on. Tim Cook Katy, one of the things that we did not get right was the mix between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. It wound up the demand was much stronger to the 7 Plus than we had predicted, so it took us a little while to adjust all the way back through the supply chain and to bring iPhone 7 Plus into balance which occurred early this past quarter. What did we learn from it? Every time we go through a launch, we learn something. You can bet we're brushing our models and we'll apply everything we learned to the next time. On Apple's numbers in China and weak performance in Hong Kong Shannon Cross, Cross Research Tim, can you talk a bit about what's going on in China and give us some more color especially as you're going through the year and then — obviously we won't talk about the next product launch — but just, are there any shifts in demand with greater China down 14%? Was it all iPhone or mix? Anything you can provide and then I have a follow-up. Tim Cook Thanks for the question, Shannon. We saw in Q2 a performance that, combined with Q1, formed the first half of the year was much better than what we experienced in the second half of last year. And if you look at what was driving that, iPhone 7 Plus — we sold the highest number of Plus models in the first half than ever before compared to 6s Plus or compared to the 6 Plus. Also the Mac business did extremely well — Mac revenue growth was up 20% in China and we had extremely strong services growth during the quarter in China. As I mentioned in my comments, our retail and online stores did well overall and in China. They grew by 21%, which is an acceleration from what we had seen in the previous quarter. And traffic, which for us is incredibly important in the retail stores because we do a lot more than sell, traffic was up 27% year on year. And now seven of our top 10 highest trafficked stores are in greater China. And so that's the set of things that sort of went in our direction, so to speak. On the flip side, currency devalued by 5%, so that's not an insignificant headwind. And our performance continued to be weak in Hong Kong, which has been hit a bit harder as the tourism market continues to slump. Also where the iPhone 7 Plus did well, we didn't perform as well on some of the previous generation iPhones. So that's sort of the set of things on the plus and minus side. We did perform about where I thought we would — I thought it would be similar to the previous quarter and it was. What I now believe is we'll improve a bit more during this current quarter — not back to growth, but make more progress and we continue to believe that there's an enormous opportunity there. Y'know, in the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there. On Apple's plans for its massive amount of cash Alright, thank you. I don't know if Luca wants to take this, but thoughts on cash usage? Y'know, you increased your program but you still have, I think, 160 billion of net cash and obviously continue to generate cash. So I'm curious — given some of the commentary that's come out of the administration, which I think most companies were expecting some sort of a return, how do you generally think about what you need to run the business from a cash perspective, how you think about the balance sheet from a strength perspective, just, y'know, as we look forward to what hopefully will come through. Luca Maestri Shannon, you know how we run our capital return program we've been pretty consistent during the last five years. Essentially for the last five years the way we've run the company is essentially to return our free cash flow to our investors. That's what we've done with the program until now. And you know the expansion of the program that we've announced today goes in the same direction. Right? We know how much we need to invest in that business. We will never underinvest in the business. We are in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have and given the current capital structure that we have, we decided that until now we return about 100 percent of the free cash flow to investors. It is difficult for us to speculate about what might or might not happen. The program that we're announcing today reflects the current tax legislation in this country and there's a lot that still needs to happen there and we'll see. Obviously we will reassess our situation if things change. On Apple's growing subscriber base Rod Hall, J.P. Morgan I wanted to start off just going back to the 165 million subscriptions and ask Tim or Luca if you could comment on the unique number of users there and I think you had made a comment, Tim, in your prepared remarks that the average revenue per user is up or maybe that was you Luca? But if you guys could just talk about you know any more color around that average revenue per user it would be interesting to us. Luca Maestri We don't disclose into this number of subscriptions of course. We're just giving you that the total count of subscriptions that are out there. Of course there are several customers that subscribe to more than one of our services. There is some level of overlap but the total number of subscribers is very, very large. Obviously, less than 165 million. But it's very good for us to see the breadth of subscriptions that we offer and that customers are interested in. It's a large number. And if you remember, we quoted the same number a quarter ago and we talked about 150 million. So when you think about a sequential increase of 15 million subscriptions from the December quarter to the March quarter, it really gives you a sense for the momentum that we have on our content stores. It's quite impressive to have 15 million subscriptions in 90 days. As we look at the dynamics that are happening on our content stores and particularly on the App Store, which is the largest, we see fairly consistently two things: We see that the number of paying accounts is growing a lot, and I mentioned the increase in number of paying accounts that we've had during these last 90 days is the largest that we've ever had. So there's a very large number of people coming into the ecosystem, experiencing the ecosystem which is obviously improving all the time in quality and quantity, and then start paying and transacting on our stores. And that number is growing very very, strongly strong double digits. What we're also seeing as we look at the people that start paying on our stores, we see a pretty common trend over time, and we keep track of that across cohorts of customers, that as people come into the ecosystem and start paying on the ecosystem, we see a spending profile that is very similar around the world. People start at a certain level and then they tend to spend more over time. And so obviously the combination of people spending more over time and having more people that are now actually spending on the stores, contributes to this 40 percent growth that Tim mentioned for the App Store on a year over year basis. On pricing and profit of Apple's services business Tim, I wanted to just ask… The services revenue keeps growing and of course the profit contribution from that is growing. And we've also at the same time I think seen you maybe a little more aggressive than Apple has been historically in pricing certain—key technologies lets call them, that maybe you want to penetrate the market with? And I just wonder if you could just comment a little bit on your strategy there in terms of the usage of that extra profit contribution from that services business. You know, how you intend to apply it to the rest of the business. Thank you. Tim Cook Rod, the way that we think about pricing is, we come up with a price that we think is a good value for the product that we're delivering. And we do that on the hardware side as well as on the services side. And so that's how we think about it. We're really not thinking about taking profits from one to subsidize the other or vice versa. On Apple's successful wearables business and the future of its wearable devices Steve Milanovich, UBS Tim, could you comment on the opportunity in wearables? The watch some people consider disappointing, had what seems to be a very good quarter. And ironically the competition almost seems to be fading in that part of the market right now. The AirPods, of course, are doing well. Do you see wearables expanding over time into a broader product line and increasingly being independent of the iPhone longer term? Tim Cook We have seen the watch as, you know, a really key product category for us since before we launched it. And we took our time to get it right. And we've made it even better with the Series 2 offering. And we're really proud of the growth of the business. You know, Watch units more than doubled in six of our top 10 markets, which is phenomenal growth particularly in a non-holiday quarter. And so we couldn't be more satisfied with it. As some people are doing, when you begin to combine the watch revenues with the revenues for AirPods, and as you know is the first full quarter of shipments for AirPods, it's still very much in the ramping mode and we're not even coming close to satisfying the demand. And then add the Beats products that a group of our customers really enjoy as well. And look on the trailing 12 months—this is not a forecast—that business was was well into the Fortune 500. And so as I look at that, that's pretty fast to come that far. You know the watch hasn't been out very long and AirPods have been out there for three, four months. And so we feel really great about it. Where does it go? I wouldn't want to comment on that. But we do have a really great pipeline here. And I think in terms of competition falling out and so forth. The watch area is really hard. It in essence from an engineering point of view is similar to a phone in terms of the intricacies and so forth. And so I'm not very surprised that some people are falling out of it, but we're very committed to it and believe that it's already a big business and believe over time it will be even larger. On 451 Research's iPhone survey and the reported decline in iPhone retention rate You mentioned the 451 Research survey. They did have a couple of findings that were kind of interesting. One is a nine-year low in iPhone purchase intent, and that might just be where you are in the cycle, and the other was a declining retention rate in the US toward 80 percent. Any comment on either of those and whether you're concerned? Tim Cook I only glanced at it. And so I haven't had time to study it but in general what we are seeing, we're seeing what we believe to be a pause in purchases on iPhone which we believe are due to the earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones. And so that part is clearly going on, and it could be what's behind the data. I don't know. But but we are seeing that, in full transparency. More on Apple's decision to withhold royalty payments to Qualcomm Toni Sacconaghi, Bernstein Tim, I'm wondering if you can comment on your recent decision and the rationale for withholding royalty payments to Qualcomm. And really specifically, I wonder what you believe is the risk that Qualcomm could have a detrimental response such as withholding modem chip sales or potentially even getting an injunction on iPhones in select geographies around the world. And I'd like to understand your perspective on whether either those are real risks to any degree. And why would Apple potentially take on those risks, you know, just in advance of what will arguably be your most significant and largest product launch in history? Tim Cook Anyone that has a standards-essential patent has a responsibility to offer it to everyone that would like it under what are called FRAND terms. FRAND stands for "fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory" terms. That's both the price and the business terms. Qualcomm has not made such an offer to Apple. And so I don't believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that. I think that there's plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see. In terms of why we're withholding royalties. You can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount. You don't know how much to pay. And so, you know, they think we owe some amount we think we owe a different amount. And there hasn't been a meeting of the minds there, and so at this point we need the courts to decide that. Unless we are able to over time settle between us on some amount. But right now we are depending upon the courts to do that. And so that is the thinking. The reason that we're pursuing this is that Qualcomm's trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value, and they do some really great work around standards essential patents. But it's one small part of what an iPhone is. It has nothing to do with the display or the Touch ID or a gazillion other innovations that Apple has done. And so we don't think that's right. And so we're taking a principled stand on it, and we strongly believe we're in the right. I'm sure they believe that they are. And that's what courts are for and we'll let it go with that. On iPhone sales, upgrades, and switchers Thank you. I was wondering if I could just follow up a little bit on iPhone demand. If I try and adjust for the drawdown in inventory and the extra week last quarter, I think sequentially iPhones declined about 27 percent if I make those adjustments. And that's actually quite a bit lower than the normal seasonality we would see from Q1 and Q2, which is typically closer to 20 percent. I understand your comments around China but your comparison was 40 points easier this quarter relative to last quarter and the growth rate improved only marginally, I think when you adjust for the extra week. And then you made a final comment around "a pause" on iPhones. So I'm wondering if you could maybe elaborate on what's the below-sequential, at least by my calculation, growth rate in Q2 attributable to a pause. And can you characterize what you think upgrade rates are doing perhaps broadly by geography, to help us better understand what might be happening or whether there are competitive dynamics that also are at play here that again might be contributing to that pause and that sequential decline that I referenced. Thank you. Tim Cook Lot of questions there. Let me give you some color as I see it. In this quarter, we reduced channel inventory by 1.2 million units. And so if you look on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily what we look at from a unit point of view because it would have the seasonality embedded in that, we grew sell-through on a year-over-year basis. Last quarter, I'm sure other folks remember, was a 14-week quarter. So you sort of have to adjust the rates last quarter to get out what the underlying sell-through growth was. And so I think that when you do that you're going to find that actually the year over year performance is similar, between the quarters. In terms of upgraders, we saw the largest absolute number of upgraders ever in any six-month period in the first half of this year. First half of this fiscal year, to precise. And we saw the largest absolute number of switchers outside of Greater China in the same period that we've ever seen. And so in four of the five operating segments, as I think Luca mentioned in his comments, we had very good growth and it was really propelled by the demand for iPhone 7 Plus which is growing incredibly fast around the world. And so that's kind of the color I would add there and hopefully some of that is useful for you. On iPhone inventory Simona Jankowski, Goldman Sachs Last year you had a 4 million unit channel inventory reduction for the iPhone in the June quarter. So just curious what you're expecting for this year. Just so we have an apples-to-apples comparison if we think about your guidance. Luca Maestri As you know, Simona, we do not provide guidance around units and around channel inventory reduction. But our goal is always to have the right amount of weeks of inventory in the channel. And if you look at our history over the last several years, we have fairly consistently reduced channel inventory in the June quarter, so I think it's a fair expectation to have. On Apple's expansion into India and its affect on future sales Tim, you've been excited about the India market for some time and have made strides in establishing a retail manufacturing and R&D presence there. So just curious, as you look at the market and the rollout of 4G there, is it reasonable for us to assume that Apple can sell something on the order of 10 to 20 million iPhones there next year and then grow from there. Tim Cook Yeah, we make it a point not to forecast by geo. We just provide a current quarter forecast. But as hopefully you've seen, as we began to give you more information about India we've been investing quite a bit. We have a ton of energy going into the country on a number of fronts, and it is the third largest smartphone market in the world today behind China and the United States. And so we believe, particularly now that a 4G infrastructure is going in the country and it's continuing to be expanded, that there is a huge opportunity for Apple there. And so that's that, and the demographics of the country is why we're putting so much energy there. On Apple's reception in India and methods by which it can expand in the country Jim Suva, Citigroup Thank you very much and congratulations on returning to growth consistently. That's great. I believe, Tim, in your prepared comments, you mentioned India was growing double digits, which is great. But I believe if you look at geographic information, India is really under-penetrated from an Apple reception perceptive. But yet they have LTE, you have the iPhone SE, the lower priced iPhone. You think that, say, this next 12-18 months is going to be a turning point, or is it more you need to work with the government to have Apple own stores or production there, or what's it really going to take to get India going along, because we think it's really a great opportunity. Tim Cook Well we think it's a great opportunity too. And so we're we're bringing all the things that we've brought to bear in other markets that we've eventually done well in. That's from channel to stores to our ecosystem and so forth. Phil was just over there opening a developer's center last quarter. So there are a ton of things going on there, and we agree that we are under-penetrated there. Our growth rates are are good—really good by most people's expectations, maybe not mine as much. And so we're putting a lot of energy in, just like we have in other geo's that eventually wound up producing more and more. And so I'm very excited about it. The 4G network investment really began rolling in in a significant way toward the last quarter of last year, as you know. But they are moving fast, they're moving at a speed that I have not seen, in any other country in the world, once they were started. And it is truly impressive.

They're thin and light, geared towards style-conscious users (Burgundy notebook, sweet!), yet Microsoft claims they are more powerful than last year's MacBook Pros and they have better battery life while being thinner and lighter. By Gadjo Cardenas Sevilla Microsoft today held an education event where it launched various initiatives towards strengthening its position in the educational space. The introduced Windows 10 S, a secure version of Windows that relies purely on the Microsoft Store to download and manage apps. The laptops aren't coming to Canada until 'later this year'. Microsoft also introduced their first bona fide notebook, the Surface Laptop, which starts at US $999, features Core i5 and i7 processors, a touch display for Pen input, 14-hours of battery life, a striking seamless premium design that incorporates unibody enclosure with a colourful cloth covered keyboards and a variety of sexy colours. While Windows 10 S, looks like a better option to Chrome OS, specially if it can run on low-priced (sub $400) notebooks built for education, the Surface Laptop is clearly Microsoft's latest thrust into Apple's notebook market. Microsoft's Panos Panay, talked exhuberantly about education and how Microsoft understands what students need and all the challenges they face. He made jabs at how the 'technology needs to dissapear,' likely a shot at the Touch Bar on recent MacBook Pros, which while innovative, was deemed uneccessary and distracting by various users. Looking at the Surface Laptops, they look very much like machines that could fit Apple's notebook niche nicely. They're thin and light, geared towards style-conscious users (Burgundy notebook, sweet!), yet Microsoft claims they are more powerful than last year's MacBook Pros and they have better battery life while being thinner and lighter. These are awesome notebooks for Windows users, for executives, for anyone that finds the 2-in-1 functionality of Surface Pro and Surface Book to be too much. But for students? Not sure about that. I can see these Surface Notebooks appealing to college students, those who are likely to buy a MacBook Air or a MacBook Pro (similar price point but they get touch functionality, the ability to use a Pen, possibly a better gaming machine). The good news is there will be cheaper notebooks by OEM partners. "Our goal with Windows 10 S is to develop the open vibrant partner-centric ecosystem we have today. Our device partners, including Acer, ASUS, Dell, Fujitsu, HP, Samsung, and Toshiba, offer a range of new Windows 10 PCs for Education today – starting at $189. In the coming months, these partners will also offer a range of Windows 10 S devices – from powerful and affordable Windows Ink and touch PCs to beautiful premium devices," Microsoft explains. Microsoft has already tried to take a chunk out of Apple's desktop pro market with the Surface Studio, an apple-esque desktop all-in-one that is like an iMac and giant iPad in one. Now, Microsoft is moving away from its 2-in-1 niche to go for Apple's jugular, its popular MacBook Air (not been updated in years) and MacBook Pro with one product under the Surface Laptop line.  Microsoft has done its homework, it has hit multiple birds with one multi-coloured stone but there's a lot to consider. While sexy and desireable, Surface Laptops are gen 1 products and a new category. The Surface Book (and its early adopters) suffered through interminable glitches and software issue for months before Microsoft got it right. I use a Surface Book now with the Creators Update and its still a bit janky, but there's no denying Its a solid and reliably product.  Surface Laptop cannot afford such a misstep, not with MacBooks being rock solid devices with hardly any viruses or known glitches to contend with. Chromebooks, they run a browser and limited web apps, which is easier overall. Offers for Teachers and Students To make it easy and affordable to bring Windows 10, Office 365 for Education with Microsoft Teams and Minecraft to the classroom, Microsoft is offering teachers and students: New Windows 10 education PCs starting at $189 USD Free one-year subscription to Minecraft: Education Edition for new Windows 10 education PCs Free Windows 10 S for all schools on any current Windows Pro PC Free Microsoft Office 365 for Education with Microsoft Teams Free trial of Microsoft Intune for Education Windows 10 S, Office 365 for Education with Microsoft Teams, Minecraft: Education Edition, and Microsoft Intune for Education offer a complete solution for teachers and students.   Stay tuned for more information and coverage of Microsoft's new hardware as well as Windows 10 S.

Related Apple Reports Drop In iPhone Sales As It Increases Share Buybacks “Apple is a company that could only have been created in America,” he told analysts in a quarterly conference call. “We’re incredibly proud to support more than 2 million jobs in all 50 states, and we expect to create even more.” In the fiscal year that ended in September, “we spent more than $50 billion in the United States with American suppliers, developers and partners. And we continue to invest confidently in our future.” Analysts were more interested in other subjects, especially the lower than expected iPhone sales in the quarter that ended in March. “One of the things we did not get right was the mix between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7+,” Cook says. “The demand was much stronger for the 7+ than we had predicted. So it took a little while to adjust… What did we learn from it? Every time we go through a launch we learn something. And you can bet that we are brushing up our models and will apply everything we’ve learned to the next time.” Cook also noted that there’s “a pause in purchases” for iPhones “which we believe are due to the earlier and more frequent reports about future iPhones.” The CEO defended the Apple Watch, which some analysts consider a disappointment. “We have seen the watch as a key category for us,” he says noting that unit sales more than doubled in six of its 10 biggest markets early this year. “We couldn’t be more satisfied with it.” The company doesn’t break out a sales number for the watch, choosing instead to blend it with other products including AirPods. The earphones “are very much in the ramping mode and we’re not coming close to satisfying demand.” Business for the two products, plus Beats and Apple TV, “was well into the Fortune 500. As I look at that, that’s pretty fast” growth. “We’re very committed to it. It’s already a big business and we believe, over time, it will be even larger.” Cook also defended Apple’s $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm, accusing the chip maker of using “monopoly power” to raise prices. Qualcomm has a “standards essential” patent, Cook says, that carries “a responsibility to offer it to everyone that would like it” under fair, resaonable and non-discriminatory terms. “Qualcomm has not made such an offer to Apple.” Since there’s a dispute over how much Qualcomm is owed, “you don’t know how much to pay….We need the courts to decide that unless we’re able to settle between us.” The chip company, he adds, “is trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value.” But the chips are “one small part of what an iPhone is. It has nothing to do with the display or touch ID or a gazillion other innovations that Apple has done. We don’t think that’s right. So we’re taking a principled stand.” Subscribe to Deadline Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy 3 3 Comments Cancel reply Comments On Deadline Hollywood are monitored.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Hayley Tsukayama By Hayley Tsukayama May 2 at 6:42 PM Follow @htsuka An Apple iPhone 7 and the company logo are seen in Bordeaux, France, in February. (Regis Duvignain/Reuters) Apple faces more pressure than ever to deliver with its highly anticipated next-generation iPhone, as the company reported Tuesday that it sold fewer iPhones than analysts had expected in the company's second quarter. Those looking forward to the new phone may have held off on buying a new device until the fall, analysts said. The softer-than-expected sales come as Apple faces increased competition for the device that makes up the majority of Apple's profits. Apple sold 50 million iPhones in the past quarter, 1 million less than in the same period last year. Analysts had expected Apple to sell 52 million units. The company reported $52.9 billion in revenue, slightly below analyst estimates. On an earnings call, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said that Apple did not correctly estimate how popular the iPhone 7 Plus would be compared with the iPhone 7, which caused some supply problems. The company did show strong profits thanks in part to its services unit, reporting earnings of $2.10 a share vs. an expected $2.02.  But the disappointing iPhone sales, combined with a weak outlook for the next quarter, sent the stock down more than 2 percent in after-hours trading. U.S. sales grew 11 percent, but the company saw a 14 percent sales drop in China. Cook played down concerns about sales in the world's largest phone market, saying that he thought those results were in line with previous years. He added that seven of the company's most popular stores are in China. But local competition from Chinese smartphone makers such as Huawei have been chipping away at Apple's market share. Cook addressed analyst questions about the Apple Watch, saying the company is happy with sales and remains “very committed to it and believe … over time it will be even larger.” Apple doesn't break out sales numbers for its wearable, but analysts expected to see more growth from that part of Apple's business as competitors leave the smartwatch market . Many analysts anticipate that the company will deliver a completely redesigned iPhone later this year. It is expected to be called the iPhone 8 and to have an edge-to-edge display similar to that of the well-reviewed Samsung Galaxy S8, which went on sale in April. And analysts are upbeat about Apple's ability to bounce back, thanks to the company's reputation and customer loyalty. “We're bullish on the iPhone 8 for three reasons: Apple's ecosystem stickiness, the expected upgradability of the device, and teenage fondness of Apple devices,” said Clement Thibault, a senior investing analyst with Investing.com. Meanwhile, Apple is also facing increased competition in its growing Mac business. Microsoft announced Tuesday morning a sleek new laptop aimed at students that is designed to compete directly with the MacBook Air. [Microsoft takes aim at Apple and Google in the classroom with new products] Sales of the iPad continued to slide. The company also increased the size of its share dividend and buyback programs to $300 billion through March 2019. Apple's stockpile of cash is nearly $260 billion, which — as The Washington Post's Thomas Heath reported — is more than the gross domestic product of Jamaica and Finland combined. [Apple’s cash pile is as big as the GDP of Finland and Jamaica, combined] The main bright spot for Apple continues to be in its services. The App Store, iTunes and other subscription products generated $7 billion, up 18 percent from the previous year. Apple faces stiff competition from Samsung but is in a strong enough position to weather a weaker quarter — as long as it delivers on the promise of the iPhone 8, said Thomas Cooke, a professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. “This is acceptable, considering the environment and that they have new products in the pipeline. That people are holding onto their phones a little longer than expected shouldn’t be so alarming,” he said. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

The Associated Press Published Tuesday, May 02, 2017 6:31PM EDT Last updated Tuesday, May 02, 2017 6:31PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print ___ Lawmakers to airlines: Improve service or Congress steps in WASHINGTON (AP) — The chief executive of United Airlines apologized Tuesday on Capitol Hill for an incident in which a passenger was dragged off a flight, calling it "a mistake of epic proportions" as frustrated lawmakers warned airline executives to improve customer service or face congressional intervention. House Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster, R-Pa., said carriers should use the notoriety of the violent event — and a separate incident in which a mother with a stroller was bullied by a flight attendant — to make long-needed improvements. If the airlines don't make changes, Congress is likely to step in, Shuster and other lawmakers said. ___ Apple growing cash stash spurs talk of huge acquisition SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — As Apple's stash of cash grows, so does the possibility that the company will use some of the money for a huge acquisition that would expand its empire beyond iPhones and other gadgets. The guessing game primarily has focused on potential acquisitions of video streaming service Netflix and electric car maker Tesla Motors. But in recent months the takeover talk has swirled around whether Apple might do something even more dramatic by trying to buy Walt Disney Co. ___ Visa crackdown threatens seasonal help at US resorts PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Innkeepers, restaurateurs and landscapers around the U.S. say they are struggling to find seasonal help and turning down business in some cases because the government tightened up on visas for temporary foreign workers. At issue are H-2B temporary visas, which are issued for workers holding down seasonal, nonagricultural jobs. The U.S. caps the number at 66,000 per fiscal year. Some workers return year after year, and Congress has let them do so in the past without being counted toward the limit. No such exception was passed for 2017 at the end of last year, after the presidential election. ___ Pay for news? More than half of Americans say they do NEW YORK (AP) — A battered news industry can find some flickers of hope in a survey that gauges public willingness to pay for journalism, as long as its leaders plan judiciously. A little more than half of American adults regularly pay for news, through newspaper and magazine subscriptions, apps on electronic devices or contributions to public media, according to the Media Insight Project, a collaboration between the American Press Institute and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. ___ Auto sales fall 4.7 per cent.; 7-year win streak may come to end DETROIT (AP) — U.S. auto sales fell 4.7 per cent last month, the most pronounced slowdown of the year and a strong indication that 2017 will put an end to seven straight years of growth. Auto executives and analysts, who have been anticipating a slowdown, saw no cause for panic. Many expect sales in the important economic sector to top 17 million for the third straight year, an industry first. Still, sales have dropped for four straight months, the first time that's happened since the economy ground to a halt in 2009. April sales totalled just over 1.4 million, a figure that translates to an annual sales rate of 16.9 million, far below last year's record of 17.5 million. The April decline brought year-to-date sales down by 2.4 per cent from a year ago. ___ Shakeup at Molina, CEO and CFO, sons of founder are out INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Brothers Mario and John Molina have been ousted as leaders of Molina Healthcare, the publicly traded health insurer their father founded to serve poor families. The company cited disappointing financial performance and its need to improve its operations and profits for the shake-up. Out are CEO Dr. Mario Molina, 58, who replaced his father as president and CEO in 1996, and John Molina, 52, who had served as chief financial officer since 2003. ___ Microsoft takes aim at Google with laptop, slim Windows NEW YORK (AP) — Microsoft is taking aim at Google as it introduced a Surface device for students and slimmed down Windows for the classroom. The new Surface Laptop is the first Surface device without a detachable keyboard. Microsoft says the new laptop will have up to 14.5 hours of battery life, compared with 12 hours for the MacBook Air. The Surface Laptop will come out on June 15. ___ India-based IT company Infosys plans Indiana tech centre INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — India-based outsourcing and information technology company Infosys announced Tuesday that it will establish a central Indiana tech centre as part of a broader expansion in the United States that is projected to create 10,000 jobs in the coming years. CEO Vishal Sikka joined Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb to announce the plan, which includes an $8.7 million investment to lease and equip office space in the Indianapolis area to accommodate 2,000 new workers by the end of 2021. ___ US allows imports of Argentine lemons WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States says it will allow lemon imports from Argentina's top producing region for the first time in 16 years. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that it will lift the ban on lemons from northwestern Argentina on May 26. The decision came days after President Donald Trump said that he was reviewing the position of his administration on the issue. In December, President Barack Obama's administration said it would lift the ban, which had been imposed following complaints by producers in California that the Argentine lemons carried diseases. ___ Italy to loan Alitalia $650 million as it seeks a new buyer MILAN (AP) — Struggling Italian air carrier Alitalia entered its second period of bankruptcy protection in a decade on Tuesday with the government approving a 600 million-euro ($650 million) bridge loan to keep the airline operating as it seeks a new buyer. The move came after the Alitalia board acknowledged the failure of a government-brokered relaunch plan, which workers overwhelmingly rejected despite softened job and salary cuts, out of concern it lacked a realistic strategy to revive revenue. ___ The Standard & Poor's 500 index edged up 2.84 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 2,391.17. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 36.43 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 20,949.89. The Nasdaq composite gained 3.76 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 6,095.37. Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.18, or 2.4 per cent, to $47.66 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed $1.06, or 2.1 per cent, to $50.46 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline dipped 1 cent to $1.51 a gallon. Heating oil lost 2 cents to $1.47 a gallon. Natural gas gave up 2 cents to $3.20 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Roston - May 2, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Apple has announced its second quarter financial results, and in it we see a surprising decrease in iPhone sales. Overall, the company reported iPhone sales totaling in at 50.76 million during the year’s second quarter, a slight drop, relatively speaking, from last year’s 51.19 million units. The figure ultimately falls short of analysts estimates, and may be largely due to the fabled ‘iPhone 8’ and its huge array of rumored features. Apple has announced a quarter revenue figure of $52.9 billion, which works out to $2.10/diluted share. It’s a good figure when looking at the year-on-year comparison — during the same quarter last year, Apple revealed revenue of $50.6 billion which worked out to $1.90/diluted share. Overall, Apple has its international sales largely to thank for the uptick in revenue, as they account for a solid 65-percent of the funds. Speaking about this, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated: We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus. We’ve seen great customer response to both models of the new iPhone 7 (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition and we’re thrilled with the strong momentum of our Services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter. Looking ahead, we are excited to welcome attendees from around the world to our annual Worldwide Developers Conference next month in San Jose. The revenue shows good things for Apple, but as mentioned, the iPhone sales were a disappointment in an otherwise notable fiscal quarter. As well, the iPhone raked in 1.2-percent greater revenues in the last quarter, which itself is due to a higher average selling price than in the past. It is possible, as well, that we’ll see a degree of rebound effect in the future following the launch of the greatly anticipated iPhone 8 (or iPhone Pro or whatever non-official name you prefer). READ: This iPhone 8 leak is the biggest and most exciting one yet The phone is expected to bring a large number of features to mark the handset’s 10th anniversary. Based on existing rumors and leaks, these features could include everything from the elimination of the home button to a fingerprint sensor under the display, a 3D camera, OLED panel, wireless charging, support for the Apple Pencil, curved edges, and more. The big question at this point is when the iPhone 8 will be released. Though we typically see new iPhone models in September, many sources have surfaced claiming troubles behind closed doors. Namely, reports indicate that Apple is having trouble dealing with the Touch ID and its new rumored position beneath the display. Leaks have indicated that Apple has at least entertained the idea of the sensor being moved to the back of the device, and at least one source has stated that Apple needs a solution in place by this month to avoid bumping the phone’s mass production — and therefore release — to a later date.

This is the fifth annual dividend hike since Apple initiated its first payout in 2012. John Melloy | @johnmelloy 8 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters What Apple may buy with all its cash: Researcher    8 Hours Ago | 00:33 There was a time when Apple investors were loath to call it a "dividend stock." Now it's the biggest dividend stock there is. Apple announced after the bell Tuesday a 10.5 percent increase in its dividend to $13.22 billion annually, surpassing Exxon Mobil's $12.77 billion payout and making it the biggest-paying dividend stock in the world. The iPhone maker reported quarterly earnings after the bell which slightly disappointed Wall Street as sales fell short of estimates. But it also said it was hiking its quarterly dividend to 63 cents a share from 57 cents a share. The giant payout increase, a luxury made possible by the tech company's now $256.8 billion cash hoard, should help cushion the blow. Biggest annual dividends in the S&P 500 Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices This is the fifth annual dividend hike since Apple initiated its first payout in 2012, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. This increase is bigger than last year's 9.6 percent hike, but short of the 15 percent increase back in 2013, according to S&P Dow Jones. "They pay out more than U.S. Steel is worth," wrote Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst and data guru with S&P Dow Jones Indices, who trumpeted the payout in an email shortly after Apple's earnings hit. To be sure, Exxon still pays a higher dividend yield than Apple (3.75 percent to 1.72 percent) because its share price is lower. The oil producer long loved by investors for its payout increased its dividend for the 35th year in a row last week by 2.7 percent to 77 cents a share, Silverblatt notes. What's most shocking about Apple's dividend is that it could easily be even bigger if the company didn't also choose to deploy some capital via share repurchases. The tech giant announced after the bell that it was upping its buyback program by $35 billion and plans to spend a total of $210 billion buying back its stock by the end of March 2019. Correction: This story originally misstated the amount Apple is spending on share repurchases. It is $210 billion, according to its earnings release.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Microsoft has taken their HoloLens into Education to get the Leap on their Competitors | Main May 02, 2017 Apple Hits Guidance Bang On, Slightly Misses iPhone Sales   Today Apple announced financial results for its fiscal 2017 second quarter ended April 1, 2017. The Company posted quarterly revenue of $52.9 billion and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $2.10. These results compare to revenue of $50.6 billion and earnings per diluted share of $1.90 in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 65 percent of the quarter's revenue. Apple's guidance for the quarter was between 51.5 and 53.5 – so Apple was in line.   CNBC via Thomson Reuters expected $52.97 and 52 million iPhones. Apple sold 50.763 million iPhones as noted in Apple's Unaudited Summary Data below.   Kevin O'Leary, Shark Tank Co-Host thinks Apple is doing fantastic. Hear his commentary in the CNBC reaction below.     Tim Cook, Apple's CEO stated: "We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus. We've seen great customer response to both models of the new iPhone 7 (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition and we're thrilled with the strong momentum of our Services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter. Looking ahead, we are excited to welcome attendees from around the world to our annual Worldwide Developers Conference next month in San Jose."   Luca Maestri, Apple's CFO: "We generated strong operating cash flow of $12.5 billion and returned over $10 billion to our investors in the March quarter. Given the strength of our business and our confidence in our future, we are happy to announce another $50 billion increase to our capital return program today."   As part of the latest update to the program, the Board has increased its share repurchase authorization to $210 billion from the $175 billion level announced a year ago. The Company also expects to continue to net-share-settle vesting restricted stock units.   The Board has approved a 10.5% increase to the Company's quarterly dividend, and has declared a dividend of $0.63 per share of the Company's common stock, payable on May 18, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 15, 2017.   From the inception of its capital return program in August 2012 through March 2017, Apple has returned over $211 billion to shareholders, including $151 billion in share repurchases.   The Company plans to continue to access the domestic and international debt markets to assist in funding the program. The management team and the Board will continue to review each element of the capital return program regularly and plan to provide an update on the program on an annual basis.   A Few Random Points from Tim Cook   Apple Watch sales more than doubled year over year. In mainland China, total store revenue grew 27 percent, comp store revenue grew 7 percent. App Store revenue grew 40 percent year over year.   Apple is providing the following guidance for its fiscal 2017 third quarter:   revenue between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38.5 percent operating expenses between $6.6 billion and $6.7 billion other income/(expense) of $450 million tax rate of 25.5 percent   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

House Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster, R-Pa., said carriers should use the notoriety of the violent event — and a separate incident in which a mother with a stroller was bullied by a flight attendant — to make long-needed improvements. If the airlines don't make changes, Congress is likely to step in, Shuster and other lawmakers said. ___ Latest business videos Apple growing cash stash spurs talk of huge acquisition SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — As Apple's stash of cash grows, so does the possibility that the company will use some of the money for a huge acquisition that would expand its empire beyond iPhones and other gadgets. The guessing game primarily has focused on potential acquisitions of video streaming service Netflix and electric car maker Tesla Motors. But in recent months the takeover talk has swirled around whether Apple might do something even more dramatic by trying to buy Walt Disney Co. ___ Visa crackdown threatens seasonal help at US resorts PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Innkeepers, restaurateurs and landscapers around the U.S. say they are struggling to find seasonal help and turning down business in some cases because the government tightened up on visas for temporary foreign workers. At issue are H-2B temporary visas, which are issued for workers holding down seasonal, nonagricultural jobs. The U.S. caps the number at 66,000 per fiscal year. Some workers return year after year, and Congress has let them do so in the past without being counted toward the limit. No such exception was passed for 2017 at the end of last year, after the presidential election. ___ Pay for news? More than half of Americans say they do NEW YORK (AP) — A battered news industry can find some flickers of hope in a survey that gauges public willingness to pay for journalism, as long as its leaders plan judiciously. A little more than half of American adults regularly pay for news, through newspaper and magazine subscriptions, apps on electronic devices or contributions to public media, according to the Media Insight Project, a collaboration between the American Press Institute and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. ___ Auto sales fall 4.7 percent.; 7-year win streak may come to end DETROIT (AP) — U.S. auto sales fell 4.7 percent last month, the most pronounced slowdown of the year and a strong indication that 2017 will put an end to seven straight years of growth. Auto executives and analysts, who have been anticipating a slowdown, saw no cause for panic. Many expect sales in the important economic sector to top 17 million for the third straight year, an industry first. Still, sales have dropped for four straight months, the first time that's happened since the economy ground to a halt in 2009. April sales totaled just over 1.4 million, a figure that translates to an annual sales rate of 16.9 million, far below last year's record of 17.5 million. The April decline brought year-to-date sales down by 2.4 percent from a year ago. ___ Shakeup at Molina, CEO and CFO, sons of founder are out INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Brothers Mario and John Molina have been ousted as leaders of Molina Healthcare, the publicly traded health insurer their father founded to serve poor families. The company cited disappointing financial performance and its need to improve its operations and profits for the shake-up. Out are CEO Dr. Mario Molina, 58, who replaced his father as president and CEO in 1996, and John Molina, 52, who had served as chief financial officer since 2003. ___ Microsoft takes aim at Google with laptop, slim Windows NEW YORK (AP) — Microsoft is taking aim at Google as it introduced a Surface device for students and slimmed down Windows for the classroom. The new Surface Laptop is the first Surface device without a detachable keyboard. Microsoft says the new laptop will have up to 14.5 hours of battery life, compared with 12 hours for the MacBook Air. The Surface Laptop will come out on June 15. ___ India-based IT company Infosys plans Indiana tech center INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — India-based outsourcing and information technology company Infosys announced Tuesday that it will establish a central Indiana tech center as part of a broader expansion in the United States that is projected to create 10,000 jobs in the coming years. CEO Vishal Sikka joined Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb to announce the plan, which includes an $8.7 million investment to lease and equip office space in the Indianapolis area to accommodate 2,000 new workers by the end of 2021. ___ US allows imports of Argentine lemons WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States says it will allow lemon imports from Argentina's top producing region for the first time in 16 years. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that it will lift the ban on lemons from northwestern Argentina on May 26. The decision came days after President Donald Trump said that he was reviewing the position of his administration on the issue. In December, President Barack Obama's administration said it would lift the ban, which had been imposed following complaints by producers in California that the Argentine lemons carried diseases. ___ Italy to loan Alitalia $650 million as it seeks a new buyer MILAN (AP) — Struggling Italian air carrier Alitalia entered its second period of bankruptcy protection in a decade on Tuesday with the government approving a 600 million-euro ($650 million) bridge loan to keep the airline operating as it seeks a new buyer. The move came after the Alitalia board acknowledged the failure of a government-brokered relaunch plan, which workers overwhelmingly rejected despite softened job and salary cuts, out of concern it lacked a realistic strategy to revive revenue. ___ The Standard & Poor's 500 index edged up 2.84 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,391.17. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 36.43 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,949.89. The Nasdaq composite gained 3.76 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,095.37. Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.18, or 2.4 percent, to $47.66 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed $1.06, or 2.1 percent, to $50.46 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline dipped 1 cent to $1.51 a gallon. Heating oil lost 2 cents to $1.47 a gallon. Natural gas gave up 2 cents to $3.20 per 1,000 cubic feet.

The company boosted its capital return programme by US$50 billion, increasing its share repurchase authorization by US$35 billion and raising its quarterly dividend by 10.5 per cent. “There is a general softening in phone demand to contend with as well as expectations of a big upgrade, all of which softens the blow of this quarter’s miss,” said James McQuivey, a Forrester Research analyst. “If we see Apple downplaying expectations before the next upgrade cycle, it might mean that the company isn’t confident it will beat those expectations.” Apple’s revenue from the Greater China region fell 14.1 per cent to US$10.73 billion in the quarter, as cheaper rivals in the region chipped away at sales. Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri said that sales of Macs and the company’s services were strong in China during the March quarter. “The performance we’re seeing in China should get better going forward this year,” he said. Apple sold 50.76 million iPhones in its fiscal second quarter ended April 1, down from 51.19 million a year earlier. Analysts on average had estimated iPhone sales of 52.27 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. Expectations are building ahead of Apple’s 10th-anniversary iPhone range this fall, with investors hoping that the launch would help bolster sales. Apple typically launches its new iPhones in September. A big jump in sales usually follows in the holiday quarter, before demand tapers over the next few quarters as customers hold back ahead of the next launch. Apple’s 10th-anniversary iPhone range might sport features such as wireless charging, 3-D facial recognition and a curved display. The company forecast total revenue of between US$43.5 billion and US$45.5 billion for the current quarter, while analysts on average were expecting US$45.60 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts on average expect the company to sell 42.31 million iPhones in the current quarter, according to FactSet. The company’s net income rose to US$11.03 billion, or US$2.10 per share, in the second quarter, from US$10.52 billion, or US$1.90 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected US$2.02 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The company's stock was down about 1.5 percent after its quarterly revenue did not hit projections. The company posted $52.9 billion in revenue, versus the Thomson Reuters consensus estimate of $53.02 billion. Earns per share were higher than expected at $2.10, compared to $2.02. Its market cap slipped to $765 billion during after hours trading due to the poor results. Apple (AAPL) briefly hit a market capitalization of more than $776.59 billion on Tuesday, topping its previous peak market value of $774.91 billion to remain the only U.S.-listed stock with a market value of more than $700 billion. Even with other tech stocks near record highs, Apple dwarfs Alphabet (GOOGL), at $646.6 billion, Microsoft at nearly $536.4 billion and Amazon at $451.5 billion, according to FactSet. It's been a long two-year road for Apple, which again breached the $700 billion mark after falling briefly below Alphabet in 2016 as Apple posted its first year-over-year revenue drop since 2001. Since then, Apple's iPhone sales have rebounded thanks to better-than-expected demand for the iPhone 7 Plus, executives say. Boosted by the rising tide of record highs in the U.S. markets , Apple hit a record intraday share price Tuesday ahead of its quarterly earnings report after the bell. But despite busting record-high share prices, Apple has until now fallen short of its all-time high market capitalization, since market value is determined by stock price multiplied by shares outstanding. Apple currently has 5.25 million shares outstanding, compared with the 5.76 million shares outstanding it had in March 2015, according to FactSet, as the company has approved share repurchases. Apple may announce that it bought back more shares during the quarter after Tuesday's earnings report, further tempering the record market capitalization.

House Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster, R-Pa., said carriers should use the notoriety of the violent event — and a separate incident in which a mother with a stroller was bullied by a flight attendant — to make long-needed improvements. If the airlines don’t make changes, Congress is likely to step in, Shuster and other lawmakers said. ___ Bipartisan deal will keep government open until Oct. 1 Advertisement Apple growing cash stash spurs talk of huge acquisition SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — As Apple’s stash of cash grows, so does the possibility that the company will use some of the money for a huge acquisition that would expand its empire beyond iPhones and other gadgets. The guessing game primarily has focused on potential acquisitions of video streaming service Netflix and electric car maker Tesla Motors. But in recent months the takeover talk has swirled around whether Apple might do something even more dramatic by trying to buy Walt Disney Co. ___ Visa crackdown threatens seasonal help at US resorts PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Innkeepers, restaurateurs and landscapers around the U.S. say they are struggling to find seasonal help and turning down business in some cases because the government tightened up on visas for temporary foreign workers. At issue are H-2B temporary visas, which are issued for workers holding down seasonal, nonagricultural jobs. The U.S. caps the number at 66,000 per fiscal year. Some workers return year after year, and Congress has let them do so in the past without being counted toward the limit. No such exception was passed for 2017 at the end of last year, after the presidential election. ___ ‘If you’re a really good federal worker, you should welcome’ the reorganization plan, OMB says Pay for news? More than half of Americans say they do NEW YORK (AP) — A battered news industry can find some flickers of hope in a survey that gauges public willingness to pay for journalism, as long as its leaders plan judiciously. A little more than half of American adults regularly pay for news, through newspaper and magazine subscriptions, apps on electronic devices or contributions to public media, according to the Media Insight Project, a collaboration between the American Press Institute and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. ___ Auto sales fall 4.7 percent.; 7-year win streak may come to end DETROIT (AP) — U.S. auto sales fell 4.7 percent last month, the most pronounced slowdown of the year and a strong indication that 2017 will put an end to seven straight years of growth. Auto executives and analysts, who have been anticipating a slowdown, saw no cause for panic. Many expect sales in the important economic sector to top 17 million for the third straight year, an industry first. Still, sales have dropped for four straight months, the first time that’s happened since the economy ground to a halt in 2009. April sales totaled just over 1.4 million, a figure that translates to an annual sales rate of 16.9 million, far below last year’s record of 17.5 million. The April decline brought year-to-date sales down by 2.4 percent from a year ago. ___ Shakeup at Molina, CEO and CFO, sons of founder are out INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Brothers Mario and John Molina have been ousted as leaders of Molina Healthcare, the publicly traded health insurer their father founded to serve poor families. The company cited disappointing financial performance and its need to improve its operations and profits for the shake-up. Out are CEO Dr. Mario Molina, 58, who replaced his father as president and CEO in 1996, and John Molina, 52, who had served as chief financial officer since 2003. ___ Microsoft takes aim at Google with laptop, slim Windows NEW YORK (AP) — Microsoft is taking aim at Google as it introduced a Surface device for students and slimmed down Windows for the classroom. The new Surface Laptop is the first Surface device without a detachable keyboard. Microsoft says the new laptop will have up to 14.5 hours of battery life, compared with 12 hours for the MacBook Air. The Surface Laptop will come out on June 15. ___ India-based IT company Infosys plans Indiana tech center INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — India-based outsourcing and information technology company Infosys announced Tuesday that it will establish a central Indiana tech center as part of a broader expansion in the United States that is projected to create 10,000 jobs in the coming years. CEO Vishal Sikka joined Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb to announce the plan, which includes an $8.7 million investment to lease and equip office space in the Indianapolis area to accommodate 2,000 new workers by the end of 2021. ___ US allows imports of Argentine lemons WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States says it will allow lemon imports from Argentina’s top producing region for the first time in 16 years. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that it will lift the ban on lemons from northwestern Argentina on May 26. The decision came days after President Donald Trump said that he was reviewing the position of his administration on the issue. In December, President Barack Obama’s administration said it would lift the ban, which had been imposed following complaints by producers in California that the Argentine lemons carried diseases. ___ Italy to loan Alitalia $650 million as it seeks a new buyer MILAN (AP) — Struggling Italian air carrier Alitalia entered its second period of bankruptcy protection in a decade on Tuesday with the government approving a 600 million-euro ($650 million) bridge loan to keep the airline operating as it seeks a new buyer. The move came after the Alitalia board acknowledged the failure of a government-brokered relaunch plan, which workers overwhelmingly rejected despite softened job and salary cuts, out of concern it lacked a realistic strategy to revive revenue. ___ The Standard & Poor’s 500 index edged up 2.84 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,391.17. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 36.43 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,949.89. The Nasdaq composite gained 3.76 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,095.37. Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.18, or 2.4 percent, to $47.66 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed $1.06, or 2.1 percent, to $50.46 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline dipped 1 cent to $1.51 a gallon. Heating oil lost 2 cents to $1.47 a gallon. Natural gas gave up 2 cents to $3.20 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Image Credit: Jordan Novet / VentureBeat Try as Apple might, it seems interest in the iPad continues to tumble. Apple reported today that it sold 8.922 million iPads in the second quarter of its fiscal year 2017. That’s down 13 percent from a year ago. The addition of bigger iPads, iPads with Pencil, iPad corporate partnerships to write software, iPad with anything … none of it seems to be helping the gadget that many of us once thought was going to make us forget about laptops and desktop computers. Nope. To find sales numbers that low, you have to go all the way back to the second quarter of 2011, when it sold 4.69 million units. By that point, the gadget had been on sale for about a year. The next quarter, sales jumped to 9.25 million units. This quarter was the first time since then unit sales dipped below that. Here’s the iPad trend line from Statista: Apple, as ever, was trying to remain upbeat about the iPad’s future: Apple CEO Tim Cook says iPad sales were ahead of expectations, despite falling 13%. He says $AAPL took share. — Roger Cheng (@RogerWCheng) May 2, 2017

The company posted quarterly revenue of $52.9 billion and quarterly earnings of $2.10 per diluted share. In Q2 2016, Apple had revenue of $50.6 billion and earnings of $1.90 per diluted share. For Q3 2017, Apple is providing guidance of revenue between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion, and gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38.5 percent. Apple’s earnings call will begin at 5 p.m. Eastern time, and can be heard live on the company’s investor website. We’ll have a recap shortly after. “We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’ve seen great customer response to both models of the new iPhone 7 (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition and we’re thrilled with the strong momentum of our Services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter. Looking ahead, we are excited to welcome attendees from around the world to our annual Worldwide Developers Conference next month in San Jose.” “We generated strong operating cash flow of $12.5 billion and returned over $10 billion to our investors in the March quarter,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “Given the strength of our business and our confidence in our future, we are happy to announce another $50 billion increase to our capital return program today.” Comments « Notes from Apple’s Q2 2017 earnings call Logitech reveals Slim Folio Bluetooth keyboard case for fifth-generation iPad » Related Stories Notes from Apple’s Q2 2017 earnings call Report: Apple’s Siri-enabled home control hub may debut at WWDC (Update: KGI agrees) Apple now withholding royalty payments to Qualcomm as dispute escalates Apple releases fifth beta of iOS 10.3.2 Report: Apple’s Jimmy Iovine still has ambitious video plans for Apple Music Apple executive talks using AI to boost human memory Subscribe to iLounge Weekly Recent News Notes from Apple’s Q2 2017 earnings call Apple Q2 2017: $52.9B revenue, 50.8M iPhones + 8.9M iPads sold Logitech reveals Slim Folio Bluetooth keyboard case for fifth-generation iPad Several major apps ditching Apple Watch support?

Las Vegas Sun May 3, 2017 Currently: 82° — Complete forecast Las Vegas Sun The Sunday News Vegas INC Opinion Sports Politics Entertainment Las Vegas Weekly Events Betting Las Vegas Raiders UNLV sports Gaming Vegas Golden Knights Smith's World Newsletter signup Apple growing cash stash spurs talk of huge acquisition Mark Lennihan / AP In this Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2011, file photo, a person stands near the Apple logo at the company’s store in Grand Central Terminal, in New York. By Michael Liedtke, Associated Press Tuesday, May 2, 2017 | 3:07 p.m. SAN FRANCISCO — As Apple's stash of cash grows, so does the possibility that the world's most valuable company will use some of the money for a huge acquisition that would expand its empire beyond iPhones and other gadgets. The company currently holds more than a quarter-trillion dollars it could use to go shopping. So far, the guessing game has primarily focused on possible targets such as Netflix and Tesla Motors. Either deal could make sense, given Apple's long-running interest in providing a TV service to consumers and its more recent work on self-driving cars . But in recent months the takeover talk has swirled around whether Apple might do something even more dramatic by making a bid for Walt Disney Co. THE MOUSE AND THE APPLE Such a combination would create the world's first company worth $1 trillion. Beyond that, an Apple-Disney marriage would unite some of the world's most successful brands in technology and entertainment — a list that includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac computer, Mickey Mouse, Disneyland, ESPN, Lucasfilm, Pixar and Marvel. "If there's a deal out there that would strike fear in the hearts of Silicon Valley and Hollywood, this could be it," RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a recent research report assessing the logic of an Apple-Disney combination. Apple doesn't discuss specific companies that it might buy, but it's exploring far and wide, according to Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri. "We are looking at every size of acquisition, so we will see how it goes going forward," Maestri told The Associated Press in a Tuesday interview. Disney hasn't given any inclination that it's looking for a buyer, but publicly held companies are required to consider all takeover offers. Buying Disney would be expensive. Daryanani estimates that Apple would have to pay $157 per share, or about $250 billion. TREASURE CHEST Apple is one of the few companies — if not the only one — that could pay that sum out of its pocket. The Cupertino, California, company ended March with nearly $257 billion in cash and marketable securities, according to numbers released Tuesday with Apple's earnings report for the January-March quarter. That's up from $233 billion a year ago, and the figure is expected to keep growing as Apple piles up more profits from the iPhone, iPad and Mac, as well as the applications and services that feed those devices. In its latest quarter, Apple's earnings climbed 5 percent to $11 billion while revenue also rose 5 percent to nearly $53 billion. In recent years, Apple has used a large chunk of its cash to provide its shareholders with extra income. The company disclosed plans on Tuesday to raise its quarterly dividend by more than 10 percent to 63 cents per share, marking the fifth increase in five years. Apple also has spent $151 billion buying back its own stock since 2012. Doing a mega-deal would be a major departure for Apple, whose largest acquisition to date was its $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014 that helped launch its music streaming service. THE SLOWING SMARTPHONE But Daryanani and other analysts believe Apple may need to make a pricier acquisition to lessen the company's dependence on the iPhone at a time when smartphone sales have been slowing. IPhone sales edged up 1 percent in Apple's latest quarter, extending a recovery from an unprecedented downturn last year. But many investors remain concerned that Apple has become too vulnerable to the ups and downs of the smartphone market, mostly because the company hasn't been able to come up with another hit product since the 2011 death of its co-founder and CEO, Steve Jobs. Apple's last big success, the iPad, came out in 2010, but sales of the tablet have been declining for more than three years.

Tim Cook blames rumor mill Apple iPhone sales fall again. Tim Cook blames rumor mill Posted on Tuesday, May 2, 2017 by CNN in Business News Apple’s iPhone sales declined again. On Tuesday, Apple reported that it sold 50.8 million iPhones in the most recent quarter, down from 51.2 million units sold in the same quarter a year earlier. A year ago, Apple reported its first ever decline in iPhone sales. The iPhone slump continued in the following two quarters, which led to Apple’s first annual sales decline since 2001. Apple managed to break its losing streak in the December quarter thanks to strong demand for the iPhone 7 Plus. But that reversal proved to be short lived. Apple’s overall sales for the March quarter rose to $52.9 billion from $50.6 billion a year earlier. But the slight dip in iPhone demand is nonetheless a red flag. “We’re seeing what we believe to be a pause in purchases on iPhone, which we believe are due to the earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones,” Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, said on a conference call with analysts Tuesday. The surprise sales decline pushed down Apple’s stock more than 2% in after hours trading. Ahead of the earnings, some analysts suggested users would hold off on purchasing new iPhones ahead of a much-hyped refresh expected later this year. “It appears Apple users are holding off upgrading but not necessarily leaving the ecosystem,” Steven Milunovich, an analyst with UBS, wrote in an investor note this week. “Investors need faith that users are waiting rather than switching.” Wall Street has been focused on pent up demand for the next iPhone, which will mark the smartphone’s tenth anniversary. For three years, the iPhone’s exterior design has remained mostly unchanged, cutting into the demand for upgrades. However, the next iPhone model is rumored to have everything from wireless charging to a curved screen and a glass design. iPhone sales aren’t the only trouble spot for the company. Apple sold just shy of 9 million iPads in the quarter, down 13% from the previous year. With two of its more mature hardware product categories in decline, Cook called attention to Apple’s smartwatches, Beats products and the recently launched AirPods headphones. Cook said if these products were lumped together into a standalone business, it would already be “well into the Fortune 500” in annual sales. The smallest company in the Fortune 500 does more than $5 billion in sales. Apple’s stock has soared to new highs in recent months on optimism for the next iPhone. The company’s market cap was closing in on the $800 billion mark for the first time before the earnings report Tuesday.

Cook also said that revenue from sales of Apple Watch along with AirPods and Beats products is now the size of a Fortune 500 company, hinting that those products have driven growth of its “Other Products” category this quarter. The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac Apple groups Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats into its “Other Products” category rather than breaking out unit sale and revenue for each during its earnings reports, but Cook’s comments hint that Apple Watch and AirPods, along with a couple new Beats products, have largely driven growth of the category that Apple reported today. The category also includes sales of Apple TV, iPod and Apple-branded and third-party accessories, and this quarter it was up 31% year over year. With Cook’s comments regarding its wearable sales now being a Fortune 500 company, that would indicate those products together are now a $5 billion+ business. Apple didn’t, however, offer any specifics for Apple Watch or any of the other products individually. During the earnings call Cook also referenced a recent study that found AirPods are getting around 98% customer satisfaction rates despite the supply shortages. Following a few delays, AirPods officially launched back in December but have been in and out of stock for most customers attempting to purchase a pair since launch. AirPods were followed by the new BeatsX headphones in February, the first earbuds after AirPods to use Apple’s W1 chip that greatly improves Bluetooth reliability and pairing following the Beats. And Apple most recently refreshed the Apple Watch with new bands for Spring and started offering its Nike Sport bands separately.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Jonnelle Marte By Jonnelle Marte May 2 at 6:16 PM Follow @jonnelle (Eric Risberg/AP) Your retirement account may soon get a little boost. One bright spot in Apple’s earnings report Tuesday was the announcement that it will be giving shareholders more cash. The tech giant is raising its quarterly dividend by 10.5 percent to 63 cents a share. The cash is to be paid out in mid-May, the company said. Apple is also buying back more of its shares, which raises the value of its stock. Investors who own individual shares of Apple may notice the biggest difference. But even people who don’t own individual shares of the company are likely to get a bump if they invest in a major stock index through their retirement account or a brokerage account. Apple is a top holding in 138 exchange-traded funds, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research for CFRA Research. For example, the tech firm is the largest holding in the widely held S&P 500 ETF, making up 3.75 percent of the fund. Apple also makes up about 15 percent of  the S&P 500 Technology index fund, a popular tech fund. The dividend increase has become an annual ritual for Apple, said Angelo Zino, an equity analyst for CFRA Research. The company has been sharing more cash with investors since it introduced its first dividend payment in 2012, he said. In addition to the bigger dividend payouts, Apple has been buying back more of its shares — a move that typically raises the stock price by reducing the number of shares in the market. Share buybacks can also be a sign from Apple’s management that it’s confident in the company’s future, said Brian Colello, an equity analyst for Morningstar, a fund research firm. A bigger dividend can be a way for Apple to keep attracting new investors at a time when it is growing more slowly, Zino said. Smartphones are so common now that the iPhone is no longer providing the gangbusters growth it once did, though that could change in the next couple of years, he added. As for cash, Apple has plenty of it — nearly $260 billion. While most of that is sitting overseas, Apple could bring more of that cash back to the States if the Trump administration delivers on its promise to lower the corporate tax rate. If so, some of those greenbacks could eventually land in shareholders’ pockets, in the form of an even bigger dividend or more share buybacks, Zino said.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint SAN FRANCISCO — As Apple's stash of cash grows, so does the possibility that the world's most valuable company will use some of the money for a huge acquisition that would expand its empire beyond iPhones and other gadgets. The company currently holds more than a quarter-trillion dollars it could use to go shopping. So far, the guessing game has primarily focused on possible targets such as Netflix and Tesla Motors. Either deal could make sense, given Apple's long-running interest in providing a TV service to consumers and its more recent work on self-driving cars . But in recent months the takeover talk has swirled around whether Apple might do something even more dramatic by making a bid for Walt Disney Co. THE MOUSE AND THE APPLE Such a combination would create the world's first company worth $1 trillion. Beyond that, an Apple-Disney marriage would unite some of the world's most successful brands in technology and entertainment — a list that includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac computer, Mickey Mouse, Disneyland, ESPN, Lucasfilm, Pixar and Marvel. "If there's a deal out there that would strike fear in the hearts of Silicon Valley and Hollywood, this could be it," RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a recent research report assessing the logic of an Apple-Disney combination. Apple doesn't discuss specific companies that it might buy, but it's exploring far and wide, according to Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri. "We are looking at every size of acquisition, so we will see how it goes going forward," Maestri told The Associated Press in a Tuesday interview. Disney hasn't given any inclination that it's looking for a buyer, but publicly held companies are required to consider all takeover offers. Buying Disney would be expensive. Daryanani estimates that Apple would have to pay $157 per share, or about $250 billion. TREASURE CHEST Apple is one of the few companies — if not the only one — that could pay that sum out of its pocket. The Cupertino, California, company ended March with nearly $257 billion in cash and marketable securities, according to numbers released Tuesday with Apple's earnings report for the January-March quarter. That's up from $233 billion a year ago, and the figure is expected to keep growing as Apple piles up more profits from the iPhone, iPad and Mac, as well as the applications and services that feed those devices. In its latest quarter, Apple's earnings climbed 5 percent to $11 billion while revenue also rose 5 percent to nearly $53 billion. In recent years, Apple has used a large chunk of its cash to provide its shareholders with extra income. The company disclosed plans on Tuesday to raise its quarterly dividend by more than 10 percent to 63 cents per share, marking the fifth increase in five years. Apple also has spent $151 billion buying back its own stock since 2012. Doing a mega-deal would be a major departure for Apple, whose largest acquisition to date was its $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014 that helped launch its music streaming service. THE SLOWING SMARTPHONE But Daryanani and other analysts believe Apple may need to make a pricier acquisition to lessen the company's dependence on the iPhone at a time when smartphone sales have been slowing. IPhone sales edged up 1 percent in Apple's latest quarter, extending a recovery from an unprecedented downturn last year. But many investors remain concerned that Apple has become too vulnerable to the ups and downs of the smartphone market, mostly because the company hasn't been able to come up with another hit product since the 2011 death of its co-founder and CEO, Steve Jobs. Apple's last big success, the iPad, came out in 2010, but sales of the tablet have been declining for more than three years. Meanwhile, the iPhone accounted for nearly two-thirds of Apple's revenue in the past quarter. The Trump administration may give Apple another reason to mull a major acquisition, given earlier promises to lower U.S. taxes on overseas corporate cash brought back to the U.S. Should that tax cut happen, Apple CEO Tim Cook has said the company will consider bringing back most of the more than $230 billion it now keeps in foreign countries, making it easier to finance a blockbuster deal in the U.S. View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.
